a time to kill billy ray cobb was the younger and smaller of the two rednecks at twentythree he was already a threeyear veteran of the state penitentiary at parchman possession with intent to sell he was a lean tough little punk who had survived prison by somehow maintaining a ready supply of drugs that he sold and sometimes gave to the blacks and the guards for protection in the year since his release he had continued to prosper and his smalltime narcotics business had elevated him to the position of one of the more affluent rednecks in ford county he was a businessman with employees obligations deals everything but taxes down at the ford place in clanton he was known as the last man in recent history to pay cash for a new pickup truck sixteen thousand cash for a custombuilt fourwheel drive canary yellow luxury ford pickup the fancy chrome wheels and mudgrip racing tires had been received in a business deal the rebel flag hanging across the rear window had been stolen by cobb from a drunken fraternity boy at an ole miss football game the pickup was billy rays most prized possession he sat on the tailgate drinking a beer smoking a joint watching his friend willard take his turn with the black girl willard was four years older and a dozen years slower he was generally a harmless sort who had never been in serious trouble and had never been seriously employed maybe an occasional fight with a night in jail but nothing that would distinguish him he called himself a pulpwood cutter but a bad back customarily kept him out of the woods he had hurt his back working on an offshore rig somewhere in the gulf and the oil company paid him a nice settlement which he lost when his exwife cleaned him out his primary vocation was that of a parttime employee of billy ray cobb who didnt pay much but was liberal with his dope for the first time in years willard could always get his hands on something and he always needed something hed been that way since he hurt his back she was ten and small for her age she lay on her elbows which were stuck and bound together with yellow nylon rope her legs were spread grotesquely with the right foot tied tight to an oak sapling and the left to a rotting leaning post of a longneglected fence the ski rope had cut into her ankles and the blood ran down her legs her face was bloody and swollen with one eye bulging and closed and the other eye half open so she could see the other white man sitting on the truck she did not look at the man on top of her he was breathing hard and sweating and cursing he was hurting her when he finished he slapped her and laughed and the other man laughed in return then they laughed harder and rolled around the grass by the truck like two crazy men screaming and laughing she turned away from them and cried softly careful to keep herself quiet she had been slapped earlier for crying and screaming they promised to kill her if she didnt keep quiet they grew tired of laughing and pulled themselves onto the tailgate where willard cleaned himself with the little niggers shirt which by now was soaked with blood and sweat cobb handed him a cold beer from the cooler and commented on the humidity they watched her as she sobbed and made strange quiet sounds then became still cobbs beer was half empty and it was not cold anymore he threw it at the girl it hit her in the stomach splashing white foam and it rolled off in the dirt near some other cans all of which had originated from the same cooler for two sixpacks now they had thrown their halfempty cans at her and laughed willard had trouble with the target but cobb was fairly accurate they were not ones to waste beer but the heavier cans could be felt better and it was great fun to watch the foam shoot everywhere the warm beer mixed with the dark blood and ran down her face and neck into a puddle behind her head she did not move willard asked cobb if he thought she was dead cobb opened another beer and explained that she was not dead because niggers generally could not be killed by kicking and beating and raping it took much more something like a knife or a gun or a rope to dispose of a nigger although he had never taken part in such a killing he had lived with a bunch of niggers in prison and knew all about them they were always killing each other and they always used a weapon of some sort those who were just beaten and raped never died some of the whites were beaten and raped and some of them died but none of the niggers their heads were harder willard seemed satisfied willard asked what he planned to do now that they were through with her cobb sucked on his joint chased it with beer and said he wasnt through he bounced from the tailgate and staggered across the small clearing to where she was tied he cursed her and screamed at her to wake up then he poured cold beer in her face laughing like a crazy man she watched him as he walked around the tree on her right side and she stared at him as he stared between her legs when he lowered his pants she turned to the left and closed her eyes he was hurting her again she looked out through the woods and saw something a man running wildly through the vines and underbrush it was her daddy yelling and pointing at her and coming desperately to save her she cried out for him and he disappeared she fell asleep when she awoke one of the men was lying under the tailgate the other under a tree they were asleep her arms and legs were numb the blood and beer and urine had mixed with the dirt underneath her to form a sticky paste that glued her small body to the ground and crackled when she moved and wiggled escape she thought but her mightiest efforts moved her only a few inches to the right her feet were tied so high her buttocks barely touched the ground her legs and arms were so deadened they refused to move she searched the woods for her daddy and quietly called his name she waited then slept again when she awoke the second time they were up and moving around the tall one staggered to her with a small knife he grabbed her left ankle and sawed furiously on the rope until it gave way then he freed the right leg and she curled into a fetal position with her back to them cobb strung a length of quarterinch ski rope over a limb and tied a loop in one end with a slip knot he grabbed her and put the noose around her head then walked across the clearing with the other end of the rope and sat on the tailgate where willard was smoking a fresh joint and grinning at cobb for what he was about to do cobb pulled the rope tight then gave a vicious yank bouncing the little nude body along the ground and stopping it directly under the limb she gagged and coughed so he kindly loosened the rope to spare her a few more minutes he tied the rope to the bumper and opened another beer they sat on the tailgate drinking smoking and staring at her they had been at the lake most of the day where cobb had a friend with a boat and some extra girls who were supposed to be easy but turned out to be untouchable cobb had been generous with his drugs and beer but the girls did not reciprocate frustrated they left the lake and were driving to no place in particular when they happened across the girl she was walking along a gravel road with a sack of groceries when willard nailed her in the back of the head with a beer can you gonna do it asked willard his eyes red and glazed cobb hesitated naw ill let you do it it was your idea willard took a drag on his joint then spit and said wasnt my idea youre the expert on killin niggers do it cobb untied the rope from the bumper and pulled it tight it peeled bark from the limb and sprinkled fine bits of elm around the girl who was watching them carefully now she coughed suddenly she heard somethinglike a car with loud pipes the two men turned quickly and looked down the dirt road to the highway in the distance they cursed and scrambled around one slamming the tailgate and the other running toward her he tripped and landed near her they cursed each other while they grabbed her removed the rope from her neck dragged her to the pickup and threw her over the tailgate into the bed of the truck cobb slapped her and threatened to kill her if she did not lie still and keep quiet he said he would take her home if she stayed down and did as told otherwise they would kill her they slammed the doors and sped onto the dirt road she was going home she passed out cobb and willard waved at the firebird with the loud pipes as it passed them on the narrow dirt road willard checked the back to make sure the little nigger was lying down cobb turned onto the highway and raced away what now willard asked nervously dont know cobb answered nervously but we gotta do something fast before she gets blood all over my truck look at her back there shes bleedin all over the place willard thought for a minute while he finished a beer lets throw her off a bridge he said proudly good idea damned good idea cobb slammed on the brakes gimme a beer he ordered willard who stumbled out of the truck and fetched two beers from the back shes even got blood on the cooler he reported as they raced off again gwen hailey sensed something horrible normally she would have sent one of the three boys to the store but they were being punished by their father and had been sentenced to weedpulling in the garden tonya had been to the store before by herselfit was only a mile awayand had proven reliable but after two hours gwen sent the boys to look for their little sister they figured she was down at the pounders house playing with the many pounders kids or maybe she had ventured past the store to visit her best friend bessie pierson mr bates at the store said she had come and gone an hour earlier jarvis the middle boy found a sack of groceries beside the road gwen called her husband at the paper mill then loaded carl lee jr into the car and began driving the gravel roads around the store they drove to a settlement of ancient shotgun houses on graham plantation to check with an aunt they stopped at broadways store a mile from bates grocery and were told by a group of old black men that she had not been seen they crisscrossed the gravel roads and dusty field roads for three square miles around their house cobb could not find a bridge unoccupied by niggers with fishing poles every bridge they approached had four or five niggers hanging off the sides with large straw hats and cane poles and under every bridge on the banks there would be another group sitting on buckets with the same straw hats and cane poles motionless except for an occasional swat at a fly or a slap at a mosquito he was scared now willard had passed out and was of no help and he was left alone to dispose of the girl in such a way that she could never tell willard snored as he frantically drove the gravel roads and county roads in search of a bridge or ramp on some river where he could stop and toss her without being seen by half a dozen niggers with straw hats he looked in the mirror and saw her trying to stand he slammed his brakes and she crashed into the front of the bed just under the window willard ricocheted off the dash into the floorboard where he continued to snore cobb cursed them both equally lake chatulla was nothing more than a huge shallow manmade mudhole with a grasscovered dam running exactly one mile along one end it sat in the far southwest corner of ford county with a few acres in van buren county in the spring it would hold the distinction of being the largest body of water in mississippi but by late summer the rains were long gone and the sun would cook the shallow water until the lake would dehydrate its once ambitious shorelines would retreat and move much closer together creating a depthless basin of reddish brown water it was fed from all directions by innumerable streams creeks sloughs and a couple of currents large enough to be named rivers the existence of all these tributaries necessarily gave rise to a good number of bridges near the lake it was over these bridges the yellow pickup flew in an allout effort to find a suitable place to unload an unwanted passenger cobb was desperate he knew of one other bridge a narrow wooden one over foggy creek as he approached he saw niggers with cane poles so he turned off a side road and stopped the truck he lowered the tailgate dragged her out and threw her in a small ravine lined with kudzu carl lee hailey did not hurry home gwen was easily excited and she had called the mill numerous times when she thought the children had been kidnapped he punched out at quitting time and made the thirtyminute drive home in thirty minutes anxiety hit him when he turned onto his gravel drive and saw the patrol car parked next to the front porch other cars belonging to owens family were scattered along the long drive and in the yard and there was one car he didnt recognize it had cane poles sticking out the side windows and there were at least seven straw hats sitting in it where were tonya and the boys as he opened the front door he heard gwen crying to his right in the small living room he found a crowd huddled above a small figure lying on the couch the child was covered with wet towels and surrounded by crying relatives as he moved to the couch the crying stopped and the crowd backed away only gwen stayed by the girl she softly stroked her hair he knelt beside the couch and touched the girls shoulder he spoke to his daughter and she tried to smile her face was bloody pulp covered with knots and lacerations both eyes were swollen shut and bleeding his eyes watered as he looked at her tiny body completely wrapped in towels and bleeding from ankles to forehead carl lee asked gwen what happened she began shaking and wailing and was led to the kitchen by her brother carl lee stood and turned to the crowd and demanded to know what happened silence he asked for the third time the deputy willie hastings one of gwens cousins stepped forward and told carl lee that some people were fishing down by foggy creek when they saw tonya lying in the middle of the road she told them her daddys name and they brought her home hastings shut up and stared at his feet carl lee stared at him and waited everyone else stopped breathing and watched the floor what happened willie carl lee yelled as he stared at the deputy hastings spoke slowly and while staring out the window repeated what tonya had told her mother about the white men and their pickup and the rope and the trees and being hurt when they got on her hastings stopped when he heard the siren from the ambulance the crowd filed solemnly through the front door and waited on the porch where they watched the crew unload a stretcher and head for the house the paramedics stopped in the yard when the front door opened and carl lee walked out with his daughter in his arms he whispered gently to her as huge tears dripped from his chin he walked to the rear of the ambulance and stepped inside the paramedics closed the door and carefully removed her from his embrace ozzie walls was the only black sheriff in mississippi there had been a few others in recent history but for the moment he was the only one he took great pride in that fact since ford county was seventyfour percent white and the other black sheriffs had been from much blacker counties not since reconstruction had a black sheriff been elected in a white county in mississippi he was raised in ford county and he was kin to most of the blacks and a few of the whites after desegregation in the late sixties he was a member of the first mixed graduating class at clanton high school he wanted to play football nearby at ole miss but there were already two blacks on the team he starred instead at alcorn state and was a defensive tackle for the rams when a knee injury sent him back to clanton he missed football but enjoyed being the high sheriff especially at election time when he received more white votes than his white opponents the white kids loved him because he was a hero a football star who had played on tv and had his picture in magazines their parents respected him and voted for him because he was a tough cop who did not discriminate between black punks and white sunks the white politicians supported him because since e became the sheriff the justice department stayed out of ford county the blacks adored him because he was ozzie one of their own he skipped supper and waited in his office at the jail for hastings to report from the hailey house he had a suspect billy ray cobb was no stranger to the sheriffs office ozzie knew he sold drugshe just couldnt catch him he also knew cobb had a mean streak the dispatcher called in the deputies and as they reported to the jail ozzie gave them instructions to locate but not arrest billy ray cobb there were twelve deputies in all nine white and three black they fanned out across the county in search of a fancy yellow ford pickup with a rebel flag in the rear window when hastings arrived he and the sheriff left for the ford county hospital as usual hastings drove and ozzie gave orders on the radio in the waiting room on the second floor they found the hailey clan aunts uncles grandparents friends and strangers crowded into the small room and some waited in the narrow hallway there were whispers and quiet tears tonya was in surgery carl lee sat on a cheap plastic couch in a dark corner with gwen next to him and the boys next to her he stared at the floor and did not notice the crowd gwen laid her head on his shoulder and cried softly the boys sat rigidly with their hands on knees occasionally glancing at their father as if waiting on words of reassurance ozzie worked his way through the crowd quietly shaking hands and patting backs and whispering that he would catch them he knelt before carl lee and gwen how is she he asked carl lee did not see him gwen cried louder and the boys sniffed and wiped tears he patted gwen on the knee and stood one of her brothers led ozzie and hastings out of the room into the hall away from the family he shook ozzies hand and thanked him for coming how is she ozzie asked not too good shes in surgery and most likely will be there for a while shes got broken fjones and a bad concussion shes beat up real bad theres rope burns on her neck like they tried to hang her was she raped he asked certain of the answer yeah she told her momma they took turns on her and hurt her real bad doctors confirmed it hows carl lee and gwen theyre tore up pretty bad i think theyre in shock carl lee aint said a word since he got here jdzzie assured him they would find the two men and it wouldnt take long and when they found them they would be locked up someplace safe the brother suggested he should hide them in another jail for their own safety three miles out of clanton ozzie pointed to a gravel driveway pull in there he told hastings who turned off the highway and drove into the front yard of a dilapidated house trailer it was almost dark ozzie took his night stick and banged violently on the front door open up bumpous the trailer shook and bumpous scrambled to the bathroom to flush a fresh joint open up bumpous ozzie banged i know youre in there open up or ill kick in the door bumpous yanked the door open and ozzie walked in you know bumpous evertime i visit you i smell somethin funny and the commodes flushin get some clothes on i gotta job for you wwhat ill explain it outside where i can breathe just get some clothes on and hurry what if i dont want to fine ill see your parole officer tomorrow ill be out in a minute ozzie smiled and walked to his car bobby bumpous was one of his favorites since his parole two years earlier he had led a reasonably clean life occasionally succumbing to the lure of an easy drug sale for a quick buck ozzie watched him like a hawk and knew of such transactions and bumpous knew ozzie knew therefore bumpous was usually most eager to help his friend sheriff walls the plan was to eventually use bumpous to nail billy ray cobb for dealing but that would be postponed for now after a few minutes he marched outside still tucking his shirttail and zipping his pants who you lookin for he demanded billy ray cobb thats no problem you can find him without me shut up and listen we think cobb was involved in a rape this afternoon a black girl was raped by two white men and i think cobb was there cobb aint into rape sheriff hes into drugs remember shut up and listen you find cobb and spend some time with him five minutes ago his truck was spotted at hueys buy him a beer shoot some pool roll dice what ever find out what he did today who was he with whered he go you know how he likes to talk right right call the dispatcher when you find him theyll call me ill be somewhere close you understand sure sheriff no problem any questions yeah im broke whos gonna pay for this ozzie handed him a twenty and left hastings drove in the direction of hueys down by the lake you sure you can trust him hastings asked who that bumpous kid sure i trust him hes proved very reliable since he was paroled hes a good kid tryin to go straight for the most part he supports his local sheriff and would do anything i ask why because i caught him with ten ounces of pot a year ago hed been outta jail about a year when i caught his brother with an ounce and i told him he was lookin at thirty years he started cryin and carryin on cried all night in his cell by mornin he was ready to talk told me his supplier was his brother bobby so i let him go and went to see bobby i knocked on his door and i could hear the commode flushin he wouldnt come to the door so i kicked it in i found him in his underwear in the bathroom tryin to unstop the commode there was dope all over the place dont know how much he flushed but most of it was comin back out in the overflow scared him so bad he wet his drawers you kiddin nope the kid pissed all over himself he was a sight standin there with wet drawers a plunger in one hand dope in the other and the room fillin up with commode water whatd you do threatened to kill him whatd he do started cryin cried like a baby cried bout his momma and prison and all this and that promised hed never screw up again you arrest him naw i just couldnt i talked real ugly to him and threatened him some more i put him on probation right there in his bathroom hes been fun to work with ever since they drove by hueys and saw cobbs truck in the gravel parking lot with a dozen other pickups and fourwheel drives they parked behind a black church on a hill up the highway from hueys where they had a good view of the honky tonk or tonk as it was affectionately called by the patrons another patrol car hid behind some trees at the other end of the highway moments later bumpous flew by and wheeled into the parking lot he locked his brakes spraying gravel and dust then backed next to cobbs truck he looked around and casually entered hueys thirty minutes later the dispatcher advised ozzie that the informant had found the subject a male white at hueys an establishment on highway near the lake within minutes two more patrol cars were hidden close by they waited what makes you so sure its cobb hastings asked i aint sure i just got a hunch the little girl said it was a truck with shiny wheels and big tires that narrows it down to two thousand she also said it was yellow looked new and had a big flag hangin in the rear window that brings it down to two hundred maybe less than that how many of those are as mean as billy ray cobb what if it aint him it is if it aint well know shortly hes got a big mouth specially when hes drinkin for two hours they waited and watched pickups come and go truck drivers pulpwood cutters factory workers and farmhands parked their pickups and jeeps in the gravel and strutted inside to drink shoot pool listen to the band but mainly to look for stray women some would leave and walk next door to anns lounge where they would stay for a few minutes and return to hueys anns lounge was darker both inside and out and it lacked the colorful beer signs and live music that made hueys such a hit with the locals anns was known for its drug traffic whereas hueys had it all music women happy hours poker machines dice dancing and plenty of fights one brawl spilled through the door into the parking lot where a group of wild rednecks kicked and clawed each other at random until they grew winded and returned to the dice table hope that wasnt bumpous observed the sheriff the restrooms inside were small and nasty and most of the patrons found it necessary to relieve themselves between the pickups in the parking lot this was especially true on mondays when tencent beer night drew rednecks from four counties and every truck in the parking lot received at least three sprayings about once a week an innocent passing motorist would get shocked by something he or she saw in the parking lot and ozzie would be forced to make an arrest otherwise he left the places alone both tonks were in violation of numerous laws there was gambling drugs illegal whiskey minors they refused to close on time etc shortly after he was elected the first time ozzie made the mistake due in part to a hasty campaign promise of closing all the honky tonks in the county it was a horrible mistake the crime rate soared the jail was packed the court dockets multiplied the rednecks united and drove in caravans to clanton where they parked around the courthouse on the square hundreds of them every night they invaded the square drinking fighting playing loud music and shouting obscenities at the horrified town folk each morning the square resembled a landfill with cans and bottles thrown everywhere he closed the black tonks too and breakins burglaries and stabbings tripled in one month there were two murders in one week finally with the city under siege a group of local ministers met secretly with ozzie and begged him to ease up on the tonks he politely reminded them that during the campaign they had insisted on the closings they admitted they were wrong and pleaded for relief yes they would support him in the next election ozzie relented and life returned to normal in ford county ozzie was not pleased that the establishments thrived in his county but he was convinced beyond any doubt that his lawabiding constituents were much safer when the tonks were open at tenthirty the dispatcher radioed that the informant was on the phone and wanted to see the sheriff ozzie gave his location and a minute later they watched bumpous emerge and stagger to his truck he spun tires slung gravel and raced toward the church hes drunk said hastings he wheeled through the church parking lot and came to a screeching stop a few feet from the patrol car howdy sheriff he yelled ozzie walked to the pickup what took so long you told me to take all night you found him two hours ago thats true sheriff but have you ever tried to spend twenty dollars on beer when its fifty cents a can you drunk naw just havin a good time could i have another twenty whatd you find out bout what cobb oh hes in there all right i know hes in there what else bumpous quit smiling and looked at the tonk in the distance hes laughin about it sheriff its a big joke said he finally found a nigger who was a virgin somebody asked how old she was and cobb said eight or nine everybody laughed hastings closed his eyes and dropped his head ozzie gritted his teeth and looked away what else did he say hes bad drunk he wont remember any of it in the mornin said she was a cute little nigger who was with him pete willard is he in there yep theyre both laughin about it where are they lefthand side next to the pinball machines ozzie smiled okay bumpous you did good get lost hastings called the dispatcher with the two names the dispatcher relayed the message to deputy looney who was parked in the street in front of the home of county judge percy bullard looney rang the doorbell and handed the judge two affidavits and two arrest warrants bullard scribbled on the warrants and returned them to looney who thanked his honor and left twenty minutes later looney handed the warrants to ozzie behind the church at exactly eleven the band quit in midsong the dice disappeared the dancers froze the cue balls stopped rolling and someone turned on the lights all eyes followed the big sheriff as he and his men swaggered slowly across the dance floor to a table by the pinball machines cobb willard and two others sat in a booth the table littered with empty beer cans ozzie walked to the table and grinned at cobb im sorry sir but we dont allow niggers in here cobb blurted out and the four burst into laughter ozzie kept grinning when the laughing stopped ozzie said you boys havin a good time billy ray we was looks like it i hate to break things up but you and mr willard need to come with me where we goin willard asked for a ride i aint movin cobb vowed with that the other two scooted from the booth and joined the spectators im placin you both under arrest ozzie said you got warrants cobb asked hastings produced the warrants and ozzie threw them among the beer cans yeah we got warrants now get up willard stared desperately at cobb who sipped a beer and said i aint goin to jail looney handed ozzie the longest blackest nightstick ever used in ford county willard was panicstricken ozzie cocked it and struck the center of the table sending beer and cans and foam in all directions willard bolted upright slapped his wrists together and thrust them at looney who was waiting with the handcuffs he was dragged outside and thrown into a patrol car ozzie tapped his left palm with the stick and grinned at cobb you have the right to remain silent anything you say will be used against you in court you have the right to a lawyer if you cant afford one the statell furnish one any questions yeah what time is it time to go to jail big man go to hell nigger ozzie grabbed his hair and lifted him from the booth then drove his face into the floor he jammed a knee into his spine and slid his nightstick under his throat and pulled upward while driving the knee deeper into his back cobb squealed until the stick began crushing his larynx the handcuffs were slapped into place and ozzie dragged him by his hair across the dance floor out the door across the gravel and threw him into the back seat with willard news of the rape spread quickly more friends and relatives crowded into the waiting room and the halls around it tonya was out of surgery and listed as critical ozzie talked to gwens brother in the hall and told of the arrests yes they were the ones he was sure jake brigance rolled across his wife and staggered to the small bathroom a few feet from his bed where he searched and groped in the dark for the screaming alarm clock he found it where he had left it and killed it with a quick and violent slap it was am wednesday may he stood in the dark for a moment breathless terrified his heart pounding rapidly staring at the fluorescent numbers glowing at him from the face of the clock a clock he hated its piercing scream could be heard down the street he flirted with cardiac arrest every morning at this time when the thing erupted on occasion about twice a year he was successful in shoving carla onto the floor and she would maybe turn it off before returning to bed most of the time however she was not sympathetic she thought he was crazy for getting up at such an hour the clock sat on the windowsill so that jake was required to move around a bit before it was silenced once up jake would not permit himself to crawl back under the covers it was one of his rules at one time the alarm was on the nightstand and the volume was reduced carla would reach and turn it off before jake heard anything then he would sleep until seven or eight and ruin his entire day he would miss being in the office by seven which was another rule the alarm stayed in the bathroom and served its purpose jake stepped to the sink and splashed cold water onhis face and hair he switched on the light and gasped in horror at the sight in the mirror his straight brown hair shot in all directions and the hairline had receded at least two inches during the night either that or his forehead had grown his eyes were matted and swollen with the white stuff packed in the corners a seam in a blanket left a bright red scar along the left side of his face he touched then rubbed it and wondered if it would go away with his right hand he pushed his hair back and inspected the hairline at thirtytwo he had no gray hair gray hair was not the problem the problem was pattern baldness which jake had richly inherited from both sides of his family he longed for a full thick hairline beginning an inch above his eyebrows he still had plenty of hair carla told him but it wouldnt last long at the rate it was disappearing she also assured him he was as handsome as ever and he believed her she had explained that a receding hairline gave him a look of maturity that was essential for a young attorney he believed that too but what about old bald attorneys or even mature middleaged bald attorneys why couldnt the hair return after he grew wrinkles and gray sideburns and looked very mature jake pondered these things in the shower he took quick showers and he shaved and dressed quickly he had to be at the coffee shop at amanother rule he turned on lights and slammed and banged drawers and closet doors in an effort to arouse carla this was the morning ritual during the summer when she was not teaching school he had explained to her numerous times that she had all day to catch up on any lost sleep and that these early moments should be spent together she moaned and tunneled deeper under the covers once dressed jake jumped on the bed with all fours and kissed her in the ear down the neck and all over the face until she finally swung at him then he yanked the covers off the bed and laughed as she curled up and shivered and begged for the blankets he held them and admired her dark tanned thin almost perfect legs the bulky nightshirt covered nothing below the waist and a hundred lewd thoughts danced before him about once a month this ritual would get out of hand she would not protest and the blankets would be jointly removed on those mornings jake undressed even quicker and broke at least three of his rules thats how hanna was conceived but not this morning he covered his wife kissed her gently and turned out the lights she breathed easier and fell asleep down the hall he quietly opened hannas door and knelt beside her she was four the only child and there would be no others she lay in her bed surrounded by dolls and stuffed animals he kissed her lightly on the cheek she was as beautiful as her mother and the two were identical in looks and manners they had large bluishgray eyes that could cry instantly if necessary they wore their dark hair the same wayhad it cut by the same person at the same time they even dressed alike jake adored the two women in his life he kissed the second one goodbye and went to the kitchen to make coffee for carla on his way out he released max the mutt into the backyard where she simultaneously relieved herself and barked at mrs pickles cat next door few people attacked the morning like jake brigance he walked briskly to the end of the driveway and got the morning papers for carla it was dark clear and cool with the promise of summer rapidly approaching he studied the darkness up and down adams street then turned and admired his house two homes in ford county were on the national register of historic places and jake brigance owned one of them although it was heavily mortgaged he was proud of it nonetheless it was a nineteenthcentury victorian built by a retired railroad man who died on the first christmas eve he spent in his new home the facade was a huge centered gable with hipped roof over a wide inset front porch under the gable a small portico covered with bargeboard hung gently over the porch the five supporting pillars were round and painted white and slate blue each column bore a handmade floral carving each with a different flowerdaffodils irises and sunflowers the railing between the pillars was filled with lavish lacework upstairs three bay windows opened onto a small balcony and to the left of the balcony an octagonal tower with stainedglass windows protruded and rose above the gable until it peaked with an ironcrested finial below the tower and to the left of the porch a wide graceful veranda with ornamental railing extended from the house and served as a carport the front panels were a collage of gingerbread cedar shingles scallops fish scales tiny intricate gables and miniature spindles carla had located a paint consultant in new orleans and the fairy chose six original colorsmostly shades of blue teal peach and white the paint job took two months and cost jake five thousand dollars and that did not include the countless hours he and carla had spent dangling from ladders and scraping cornices and although he was not wild about some of the colors he had never dared suggest repainting as with every victorian the house was gloriously unique it had a piquant provocative engaging quality derived from an ingenuous joyous almost childlike bearing carla had wanted it since before they married and when the owner in memphis finally died and the estate was closed they bought it for a song because no one else would have it it had been abandoned for twenty years they borrowed heavily from two of the three banks in clanton and spent the next three years sweating and doting over their landmark now people drove by and took pictures of it the third local bank held the mortgage on jakes car the only saab in ford county and a red saab at that he wiped the dew from the windshield and unlocked the door max was still barking and had awakened the army of bluejays that lived in mrs pickles maple tree they sang to him and called farewell as he smiled and whistled in return he backed into adams street two blocks east he turned south on jefferson which two blocks later ran dead end into washington street jake had often wondered why every small southern town had an adams a jefferson and a washington but no lincoln or grant washington street ran east and west on the north side of the clanton square because clanton was the county seat it had a square and the square quite naturally had a courthouse in the center of it general clanton had laid out the town with much thought and the square was long and wide and the courthouse lawn was covered with massive oak trees all lined neatly and spaced equally apart the ford county courthouse was well into its second century built after the yankees burned the first one it defiantly faced south as if telling those from the north to politely and eternally kiss its ass it was old and stately with white columns along the front and black shutters around the dozens of windows the original red brick had long since been painted white and every four years the boy scouts added a thick layer of shiny enamel for their traditional summer project several bond issues over the years had allowed additions and renovations the lawn around it was clean and neatly trimmed a crew from the jail manicured it twice a week clanton had three coffee shopstwo for the whites and one for the blacks and all three were on the square it was not illegal or uncommon for whites to eat at claudes the black cafe on the west side and it was safe for the blacks to eat at the tea shoppe on the south side or the coffee shop on washington street they didnt however since they were told they could back in the seventies jake ate barbecue every friday at claudes as did most of the white liberals in clanton but six mornings a week he was a regular at the coffee shop he parked the saab in front of his office on washington street and walked three doors to the coffee shop it had opened an hour earlier and by now was bustling with action waitresses scurried about serving coffee and breakfast and chatting incessantly with the farmers and mechanics and deputies who were the regulars this was no whitecollar cafe the white collars gathered across the square at the tea shoppe later in the morning and discussed national politics tennis golf and the stock market at the coffee shop they talked about local politics football and bass fishing jake was one of the few white collars allowed to frequent the coffee shop he was well liked and accepted by the blue collars most of whom at one time or another had found their way to his office for a will a deed a divorce a defense or any one of a thousand other problems they picked at him and told crooked lawyer jokes but he had a thick skin they asked him to explain supreme court rulings and other legal oddities during breakfast and he gave a lot of free legal advice at the coffee shop jake had a way of cutting through the excess and discussing the meat of any issue they appreciated that they didnt always agree with him but they always got honest answers they argued at times but there were never hard feelings he made his entrance at six and it took five minutes to greet everyone shake hands slap backs and say smart things to the waitresses by the time he sat at his table his favorite girl dell had his coffee and regular breakfast of toast jelly and grits she patted him on the hand and called him honey and sweetheart and generally made a fuss over him she griped and snapped at the others but had a different routine for jake he ate with tim nunley a mechanic down at the chevrolet place and two brothers bill and bert west who worked at the shoe factory north of town he splashed three drops of tabasco on his grits and stirred them artfully with a slice of butter he covered the toast with a half inch of homemade strawberry jelly once his food was properly prepared he tasted the coffee and started eating they ate quietly and discussed how the crappie were biting in a booth by the window a few feet from jakes table three deputies talked among themselves the big one marshall prather turned to jake and asked loudly say jake didnt you defend billy ray cobb a few years ago the cafe was instantly silent as everyone looked at the lawyer startled not by the question but by its response jake swallowed his grits and searched for the name billy ray cobb he repeated aloud what kind of case was it dope prather said caught him sellin dope about four years ago spent time in parchman and got out last year jake remembered naw i didnt represent him i think he had a memphis lawyer prather seemed satisfied and returned to his pancakes jake waited finally he asked why whats he done now we picked him up last night for rape rape yeah him and pete willard whod they rape you remember that hailey nigger you got off in that murder trial a few years ago lester hailey of course i remember you know his brother carl lee sure know him well i know all the haileys represented most of them well it was his little girl youre kidding nope how old is she ten jakes appetite disappeared as the cafe returned to normal he played with his coffee and listened to the conversation change from fishing to japanese cars and back to fishing when the west brothers left he slid into the booth with the deputies how is she he asked who the hailey girl pretty bad said prather shes in the hospital what happened we dont know everything she aint been able to talk much her momma sent her to the store they live on craft road behind bates grocery i know where they live somehow they got her in cobbs pickup and took her out in the woods somewhere and raped her both of them yeah several times and they kicked her and beat her real bad some of her kinfolks didnt know her she was beat so bad jake shook his head thats sick sure is worst ive ever seen they tried to kill her left her for dead who found her buncha niggers fishin down by foggy creek saw her floppin out in the middle of the road had her hands tied behind her she was talkin a littletold them who her daddy was and they took her home howd you know it was billy ray cobb she told her momma it was a yellow pickup truck with a rebel flag hangin in the rear window thats about all ozzie needed he had it figured out by the time she got to the hospital prather was careful not to say too much he liked jake but he was a lawyer and he handled a lot of criminal cases who is pete willard some friend of cobbs whered yall find them hueys that figures jake drank his coffee and thought of hanna sick sick sick looney mumbled hows carl lee prather wiped syrup from his mustache personally i dont know him but i aint ever heard anything bad about him theyre still at the hospital i think ozzie was with them all night he knows them real well of course he knows all those folks real well hastings is kin to the girl somehow whens the preliminary hearing bullard set it for one pm today aint that right looney looney nodded any bond aint been set yet bollards gonna wait till the hearing if she dies theyll be lookin at capital murder wont they jake nodded they cant have a bond for capital murder can they jake looney asked they can but ive never seen one i know bullard wont set a bond for capital murder and if he did they couldnt make it if she dont die how much time can they get asked nesbit the third deputy others listened as jake explained they can get life sentences for the rape i assume they will also be charged with kidnapping and aggravated assault they already have then they can get twenty years for the kidnapping and twenty years for the aggravated assault yeah but how much time will they serve asked looney jake thought a second they could conceivably be paroled in thirteen years seven for the rape three for the kidnapping and three for the aggravated assault thats assuming theyre convicted on all charges and sentenced to the maximum what about cobb hes got a record yeah but hes not habitual unless hes got two prior convictions thirteen years looney repeated shaking his head jake stared through the window the square was coming to life as pickups full of fruits and vegetables parked next to the sidewalk around the courthouse lawn and the old farmers in faded overalls neatly arranged the small baskets of tomatoes and cucumbers and squash on the tailgates and hoods watermelons from florida were placed next to the dusty slick tires and the farmers left for an earlymorning meeting under the vietnam monument where they sat on benches and chewed red man and whittled while they caught up on the gossip theyre probably talking about the rape jake thought it was daylight now and time for the office the deputies were finished with their food and jake excused himself he hugged dell paid his check and for a second thought of driving home to check on hanna at three minutes before seven he unlocked his office and turned on the lights carl lee had difficulty sleeping on the couch in the waiting room tonya was serious but stable they had seen her at midnight after the doctor warned that she looked bad she did gwen had kissed the little bandaged face while carl lee stood at the foot of the bed subdued motionless unable to do anything but stare blankly at the small figure surrounded by machines tubes and nurses gwen was later sedated and taken to her mothers house in clanton the boys went home with gwens brother the crowd had dispersed around one leaving carl lee alone on the couch ozzie brought coffee and doughnuts at two and told carl lee all he knew about cobb and willard jakes office was a twostory building in a row of twostory buildings overlooking the courthouse on the north side of the square just down from the coffee shop the building was built by the wilbanks family back in the s back when they owned ford county and there had been a wilbanks practicing law in the building from the day it was built until the year of the disbarment next door to the east was an insurance agent jake had sued for botching a claim for tim nunley the mechanic down at the chevrolet place to the west was the bank with the mortgage on the saab all the buildings around the square were twostory brick except the banks the one next door had also been built by the wilbankses and had just two floors but the one on the southeast corner of the square had three floors and the newest one on the southwest corner had four floors jake practiced alone and had since the year of the disbarment he liked it that way especially since there was no other lawyer in clanton competent enough to practice with him there were several good lawyers in town but most were with the sullivan firm over in the bank building with four floors jake detested the sullivan firm every lawyer detested the sullivan firm except those in it there were eight in all eight of the most pompous and arrogant jerks jake had ever met two had harvard degrees they had the big farmers the banks the insurance companies the railroads everybody with money the other fourteen lawyers in the county picked up the scraps and represented people living breathing human souls most of whom had very little money these were the street lawyersthose in the trenches helping people in trouble jake was proud to be a street lawyer his offices were huge he used only five of the ten rooms in the building downstairs there was a reception room a large conference room a kitchen and a smaller storage and junk room upstairs jake had his vast office and another smaller office he referred to as the war room it had no windows no telephones no distractions three offices sat empty upstairs and two downstairs in years past these had been occupied by the prestigious wilbanks firm long before the disbarment jakes office upstairs the office was immense thirty by thirty with a tenfoot hardwood ceiling hardwood floors huge fireplace and three deskshis work desk a small conference desk in one corner and a rolltop desk in another corner under the portrait of william faulkner the antique oak furniture had been there for almost a century as had the books and shelves that covered one wall the view of the square and courthouse was impressive and could be enhanced by opening the french doors and walking onto a small balcony overhanging the sidewalk next to wash ington street jake had without a doubt the finest office in clanton even his bitter enemies in the sullivan firm would concede that much for all the opulence and square footage jake paid the sum of four hundred dollars a month to his landlord and former boss lucien wilbanks who had been disbarred in for decades the wilbanks family ruled ford county they were proud wealthy people prominent in farming banking politics and especially law all the wilbanks men were lawyers and were educated at ivy league schools they founded banks churches schools and several served in public office the firm of wilbanks wilbanks had been the most powerful and prestigious in north mississippi for many years then came lucien he was the only male wilbanks of his generation there was a sister and some nieces but they were expected only to marry well great things were expected of lucien as a child but by the third grade it was evident he would be a different wilbanks he inherited the law firm in when his father and uncle were killed in a plane crash although he was forty he had just recently several months prior to their deathscompleted his study of the law by correspondence courses somehow he passed the bar exam he took control of the firm and clients began disappearing big clients like insurance companies banks and farmers all left and went to the newly established sullivan firm sullivan had been a junior partner in the wilbanks firm until lucien fired him and evicted him after which he left with the other junior partners and most of the clients then lucien fired everyone elseassociates secretaries clerkseveryone but ethel twitty his late fathers favorite secretary ethel and john wilbanks had been very close through the years in fact she had a younger son who greatly resembled lucien the poor fellow spent most of his time in and out of various nut houses lucien jokingly referred to him as his retarded brother after the plane crash the retarded brother appeared in clanton and started telling folks he was the illegitimate son of john wilbanks ethel was humiliated but couldnt control him clanton seethed with scandal a lawsuit was filed by the sullivan firm as counsel for the retarded brother seeking a portion of the estate lucien was furious a trial ensued and lucien vigorously defended his honor and pride and family name he also vigorously defended his fathers estate all of which had been left to lucien and his sister at trial the jury noted the striking resemblance between lucien and ethels son who was several years younger the retarded brother was strategically seated as close as possible to lucien the sullivan lawyers instructed him to walk talk sit and do everything just like lucien they even dressed him like lucien ethel and her husband denied the boy was any kin to the wilbanks but the jury felt otherwise he was found to be an heir of john wilbanks and was awarded one third of the estate lucien cursed the jury slapped the poor boy and was carried screaming from the courtroom and taken to jail the jurys decision was reversed and dismissed on appeal but lucien feared more litigation if ethel ever changed her story thus ethel twitty remained with the wilbanks firm lucien was satisfied when the firm disintegrated he never intended to practice law like his ancestors he wanted to be a criminal lawyer and the old firms clientele had become strictly corporate he wanted the rapes the murders the child abuses the ugly cases no one else wanted he wanted to be a civil rights lawyer and litigate civil liberties but most of all lucien wanted to be a radical a flaming radical of a lawyer with unpopular cases and causes and lots of attention he grew a beard divorced his wife renounced his church sold his share of the country club joined the naacp and aclu resigned from the bank board and in general became the scourge of clanton he sued the schools because of segregation the governor because of the prison the city because it refused to pave streets in the black section the bank because there were no black tellers the state because of capital punishment and the factories because they would not recognize organized labor he fought and won many criminal cases and not just in ford county his reputation spread and a large following developed among blacks poor whites and the few unions in north mississippi he stumbled into some lucrative personal injury and wrong ful death cases there were some nice settlements the firm he and ethel was more profitable than ever lucien did not need the money he had been born with it and never thought about it ethel did the counting the law became his life with no family he became a workaholic fifteen hours a day seven days a week lucien practiced law with a passion he had no other interests except alcohol in the late sixties he noticed an affinity for jack daniels by the early seventies he was a drunk and when he hired jake in he was a fullfledged alcoholic but he never let booze interfere with his work he learned to drink and work at the same time lucien was always half drunk and he was a dangerous lawyer in that condition bold and abrasive by nature he was downright frightening when he was drinking at trial he would embarrass the opposing attorneys insult the judge abuse the witnesses then apologize to the jury he respected no one and could not be intimidated he was feared because he would say and do anything people walked lightly around lucien he knew it and loved it he became more and more eccentric the more he drank the crazier he acted then people talked about him even more so he drank even more between and lucien hired and disposed of eleven associates he hired blacks jews hispanics women and not one kept the pace he demanded he was a tyrant around the office constantly cursing and berating the young lawyers some quit the first month one lasted two years it was difficult to accept luciens craziness he had the money to be eccentrichis associates did not he hired jake in fresh from law school jake was from karaway a small town of twentyfive hundred eighteen miles west of clanton he was cleancut conservative a devout presbyterian with a pretty wife who wanted babies lucien hired him to see if he could corrupt him jake took the job with strong reservations because he had no other offers close to home a year later lucien was disbarred it was a tragedy for those very few who liked him the small union at the shoe factory north of town had called a strike it was a union lucien had organized and represented the factory began hiring new workers to replace the strikers and violence fol lowed lucien appeared on the picket line to rally his people he was drunker than normal a group of scabs attempted to cross the line and a brawl erupted lucien led the charge was arrested and jailed he was convicted in city court of assault and battery and disorderly conduct he appealed and lost appealed and lost the state bar association had grown weary of lucien over the years no other attorney in the state had received as many complaints as had lucien wilbanks private reprimands public reprimands and suspensions had all been used all to no avail the complaints tribunal and disciplinary committee moved swiftly he was disbarred for outrageous conduct unbecoming a member of the bar he appealed and lost appealed and lost he was devastated jake was in luciens office the big office upstairs when word came from jackson that the supreme court had upheld the disbarment lucien hung up the phone and walked to the doors overlooking the square jake watched him closely waiting for the tirade but lucien said nothing he walked slowly down the stairs stopped and stared at ethel who was crying and then looked at jake he opened the door and said take care of this place ill see you later they ran to the front window and watched him speed away from the square in his ragged old porsche for several months there was no word from him jake labored diligently on luciens cases while ethel kept the office from chaos some of the cases were settled some left for other lawyers some went to trial six months later jake returned to his office after a long day in court and found lucien asleep on the persian rug in the big office lucien are you all right he asked lucien jumped up and sat in the big leather chair behind the desk he was sober tanned relaxed jake my boy how are you he asked warmly fine just fine where have you been cayman islands doing what drinking rum lying on the beach chasing little native girls sounds like fun why did you leave it got boring jake sat across the desk its good to see you lucien good to see you jake how are things around here hectic but okay i guess did you settle medley yeah they paid eighty thousand thats very good was he happy yes seemed to be did cruger go to trial jake looked at the floor no he hired fredrix i think its set for trial next month i shouldve talked to him before i left hes guilty isnt he yes very it doesnt matter who represents him most defendants are guilty remember that lucien walked to the french doors and gazed at the courthouse what are your plans jake id like to stay here what are your plans youre a good man jake and i want you to stay me i dont know i thought about moving to the caribbean but i wont its a nice place to visit but it gets old i have no plans really i may travel spend some money im worth a ton you

this office it was my fathers and grandfathers put my junk in some boxes and ill pick it up later cobb and willard awoke with throbbing heads and red swollen eyes ozzie was yelling at them they were in a small cell by themselves through the bars to the right was a cell where the state prisoners were held awaiting the trip to parchman a dozen blacks leaned through the bars and glared at the two white boys as they struggled to clear their eyes to the left was a smaller cell also full of blacks wake up ozzie yelled and stay quiet or he would integrate his jail jakes quiet time was from seven until ethel arrived at eightthirty he was jealous with this time he locked the front door ignored the phone and refused to make appointments he meticulously planned his day by eightthirty he would have enough work dictated to keep ethel busy and quiet until noon by nine he was either in court or seeing clients he would not take calls until eleven when he methodically returned the mornings messagesall of them he never delayed returning a phone callanother rule jake worked systematically and efficiently with little wasted time these habits he had not learned from lucien at eightthirty ethel made her usual noisy entrance downstairs she made fresh coffee and opened the mail as she had every day for the past fortyone years she was sixtyfour and looked fifty she was plump but not fat well kept but not attractive she chomped on a greasy sausage and biscuit brought from home and read jakes mail jake heard voices ethel was talking to another woman he checked his appointment booknone until ten good morning mr brigance ethel announced through the intercom morning ethel she preferred to be called mrs twitty lucien and everyone else called her that but jake had called her ethel since he had fired her shortly after the disbarment theres a lady here to see you she doesnt have an appointment yes sir i know make one for tomorrow morning after tenthirty im busy now yes sir but she says

brigance she wants to hire you someone told her youre the best criminal lawyer in the county the amusement was obvious in ethels voice tell her thats true but im not interested ozzie handcuffed willard and led him down the hall to his office in the front section of the ford county jail he removed the handcuffs and seated him in a wooden chair in the center of the cramped room ozzie sat in the big chair across the desk and looked down at the defendant mr willard this here is lieutenant griffin with the mississippi highway patrol over here is investigator rady with my office and this

ray we wont promised the sheriff percy bullard fidgeted nervously in the leather chair behind the huge battered oak desk in the judges chambers behind the courtroom where a crowd had gathered to see about the rape in the small room next door the lawyers gathered around the coffee machine and gossiped about the rape bullards small black robe hung in a corner by the window that looked north over washington street his sizesix feet were wearing jogging shoes that barely touched the floor he was a small nervous type who worried about preliminary hearings and every other routine hearing after thirteen years on the bench he had never learned to relax fortunately he was not required to hear big cases those were for the circuit court judge bullard was just a county court judge and he had reached his pinnacle mr pate the ancient courtroom deputy knocked on the door come in bullard demanded afternoon judge how many blacks out there bullard asked abruptly half the courtroom thats a hundred people they dont draw that much for a good murder trial whatta they want mr pate shook his head they must think were trying these boys today i guess theyre just concerned mr pate said softly concerned about what im not turning them loose its just a preliminary hearing he quieted and stared at the window is the family out there i think so i recognize a few of them but i dont know her parents how about security sheriffs got ever deputy and ever reserve close to the courtroom we checked everbody at the door find anything no sir where are the boys sheriffs got them theyll be here in a minute the judge seemed satisfied mr pate laid a handwritten note on the desk what is it mr pate inhaled deeply its a request from a tv crew from memphis to film the hearing what bullards face turned red and he rocked furiously in the swivel chair cameras he yelled in my courtroom he ripped the note and threw the pieces in the direction of the trash can where are they in the rotunda order them out of the courthouse mr pate left quickly carl lee hailey sat on the row next to the back dozens of relatives and friends surrounded him in the rows of padded benches on the right side of the courtroom the benches on the left side were empty deputies milled about armed apprehensive keeping a nervous watch on the group of blacks and especially on carl lee who sat bent over elbows on knees staring blankly at the floor jake looked out his window across the square to the rear of the courthouse which faced south it was pm he had skipped lunch as usual and had no business across the street but he did need some fresh air he hadnt left the building all day and although he had no desire to hear the details of the rape he hated to miss the hearing there had to be a crowd in the courtroom because there were no empty parking spaces around the square a handful of reporters and photographers waited anxiously near the rear of the courthouse by the wooden doors where cobb and willard would enter the jail was two blocks off the square on the south side down the highway ozzie drove the car with cobb and willard in the back seat with a squad car in front and one behind the procession turned off washington street into the short driveway leading under the veranda of the courthouse six deputies escorted the defendants past the reporters through the doors and up the back stairs to the small room just outside the courtroom jake grabbed his coat ignored ethel and raced across the street he ran up the back stairs through a small hall outside the jury room and entered the courtroom from a side door just as mr pate led his honor to the bench all rise for the court mr pate shouted everyone stood bullard stepped to the bench and sat down be seated he yelled where are the defendants where bring them in then cobb and willard were led handcuffed into the courtroom from the small holding room they were unshaven wrinkled dirty and looked confused willard stared at the large group of blacks while cobb turned his back looney removed the handcuffs and seated them next to drew jack tyndale the public defender at the long table where the defense sat next to it was a long table where the county prosecutor rocky childers sat taking notes and looking important willard glanced over his shoulder and again checked on the blacks on the front row just behind him sat his mother and cobbs mother each with a deputy for protection willard felt safe with all the deputies cobb refused to turn around from the back row eighty feet away carl lee raised his head and looked at the backs of the two men who raped his daughter they were mangy bearded dirtylooking strangers he covered his face and bent over the deputies stood behind him backs against the wall watching every move now listen bullard began loudly this is just a preliminary hearing not a trial the purpose of a preliminary hearing is to determine if there is enough evidence that a crime has been committed to bind these defendants over to the grand jury the defendants can even waive this hearing if they want to tyndale stood no sir your honor we wish to proceed with the hearing very well i have copies of affidavits sworn to by sheriff walls charging both defendants with rape of a female under the age of twelve kidnapping and aggravated assault mr childers you may call your first witness your honor the state calls sheriff ozzie walls jake sat in the jury box along with several other attorneys all of whom pretended to be busy reading important materials ozzie was sworn and sat in the witness chair to the left of bullard a few feet from the jury box would you state your name sheriff ozzie walls youre the sheriff of ford county yes i know who he is bullard mumbled as he flipped through the file sheriff yesterday afternoon did your office receive a call about a missing child yes around fourthirty what did your office do deputy willie hastings was dispatched to the residence of gwen and carl lee hailey the parents of the girl where was that down on craft road back behind bates grocery what did he find he found the girls mother who made the call then drove around searchin for the girl did he find her no when he returned to the house the girl was there shed been found by some folks fishin and they took her home what shape was the girl in shed been raped and beaten was she conscious yeah she could talk or mumble a little what did she say tyndale jumped to his feet your honor please i know hearsay is admissible in a hearing like this but this is triple hearsay overruled shut up sit down continue mr childers what did she say told her momma it was two white men in a yellow pickup truck with a rebel flag in the window thats about all she couldnt say much had both jaws broken and her face kicked in what happened then the deputy called an ambulance and she was taken to the hospital how is she they say shes critical what happened then based on what i knew at the time i had a suspect in mind so whatd you do i located an informant a reliable informant and placed him in a beer joint down by the lake childers was not one to dwell on details especially in front of bullard jake knew it as did tyndale bullard sent every case to the grand jury so every preliminary was a formality regardless of the case the facts the proof regardless of anything bullard would bind the defendant over to the grand jury if there was insufficient proof let the grand jury turn them loose not bullard he had to be reelected the grand jury did not voters got upset when criminals were cut loose most defense lawyers in the county waived the preliminary hearings before bullard not jake he viewed such hearings as the best and quickest way to look at the prosecutions case tyndale seldom waived a preliminary hearing which beer joint hueys whatd he find out said he heard cobb and willard the two defendants over there braggin bout rapin a little black girl cobb and willard exchanged stares who was the informant they remembered little from hueys whatd you find at hueys we arrested cobb and willard then we searched a pickup titled in the name of billy ray cobb whatd you find we towed it in and examined it this mornin lot of blood stains what else we found a small tshirt covered with blood whose tshirt it belonged to tonya hailey the little girl who was raped her daddy carl lee hailey identified it this nin carl lee heard his name and sat upright ozzie stared straight at him jake turned and saw carl lee for the first time describe the truck new yellow ford halfton pickup big chrome wheels and mud tires rebel flag in the rear window owned by who ozzie pointed at the defendants billy ray cobb does it match the description given by the girl yes childers paused and reviewed his notes now sheriff what other evidence do you have against these defendants we talked to pete willard this mornin at the jail he signed a confession you did what cobb blurted willard cowered and looked for help order order shouted bullard as he banged his gavel tyndale separated his clients did you advise mr willard of his rights yes did he understand them yes did he sign a statement to that effect yes who was present when mr willard made his statement me two deputies my investigator rady and lieutenant griffin with the highway patrol do you have the confession yes please read it the courtroom was still and silent as ozzie read the short statement carl lee stared blankly at the two defendants cobb glared at willard who picked dirt off his boots thank you sheriff childers said when ozzie finished did mr willard sign the confession yes in front of three witnesses the state has nothing further your honor bullard shouted you may crossexamine mr tyndale i have nothing at this time your honor good move thought jake strategically for the de listen take notes let the court reporter record the testimony and stay quiet the grand jury would see the case anyway so why bother and never allow the defendants to testify their testimony would serve no purpose and haunt them at trial jake knew they would not testify because he knew tyndale call your next witness demanded the judge we have nothing further your honor good sit down mr tyndale do you have any witnesses no your honor good the court finds there is sufficient evidence that numerous crimes have been committed by these defendants and the court orders mr cobb and mr willard to be held to await action by the ford county grand jury which is scheduled to meet on monday may any questions tyndale rose slowly yes your honor we would request the court to set a reasonable bond for these de forget it snapped bullard bail will be denied as of now its my understanding that the girl is in critical condition if she dies there will of course be other charges well your honor in that case i would like to request a bail hearing a few days from now in the hopes that her condition improves bullard studied tyndale carefully good idea he thought granted a bail hearing is set for next monday may in this courtroom until then the defendants will remain in the custody of the ford county sheriff courts adjourned bullard rapped the gavel and disappeared the deputies swarmed around the defendants handcuffed them and they too disappeared from the courtroom into the holding room down the back stairs past the reporters and into the squad car the hearing was typical for bullardless than twenty minutes justice could be very swift in his courtroom jake talked to the other lawyers and watched the crowd file silently through the enormous wooden doors at the rear of the courtroom carl lee was in no hurry to leave and motioned for jake to follow him they met in the rotunda carl lee wanted to talk and he excused himself from the crowd and promised to meet them at the hospital he and jake walked down the winding staircase to the first floor im truly sorry carl lee jake said yeah me too how is she shell make it hows gwen okay i guess how about you they walked slowly down the hall toward the rear of the courthouse it aint sunk in yet i mean twentyfour hours ago everthing was fine now look at us my little girls layin up in the hospital with tubes all over her body my wifes crazy and my boys are scared to death and all i think about is gettin my hands on those bastards i wish i could do something carl lee all you can do is

for a steel company good job got married youre kidding lester married yeah married a white girl white girl whats he want with a white girl aw you know lester always an uppity nigger hes on his way home now be in late tonight what for they stopped at the rear door jake asked again whats lester coming in for family business yall planning something nope he just wants to see his niece yall dont get excited thats easy for you to say jake i know what would you plan jake what do you mean you gotta little girl suppose shes layin up in the hospital beat and raped what would you do jake looked through the window of the door and could not answer carl lee waited dont do anything stupid carl lee answer my question what would you do i dont know i dont know what id do lemme ask you this if it was your little girl and if it was two niggers and you could get your hands on them what would you do kill them carl lee smiled then laughed sure you would jake sure you would then youd hire some bigshot lawyer to say yous crazy just like you did in lesters trial we didnt say lester was crazy we just said bowie needed killing you got him off didnt you sure carl lee walked to the stairs and looked up this how they get to the courtroom he asked without looking at jake who those boys yeah most of the time they take them up those stairs its quicker and safer they can park right outside the door here and run them up the stairs carl lee walked to the rear door and looked through the window at the veranda how many murder trials you had jake three lesters and two more how many were black all three how many you win all three you pretty good on nigger shootins aint you i guess you ready for another one dont do it carl lee its not worth it what if youre convicted and get the gas chamber what about the kids wholl raise them those punks arent worth it you just told me youd do it jake walked to the door next to carl lee its different with me i could probably get off how im white and this is a white county with a little luck i could get an allwhite jury which will naturally be sympathetic this is not new york or california a mans supposed to protect his family a jury would eat it up and me like i said this aint new york or california some whites would admire you but most would want to see you hang it would be much harder to win an acquittal but you could do it couldnt you jake dont do it carl lee i have no choice jake ill never sleep till those bastards are dead i owe it to my little girl i owe it to myself and i owe it to my people itll be done they opened the doors walked under the veranda and down the driveway to washington street across from jakes office they shook hands jake promised to stop by the hospital tomorrow to see gwen and the family one more thing jake will you meet me at the jail when they arrest me jake nodded before he thought carl lee miled and walked down the sidewalk to his truck lester hailey married a swedish girl from wisconsin and although she still professed love for him lester suspected the novelty of his skin was beginning to fade she was terrified of mississippi and flatly refused to travel south with lester even though he assured her she would be safe she had never met his family not that his people were anxious to meet herthey were not it was not uncommon for southern blacks to move north and marry white girls but no hailey had ever mixed there were many haileys in chicago most were kin and all married black the family was not impressed with lesters blonde wife he drove to clanton in his new cadillac by himself it was late wednesday night when he arrived at the hospital and found some cousins reading magazines in the secondfloor waiting room he embraced carl lee they had not seen each other since the christmas holidays when half the blacks in chicago trooped home to mississippi and alabama they stepped into the hall away from the relatives how is she lester asked better much better might go home this weekend lester was relieved when he left chicago eleven hours earlier she had been near death according to the cousin who had called and scared him from bed he lit a kool under the no smoking sign and stared at his big brother you okay carl lee nodded and glanced down the hall hows gwen crazier than normal shes at her mommas you come by yourself yeah lester answered defensively good dont get smart i didnt drive all day to hear crap about my wife okay okay you still got gas lester smiled and chuckled he had been plagued by stomach gas since the day he married the swede she pre pared dishes he couldnt pronounce and his system behaved violently he longed for collards peas okra fried chicken barbecue pork and fatback they found a small waiting room on the third floor with folding chairs and a card table lester bought two cups of stale thick coffee from a machine and stirred the powdered cream with his finger he listened intently as carl lee detailed the rape the arrests and the hearing lester found some napkins and diagrammed the courthouse and the jail it had been four years since his murder trial and he had trouble with the drawings he had spent only a week in jail prior to posting bond and had not visited the place since his acquittal in fact he had left for chicago shortly after his trial the victim had relatives they made plans and discarded them plotting well past midnight at noon thursday tonya was removed from intensive care and placed in a private room she was listed as stable the doctors relaxed and her family brought candy toys and flowers with two broken jaws and a mouthful of wire she could only stare at the candy her brothers ate most of it they clung to her bed and held her hand as if to protect and reassure the room stayed full of friends and strangers all patting her gently and saying how sweet she was all treating her as someone special someone who had been through this horrible thing the crowd moved in shifts from the hall into her room and back into the hall where the nurses watched carefully the wounds hurt and at times she cried every hour the nurses cleared a path through the visitors and found the patient for a dose of painkiller that night in her room the crowd hushed as the memphis station talked about the rape the television showed pictures of the two white men but she couldnt see very well the ford county courthouse opened at am and closed at pm every day except friday when it closed at fourthirty at fourthirty on friday carl lee was hiding in a moiiiuui icsiroom wnen tney locked the courthouse he sat on a toilet and listened quietly for an hour no janitors no one silence he walked through the wide semidark hall to the rear doors and peeked through the window no one in sight he listened for a while the courthouse was deserted he turned and looked down the long hall through the rotunda and through the front doors two hundred feet away he studied the building the two sets of rear doors opened to the inside into a large rectangular entrance area to the far right was a set of stairs and to the left was an identical stairway the open area narrowed and led into the hall carl lee pretended to be on trial he grabbed his hands behind him and touched his back to the rear door he walked to his right thirty feet to the stairs up the stairs ten steps then a small landing then a ninetydegree turn to the left just like lester said then ten more steps to the holding room it was a small room fifteen by fifteen with nothing but a window and two doors one door he opened and walked into the huge courtroom in front of the rows of padded pews he walked to the aisle and sat in the front row surveying the room he noticed in front of him the railing or bar as lester called it which separated the general public from the area where the judge jury witnesses lawyers defendants and clerks sat and worked he walked down the aisle to the rear doors and examined the courtroom in detail it looked much different from wednesday back down the aisle he returned to the holding room and tried the other door which led to the area behind the bar where the trial took place he sat at the long table where lester and cobb and willard had sat to the right was another long table where the prosecutors sat behind the tables was a row of wooden chairs then the bar with swinging gates on both ends the judge sat high and lordly behind the elevated bench his back to the wall under the faded portrait of jefferson davis frowning down on everyone in the room the jury box was against the wall to carl lees right to the judges left under the yellow portraits of other forgotten confederate heroes the witness stand was next to the bench but lower of course and in front of the jury to carl lees left opposite the jury box was a long enclosed workbench covered with large red docket books clerks and lawyers usually milled around behind it during a trial behind the workbench through the wall was the holding room carl lee stood still as though handcuffed and walked slowly through the small swinging gate in the bar and was led through the first door into the holding room then down the steps ten of them through the narrow shadowy stairway then he stopped from the landing halfway down the steps he could see the rear doors of the courthouse and most of the entrance area between the doors and the hall at the foot of the stairs to the right was a door that he opened and found a crowded junky janitors closet he closed the door and explored the small room it turned and ran under the stairway it was dark dusty crowded with brooms and buckets and seldom used he opened the door slightly and looked up the stairs for another hour he roamed the courthouse the other rear stairway led to another holding room just behind the jury box one door went to the courtroom the other to the jury room the stairs continued to the third floor where he found the county law library and two witness rooms just as lester said up and down up and down he traced and retraced the movements to be made by the men who raped his daughter he sat in the judges chair and surveyed his domain he sat in the jury box and rocked in one of the comfortable chairs he sat in the witness chair and blew into the microphone it was finally dark at seven when carl lee raised a window in the restroom next to the janitors closet and slid quietly through the bushes and into the darkness who would you report it to carla asked as she closed the fourteeninch pizza box and poured some more lemonade jake rocked slightly in the wicker swing on the front porch and watched hanna skip rope on the sidewalk next to the street are you there she asked no who would you report it to i dont plan to report it he said i mink you should i think i shouldnt why not his rocking gained speed and he sipped the lemonade he spoke slowly first of all i dont know for sure that a crime is being planned he said some things any father would say and im sure hes having thoughts any father would have but as far as actually planning a crime i dont think so secondly what he said to me was said in confidence just as if he was a client in fact he probably thinks of me as his lawyer but even if youre his lawyer and you know hes planning a crime you have to report it dont you yes if im certain of his plans but im not she was not satisfied i think you should report it jake did not respond it wouldnt matter he ate his last bite of crust and tried to ignore her you want carl lee to do it dont you do what kill those boys no i dont he was not convincing but if he did i wouldnt blame him because id do the same thing dont start that again im serious and you know it id do it jake you couldnt kill a man okay whatever im not going to argue weve been through it before carla yelled at hanna to move away from the street she sat next to him in the swing and rattled her ice cubes would you represent him i hope so would the jury convict him would you i dont know well think of hanna just look at that sweet little innocent child out there skipping rope youre a mother now think of the little hailey girl lying there beaten bloody begging for her momma and daddy shut up jake he smiled answer the question youre on the jury would you vote to convict the father she placed her glass on the windowsill and suddenly became interested in her cuticles jake smelled victory come on youre on the jury conviction or acquittal im always on the jury around here either that or im being crossexamined convict or acquit she glared at him it would be hard to convict he grinned and rested his case but i dont see how he could kill them if theyre in jail easy theyre not always in jail they go to court and theyre transported to and from remember oswald and jack ruby plus they get out if they can make bail when can they do that bonds will be set monday if they bond out theyre loose and if they cant they remain in jail until trial when is the trial probably late summer i think you should report it jake bolted from the swing and went to play with hanna k t bruster or cat bruster as he was known was to his knowledge the only oneeyed black millionaire in memphis he owned a string of black topless joints in town all of which he operated legally he owned blocks of rental property which he operated legally and he owned two churches in south memphis which were also operated legally he was a benefactor for numerous black causes a friend of the politicians and a hero to his people it was important for cat to be popular in the community because he would be indicted again and tried again and in all likelihood acquitted again by his peers half of whom were black the authorities had found it impossible to convict cat of killing people and of selling such things as women cocaine stolen goods credit cards food stamps untaxed liquor guns and light artillery he had one eye with him the other one was somewhere in a rice paddy in vietnam he lost it the same day in that his buddy carl lee hailey was hit in the leg carl lee carried him for two hours before they found help after the war he returned to memphis and brought with him two pounds of hashish the proceeds went to buy a small saloon on south main and he almost starved before he won a whore in a poker game with a pimp he promised her she could quit whoring if she would take off her clothes and dance on his tables overnight he had more business than he could seat so he bought another bar and brought in more dancers he found his niche in the market and within two years he was a very wealthy man his office was above one of his clubs just off south main between vance and beale in the roughest part of memphis the sign above the sidewalk advertised bud and breasts but much more was for sale behind the black windows carl lee and lester found the loungebrown sugar around noon saturday they sat at the bar ordered bud and watched the breasts is cat in carl lee asked the bartender when he walked behind them he grunted and returned to the sink where he continued his beer mug washing carl lee glanced at him between sips and dance routines another beer lester said loudly without taking his eyes off the dancers cat bruster here carl lee asked firmly when the bartender brought the beer who wants to know i do so so me and cat are good friends fought together in nam name hailey carl lee hailey from mississippi the bartender disappeared and a minute later emerged from between two mirrors behind the liquor he motioned for the haileys who followed him through a small door past the restrooms and through a locked door up the stairs the office was dark and gaudy the carpet on the floor was gold on the walls red on the ceiling green a green shag ceiling thin steel bars covered the two blackened windows and for good measure a set of heavy dusty burgundy drapes hung from ceiling to floor to catch and smother any sunlight robust enough to penetrate the painted glass a small ineffective chrome chandelier with mirror panes rotated slowly in the center of the room barely above their heads two mammoth bodyguards in matching threepiece black suits dismissed the bartender and seated lester and carl lee and stood behind them the brothers admired the furnishings nice aint it lester said bb king mourned softly on a hidden stereo suddenly cat entered from a hidden door behind the marble and glass desk he lunged at carl lee my man my man carl lee hailey he shouted and grabbed carl lee so good to see you carl lee so good to see you carl lee stood and they bearhugged how are you my man cat demanded doin fine cat just fine and you great great whos this he turned to lester and threw a hand in his chest lester shook it violently iuia ucie s my orother lester carl lee said hes from chicago

tightens up sometimes when it rains but its fine we mighty tight aint we carl lee nodded and smiled cat released him you fellas want a drink no thanks said carl lee ill take a beer said lester cat snapped his fingers and a bodyguard disappeared carl lee fell into his chair and cat sat on the edge of his desk his feet dangling and swinging like a kid on a pier he grinned at carl lee who squirmed under all the admiration why dont you move to memphis and go to work for me cat said carl lee knew it was coming cat had been offering him jobs for ten years no thanks cat im happy and im happy for you whats on your mind carl lee opened his mouth hesitated crossed his legs and frowned he nodded and said need a favor cat just a small favor cat spread his arms anything big man anything you want you remember them ms we used in nam i need one of them as quick as possible cat recoiled his arms and folded them across his chest he studied his friend thats a bad gun what kinda squirrels you huntin down there it aint for squirrels cat analyzed them both he knew better than to ask why it was serious or carl lee wouldnt be there semi nope the real thing you talkin some cash how much its illegal as hell you know if i could buy it at sears i wouldnt be here cat grinned again when do you need it today the beer arrived and was served to lester cat moved behind his desk to his orange vinyl captains

anyone else but not for you big man how much nothin carl lee nothin i owe you somethin worth much more than money ill be glad to pay for it nope i wont hear it the guns yours thats mighty kind cat id give you fifty of them just need one when can i get it lemme check cat phoned someone and mumbled a few sentences into the receiver the orders given he hung up and explained it would take about an hour we can wait carl lee said cat removed the patch from his left eye and wiped the empty socket with a handkerchief i gotta better idea he snapped at the bodyguards get my car well drive over and pick it up they followed cat through a secret door and down a hall i live here you know he pointed through that door is my pad usually keep some naked women around id like to see it lester volunteered thats okay said carl lee farther down the hall cat pointed to a thick black shiny iron door at the end of a short hallway he stopped as if to admire it thats where i keep my cash post a guard in there around the clock how much lester asked with a sip of beer cat glared at him and continued down the hall carl lee frowned at his brother and shook his head where the hall ended they climbed a narrow stairway to the fourth floor it was darker and somewhere in the darkness cat found a button on a wall they waited silently for a few um me wait opened and revealed a bright elevator with red carpet and a no smoking sign cat pushed another button you gotta walk up to catch the elevator goin down he said with amusement security reasons they nodded approval and admiration it opened in the basement one of the bodyguards waited by the open door of a clean white stretch limo and cat invited his guests in for a ride they moved slowly past a row of fleetwoods several more limos a rolls and an assortment of european luxury cars theyre all mine he said proudly the driver honked and a heavy door rolled up to reveal a oneway side street drive slow cat yelled to the chauffeur and the bodyguard way up front i wanna show you fellas around some carl lee had received the tour a few years earlier during his last visit to cat there were rows of beaten and paintless shacks that the great man referred to as rental properties there were ancient redbricked warehouses with blackened or boarded windows and no clue as to what was stored inside there was a church a prosperous church and a few blocks away another one he owned the preachers too he said there were dozens of corner taverns with open doors and groups of young blacks sitting on benches outside drinking quart bottles of stag beer he pointed proudly to a burnedout building near beale and told with great zeal the story of a competitor who had attempted to gain a foothold in the topless business he had no competitors he said and then there were the clubs places with names like angels and cats house and black paradise places where a man could go for good drink good food good music naked women and possibly more he said the clubs had made him a very rich man eight of them in all they were shown all eight plus what seemed like most of the real estate in south memphis at the dead end of a nameless street near the river the driver turned sharply between two of the redbricked warehouses and drove through a narrow alley until a gate opened to the right past the gate a door opened next to a loading dock and the limo disap peared into the building it stopped and the bodyguard got out keep your seats cat said the trunk opened then shut in less than a minute the limo was again cruising the streets of memphis how bout lunch cat asked before they answered he yelled at the driver black paradise call and tell them im comin for lunch got the best prime rib in memphis right here in one of my clubs course you wont read about it in the sunday paper ive been shunned by the critics can you imagine sounds like discrimination lester said yeah im sure it is but i dont use that until im indicted we aint read about you lately cat carl lee said its been three years since my last trial tax evasion feds spent three weeks puttin on proof and the jury stayed out twentyseven minutes and returned with the two most precious words in the afroenglish languagenot guilty ive heard them myself lester said a doorman waited under the canopy at the club and a set of matching bodyguards different bodyguards escorted the great one and his guests to a private booth away from the dance floor drinks and food were served by a squad of waiters lester switched to scotch and was drunk when the prime rib arrived carl lee drank iced tea and swapped war stories with cat when the food was gone a bodyguard approached and whispered to cat he grinned and looked at carl lee yall in the red eldorado with illinois plates yeah but we left it at the other place its parked outside in the trunk what said lester how cat roared and slapped him on the back dont ask my man dont ask its all taken care of my man cat can do anything as usual jake worked saturday morning after breakfast at the coffee shop he enjoyed the tranquility of his office on saturdayno phones no ethel he locked the office ig uuicu me pnone and avoided clients he organized files read recent decisions from the supreme court and planned strategy if a trial was approaching his best thoughts and ideas came during quiet saturday mornings at eleven he phoned the jail sheriff in he asked the dispatcher lemme check came the reply moments passed before the sheriff answered sheriff walls he announced ozzie jake brigance how are you fine jake you fine will you be there for a while coupla hours whats up not much just need to talk for a minute ill be there in thirty minutes ill be waitin jake and the sheriff had a mutual like and respect for each other jake had roughed him up a few times during crossexaminations but ozzie considered it business and nothing personal jake campaigned for ozzie and lucien financed the campaigns so ozzie didnt mind a few sarcastic and pointed questions during trial he liked to watch jake at trial and he liked to kid him about the game in when jake was a sophomore quarterback at karaway ozzie was a senior allconference allstate tackle at clanton the two rivals both undefeated met in the final game at clanton for the conference championship for four long quarters ozzie terrorized the karaway offense which was much smaller and led by a gutsy but battered sophomore quarterback late in the fourth quarter leading ozzie broke jakes leg on a blitz for years now he had threatened to break the other one he always accused jake of limping and asked about the leg whats on your mind buddy ozzie asked as they sat in his small office carl lee im a little worried about him what way look ozzie whatever we say here is said in confidence i dont want anyone to know about this conversation you sound serious jake i am serious i talked to carl lee wednesday after the hearing hes out of his mind and i understand that i would be too he was talking about killing the boys and he sounded serious i just think you ought to know theyre safe jake he couldnt get to them if he wanted to weve had some phone calls anonymous of course with all kinds of threats black folks are bad upset but the boysre safe theyre in a cell by themselves and were real careful thats good i havent been hired by carl lee but ive represented all the haileys at one time or another and im sure he considers me to be his lawyer for whatever reason i feel a responsibility to let you know im not worried jake good let me ask you something ive got a daughter and youve got a daughter right got two of them whats carl lee thinking i mean as a black father same thing youd be thinkin and whats that ozzie reared back in his chair and crossed his arms he thought for a moment hes wonderin if shes okay physically i mean is she gonna live and if she does how bad is she hurt can she ever have kids then hes wonderin if shes okay mentally and emotionally and how will this affect her for the rest of her life thirdly he wants to kill the bastards would you its easy to say i would but a man dont know what hed do i think my kids need me at home a whole lot more than parchman needs me what would you be thinkin jake about the same i guess i dont know what id do probably go crazy he paused and stared at the desk but i might seriously plan to kill whoever did it itd be mighty hard to lie down at night knowing he was still alive what would a jury do depends on whos on the jury you pick the right jury and you walk if the da picks the right jury you get the gas it depends strictly on the jury and in this county you can me ngrit lolks people are tired of raping and robbing and killing i know white folks are everbody is my point is that thered be a lot of sympathy for a father who took matters into his own hands people dont trust our judicial system i think i could at least hang a jury just convince one or two that the bastard needed to die like monroe bowie exactly just like monroe bowie he was a sorry nigger who needed killing and lester took a walk by the way ozzie why do you suppose lester drove from chicago hes pretty close to his brother were watchin him too the conversation changed and ozzie finally asked about the leg they shook hands and jake left he drove straight home where carla was waiting with her list she didnt mind the saturdays at the office as long as he was home by noon and pretty much followed orders thereafter on sunday afternoon a crowd gathered at the hospital and followed the little hailey girls wheelchair as it was pushed by her father down the hall through the doors and into the parking lot where he gently raised her and sat her in the front seat as she sat between her parents with her three brothers in the back seat he drove away followed by a procession of friends and relatives and strangers the caravan moved slowly deliberately out of town and into the country she sat up in the front seat like a big girl her father was silent her mother tearful and her brothers mute and rigid another throng waited at the house and rushed to the porch as the cars moved up the driveway and parked on the grass on the long front yard the crowd hushed as he carried her up the steps through the door and laid her on the couch she was glad to be home but tired of the spectators her mother held her feet as cousins uncles aunts neighbors and everybody walked to her and touched her and smiled some through tears and said nothing her daddy went outside and talked to uncle lester and the men her brothers were in the kitchen with the crowd devouring the pile of food rocky childers had been the prosecutor for ford county for more years than he cared to remember the job paid fifteen thousand a year and required most of his time it also destroyed any practice he hoped to build at fortytwo he was washed up as a lawyer stuck in a deadend parttime fulltime job elected permanently every four years thankfully he had a wife with a good job so they could drive new buicks and afford the country club dues and in general put on the necessary airs of educated white people in ford county at a younger age he had political ambitions but the voters dissuaded him and he was malcontent to exhaust his career prosecuting drunks shoplifters and juvenile delinquents and being abused by judge bullard whom he despised excitement crept up occasionally when people like cobb and willard screwed up and rocky by statutory authority handled the preliminary and other hearings before the cases were sent to the grand jury and then to circuit court and then to the real prosecutor the big prosecutor the district attorney mr rufus buckley from polk county it was buckley who had disposed of rockys political career normally a bail hearing was no big affair for childers but this was a bit different since wednesday he had received dozens of phone calls from blacks all registered voters or claiming to be who were very concerned about cobb and willard being released from jail they wanted the boys locked up just like the black ones who got in trouble and could not make bail before trial childers promised his best but explained the bonds would be set by county judge percy bullard whose number was also in the phone book on bennington street they promised to be in court monday to watch him and bullard at twelvethirty monday childers was summoned to the judges chambers where the sheriff and bullard were waiting the judge was so nervous he could not sit how much bond do you want he snapped at childers i dunno judge i havent thought much about it dont you think its about time you thought about it he paced rapidly back and forth behind his desk then to the window then back to his desk ozzie was amused and silent not really childers answered softly its your decision youre the judge thanks thanks thanks how much will you ask for i always ask for more than i expect replied childers coolly thoroughly enjoying the judges neurosis how much is that i dunno i hadnt thought much about it dullards neck turned dark red and he glared at ozzie whatta you think sheriff well ozzie drawled i would suggest pretty stiff bonds these boys need to be in jail for their own safety black folk are restless out there they might get hurt if they bond out better go high how much money they got willards broke cant tell about cobb drug moneys hard to trace he might could find twenty thirty thousand i hear hes hired some bigshot memphis lawyer supposed to be here today he must have some money damn why dont i know these things whod he hire bernard peter k bernard answered childers he called me this morning never heard of him retorted bullard with an air of superiority as though he memorized some kind of judicial rap sheet on all lawyers bullard studied the trees outside the window as the sheriff and prosecutor exchanged winks the bonds would be exorbitant as always the bail bondsmen loved bullard for his outrageous bonds they watched with delight as desperate families scraped and mortgaged to collect the ten percent premiums they charged to write the bonds bullard would be high and he didnt care it was politically safe to set them high and keep the criminals in jail the blacks would appreciate it and that was important even if the county was seventyfour percent white he owed the blacks a few favors lets go a hundred thousand on willard and two hundred on cobb that oughtta satisfy them satisfy who asked ozzie er uh the people the people out there sound okay to you fine with me said childers but what about the hearing he asked with a grin well give them a hearing a fair hearing then ill set the bonds at a hundred and two hundred and i suppose you want me to ask for three hundred apiece so you can look fair asked childers i dont care what you ask for yelled the judge sounds fair to me said ozzie as he headed for the door will you call me to testify he asked childers naw we dont need you i dont guess the state will call anybody since were having such a fair hearing they left the chambers and bullard stewed he locked the door behind them and pulled a half pint of vodka from his briefcase and gulped it furiously mr pate waited outside the door five minutes later bullard barged into the packed courtroom all rise for the court mr pate shouted be seated screamed the judge before anyone could stand where are the defendants where cobb and willard were escorted from the holding room and seated at the defense table cobbs new lawyer smiled at his client as the handcuffs were removed willards lawyer tyndale the public defender ignored him the same crowd of blacks had returned from last wednesday and had brought some friends they closely followed the movements of the two white boys lester saw them for the first time carl lee was not in the courtroom from the bench bullard counted deputiesnine in all that had to be a record then he counted blackshundreds of them all bunched together all glaring at the two rapists who sat at the same table between their lawyers the vodka felt good he took a sip of what appeared to be ice water from a styrofoam cup and managed a slight grin it burned slowly downward and his cheeks flushed what he ought to do was order the deputies out of the courtroom and throw cobb and willard to the niggers that would be fun to watch and justice would be served he could just see the fat nigger women stomping up and down while their men carved on the boys with switchblades and machetes then when they were finished they would collect themselves and all march quietly from the courtroom he smiled to himself he motioned for mr pate who approached the bench ive got a half pint of ice water in my desk drawer he whispered pour me some in a styrofoam cup mr pate nodded and disappeared this is a bail hearing he declared loudly and i dont intend for it to last long are the defendants ready yes sir said tyndale yes your honor said mr bernard the state ready yes sir answered childers without standing good call your first witness childers addressed the judge your honor the state will call no witnesses his honor is well aware of the charges against these two defendants since his honor held the preliminary hearing last wednesday it is my understanding the victim is now home so we do not anticipate further charges the grand jury will be asked next monday to indict the two defendants for rape kidnapping and aggravated assault because of the violent nature of these crimes because of the age of the victim and because mr cobb is a convicted felon the state would ask for the maximum bonds and not a penny less bullard almost choked on his ice water what maximum theres no such thing as a maximum bond what do you suggest mr childers half a million apiece childers announced proudly and sat down half a million out of the question thought bullard he sipped furiously and glared at the prosecutor half a million doublecrossed in open court he sent mr pate after more ice water the defense may proceed cobbs new lawyer stood purposefully he cleared his throat and removed his hornrimmed academic gotohell reading glasses may it please the court your honor my name is peter k bernard am irom jviempms aim i uavt been retained by mr cobb to represent him do you have a license to practice in mississippi interrupted bullard bernard was caught offguard well uh not exactly your honor i see when you say not exactly do you mean something other than no several lawyers in the jury box snickered bullard was famous for this he hated memphis lawyers and required them to associate local counsel before appearing in his court years before when he was practicing a memphis judge had kicked him out of court because he was not licensed in tennessee he had enjoyed revenge since the day he was elected your honor i am not licensed in mississippi but i am licensed in tennessee i would hope so came the retort from the bench more suppressed laughter from the jury box are you familiar with our local rules here in ford county his honor asked er uh yes sir do you have a copy of these rules yes sir and you read them carefully before you ventured into my courtroom uh yes sir most of them did you understand rule when you read it cobb glanced up suspiciously at his new lawyer uh i dont recall that one bernard admitted i didnt think so rule requires outofstate unlicensed attorneys to associate local counsel when appearing in my courtroom yes sir from his looks and mannerisms bernard was a polished attorney at least he was known as such in memphis he was however in the process of being totally degraded and humbled before a smalltown redneck judge with a quick tongue yes sir what snapped bullard yes sir i think ive heard of that rule there is none but i planned then you drove down here from memphis carefully read my rules and deliberately ignored them right bernard lowered his head and stared at a blank yellow legal pad on the table tyndale rose slowly your honor for the record i show myself as associated counsel for mr bernard for purposes of this hearing and for no other purpose bullard smiled slick move tyndale slick move the ice water warmed him and he relaxed very well call your first witness bernard stood straight again he cocked his head your honor on behalf of mr cobb i would like to call his brother mr fred cobb to the stand make it brief bullard mumbled cobbs brother was sworn and seated in the witness chair bernard assumed the podium and began a long detailed direct examination he was well prepared he elicited proof that billy ray cobb was gainfully employed owned real estate in ford county grew up there had most of his family there and friends and had no reason to leave a solid citizen with deep roots with much to lose if he fled a man who could be trusted to show up for court a man worthy of a low bond bullard sipped tapped his pen and searched the black faces in the audience childers had no questions bernard called cobbs mother cora who repeated what her son fred said about her son billy ray she managed a couple of tears at an awkward moment and bullard shook his head tyndale was next he went through the same motions with willards family half a million dollars bond anything less would be too little and the blacks wouldnt like it the judge had new reason to hate childers but he liked the blacks because they elected him last time he received fiftyone percent of the vote countywide but he got all the nigger vote anything else he asked when tyndale finished the three lawyers looked blankly at each other then at the judge bernard stood your honor i would like to summarize my clients position in regard to a reasonable bond forget it pal ive heard enough from you and your client sit down bullard hesitated then rapidly announced bond is hereby set at one hundred thousand for pete willard and two hundred thousand for billy ray cobb defendants will remain in the custody of the sheriff until they are able to make bail courts adjourned he rapped the gavel and disappeared into his chambers where he finished the half pint and opened another one lester was pleased with the bonds his had been fifty thousand for the murder of monroe bowie of course bowie was black and bonds were generally lower for those cases the crowd inched toward the rear door but lester did not move he watched closely as the two white boys were handcuffed and taken through the door into the holding room when they were out of sight he placed his head in his hands and said a short prayer then he listened at least ten times a day jake walked through the french doors and onto the balcony to inspect downtown clanton he sometimes puffed a cheap cigar and blew smoke over washington street even in the summer he left the windows open in the big office the sounds of the busy small town made good company as he worked quietly at times he was amazed at the volume of noise generated on the streets around the courthouse and at other times he walked to the balcony to see why things were so quiet just before pm monday may he walked to the balcony and lit a cigar a heavy silence engulfed downtown clanton mississippi cobb went first down the stairs cautiously with his hands cuffed behind him then willard then deputy looney ten steps down then the landing turn right then ten steps to the first floor three other deputies waited outside by the patrol cars smoking cigarettes and watching reporters when cobb reached the second step from the floor and willard was three steps behind and looney was one step off the landing the small dirty neglected unnoticed door to the janitors closet burst open and mr carl lee hailey sprung from the darkness with an m at pointblank range he opened fire the loud rapid clapping popping gunfire shook the courthouse and exploded the silence the rapists froze then screamed as they were hitcobb first in the stomach and chest then willard in the face neck and throat they twisted vainly up the stairs handcuffed and helpless stumbling over each other as their skin and blood splashed together looney was hit in the leg but managed to scramble up the stairs into the holding room where he crouched and listened as cobb and willard screamed and moaned and the crazy nigger laughed bullets ricocheted between the walls of the narrow stairway and looney could see looking down toward the landing blood and flesh splashing on the walls and dripping down in short sudden bursts of seven or eight rounds each the enormous booming sound of the m echoed through the courthouse for an eternity through the gunfire and the sounds of the bullets rattling around the walls of the stairway the highpitched shrill laughing voice of carl lee could be plainly heard when he stopped he threw the rifle at the two corpses and ran into the restroom he jammed the door with a chair crawled out a window into the bushes then onto the sidewalk nonchalantly he walked to his pickup and drove home lester froze when the shooting started the gunfire was heard loudly in the courtroom willards mother screamed and cobbs mother screamed and the deputies raced into the holding room but did not venture down the stairs lester listened intently for the sounds of handguns and hearing none he left the courtroom with the first shot bullard grabbed the half pint and crawled under his desk while mr pate locked the door cobb or what was left of him came to rest on willard their blood mixed and puddled on each step then it overflowed and dripped to the next step where it puddled before overflowing and dripping to the next soon the foot of the stairway was flooded with the mixture jake sprinted across the street to the rear door of the courthouse deputy prather crouched in front of the door gun drawn and cursed the reporters who pressed forward the other deputies knelt fearfully on the doorsteps next to the patrol cars jake ran to the front of the courthouse where more deputies were guarding the door and evacuating the county employees and courtroom spectators a mass of bodies poured onto the front steps jake fought through the stampede and into the rotunda and found ozzie directing people and yelling in all directions he motioned for jake and they walked down the hall to the rear doors where a half dozen deputies stood guns in hand gazing silently at the stairway jake felt nauseated willard had almost made it to the landing the front of his head was missing and his brains rolled out like jelly covering his face cobb had been able to twist over and absorb the bullets with his back his face was buried in willards stomach and his feet touched the fourth step from the floor the blood continued from the lifeless bodies and it covered completely the bottom six steps the crimson pool on the floor inched quickly toward the deputies who slowly backed away the weapon was between cobbs legs on the fifth step and it too was covered with blood the group stood silently mesmerized by the two bodies which though dead continued to spew blood the thick smell of gunfire hung over the stairway and drifted toward the hall into the rotunda where the deputies continued to move people toward the front door jake youd better leave ozzie said without looking from the bodies why just leave why cause we gotta take pictures and collect evidence and stuff and you dont need to be here cui you aon t interrogate him out ot my presence understand ozzie nodded the photographs were taken the mess cleaned the evidence gathered the bodies removed and two hours later ozzie left town followed by five patrol cars hastings drove and led the convoy into the country toward the lake past bates grocery onto craft road the hailey driveway was empty except for owens car carl lees pickup and the red cadillac from illinois ozzie expected no trouble as the patrol cars parked in a row across the front yard and the deputies crouched behind the open doors watching as the sheriff walked alone to the house he stopped the front door opened slowly and the hailey family emerged carl lee walked to the edge of the porch with tonya in his arms he looked down at his friend the sheriff and behind him at the row of cars and deputies to his right was gwen and to his left were his three sons the smallest one crying softly but the older ones brave and proud behind them stood lester the two groups watched each other each waiting for the other to say or do something each wanting to avoid what was about to happen the only sounds were the soft sniffles of the little girl her mother and the youngest boy the children had tried to understand their daddy had explained to them what he had just done and why they understood that but they could not comprehend why he had to be arrested and taken to jail ozzie kicked at a clod of dirt occasionally glancing at the family then at his men finally he said you better come with me carl lee nodded slightly but did not move gwen and the boy cried louder as lester took the girl from her daddy then carl lee knelt before the three boys and whispered to them again that he must leave but wouldnt be gone long he hugged them and they all cried and clutched him he turned and kissed his wife then walked down the steps to the sneriff you wanna handcuff me ozzie naw carl lee just get in the car moss junior tatum the chief deputy and jake talked quietly in ozzies office while deputies reserves trusties and other jailhouse regulars gathered in the large cluttered workroom next to the office and waited anxiously for the arrival of the new prisoner two of the deputies peered through the blinds at the reporters and cameramen waiting in the parking lot between the jail and the highway the television vans were from memphis jackson and tupelo and they were parked in various directions throughout the crowded lot moss did not like this so he walked slowly down the sidewalk and ordered the press to regroup in a certain area and to move the vans will you make a statement yelled a reporter yeah move the vans can you say anything about the murders yeah two people got killed how about the details nope i wasnt there do you have a suspect yep who is it ill tell you when the vans are moved the vans were immediately moved and the cameras and microphones were bunched together near the sidewalk moss pointed and directed until he was satisfied then stepped to the crowd he calmly chewed on a toothpick and stuck both thumbs in the front belt loops just under the overlapping belly who did it is he under arrest was the girls family involved are both dead moss smiled and shook his head one at a time yes we have a suspect hes under arrest and will be here in a minute keep the vans outta the way thats all i have moss walked back to the jail as they continued to can at mm he ignored them and entered the crowded workroom hows looney he asked prathers with him at the hospital hes fineslight wound to the leg yeah that and a slight heart attack moss said with a smile the others laughed here they come a trusty shouted and everyone inside moved to the windows as the line of blue lights rolled slowly into the parking lot ozzie drove the first car with carl lee seated unhandcuffed in the front hastings reclined in the back and waved at the cameras as the car passed them and continued through the crowd past the vans and around to the rear of the jail where ozzie parked and the three walked casually inside carl lee was given to the jailer and ozzie walked down the hall to his office where jake was waiting you can see him in a minute jake he said thanks you sure he did it yeah im sure he didnt confess did he no he didnt say much of nothin i guess lester coached him moss walked in ozzie them reporters wanna talk to you i said youd be out in a minute thanks moss ozzie sighed anybody see it jake asked ozzie wiped his forehead with a red handkerchief yeah looney can id him you know murphy the little crippled man who sweeps floors in the courthouse sure stutters real bad he saw the whole thing he was sittin on the east stairs directly across from where it happened eatin his lunch scared him so bad he couldnt talk for an hour ozzie paused and eyed jake why am i tellin you all this what difference does it make ill find out sooner or later wheres my man down the hall in the jail they gotta take his picture and all that be bout thirty minutes ozzie left and jake used his phone to call carla and remind her to watch the news and record it i answerin no questions

preliminary hearing im not the judge any idea maybe tomorrow maybe wednesday no more questions please i have no further information to release at this time the jailer took carl lees wallet money watch keys ring and pocketknife and listed the items on an inventory form that carl lee signed and dated in a small room next to the jailers station he was photographed and fingerprinted just as lester said ozzie waited outside the door and led him down the hall to a small room where the drunks were taken to blow into the intoxilyzer jake sat at a small table next to the machine ozzie excused himself the lawyer and client sat across the table and analyzed each other carefully they grinned admiringly but neither spoke they had last talked five days before on wednesday after the preliminary hearing the day after the rape carl lee was not as troubled now his face was relaxed and his eyes were clear finally he said you didnt think id do it jake not really you did do it you know i did jake smiled nodded and crossed his arms how do you feel carl lee relaxed and sat back in the folding chair well i feel better i dont feel good bout the whole thing i wish it didnt happen but i wish my girl was okay too you know i didnt have nothin against them boys till they messed with her now they got what they started i feel sorry for their mommas and daddies if they got daddies which i doubt are you scared of what how about the gas chamber naw jake thats why i got you i dont plan to go to no gas chamber i saw you get lester off now just get me off you can do it jake its not quite that easy carl lee say what you just dont shoot a person or persons in cold blood and then tell the jury they needed killing and expect to walk out of the courtroom you did with lester but every case is different and the big difference here is that you killed two white boys and lester killed a nigger big difference you scared jake why should i be scared im not facing the gas chamber you dont sound too confident you big stupid idiot thought jake how could he be confident at a time like this the bodies were still warm sure he was confident before the killings but now it was different his client was facing the gas for a crime which he admits he committed whered you get the gun a friend in memphis okay did lester help nope he knew bout what fs gonna do and he wanted to help but i wouldnt let him hows gwen shes pretty crazy right now but testers with her she didnt know a thing about it the kids you know how kids are they dont want their daddy in jail they upset but theyll make it lesterll take care of them is he going back to chicago not for a while jake when do we go to court the preliminary should be tomorrow or wednesday depends on bullard is he the judge he will be for the preliminary hearing but he wont hear the trial thatll be in circuit court whos the judge there omar noose from van buren county same judge who tried lester good hes okay aint he yeah hes a good judge when will the trial be late summer or early fall buckley will push for a quick trial whos buckley rufus buckley district attorney same da who prosecuted lester you remember him big loud guy yeah yeah i remember big bad rufus buckley id forgot all about him hes pretty mean aint he hes good very good hes corrupt and ambitious and hell eat this up because of the publicity youve beat him aint you yeah and hes beat me jake opened his briefcase and removed a file inside was a contract for legal services which he studied although he had it memorized his fees were based on the ability to pay and the blacks generally could pay little unless there was a close and generous relative in st louis or chicago with a goodpaying job those were rare in lesters trial there had been a brother in california who worked for the post office but hed been unwilling or unable to help there were some sisters scattered around but they had their own problems and had offered only moral support for lester gwen had a big family and they stayed out of trouble but they were not prosperous carl lee owned a few acres around his house and had mortgaged it to help lester pay jake before he had charged lester five thousand for his murder trial half was paid before trial and the rest in installments over three years jake hated to discuss fees it was the most difficult part of practicing law clients wanted to know up front immediately how much he would cost and they all reacted differently some were shocked some just swallowed hard a few had stormed out of his office some negotiated but most paid or promised to pay he studied the file and the contract and thought desperately of a fair fee there were other lawyers out there who would take such a case for almost nothing nothing but publicity he thought about the acreage and the job at the paper mill and the family and finally said my fee is ten thousand carl lee was not moved you charged lester five thousand jake anticipated this you have three counts lester had one how many times can i go to the gas chamber good point how much can you pay i can pay a thousand now he said proudly and ill borrow as much as i can on my land and give it all to you jake thought a minute ive got a better idea lets agree on a fee you pay a thousand now and sign a note for the rest borrow on your land and pay against the note how much you want asked carl lee ten thousand ill pay five you can pay more than that and you can do it for less than ten okay i can do it for nine then i can pay six eight seven can we agree on seventyfive hundred yeah i think i can pay that much depends on how much theyll loan me on my land you want me to pay a thousand now and sign a note for sixtyfive hundred thats right okay you got a deal jake filled in the blanks in the contract and promissory note and carl lee signed both jake how much would you charge a man with plenty of money fifty thousand fifty thousand you serious yep man thats a lotta money you ever get that much no but i havent seen too many people on trial for murder with that kind of money carl lee wanted to know about his bond the grand jury the trial the witnesses who would be on the jury when could he get out of jail could jake speed up the trial when could he tell his version and a thousand other questions jake said they would have plenty of time to talk he promised to call gwen and his boss at the paper mill he left and carl lee was placed in his cell the one next to the cell for state prisoners the saab was blocked by a television van jake inquired as to who owned it most of the reporters had left but a few loitered about expecting something it was almost dark are you with the sheriffs department asked a reporter no im a lawyer jake answered nonchalantly attempting to seem disinterested are you mr haileys attorney jake turned and stared at the reporter as the others listened matter of fact i am will you answer some questions you can ask some i wont promise any answers will you step over here jake walked to the microphones and cameras and tried to act annoyed by the inconvenience ozzie and the deputies watched from inside jake loves cameras he said all lawyers do added moss what is your name sir jake brigance youre mr haileys attorney correct jake answered coolly mr hailey is the father of the young girl raped by the two men who were killed today correct who killed the two men i dont know was it mr hailey i said i dont know whats your client been charged with hes been arrested for the murders of billy ray cobb and pete willard he hasnt formally been charged with anything do you expect mr hailey to be indicted for the two murders no comment why no comment have you talked with mr hailey asked another reporter yes just a moment ago how is he what do you mean well uh how is he you mean how does he like jail jake asked with a slight grin uh yeah no comment when will he be in court probably tomorrow or wednesday will he plead guilty jake smiled and replied of course not after a cold supper they sat in the swing on the front porch and watched the lawn sprinkler and talked about the case the killings were big news across the country and carla recorded as many television reports as possible two of the networks covered the story live through their memphis affiliates and the memphis jackson and tupelo stations re house surrounded by deputies and seconds later being carried from the courthouse under white sheets one of the stations played the actual audio of the gunfire over film of the deputies scrambling for cover jakes interview was too late for the evening news so he and carla waited with the recorder for the ten oclock and there he was briefcase in hand looking trim fit handsome and arrogant and very disgusted with the reporters for the inconvenience jake thought he looked great on tv and he was excited to be there there had been one other brief appearance after lesters acquittal and the regulars at the coffee shop had kidded him for months he felt good he relished the publicity and anticipated much more he could not think of another case another set of facts another setting which could generate as much publicity as the trial of carl lee hailey and the acquittal of carl lee hailey for the murder of the two white men who raped his daughter before an allwhite jury in rural mississippi whatre you smiling about carla interrupted nothing sure youre thinking about the trial and the cameras the reporters the acquittal and walking out of the courthouse arm around carl lee reporters chasing you with the cameras rolling people slapping you on the back congratulations everywhere i know exactly what youre thinking about then whyd you ask to see if youd admit it okay i admit it this case could make me famous and make us a million bucks in the long run if you win yes if i win and if you lose ill win but if you dont think positive the phone rang and jake spent ten minutes with the editor owner and only reporter of the clanton chronicle it rang again and jake talked with a reporter with the mem phis morning paper he hung up and called lester ana gwen then the foreman at the paper mill at elevenfifteen it rang again and jake received his first death threat anonymous of course he was called a niggerloving son of a bitch one who would not live if the nigger walked dell perkins served more coffee and grits than usual tuesday morning after the killings all the regulars and some extras had gathered early to read the papers and talk about the killings which had taken place less than three hundred feet from the front door of the coffee shop claudes and the tea shoppe were also crowded earlier than usual jakes picture made the front page of the tupelo paper and the memphis and jackson papers had frontpage photos of cobb and willard both before the shootings and afterward as the bodies were loaded into the ambulance there were no pictures of carl lee all three papers ran detailed accounts of the past six days in clanton it was widely accepted around town that carl lee had done the killing but rumors of additional gunmen surfaced and flourished until one table at the tea shoppe had a whole band of wild niggers in on the attack however the deputies in the coffee shop though not talkative throttled the gossip and kept it pretty much under control deputy looney was a regular and there was concern for his wounds which appeared to be more serious than originally reported he remained in the hospital and he had identified the gunman as lester haileys brother jake entered at six and sat near the front with some farmers he nodded at prather and the other deputy but they pretended not to see him theyll be okay once looney is released he thought there were some remarks about the frontpage picture but no one questioned jake about his new client or the killings he detected a certain coolness among some of the regulars he ate quickly and left at nine ethel called jake bullard was holding hello judge how are you terrible you represent carl lee hailey yes sir when do you want the preliminary why are you asking me judge good question look the funerals are tomorrow morning sometime and i think it would be best to wait till they bury those bastards dont you yeah judge good idea how bout tomorrow afternoon at two fine bullard hesitated jake would you consider waiving the preliminary and letting me send the case straight to the grand jury judge i never waive a preliminary you know that yeah i know just thought id ask a favor i wont hear this trial and i have no desire to get near it see you tomorrow an hour later ethel squawked through the intercom again mr brigance there are some reporters here to see you jake was ecstatic from where memphis and jackson i believe seat them in the conference room ill be down in a minute he straightened his tie and brushed his hair and checked the street below for television vans he decided to make them wait and after a couple of meaningless phone calls he walked down the stairs ignored ethel and entered the conference room they asked him to sit at one end of the long table because of the lighting he declined told himself he would control things and sat at one side with his back to the rows of thick expensive law books the microphones were placed before him and the camera lights adjusted and finally an attractive lady from memphis with streaks of bright orange across her forehead and under her eyes cleared her throat and asserted herself mr brigance you represent carl lee hailey yes i do and hes been charged with the murders of billy ray cobb and pete willard thats correct and cobb and willard were charged with raping mr haileys daughter yes thats correct does mr hailey deny killing cobb and willard he will plead not guilty to the charges will he be charged for the shooting of the deputy mr looney yes we anticipate a third charge of aggravated assault against the officer do you anticipate a defense of insanity im not willing to discuss the defense at this time because he has not been indicted are you saying theres a chance he may not be indicted a fat pitch one jake was hoping for the grand jury would either indict him or not and the grand jurors would not be selected until circuit court convened on monday may so the future members of the grand jury were walking the streets of clanton tending their shops working in the factories cleaning house reading newspapers watching tv and discussing whether or not he should be indicted yes i think theres a chance he may not be indicted its up to the grand jury or will be after the preliminary hearing whens the preliminary hearing tomorrow two pm youre assuming judge bullard will bind him over to the grand jury thats a pretty safe assumption replied jake knowing bullard would be thrilled with the answer when will the grand jury meet a new grand jury will be sworn in monday morning it could look at the case by monday afternoon when do you anticipate a trial assuming hes indicted the case could be tried in late summer or early fall which court circuit court of ford county who would be the judge honorable omar noose wheres he from chester mississippi van buren county you mean the case will be tried here in clanton yes unless venue is changed will you request a change of venue very good question and one im not prepared to answer at this time its a bit premature to talk defense strat egy why would you want a change of venue to find a blacker county jake thought he answered thoughtfully the usual reasons pretrial publicity etc who makes the decision to change venue judge noose the decision is within his sole discretion has bond been set no and it probably wont be until after the indictments come down hes entitled to a reasonable bond now but as a matter of practice in this county bonds are not set in capital murder cases until after the indictment and arraignment in circuit court at that point the bond will be set by judge noose what can you tell us about mr hailey jake relaxed and reflected a minute while the cameras continued another fat pitch with a golden chance to plant some seeds hes thirtyseven years old married to the same woman for twenty years four kidsthree boys and a girl nice guy with a clean record never been in trouble before decorated in vietnam works fifty hours a week at the paper mill in coleman pays his bills and owns a little land does to church every sunday with his family minds his own business and expects to be left alone will you allow us to talk to him of course not wasnt his brother tried for murder several years ago he was and he was acquitted you were his attorney yes i was youve handled several murder trials in ford county havent you three how many acquittals all of them he answered slowly doesnt the jury have several options in mississippi asked the lady from memphis thats right with a capital murder indictment the jury at trial can find the defendant guilty of manslaughter which carries twenty years or capital murder which carries life or death as determined by the jury and the jury can find the defendant not guilty jake smiled at the cameras again youre assuming hell be indicted hows the hailey girl shes at home went home sunday shes expected to be fine the reporters looked at each other and searched for other questions jake knew this was the dangerous part when they ran out of things to ask and began serving up screwball questions he stood and buttoned his coat look i appreciate you folks stopping by im usually available just give a little more notice and ill be glad to talk to you anytime they thanked him and left at ten wednesday morning in a nofrills double service at the funeral home the rednecks buried their dead the minister a freshly ordained pentecostal struggled desperately for comforting and reassuring thoughts to lay upon the small crowd and over the two closed caskets the service was brief with few tears the pickups and dirty chevrolets moved slowly behind the single hearse as the procession left town and crawled into the country they parked behind a small red brick church the bodies were laid to rest one at a time at opposite ends of the tiny overgrown cemetery after a few additional words of inspiration the crowd dispersed cobbs parents had divorced when he was small and his father drove from birmingham for the funeral after the burial he disappeared mrs cobb lived in a small clean white frame house near the settlement of lake village ten miles south of clanton her other two sons and their cousins and friends gathered under an oak tree in the backyard while the women made a fuss over mrs cobb the men talked about niggers in general and chewed red man and sipped whiskey and reminisced about the other days when niggers knew their place now they were just pampered and protected by the government and courts and there was nothing white people could do one cousin knew a friend or someone who used to be active in the klan and he might give him a call cobbs grandfather had been in the klan long before his death the cousin explained and when he and billy ray were kids the old man would tell stories about hanging niggers in ford and tyler counties what they should do was the same thing the nigger had done but there were no volunteers maybe the klan would be interested there was a chapter farther down south near jackson near nettles county and the cousin was authorized to contact them the women prepared lunch the men ate quietly then returned to the whiskey under the shade tree the niggers hearing at pm was mentioned and they loaded up and drove to clanton there was a clanton before the killings and there was a clanton after the killings and it would be months before the two resembled each other one tragic bloody event the duration of which was less than fifteen seconds transformed the quiet southern town of eight thousand into a mecca for journalists reporters camera crews photographers some from neighboring towns others from the national news organizations cameramen and tv reporters bumped into one another on the sidewalks around the square as they asked the man in the street for the hundredth time how he or she felt about the hailey event and how he or she would vote if he or she was on the jury there was no clear verdict from the man on the street television vans followed small marked imported television cars around the square and down the streets chasing leads stories and interviews ozzie was a favorite at first he was interviewed a half dozen times the day after the shooting then found other business and delegated the interviewing to moss junior who enjoyed bantering with the press he could answer twenty questions and not divulge one new detail he also lied a lot and the ignorant foreigners could not tell his lies from his truth sir is there any evidence of additional gunmen yes really who we have evidence that the shootins were authorized and financed by an offshoot of the black panthers moss junior replied with a straight face half the reporters would either stutter or stare blankly while the other half repeated what he said and scribbled furiously bullard refused to leave his office or take calls he called jake again and begged him to waive the preliminary jake refused reporters waited in the lobby of bullards office on the first floor of the courthouse but he was safe with his vodka behind the locked door there was a request to film the funeral the cobb boys said yes for a fee but mrs willard vetoed the proposal the reporters waited outside the funeral home and filmed what they could then they followed the procession to the grave sites and filmed the burials and followed the mourners to mrs cobbs where freddie the oldest cursed them and made them leave the coffee shop on wednesday was silent the regulars including jake eyed the strangers who had invaded their sanctuary most of them had beards spoke with unusual accents and did not order grits arent you mr haileys attorney shouted one from across the room jake worked on his toast and said nothing arent you sir what if i am shot jake will he plead guilty im eating breakfast will he no comment why no comment no comment but why i dont comment during breakfast no comment may i talk to you later yeah make an appointment i talk at sixty bucks an hour the regulars hooted but the strangers were undaunted jake consented to an interview without charge with a memphis paper wednesday then barricaded himself in the war room and prepared for the preliminary hearing at noon he visited his famous client at the jail carl lee was rested and relaxed from his cell he could see the coming and going of the reporters in the parking lot hows jail jake asked not that bad foods good i eat with ozzie in his office you what yep play cards too youre kidding carl lee nope watch tv too saw you on the news last night you looked real good im gonna make you famous jake aint i jake said nothing when do i get on tv i mean i did the killin and you and ozzie gettin famous for it the client was grinning the lawyer was not today n about an hour yeah i heard wes goin to court what for preliminary hearing its no big deal at least its not supposed to be this one will be different because of the cameras what do i say nothing you dont say a word to anyone not to the judge the prosecutor the reporters anyone we just listen we listen to the prosecutor and see what kind of case hes got theyre supposed to have an eyewitness and he might testify ozzie will testify and tell the judge about the gun the fingerprints and looney hows looney dont know worse than they thought man i feel bad bout shootin looney i didnt even see the man well theyre going to charge you with aggravated assault for shooting looney anyway the preliminary is just a formality its purpose is to allow the judge to determine if theres enough evidence to bind you over to the grand jury bullard always does that so its just a formality then why do it we could waive it replied jake thinking of all the cameras he would miss but i dont like to its a good chance to see what kind of case the state has well jake id say they gotta pretty good case wouldnt you i would think so but lets just listen thats the strategy of a preliminary hearing okay sounds good to me you talked to gwen or lester today no i called them monday night they were here yesterday in ozzies office said theyd be in court today i think everyone will be in court today jake left in the parking lot he brushed by some of the reporters who were awaiting carl lees departure from jail he had no comments for them and no comments for the reporters waiting outside his office he was too busy at the moment for questions but he was very aware of the cameras at onethirty he went to the courthouse and hid in the law library on the third floor ozzie and moss junior and the deputies watched the parking lot and quietly cursed the mob of reporters and cameramen it was one fortyfive time to transport the prisoner to court kinda reminds me of a buncha vultures waitin for a dead dog beside the highway moss junior observed as he gazed through the blinds rudest buncha folks i ever saw added prather wont take no for an answer they expect the whole town to cater to them and thats only half of themother half s waitin at the courthouse ozzie hadnt said much one newspaper had criticized him for the shooting implying the security around the courthouse was intentionally relaxed he was tired of the press twice wednesday he had ordered reporters out of the jail i got an idea he said what asked moss junior is curtis todd still in jail yep gets out next week he sorta favors carl lee dont he whatta you mean well i mean hes bout as black as carl lee roughly the same height and weight aint he yeah well so what asked prather moss junior grinned and looked at ozzie whose eyes never left the window ozzie you wouldnt what asked prather lets go get carl lee and curtis todd ozzie ordered drive my car around back bring todd here for some instructions ten minutes later the front door of the jail opened and a squad of deputies escorted the prisoner down the sidewalk two deputies walked in front two behind and one on each side of the man with the thick sunglasses and handcuffs which were not fastened as they approached the reporters the cameras clicked and rolled the questions flew sir will you plead guilty sir will you plead not guilty sir how will you plead mr hailey will you plead insanity the prisoner smiled and continued the slow walk to the waiting patrol cars the deputies smiled grimly and ignored the mob the photographers scrambled about trying to get the perfect shot of the most famous vigilante in the country suddenly with the nation watching with deputies all around him with dozens of reporters recording his every move the prisoner broke and ran he jolted jumped twisted and squirmed running wildly across the parking lot over a ditch across the highway into some trees and out of sight the reporters shouted and broke ranks and several even chased him for a moment curiously the deputies ran back to the jail and slammed the door leaving the vultures roaming in circles of disarray in the woods the prisoner removed the handcuffs and walked home curtis todd had just been paroled one week early ozzie moss junior and carl lee quickly left through the rear of the jail and drove down a back street to the courthouse where more deputies waited to escort him into the courthouse how many niggers out there bullard screamed at mr pate a ton wonderful a ton of niggers i guess theres a ton of rednecks too quite a few is the courtroom full packed my godits only a preliminary bullard screamed he finished a half pint of vodka as mr pate handed him another one take it easy judge brigance its all his fault he could waive this if he wanted to i asked him to asked him twice he knows ill send it to the grand jury he knows that all lawyers know that but now i gotta make all the niggers mad because i wont turn him loose and ill make all the rednecks mad because i wont execute him today in the courtroom ill get brigance for this hes playing for the cameras i have to get reelected but he doesnt does he no judge how many officers out there plenty sheriffs called in the reserves youre safe how about the press theyre lined up on the front rows no cameras no cameras is hailey here yes sir hes in the courtroom with brigance everbodys ready just waitin on you his honor filled a styrofoam cup with straight vodka okay lets go just like in the old days before the sixties the courtroom was neatly segregated with the blacks and whites separated by the center aisle the officers stood solemnly in the aisle and around the walls of the courtroom of particular concern was an assemblage of slightly intoxicated whites sitting together in two rows near the front a couple were recognized as brothers or cousins of the late billy ray cobb they were watched closely the two front rows the one on the right in front of the blacks and the one on the left in front of the whites were occupied by two dozen journalists of various sorts some took notes while some sketched the defendant his lawyer and now finally the judge they gonna make this nigger a hero mumbled one of the rednecks loud enough for the reporters when bullard assumed the bench the deputies locked the rear door call your first witness he ordered in the direction of rocky childers the state calls sheriff ozzie walls the sheriff was sworn and took the stand he relaxed and began a long narrative describing the scene of the shooting the bodies the wounds the gun the fingerprints on the gun and the fingerprints of the defendant childers produced an affidavit signed by officer looney and witnessed by the sheriff and moss junior it identified the gunman as carl lee ozzie verified looneys signature and read the affidavit into the record sheriff do you know of any other eyewitness asked childers with no enthusiasm yes murphy the janitor whats his first name nobody knows hes just murphy okay have you talked to him no but my investigator did who is your investigator officer rady rady was sworn and seated in the witness chair mr pate fetched the judge another cup of ice water from chambers jake took pages of notes he would call no witnesses and he chose not to crossexamine the sheriff occasionally the states witnesses would get their lies confused in a preliminary and jake would ask a few questions on crossexamination to nail down for the record the discrepancies later at trial when the lying started again jake would produce the testimony from the preliminary to further confuse the liars but not today sir have you had an occasion to talk with murphy childers asked murphy who i dont knowjust murphy the janitor oh him yes sir good what did he say about what childers hung his head rady was new and had not testified much ozzie thought this would be good practice about the shooting tell us what he told you about the shooting jake stood your honor i object i know hearsay is admissible in a preliminary but this murphy fella is available he works here in the courthouse why not let him testify because he stutters replied bullard what he stutters and i dont want to hear him stutter for the next thirty minutes objection overruled continue mr childers jake sat in disbelief bullard snickered at mr pate who left for more ice water now mr rady what did murphy tell you about the shooting well hes hard to understand because he was so excited and when he gets excited he stutters real bad i mean he stutters anyway but just tell us what he said bullard shouted okay he said he saw a male black shoot the two white boys and the deputy thank you said childers now where was he when this took place who murphy he was sittin on the stairs directly opposite the stairs where they got shot and he saw it all said he did has he identified the gunman yes we showed him photos of ten male blacks and he identified the defendant sittin over there good thank you your honor we have nothing further any questions mr brigance asked the judge no sir jake said as he stood any witnesses no sir any requests motions anything no sir jake knew better than to request bail first it would do no good bullard would not set bail for capital murder second it would make the judge look bad thank you mr brigance the court finds sufficient evidence exists to hold this defendant for action by the ford county grand jury mr hailey shall remain in the custody of the sheriff without bond courts adjourned carl lee was quickly handcuffed and escorted from the courtroom the area around the rear door downstairs was sealed and guarded the cameras outside caught a glimpse of the defendant between the door and the waiting patrol car he was in jail before the spectators cleared the courtroom the deputies directed the whites on one side to leave first followed by the blacks the reporters requested some of jakes time and they were instructed to meet him in the rotunda in a few minutes he made them wait by first going to chambers and giving his regards to the judge then he walked to the third floor to check on a book when the courtroom was empty and they had waited long enough he walked through the rear door into the rotunda and faced the cameras a microphone with red letters on it was thrust into his face why didnt you request bond a reporter demanded that comes later will mr hailey plead an insanity defense as ive stated its too early to answer that question we must now wait for the grand juryhe may not be indicted if he is well start planning his defense mr buckley the da has stated he expects easy convictions any comment im afraid mr buckley often speaks when he shouldnt its asinine for him to make any comment on this case until it is considered by the grand jury he also said he would vigorously oppose any request for a change of venue that request hasnt been made yet he really doesnt care where the trial is held hed try it in the desert as long as the press showed up can we assume there are hard feelings between you and the da if you want to hes a good prosecutor and a worthy adversary he just talks when he shouldnt he answered a few other assorted questions and excused himself late wednesday night the doctors cut below looneys knee and removed the lower third of his leg they called ozzie at the jail and he told carl lee rufus buckley scanned the thursday morning papers and read with great interest the accounts of the preliminary hearing in ford county he was delighted to see his name mentioned by the reporters and by mr brigance the disparaging remarks were greatly outweighed by the fact that his name was in print he didnt like brigance but he was glad jake mentioned his name before the cameras and reporters for two days the spotlight had been on brigance and the defendant it was about time the da was mentioned brigance should not criticize anyone for seeking publicity lucien wilbanks wrote the book on manipulating the press both before and during a trial and he had taught jake well but buckley held no grudge he was pleased he relished the thought of a long nasty trial with his first opportunity at real meaningful exposure he looked forward to monday the first day of the may term of court in ford county he was fortyone and when he was first elected nine years earlier he had been the youngest da in mississippi now he was one year into his third term and his ambitions were calling it was time to move on to another public office say attorney general or possibly governor and then to congress he had it all planned but he was not well known outside the twentysecond judicial district ford tyler polk van buren and milburn counties he needed to be seen and heard he needed publicity what rufus needed more than anything else was a big nasty controversial wellpublicized conviction in a murder trial ford county was directly north of smithfield the county seat of polk county where rufus lived he had grown up in tyler county near the tennessee line north of ford county he had a good base politically he was a good prosecutor during elections he boasted of a ninety percent conviction rate and of sending more men to death row than any prosecutor in the state he was loud abrasive sanctimonious his client was the people of the state of mississippi by god and he took that obligation seriously the people hated crime and he hated crime and together they could eliminate it he could talk to a jury oh how he could talk to a jury he could preach pray sway plead beg he could inflame a jury to the point it couldnt wait to get back to that jury room and have a prayer meeting then vote and return with a rope to hang the defendant he could talk like the blacks and he could talk like the rednecks and that was enough to satisfy most of the jurors in the twentysecond and the juries were good to him in ford county he liked clanton when he arrived at his office in the polk county courthouse rufus was delighted to see a camera crew waiting in his reception room he was very busy he explained looking at his watch but he might have a minute for a few questions he arranged them in his office and sat splendidly in his leather swivel behind the desk the reporter was from jackson mr buckley do you have any sympathy for mr hailey he smiled seriously obviously in deep thought yes i do i have sympathy for any parent whose child is raped i certainly do but what i cannot condone and what our system cannot tolerate is this type of vigilante justice are you a parent i am i have one small son and two daughters one the age of the hailey girl and id be outraged if one of my daughters were raped but i would hope our judicial system would deal effectively with the rapist i have that much confidence in the system so you anticipate a conviction certainly i normally get a conviction when i go after one and i intend to get a conviction in this case will you ask for the death penalty yes it looks like a clear case of premeditated murder i think the gas chamber would be appropriate do you predict a death penalty verdict of course ford county jurors have always been willing to apply the death penalty when i ask for it and its appropriate i get very good juries up there mr brigance the defendants attorney has stated the grand jury may not indict his client bucmey chuckled at this well mr brigance should not be so foolish the case will be presented to the grand jury monday and well have our indictments monday afternoon i promise you that really he knows better you think the case will be tried in ford county i dont care where its tried ill get a conviction do you anticipate the insanity defense i anticipate everything mr brigance is a most capable criminal defense attorney i dont know what ploy he will use but the state of mississippi will be ready what about a plea bargain i dont much believe in plea negotiating neither does brigance i wouldnt expect that he said hes never lost a murder case to you the smile disappeared instantly he leaned forward on the desk and looked harshly at the reporter true but i bet he didnt mention a number of armed robberies and grand larcenies did he ive won my share ninety percent to be exact the camera was turned off and the reporter thanked him for his time no problem said buckley anytime ethel waddled up the stairs and stood before the big desk mr brigance my husband and i received an obscene phone call last night and ive just taken the second one here at the office i dont like this he motioned to a chair sit down ethel what did these people say they werent really obscene they were threatening they threatened me because i work for you said id be sorry because i worked for a nigger lover the ones here threaten to harm you and your family im just scared jake was worried too but shrugged it off for ethel he had called ozzie on wednesday and reported the calls to his house change your number ethel ill pay for it i dont want to change my number ive had it for seventeen years good then dont ive had my home number changed and its no big deal well ill not do it fine what else do you want well i dont think you should have taken that case i and i dont care what you think youre not paid to think about my cases if i want to know what you think ill ask until i do keep quiet she huffed and left jake called ozzie again an hour later ethel announced through the intercom lucien called this morning he asked me to copy some recent cases and he wants you to deliver them this afternoon said it had been five weeks since your last visit four weeks copy the cases and ill take them this afternoon lucien stopped by the office or called once a month he read cases and kept abreast of current developments in the law he had little else to do except drink jack daniels and play the stock market both of which he did recklessly he was a drunk and he spent most of his time on the front porch of his big white house on the hill eight blocks off the square overlooking clanton sipping jack in the black and reading cases he had deteriorated since the disbarment a fulltime maid doubled as a nurse who served drinks on the porch from noon until midnight he seldom ate or slept preferring instead to rock away the hours jake was expected to visit at least once a month the visits were made out of some sense of duty lucien was a bitter sick old man who cursed lawyers judges and especially the state bar association jake was his only friend the only audience he could find and keep captive long enough to hear his sermons along with the preaching he also freely dispensed unsolicited advice on jakes cases a most annoying habit he knew about the cases although jake never knew how lucien knew so much he was seldom seen downtown or anywhere in clanton except at the package store in the black section the saab parked behind the dirty dented porsche and jake handed the cases to lucien there were no hellos or other greetings just the handing of the copies to lucien who said nothing they sat in the wicker rockers on the long porch and looked out over clanton the top floor of the courthouse stood above the buildings and houses and trees around the square finally he offered whiskey then wine then beer jake declined carla frowned on drinking and lucien knew it congratulations for what jake asked for the hailey case why am i to be congratulated i never had a case that big and i had some big ones big in terms of what publicity exposure thats the name of the game for lawyers jake if youre unknown you starve when people get in trouble they call a lawyer and they call someone theyve heard of you must sell yourself to the public if youre a street lawyer of course its different if youre in a big corporate or insurance firm where you sit on your ass and bill a hundred bucks an hour ten hours a day ripping off little people and lucien jake interrupted quietly weve talked about this many times lets talk about the hailey case all right all right ill bet noose refuses to change venue who said i would request it youre stupid if you dont why simple statistics this county is twentysix percent black every other county in the twentysecond is at least thirty percent black van buren county is forty percent that means more black jurors potentialjurors if you get it moved you have a better chance for blacks in the jury box if its tried here you run the risk of an allwhite jury and believe me ive seen enough allwhite juries in this county all you need is one black to hang it and get a mistrial but then itll be retried then hang it again theyll give up after three trials a hung jury is the same as a loss on buckleys scorecard hell quit after the third trial so i simply tell noose i want the trial moved to a blacker county so i can get a blacker jury you can if you want to but i wouldnt id go through the usual crap about pretrial publicity a biased community and on and on and you dont think noose buy it naw this case is too big and itll get bigger the press has intervened and already started the trial everyones heard of it and not just in ford county you couldnt find a person in this state without a preconceived notion of guilt or innocence so why move it to another county then why should i request it because when that poor man is convicted youll need something to argue on appeal you can claim he was denied a fair trial because venue was not changed thanks for the encouragement whatre the chances of getting it moved to another district say somewhere in the delta forget it you can request a change of venue but you cannot request a certain location jake didnt know that he usually learned something during these visits he nodded confidently and studied the old man with the long dirty gray beard there had never been a time when he stumped lucien on a point of criminal law sallie lucien screamed throwing his ice cubes into the shrubs whos sallie my maid he replied as a tall attractive black lady opened the screen door and smiled at jake yeah lucien she answered my glass is empty she walked elegantly across the porch and took his glass she was under thirty shapely pretty and very dark jake ordered iced tea whered you find her he asked lucien stared at the courthouse whered you find her i dunno how old is she lucien was silent she live here no response how much do you pay her why is it any of your business more than you pay ethel shes a nurse too you know sure jake thought with a grin ill bet she does a lot of things dont worry about it i take it youre not thrilled with my chances for an acquittal lucien reflected a moment the maidnurse returned with the whiskey and tea not really it will be difficult why looks like it was premeditated from what i gather it was well planned right yes im sure youll plead insanity i dont know you must plead insanity lucien lectured sternly there is no other possible defense you cant claim it was an accident you cant say he shot those two boys handcuffed and unarmed with a machine gun in selfdefense can you no you wont create an alibi and tell the jury he was at home with his family of course not then what other defense do you have you must say he was crazy but lucien he was not insane and theres no way i can find some bogus psychiatrist to say he was he planned it meticulously every detail lucien smiled and took a drink thats why youre in trouble my boy jake sat his tea on the table and rocked slowly lucien savored the moment thats why youre in trouble he repeated what about the jury you know theyll be sympathetic thats exactly why you must plead insanity you must give the jury a way out you must show them a way to find him not guilty if they are so inclined if theyre sympathetic if they want to acquit you must provide them with a defense tney can use to do it it makes no difference if they believe the insanity crap thats not important in the jury room whats important is that the jury have a legal basis for an acquittal assuming they want to acquit will they want to acquit some will but buckley will make an awfully strong case of premeditated murder hes good hell take away their sympathy haileyll be just another black on trial for killing a white man when buckley gets through with him lucien rattled his ice cubes and stared at the brown liquid and what about the deputy assault with intent to kill a peace officer carries life no parole talk your way out of that one there was no intent great thatll be real convincing when the poor guy hobbles to the witness stand and shows the jury his nub nub yes nub they cut his leg off last night looney yes the one mr hailey shot i thought he was okay oh hes fine just minus a leg howd you find out ive got sources jake walked to the edge of the porch and leaned on a column he felt weak the confidence was gone taken away again by lucien he was an expert at poking holes in every case jake tried it was sport to him and he was usually right look jake i dont mean to sound so hopeless the case can be wonits a long shot but it can be won you can walk him out of there and you need to believe you can just dont get too cocky youve said enough to the press for a while back off and go to work lucien walked to the edge of the porch and spat in the shrubs always keep in mind that mr hailey is guilty guilty as hell most criminal defendants are but especially this one he took the law into his own hands and he murdered two people planned it all very carefully our legal system does not permit vigilante justice now you can win the case and if you do justice will prevail but if you lose it justice will also prevail kind of a strange case i guess i just wish i had it you serious sure im serious its a trial lawyers dream win it and youre famous the biggest gun in these parts it could make you rich ill need your help youve got it i need something to do after dinner and after hanna was asleep jake told carla about the calls at the office they had received a strange call before during one of the other murder trials but no threats were made just some groaning and breathing but these were different they mentioned jakes name and his family and promised revenge if carl lee was acquitted are you worried she asked not really its probably just some kids or some of cobbs friends does it scare you i would prefer they didnt call everybodys getting calls ozzies had hundreds bullard childers everybody im not worried about it what if it becomes more serious carla i would never endanger my family its not worth it ill withdraw from the case if i think the threats are legitimate i promise she was not impressed lester peeled off nine onehundreddollar bills and laid them majestically on jakes desk thats only nine hundred jake said our agreement was a thousand gwen needed groceries you sure lester didnt need some whiskey come on jake you know i wouldnt steal from my own brother okay okay whens gwen going to the bank to borrow the rest im goin right now to see the banker atcavage yeah stan atcavage next door at security bank good friend of mine he loaned it before on your trial you got the deed in my pocket how much you reckon hell give us no idea why dont you go find out lester left and ten minutes later atcavage was on the phone jake i cant loan the money to these people what if hes convictedno offense i know youre a good lawyer my divorce rememberbut hows he gonna pay me sitting on death row thanks look stan if he defaults you own ten acres right right with a shack on it ten acres of trees and kudzu plus an old house just what my new wife wants come on jake its a nice house and its almost paid for its a shack a clean shack but its not worth anything jake its gotta be worth something jake i dont want it the bank does not want it you loaned it before and he wasnt in jail before his brother was remember he was working at the paper mill good job too now hes headed for parchman thanks stan for the vote of confidence come on jake ive got confidence in your ability but i cant loan money on it if anybody can get him off you can and i hope you do but i cant make this loan the auditors would scream lester tried the peoples bank and ford national with the same results they hoped his brother was acquitted but what if he wasnt wonderful thought jake nine hundred dollars for a capital murder case claude had never seen the need for printed menus in his cafe years before when he first opened he couldnt afford menus and now that he could he didnt need them because most folks knew what he served for breakfast he cooked everything but rice and toast and the prices varied for friday lunch he barbecued pork shoulder and spare ribs and everybody knew it he had few white customers during the week but at noon friday every friday his small cafe was half white claude had known for some time that whites enjoyed barbecue as much as blacks they just didnt know how to prepare it jake and atcavage found a small table near the kitchen claude himself delivered two plates of ribs and slaw he leaned toward jake and said softly good luck to you hope you get him off thanks claude i hope youre on the jury claude laughed and said louder can i volunteer jake attacked the ribs and chewed on atcavage for not making the loan the banker was steadfast but did offer to lend five thousand if jake would cosign that would be unethical jake explained on the sidewalk a line formed and faces squinted through the painted letters on the front windows claude was everywhere taking orders giving orders cooking counting money shouting swearing greeting customers and asking them to leave on friday the customers were allotted twenty minutes after the food was served then claude asked and sometimes demanded that they pay and leave so he could sell more barbecue quit talkin and eat he would yell ive got ten more minutes claude you got seven on wednesday he fried catfish and allowed thirty minutes because of the bones the white folks avoided claudes on wednesday and he knew why it was the grease a secret recipe grease handed down by his grandmother he said it was heavy and sticky and wreaked havoc with the lower intestines of white people it didnt faze the blacks who piled in by the carloads every wednesday two foreigners sat near the cash register and watched claude fearfully as he directed lunch probably reporters thought jake each time claude drew nigh and glared they obediently picked up and gnawed a rib they had not experienced ribs before and it was obvious to everyone they were from the north they had wanted chef salads but claude cursed them and told them to eat barbecue or leave then he announced to the crowd these silly fools wanted chef salads heres your food hurry up and eat it he had demanded when he served them no steak knives one had asked crisply claude rolled his eyes and staggered away mumbling one noticed jake and after staring for a few minutes finally walked over and knelt by the table arent you jake brigarice mr haileys attorney yes i am who are you im roger mckittrick with the new york times nice to meet you jake said with a mile and a new attitude im covering the hailey case and id like to talk with you sometime as soon as possible really sure im not too busy this afternoon its friday i could do it late how about four fine said mckittrick who noticed claude approaching from the kitchen ill see you then okay buddy claude yelled at mckittrick times up get your check and leave jake and atcavage finished in fifteen minutes and waited for the verbal assault from claude they licked their fingers and mopped their faces and commented on the tenderness of the ribs this casell make you famous wont it asked atcavage i hope evidently it wont make any money seriously jake wont it help your practice if i win ill have more clients than i can handle sure itll help i can pick and choose my cases pick and choose my clients financially whatll it mean i have no idea theres no way to predict who or what it might attract ill have more cases to choose from so that means more money i could quit worrying about the overhead surely you dont worry about the overhead look stan were not all filthy rich a law degree is not worth what it once wastoo many of us fourteen in this little town competition is tough even in clantonnot enough good cases and too many lawyers its worse in the big towns and the law schools graduate more and more many of whom cant find jobs i get ten kids a year knocking on my door looking for work a big firm in memphis laid off some lawyers a few months ago can you imagine just like a factory they laid them off i suppose they went down to the unemployment office and stood in line with the dozer operators lawyers now not secretaries or truck drivers but lawyers sorry i asked sure i worry about the overhead it runs me four thousand a month and i practice alone thats fifty thousand a year before i clear a dime some months are good others slow theyre all unpredictable i wouldnt dare estimate what ill gross next month thats why this case is so important there will never be another one like it its the biggest ill practice the rest of my life and never have another reporter from the new york times stop me in a cafe and ask for an interview if i win ill be the top dog in this part of the state i can forget about the overhead and if you lose jake paused and glanced around for claude the publicity will be abundant regardless of the outcome win or lose the case will help my practice but a loss will really hurt every lawyer in the county is secretly hoping i blow it they want him convicted theyre jealous afraid i might get too big and take away their clients lawyers are extremely jealous you too sure take the sullivan firm i despise every lawyer in that firm but im jealous to an extent i wish i had some of their clients some of their retainers some of their security they know that every month theyll get a nice check its guaranteed almost and every christmas theyll get a big bonus they represent old money steady money that would be enjoyable for a change me i represent drunks thugs wife beaters husband beaters injured people most of whom have little or no money and i never know from one month to the next how many of these people will show up at my office look jake atcavage interrupted i would really like to finish this discussion but claude just looked at his watch and then looked at us i think our twenty minutes are up jakes check was seventyone cents more than atcavages and since both orders were identical claude was interrogated no problem he explained jake got an extra rib mckittrick was personable and precise thorough and pushy he had arrived in clanton on wednesday to investigate and write about what was billed as the most famous murder in the country at the moment he talked to ozzie and moss junior and they suggested he talk to jake he talked to bullard through the door and the judge suggested he talk to jake he interviewed gwen and lester but was not permitted to meet the girl he visited with the regulars at the coffee shop and the tea shoppe and he visited with the regulars at hueys and anns lounge he talked to willards exwife and mother but mrs cobb was through with reporters one of cobbs brothers offered to talk for a fee mckittrick declined he drove to the paper mill and talked to the coworkers and he drove to smithfield to interview the da he would be in town for a few more days then return for the trial he was from texas and retained when convenient a slight drawl which impressed the locals and opened them up he even said you all and yall occasionally and this distinguished him from most of the other reporters who clung to their crisp precise modern american pronunciation whats that mckittrick pointed to the center of jakes desk thats a tape recorder jake answered mckittrick sat his own recorder on the desk and looked at jakes may i ask why you may its my office my interview and if i want to record it i will are you expecting trouble im trying to prevent it i hate to be misquoted im not known for misquoting good then you wont mind if both of us record everthing you dont trust me do you mr brigance hell no and my name is jake why dont you trust me because youre a reporter youre from a new york paper youre looking for a sensational story and if youre true to form youll write some wellinformed moralistic piece of trash depicting us all as racist ignorant rednecks youre wrong first of all im from texas your paper is from new york but i consider myself a southerner how long have you been gone about twenty years jake smiled and shook his head as if to say thats too long and i dont work for a sensational newspaper well see the trial is several months away well have time to read your stories fair enough jake punched the play button on his tape recorder and mckittrick did likewise can carl lee hailey receive a fair trial in ford county why couldnt he jake asked well hes black he killed two white men and he will be tried by a white jury you mean he will be tried by a bunch of white racists no thats not what i said nor what i implied why do you automatically assume i think you are all a bunch of racists because you do were stereotyped and you know it mckittrick shrugged and wrote something on his steno pad will you answer the question yes he can receive a fair trial in ford county if hes tried here do you want it tried here im sure well try to move it to where we wont suggest a place thats up to the judge where did he get the m jake chuckled and stared at the tape recorder i do not know would he be indicted if he were white hes black and he has not been indicted but if he were white would there be an indictment yes in my opinion would he be convicted would you like a cigar jake opened a desk drawer and found a roitan he unwrapped it then lit it with a butane lighter no thanks no he would not be convicted if he were white in my opinion not in mississippi not in texas not in wyoming im not sure about new york why not do you have a daughter no then you wouldnt understand i think i do will mr hailey be convicted probably so the system does not work as fairly for blacks have you talked with raymond hughes no who is he he ran for sheriff last time and had the misfortune of making the runoff against ozzie walls hes white ozzie of course is not if im not mistaken he got thirtyone percent of the vote in a county thats seventyfour percent white why dont you ask mr hughes if the system treats blacks fairly i was referring to the judicial system its the same system who do you think sits in the jury box the same registered voters who elected ozzie walls well if a white man would not be convicted and mr hailey will probably be convicted explain to me how the system treats both fairly it doesnt im not sure im following you the system reflects society its not always fair but its as fair as the system in new york or massachusetts or california its as fair as biased emotional humans can make it and you think mr hailey will be treated as fairly here as he would be in new york im saying theres as much racism in new york as in mississippi look at our public schoolstheyre as desegregated as any by court order sure but what about the courts in new york for years you pious bastards pointed your fingers and noses at us down here and demanded that we desegregate it happened and it has not been the end of the world but youve conveniently ignored your own schools and neighborhoods your own voting irregularities your own allwhite juries and city councils we were wrong and weve paid dearly for it but we learned and although the change has been slow and painful at least were trying yall are still pointing fingers i didnt intend to refight gettysburg im sorry what defense will we use i do not know at this point honestly its just too early he hasnt even been indicted of course he will of course we dont know yet more than likely when will this be printed maybe sunday makes no difference no one here takes your paper yes he will be indicted mckittrick glanced at his watch and jake turned off his recorder look im not a bad guy mckittrick said lets drink a beer sometime and finish this off the record i dont drink but i accept your invitation the first presbyterian church of clanton was directly across the street from the first united methodist church of clanton and both churches were within sight of the much larger first baptist church the baptists had more members and money but the presbyterians and methodists adjourned earlier on sunday and outraced the baptists to the restaurants for sunday dinner the baptists would arrive at twelvethirty and stand in line while the presbyterians and methodists ate slowly and waved at them jake was content not to be a baptist they were a bit too narrow and strict and they were forever preaching about sunday night church a ritual jake had always struggled with carla was raised as a baptist jake a methodist and during the courtship a compromise was negotiated and they became presbyterians they were happy with their church and its activities and seldom missed on sunday they sat in their usual pew with hanna asleep between them and ignored the sermon jake ignored it by watching the preacher and picturing his confronting buckley in court before twelve good and lawful citizens as the nation watched and waited and carla ignored it by watching the preacher and mentally redecorating the dining room jake caught a few inquisitive stares during the worship service and he figured his fellow church members were somewhat awed to have a celebrity among them there were some strange faces in the congregation and they were either longlost repentant members or reporters jake was unsure until one persisted in staring at himthen he knew they were all reporters enjoyed your sermon reverend jake lied as he shook hands with the minister on the steps outside the sanctuary good to see you jake replied the reverend weve watched you all week on tv my kids get excited every time they see you thanks just pray for us they drove to karaway for sunday lunch with jakes parents gene and eva brigance lived in the old family house a sprawling country home on five acres of wooded land in downtown karaway three blocks from main street and two blocks from the school where jake and his sister put in twelve years both were retired but young enough to travel the continent in a mobile home each summer they would leave monday for canada and return after labor day jake was their only son an older daughter lived in new orleans sunday lunch on evas table was a typical southern feast of fried meats fresh garden vegetablesboiled battered baked and raw homemade rolls and biscuits two gravies watermelon cantaloupe peach cobbler lemon pie and strawberry shortcake little of it would be eaten and the leftovers would be neatly packaged by eva and carla and sent to clanton where it would last for a week how are your parents carla mr brigance asked as he passed the rolls theyre fine i talked to mother yesterday are they in knoxville no sir theyre already in wilmington for the summer will yall be going to visit them asked eva as she poured the tea from a onegallon ceramic pitcher carla glanced at jake who was dipping butterbeans onto hannas plate he did not want to discuss carl lee hailey every meal since monday night had centered around the case and jake was in no mood to answer the same questions yes maam we plan to it depends on jakes schedule it could be a busy summer so weve heard eva said flatly slowly as if to remind her son he had not called since the killings is something wrong with your phone son asked mr brigance yes weve had the number changed the four adults ate slowly apprehensively while hanna looked at the shortcake yes i know thats what the operator told us to an unlisted number sorry ive been very busy its been hectic so weve read said his father eva stopped eating and cleared her throat jake do you really think you can get him off im worried about your family said his father it could be a very dangerous case he shot them in cold blood eva said they raped his daughter mother what would you do if someone raped hanna whats rape asked hanna never mind dear carla said could we please change the subject she looked firmly at the three brigances and they started eating again the daughterinlaw had spoken with wisdom as usual jake smiled at his mother without looking at mr brigance i just dont want to talk about the case mother im tired of it i guess well have to read about it said mr brigance they talked about canada at about the time the brigances finished lunch the sanctuary of the mt zion chapel cme rocked and swayed as the right reverend ollie agee whipped the devotees into a glorified frenzy deacons danced elders chanted women fainted grown men screamed and raised their arms toward the heavens as the small children looked upward in holy terror choir members lurched and lunged and jerked then broke down and shrieked different stanzas of the same song the organist played one song the pianist another and the choir sang whatever came over it the reverend hopped around the pulpit in his long white robe with purple trim yelling praying screaming at god and perspiring the bedlam rose and fell rising it seemed with each new fainting and falling with fatigue through years of experience agee knew precisely when the fury reached its peak when the delirium gave way to weariness and when the flock needed a break at that precise moment he jigged to the pulpit and slapped it with the power of god almighty instantly the music died the convulsions ceased the fainters awoke the children stopped crying and the multitude settled submissively into the pews it was time for the sermon as the reverend was about to preach the rear doors opened and the haileys entered the sanctuary little tonya walked by herself limping holding her mothers hand her brothers marched behind and uncle lester followed they moved slowly down the aisle and found a seat near the front the reverend nodded at the organist who began to play softly then the choir began to hum and sway the deacons stood and swayed with the choir not to be outdone the elders stood and began to chant then of all things sister crystal fainted violently her fainting was contagious and the other sisters began dropping like flies the elders chanted louder than the choir so the choir got excited the organist could not be heard so she increased the volume the pianist joined in with a clanging rendition of a hymn unlike the hymn being played by the organist the organist thundered back reverend agee fluttered down from the podium and danced his way toward the haileys everyone followedthe choir the deacons the elders the women the crying childreneveryone followed the reverend to greet the little hailey girl jail did not bother carl lee home was more pleasant but under the circumstances he found jail life tolerable it was a new jail built with federal money under the mandate of a prisoners rights lawsuit the food was cooked by two huge black women who knew how to cook and write bad checks they were eligible for early release but ozzie had not bothered to tell them the food was served to forty prisoners give or take a few by the trusties thirteen of the prisoners belonged at parchman but it was full so they waited never knowing if the next day would be their day for the dreaded trip to the sprawling enclosed delta farm where the food was not as good the beds were not as soft the air conditioning was nonexistent the mosquitoes immense plentiful and vicious and where toilets were scarce and clogged carl lees cell was next to cell two where the state prisoners waited with two exceptions they were black and with no exceptions they were violent but they were all afraid of carl lee he shared cell one with two shoplifters who were not just scared but downright terrified of their famous cellmate each evening he was escorted to ozzies office where he and the sheriff ate dinner and watched the news he was a celebrity and he liked that almost as much as did his lawyer and the da he wanted to explain things to the reporters tell them about his daughter and why he should not be in jail but his lawyer said no after gwen and lester left late sunday afternoon ozzie moss junior and carl lee sneaked out the rear of the jail and went to the hospital it was carl lees idea and ozzie saw no harm looney was alone in a private room when the three entered carl lee took one look at the leg then stared at looney they shook hands with watery eyes and a breaking voice carl lee said he was sorry that he had no intention of hurting anyone but the two boys that he wished and prayed he could undo what he had done to looney without hesitation looney accepted the apology jake was waiting in ozzies office when they sneaked back into the jail ozzie and moss junior excused themselves leaving the defendant with his lawyer where have yall been jake asked suspiciously went to the hospital to see looney you what nothin wrong is it i wish you would check with me before you make any more visits whats wrong with seein looney looney will be the star witness for the state when they attempt to send you to the gas chamber thats all he aint on our side carl lee and any talking you do with looney should be with your attorney present understand not really i cant believe ozzie would do that jake mumbled it was my idea carl lee admitted well if you get any more ideas please let me know about them okay okay you talked to lester lately yeah him and gwen came by today brought me goodies told me bout the banks jake planned to play hardball about his fee no way he could represent carl lee for nine hundred dollars the case would consume his practice for the next three monms ai least and nine hundred would be less than minimum wage it would not be fair to him or his family to work for nothing carl lee would simply have to raise the money there were plenty of relatives gwen had a big family they would just have to sacrifice maybe sell a few automobiles maybe some land but jake would get his fee if not carl lee could find another lawyer ill give you the deed to my place carl lee offered jake melted i dont want your place carl lee i want cash sixtyfive hundred dollars show me how and ill do it you the lawyer you figure out a way im with you jake was beat and he knew it i cant do it for nine hundred dollars carl lee i cant let this case bankrupt me im a lawyer im supposed to make money jake ill pay you the money i promise it may take a long time but ill pay you trust me not if youre on death row thought jake he changed the subject you know the grand jury meets tomorrow and itll take up your case so i go to court naw it means youll be indicted tomorrow the courthouse will be full of people and reporters judge noose will be here to open the may term of court buckleyll be running around chasing cameras and blowing smoke its a big day noose starts an armed robbery trial in the afternoon if youre indicted tomorrow well be in court wednesday or thursday for the arraignment the what the arraignment in a capital murder case the judge is required by law to read the indictment to you in open court in front of god and everybody theyll make a big deal out of it well enter a plea of not guilty and noose sets the trial date we ask for a reasonable bond and he says no when i mention bond buckleyll scream and turn cartwheels the more i think of him the more i hate him hell be a large pain in the ass why dont i get a bond for capital murder the judge does not have to set a bond he can if he wants to but most dont even if noose set a bond you couldnt pay it so dont worry about it youll be in jail until trial i lost my job you know when gwen drove over friday and got my paycheck they told her nice aint it work there eleven years miss five days and they fire me guess they think i aint comin back im sorry to hear that carl lee real sorry the honorable omar noose had not always been so honorable before he became the circuit judge for the twentysecond judicial district he was a lawyer with meager talent and few clients but he was a politician of formidable skills five terms in the mississippi legislature had corrupted him and taught him the art of political swindling and manipulation senator noose prospered handsomely as chairman of the senate finance committee and few people in van buren county questioned how he and his family lived so affluently on his legislative salary of seven thousand dollars a year like most members of the mississippi legislature he ran for reelection one time too many and in the summer of he was humiliated by an unknown opponent a year later judge loopus his predecessor on the bench died and noose persuaded his friends in the legislature to persuade the governor to appoint him to serve the unexpired term thats how exstate senator noose became circuit judge noose he was elected in and reelected in and repentant reformed and very humbled by his rapid descent from power judge noose applied himself to the study of the law and after a shaky start grew to the job it paid sixty thousand a year so he could afford to be honest now at sixtythree he was a wise old judge well respected by most lawyers and by the state supreme court which seldom reversed his rulings he was quiet but charming patient but strict and he had a huge monument of a nose that was very long and very pointed and served as a throne for his blackrimmed octagonshaped reading glasses which he wore constantly but never used his nose plus his tall gawky frame plus his wild untamed dense gray hair plus his squeaky voice had given rise to his secret nickname whispered among lawyers of ichabod ichabod noose the honorable ichabod noose he assumed the bench and the crowded courtroom stood as ozzie mumbled incoherently a statutorily required paragraph to officially open the may term of the ford county circuit court a long flowery prayer was offered by a local minister and the congregation sat down prospective jurors filled one side of the courtroom criminals and other litigants their families and friends the press and the curious filled the other side noose required every lawyer in the county to attend the opening of the term and the members of the bar sat in the jury box all decked out in full regalia all looking important buckley and his assistant d r musgrove sat at the prosecutions table splendidly representing the state jake sat by himself in a wooden chair in front of the railing the clerks and court reporters stood behind the large red docket books on the workbench and with everyone elsewatched intently as ichabod situated himself in his chair upon the bench straightened his robe adjusted his hideous reading glasses and peered over them at the assemblage good morning he squeaked loudly he pulled the microphone closer and cleared his throat its always nice to be in ford county for the may term of court i see most members of the bar found time to appear for the opening of court and as usual i will request madam clerk to note those absent attorneys so that i may personally contact them i see a large number of potential jurors present and i thank each of you for being here i realize you had no choice but your presence is vital to our judicial process we will empanel a grand jury momentarily and then we will select several trial juries to serve this week and next i trust each member of the bar has a copy of the docket and you will note it looks somewhat crowded my calendar reveals at least two cases set for trial each day this week and next but its my understanding most of the criminal cases set for trial will go off on negotiated plea bargains nonetheless we have many cases to move and i request the diligent cooperation of the bar once the new grand jury is empaneled and goes to work and once the indictments start coming down i will schedule arraignments and first appearances lets quickly call the docket criminal first then civil then the attorneys may be excused as we select a grand jury state versus warren moke armed robbery set for trial this afternoon buckley rose slowly purposefully the state of missis sippi is ready for trial your honor he announced gloriously for the spectators sos the defense said tyndale the courtappointed lawyer how long do you anticipate for trial asked the judge day and a half answered buckley tyndale nodded in agreement good well select the trial jury this morning and start the trial at one pm today state versus william daal forgery six counts set for tomorrow your honor answered dr musgrove there will be a plea in that case good state versus roger hornton grand larceny two counts set for tomorrow noose continued through the docket each case drew the same response buckley would stand and proclaim the state ready for trial or musgrove would quietly inform the court that a plea had been negotiated the defense attorneys would stand and nod jake had no cases in the may term and although he tried his best to look bored he enjoyed the call of the docket because he could learn who had the cases and what the competition was doing it was also a chance to look good before some of the local folks half the members of the sullivan firm were present and they too looked bored as they sat arrogantly together in the front row of the jury box the older partners of the sullivan firm would not dare make an appearance at docket call and they would lie and tell noose they were in trial in federal court over in oxford or perhaps before the supreme court in jackson dignity prevented their mingling with the ordinary members of the bar so the firms younger lieutenants were sent to satisfy noose and request that all the firms civil cases be continued postponed delayed stalled or acted upon in such a way that the firm could drag them on forever and continue to bill by the hour their clients were insurance companies who generally preferred not to go to trial and would pay by the hour for legal maneuvering designed solely to keep the cases away from the juries it would be cheaper and fairer to pay a reasonable settlement and avoid both litigation and the parasitic defense firms like sullivan ohare but the insurance companies and their adjusters were too stupid and cheap so street lawyers like jake brigance earned their livelihoods suing insurance companies and forcing them to pay more than what they would have paid had they dealt fairly from the beginning jake hated insurance companies and he hated insurance defense attorneys and he especially hated the sullivan firms younger members all of whom were his age and all of whom would gladly cut his throat their associates throats their partners throats anyones throat to make partner and earn two hundred thousand a year and skip docket calls jake particularly hated lotterhouse or l winston lotterhouse as the letterhead proclaimed him a little foureyed wimp with a harvard degree and a bad case of haughty selfimportance who was next in line to make partner and thus had been especially indiscriminate with his throat cutting during the past year he sat smugly between two other sullivan associates and held seven files each of which was being charged a hundred dollars per hour while he answered the docket call noose began the civil docket collins versus royal consolidated general mutual insurance company lotterhouse stood slowly seconds meant minutes minutes meant hours hours meant fees retainers bonuses partnerships your honor sir that case is set prime for a week from wednesday i realize that noose said yes sir well sir im afraid i must ask for a continuance a conflict has developed in my trial calendar for that wednesday and i have a pretrial conference in federal court in memphis that the judge has refused to continue i regret this i filed a motion this morning asking for a continuance gardner the plaintiffs attorney was furious your honor that case has been set prime for two months it was set for trial in february and mr lotterhouse had a death in his wifes family it was set for trial last november and an uncle died it was set for trial last august and there was another funeral i guess we should be thankful that this time no one has died there were pockets of light laughter in the courtroom lotterhouse blushed enough is enough your honor gardner continued mr lotterhouse would prefer to postpone this trial forever the case is ripe for trial and my client is entitled to one we strenuously oppose any motion for a continuance lotterhouse smiled at the judge and removed his glasses your honor if i may respond no you may not mr lotterhouse interrupted noose no more continuances the case is set for trial next wednesday there will be no more delays hallelujah thought jake noose was generally soft on the sullivan firm jake smiled at lotterhouse two of jakes civil cases were continued to the august term when noose finished the civil docket he dismissed the attorneys and turned his attention to the pool of prospective jurors he explained the role of the grand jury its importance and procedure he distinguished it from the trial juries equally important but not as time consuming he began asking questions dozens of questions most of them required by law all dealing with ability to serve as jurors physical and moral fitness exemptions and age a few were useless but nonetheless required by some ancient statute are any of you common gamblers or habitual drunkards there were laughs but no volunteers those over sixtyfive were automatically excused at their option noose granted the usual exemptions for illnesses emergencies and hardships but he excused only a few of the many who requested pardons for economic reasons it was amusing to watch the jurors stand one at a time and meekly explain to the judge how a few days of jury duty would cause irreparable damage to the farm or the body shop or the pulpwood cutting noose took a hard line and delivered several lectures on civic responsibility to the flimsier excuses from the venire of ninety or so prospects eighteen would be selected for the grand jury and the rest would remain available for selection as trial jurors when noose completed his questioning the clerk drew eighteen names from a box and laid them on the bench before his honor who began calling names the jurors one by one rose and walked slowly toward the front of the courtroom through the gate in the railing and into the cushioned swivel rocking seats in the jury box there were fourteen such seats twelve for the jurors and two for the alternates when the box was rilled noose called four more who joined their colleagues in wooden chairs placed in front of the jury box stand and take the oath instructed noose as the clerk stood before them holding and reading from a little black book that contained all the oaths raise your right hands she directed do you solemnly swear or affirm that you will faithfully discharge your duties as grand jurors that you will fairly hear and decide all issues and matters brought before you so help you god a chorus of assorted i dos followed and the grand jury was seated of the five blacks two were women of the thirteen whites eight were women and most were rural jake recognized seven of the eighteen ladies and gentlemen noose began his usual speech you have been selected and duly sworn as grand jurors for ford county and you will serve in that capacity until the next grand jury is empaneled in august i want to stress that your duties will not be time consuming you will meet every day this week then several hours each month until september you have the responsibility of reviewing criminal cases listening to law enforcement officials and victims and determining whether or not reasonable grounds exist to believe the accused has committed the crime if so you issue an indictment which is a formal charge placed against the accused there are eighteen of you and when at least twelve believe a person should be indicted the indictment is issued or returned as we say you have considerable power by law you can investigate any criminal act any citizen suspected of wrongdoing any public official really anybody or anything that smells bad you may convene yourself whenever you choose but normally you meet whenever the district attorney mr buckley wants you you have the power to subpoena witnesses to testify before you and you may also subpoena their records your deliberations are extremely private with no one being present but yourselves the da and his staff and the witnesses the accused is not allowed to appear before you you are expressly forbidden to discuss anything that is said or transpires in the grand jury room mr buckley would you please stand thank you this is mr rufus buckley the district attorney hes from smithfield in polk county he will sort of act as your supervisor while you deliberate thank you mr buckley mr musgrove will you stand this is dr musgrove assistant district attorney also from smithfield he will assist mr buckley while you are in session thank you mr musgrove now these gentlemen represent the state of mississippi and they will present the cases to the grand jury one final matter the last grand jury in ford county was empaneled in february and the foreman was a white male therefore in keeping with tradition and following the wishes of the justice department i will appoint a black female as foreman of this grand jury lets see laverne gossett where are you mrs gossett there you are good i believe you are a schoolteacher correct good im sure youll be able to handle your new duties now its time for you to get to work i understand there are over fifty cases waiting on you i will ask that you follow mr buckley and mr musgrove down the hall to the small courtroom that we use for a grand jury room thank you and good luck buckley proudly marched his new grand jury out of the courtroom and down the hall he waved at reporters and had no commentsfor the time being in the small courtroom they seated themselves around two long folding tables a secretary rolled in boxes of files an ancient halfcrippled halfdeaf longretired deputy in a faded uniform took his position by the door the room was secure buckley had second thoughts excused himself and met with the reporters in the hall yes he said the hailey case would be presented that afternoon in fact he was calling a press conference for pm on the front steps of the courthouse and he would have the indictments at that time after lunch the chief of the karaway police department sat at one end of the long table and shuffled nervously through his files he avoided looking at the grand jurors who anxiously awaited their first case state your name barked the da chief nolan earnhart karaway city police how many cases do you have chief we have five from karaway lets hear the first one okay lets see all right the chief mumbled and stuttered as he flipped through his paperwork okay the first case is fedison bulow male black age twentyfive got caught redhanded in the rear of griffins feed store in karaway at two oclock in the mornin april silent alarm went off and we caught him in the store cash register had been broken into and some fertilizer was gone we found the cash and the goods in a car registered in his name parked behind the store he gave a threepage confession at the jail and ive got copies here buckley walked casually around the room smiling at everyone and you want this grand jury to indict fedison bulow on one count of breaking and entering a commercial building and one count of grand larceny buckley asked helpfully yes sir thats right now members of the grand jury you have the right to ask any questions this is your hearing any questions yes does he have a record asked mack loyd crowell an unemployed truck driver no replied the chief this is his first offense good question always ask that question because if they have prior records we may need to indict them as habitual criminals lectured buckley any more questions none good now at this point someone needs to make a motion that the grand jury return a true bill of indictment against fedison bulow silence the eighteen stared at the table and waited for someone else to make a motion buckley waited silence this is great he thought a soft grand jury a bunch of timid souls afraid to speak liberals why couldnt he have a bloodthirsty grand jury eager to make motions to indict everybody for everything mrs gossett would you like to make the first motion since youre the foreman i so move she said thank you said buckley now lets vote how many vote to indict fedison bulow on one count of breaking and entering a commercial building and one count of grand larceny raise your hands eighteen hands went up and buckley was relieved the chief presented the other four cases from karaway each involved defendants equally guilty as bulow and each received unanimous true bills buckley slowly taught the grand jury how to operate itself he made them feel important powerful and laden with the heavy burden of justice they became inquisitive does he have a record how much time does that carry when will he get out how many counts can we give him when will he be tried is he out of jail now with five indictments out of the way with five true bills and no dissension with the grand jury eager for the next case whatever it might be buckley decided the mood was ripe he opened the door and motioned for ozzie who was standing in the hall talking quietly with a deputy and watching the reporters present hailey first buckley whispered as the two met in the door ladies and gentlemen this is sheriff walls im sure most of you know him he has several cases to present whats first sheriff ozzie scrambled through his files lost whatever he was looking for and finally blurted carl lee hailey the jurors became quiet again buckley watched them closely to gauge their reactions most of them stared at the table again no one spoke while ozzie reviewed the file then excused himself to get another briefcase he had not planned to present the hailey case first buckley prided himself on reading jurors of watching their faces and knowing precisely their thoughts he watched the jury constantly during a trial always predicting to himself what each was thinking he would crossexamine a witness and never take his eyes off the jury he would sometimes stand and face the jury box and interrogate a witness and watch the faces react to the answers after hundreds of trials he was good at reading jurors and he knew instantly he was in trouble with hailey the five blacks grew tense and arrogant as if they welcomed the case and the inevitable argument the foreman mrs gossett looked particularly pious as ozzie mumbled to himself and flipped papers most of the whites looked noncommittal but mack loyd crowell a hardlooking middleaged rural type appeared as arrogant as the blacks crowell pushed back his chair and walked to the window which looked over the north side of the courtyard buckley could not read him precisely but he knew crowell was trouble sheriff how many witnesses do you have for the hailey case buckley asked somewhat nervously ozzie stopped shuffling paper and said well uh just me we can get another if we need one all right all right replied buckley just tell us about the case ozzie reared back crossed his legs and said shoot rufus everbody knows about this case been on tv for a week just give us the evidence the evidence okay one week ago today carl lee hailey male black age thirtyseven shot and killed one billy ray cobb and one pete willard and he shot a peace officer one dewayne looney whos still in the hospital with his leg cut off the weapon was an m machine gun illegal which we recovered and matched the fingerprints with those of mr hailey i have an affidavit signed by deputy looney and he states under oath that the man who did the shootin was carl lee hailey there was an eyewitness murphy the little crippled man that sweeps the courthouse and stutters real bad i can get him here if you want any questions interrupted buckley the da nervously watched the jurors who nervously watched the sheriff crowell stood with his back to the others looking through the window any questions buckley repeated yeah answered crowell as he turned and glared at the da then at ozzie those two boys he shot they raped his little girl didnt they sheriff were pretty sure they did answered ozzie well one confessed didnt he yep crowell walked slowly boldly arrogantly across the room and stood at the other end of the tables he looked down at ozzie you got kids sheriff yep you got a little girl yep suppose she got raped and you got your hands on the man who did it what would you do ozzie paused and looked anxiously at buckley whose neck had turned a deep red i dont have to answer that ozzie replied is that so you came before this grand jury to testify didnt you youre a witness aint you answer the question i dont know what id do come on sheriff give us a straight answer tell the truth what would you do ozzie felt embarrassed confused and angry at this stranger he would like to tell the truth and explain in detail how he would gladly castrate and mutilate and kill any pervert who touched his little girl but he couldnt the grand jury might agree and refuse to indict carl lee not that he wanted him indicted but he knew the indictment was necessary he looked sheepishly at buckley who was perspiring and seated now crowell zeroed in on the sheriff with the zeal and fervor of a lawyer who had just caught a witness in an obvious lie come on sheriff he taunted were all listenin tell the truth what would you do to the rapist tell us come on buckley was near panic the biggest case of his wonderful career was about to be lost not at trial but in the grand jury room in the first round at the hands of an unemployed truck driver he stood and struggled for words the witness does not have to answer crowell turned and shouted at buckley you sit down and shut up we dont take orders from you we can indict you if we want to cant we buckley sat and looked blankly at ozzie crowell was a ringer he was too smart to be on a grand jury someone must have paid him he knew too much yes the grand jury could indict anyone crowell retreated and returned to the window they watched him until it appeared he was finished are you absolutely sure he done it ozzie asked lemoyne frady an illegitimate distant cousin to gwen hailey yes were sure ozzie answered slowly with both eyes on crowell and you want us to indict him for what asked mr frady the admiration for the sheriff obvious two counts of capital murder and one count of assault on a peace officer how much time you talkin about asked barney flaggs another black capital murder carries the gas chamber assault on a deputy carries life with no parole and thats what you want ozzie asked flaggs yeah barney i say this grand jury should indict mr hailey i sure do any more questions interrupted buckley not so fast replied crowell as he turned from the window i think youre tryin to ram this case down our throats mr buckley and i resent it i wanna talk about it some you sit down and if we need you well ask you buckley glared fiercely and pointed his finger i dont have to sit and i dont have to stay quiet he yelled yes yes you do crowell answered coolly with a caustic grin because if you dont we can make you leave cant we mr buckley we can ask you to leave this room and if you refuse well go ask the judge hell make you leave wont he mr buckley rufus stood motionless speechless and stunned his stomach turned flips and his knees were spongy but he was frozen in place so if you would like to hear the rest of our deliberations sit down and shut up buckley sat next to the bailiff who was now awake thank you said crowell i wanna ask you folks a question how many of you would do or wanna do what mr hailey did if someone raped your daughter or maybe your wife or what about your motner now many i cut hands seven or eight hands shot up and buckley dropped his head crowell smiled and continued i admire him for what he did it took guts id hope id have the courage to do what he did cause lord knows id want to sometimes a mans just gotta do what hes gotta do this man deserves a trophy not an indictment crowell walked slowly around the tables enjoying the attention before you vote i want you to do one thing i want you to think about that poor little girl i think shes ten try to picture her layin there hands tied behind her cryin beggin for her daddy and think of those two outlaws drunk doped up takin turns rapin and beatin and kickin her hell they even tried to kill her think of your own daughter put her in the place of the little hailey girl now wouldnt you say they got pretty much what they deserved we should be thankful theyre dead i feel safer just knowin those two bastards are no longer here to rape and kill other children mr hailey has done us a great service lets dont indict him lets send him home to his family where he belongs hes a good man whos done a good thing crowell finished and returned to the window buckley watched him fearfully and when he was certain he was finished he stood sir are you finished there was no response good ladies and gentlemen of the grand jury i would like to explain a few things a grand jury is not supposed to try the case thats what a trial jury is for mr hailey will get a fair trial before twelve fair and impartial jurors and if hes innocent hell be acquitted but his guilt or innocence is not supposed to be determined by the grand jury youre supposed to decide after listening to the states version of the evidence if there is a strong possibility a crime has been committed now i submit to you that a crime has been committed by carl lee hailey three crimes actually he killed two men and he wounded another we have eyewitnesses buckley was warming as he circled the tables the confidence was back the duty of this grand jury is to indict him and if he has a valid defense hell have a chance to present it at trial if he has a legal reason for doing what he did let him prove it at trial thats what trials are for the state charges him with a crime and the state must prove at trial he committed the crime if he has a defense and if he can convince the trial jury he will be acquitted i assure you good for him but its not the duty of this grand jury to decide today that mr hailey should go free therell be another day for that right sheriff ozzie nodded and said thats right the grand jury is to indict if the evidence is presented the trial jury will not convict him if the state cant prove its case or if he puts a good defense but the grand jury dont worry bout things like that anything further from the grand jury buckley asked anxiously okay we need a motion i make a motion we dont indict him for anything yelled crowell second mumbled barney flaggs buckleys knees quivered he tried to speak but nothing came forth ozzie suppressed his joy we have a motion and a second announced mrs gossett all in favor raise your hands five black hands went up along with crowells sk votes the motion failed whatta we do now asked mrs gossett buckley spoke rapidly someone make a motion to indict mr hailey for two counts of capital murder and one count of assault on a peace officer so move said one of the whites second said another all in favor raise your hands said mrs gossett i count twelve hands all opposedi count five plus mine makes six twelve to six what does that mean that means hes been indicted buckley replied proudly he breathed normally again and the color returned to his face he whispered to a secretary then addressed the grand jury lets take a tenminute recess we have about forty more cases to work on so please dont be gone long i would like to remind you of something judge noose said this morning these deliberations are extremely confidential you are not to discuss any your work ouisiue room what hes tryin to say interrupted crowell is that we cant tell anybody that he came within one vote of not gettin the indictments aint that right buckley the da quickly left the room and slammed the door surrounded by dozens of cameras and reporters buckley stood on the front steps of the courthouse and waved copies of the indictments he preached lectured moralized praised the grand jury sermonized against crime and vigilantes and condemned carl leehailey bring on the trial put the jury in the box he guaranteed a conviction he guaranteed a death penalty he was obnoxious offensive arrogant selfrighteous he was himself vintage buckley a few of the reporters left but he labored on he extolled himself and his trial skills and his ninety no ninetyfive percent conviction rate more reporters left more cameras were turned off he praised judge noose for his wisdom and fairness he acclaimed the intelligence and good judgment of ford county jurors he outlasted them they grew weary of him and they all left stump sisson was the klans imperial wizard for mississippi and he had called the meeting at the small cabin deep in the pine forests of nettles county two hundred and thirty miles south of ford county there were no robes rituals or speeches the small group of klansmen discussed the events in ford county with a mr freddie cobb brother of billy ray cobb deceased freddie had called a friend who called stump to arrange the meeting had they indicted the nigger cobb was not sure but he had heard the trial would be in late summer or early fall what concerned him most was all the talk about the nigger pleading insanity and getting off it wasnt right the nigger killed his brother in cold blood planned the shooting he hid in a closet and waited for his brother it was coldblooded murder and now there was talk of the nigger walking free what could the klan do about it the niggers have plenty of protection nowadaysthe naacp aclu a thousand other civil rights groups plus the courts and the government hell white folks aint got a chance except for the klan who else would march and stand up for white people all the laws favor the niggers and the liberal niggerloving politicians keep making more laws against white people somebodys got to stand up for them thats why he called the klan is the nigger in jail yes and hes treated like a king got a nigger sheriff up there walls and he likes this nigger gives him special privileges and extra protection the sheriffs another story someone said hailey might get out of jail this week on bond just a rumor they hoped he got out what about your brother did he rape her were not sure probably not willard the other guy confessed to rape but billy ray never confessed he had plenty of women why would he rape a little nigger girl and if he did what was the big deal whos the niggers lawyer brigance a local boy in clanton young but pretty good does a lot of criminal work and has a good reputation won several minuet told some reporters the nigger would plead insanity and get off whos the judge dont know yet bullard was the county judge but someone said he would not hear the case theres talk of moving the case to another county so who knows who will be the judge sisson and the kluxers listened intently to this ignorant redneck they liked the part about the naacp and the government and the politicians but they had also read the papers and watched tv and they knew his brother had received justice but at the hands of a nigger it was unthinkable the case had real potential with the trial several months away there was time to plan a rebellion they could march during the day around the courthouse in their white robes and pointed hooded masks they could make speeches to a captive audience and parade in front of the cameras the press would love ithate them but love the altercations the disruptions and at night they could intimidate with burning crosses and threatening phone calls the targets would be easy and unsuspecting violence would be unavoidable they knew how to provoke it they fully appreciated what the sight of marching white robes did to crowds of angry niggers ford county could be their playground for hide and seek search and destroy and hit and run they had time to organize and call in comrades from other states what kluxer would miss this golden moment and new recruits why this case could fuel the fires of racism and bring nigger haters out of the woods and onto the streets membership was down hailey would be their new battle cry the rallying point mr cobb can you get us the names and addresses of the nigger his family his lawyer the judge and the jurors asked sisson cobb pondered this task everbody but the jurors they aint been picked yet when will you know them damned if i know i guess at trial whatre yall thinkin were not sure but the klan most likely will get involved we need to flex our muscle a bit and this could be a good opportunity can i help cobb asked eagerly sure but you need to be a member we aint got no klan up there it folded a long time ago my granddaddy used to be a member you mean the grandfather of the victim was a klansman yep cobb answered proudly well then we must get involved the klansmen shook their heads in disbelief and vowed revenge they explained to cobb that if he could get five or six friends of similar thinking and motivation to agree to join they would have a big secret ceremony deep in the woods of ford county with a huge burning cross and all sorts of ritualsthey would be inducted as members fullfledged members of the ku klux klan ford county klavern and they would all join in and make a spectacle of the trial of carl lee hailey they would raise so much hell in ford county this summer that no juror with any common sense would consider voting to acquit the nigger just recruit half a dozen more and they would make him the leader of the ford county klavern cobb said he had enough cousins to start a klavern he left the meeting drunk with excitement of being a klansman just like his grandfather buckleys timing was a little off his pm press show was ignored by the evening news jake flipped the channels on a small black and white in his office and laughed out loud when the networks and then memphis then jackson then tupelo signed off with no news of the indictments he could see the buckley family in their den glued to the set turning knobs and searching desperately for their hero while he yelled at them all to be quiet and then at seven after the tupelo weather the last weather they backed away and left him alone in his recliner maybe at ten he probably said at ten jake and carla laid crosslegged and tangled in the dark on the sofa waiting on the news finally there he was on trie iront steps waving papcis anu u street preacher while the channel man on the scene explained that this was rufus buckley the da who would prosecute carl lee hailey now that he had been indicted after an awful glimpse of buckley the report panned around the square for a wonderful view of downtown clanton and then finally back to the reporter for two sentences about a trial in late summer hes offensive carla said why would he call a press conference to announce the indictments hes a prosecutor we defense lawyers hate the press ive noticed my scrapbook is rapidly filling up be sure and make copies for mom will you autograph it for her only for a fee yours i will autograph for free fine and if you lose ill send you a bill for clipping and pasting i remind you dear that i have never lost a murder case three and oh as a matter of fact carla punched the remote control and the weatherman remained but his volume disappeared you know what i dislike most about your murder trials she kicked the cushions from her thin bronze almost perfect legs the blood the carnage the gruesomeness no she unfolded her shoulderlength hair and let it fall around her on the arm of the sofa the loss of life regardless of how insignificant no she was wearing one of his old starchedout sixteenbythirtyfour pinpoint oxford buttondowns and she began to play with the buttons the horrible specter of an innocent man facing the gas chamber no she was unbuttoning it the bluish gray rays from the television flashed like a strobe in the dark room as the artchorperson smiled and mouthed good night the fear of a young family as the father walks into the courtroom and faces a jury of his peers no it was unbuttoned and under it a thin fluorescent band of white silk glittered against the brown skin the latent unfairness of our judicial system no she slid an almost perfect bronze leg up up up to the back of the sofa where it gently came to rest the unethical and unscrupulous tactics employed by cops and prosecutors to nail innocent defendants no she unsnapped the band of silk between the two almost perfect breasts the fervor the fury the intensity the uncontrolled emotions the struggle of the human spirit the unbridled passion close enough she said shirts and shorts ricocheted off the lamps and coffee tables as the bodies meshed deep under the cushions the old sofa a gift from her parents rocked and squeaked on the ancient hardwood floor it was sturdy and accustomed to the rocking and squeaking max the mixbreed instinctively ran down the hall to stand guard by hannas door harry rex vonner was a huge slob of a lawyer who specialized in nasty divorce cases and perpetually kept some jerk in jail for back child support he was vile and vicious and his services were in great demand by divorcing parties in ford county he could get the children the house the farm the vcr and microwave everything one wealthy farmer kept him on retainer just so the current wife couldnt hire him for the next divorce harry rex sent his criminal cases to jake and jake sent his nasty divorces to harry rex they were friends and disliked the other lawyers especially the sullivan firm tuesday morning he barged in and growled at ethel jake in he lumbered toward the stairs glaring at her and daring her to speak she nodded knowing better than to ask if he was expected he had cursed her before he had cursed everybody before the stairway shook as he thundered upward he was gasping for air as he entered the big office morning harry rex you gonna make it why dont you get an office downstairs he demanded between breaths you need the exercise if it werent for those stairs your weight would be over three hundred thanks say i just came from the courtroom noose wants you in chambers at tenthirty if possible wants to talk about hailey with you and buckley set up arraignment trial date all that crap he asked me to tell you good ill be there i guess you heard about the grand jury sure ive got a copy of the indictment right here harry rex smiled no no i mean the vote on the indictment jake froze and looked at him curiously harry rex moved in silent and dark circles like a cloud over the county he was an endless source of gossip and rumor and took great pride in spreading only the truthmost of the time he was the first to know almost everything the legend of harry rex began twenty years earlier with his first jury trial the railroad he had sued for millions refused to offer a dime and after three days of trial the jury retired to deliberate the railroad lawyers became concerned when the jury failed to return with a quick verdict in their favor they offered harry rex twentyfive thousand to settle when the deliberations went into the second day with nerves of steel he told them to go to hell his client wanted the money he told his client to go to hell hours later a weary and fatigued jury returned with a verdict for one hundred fifty thousand harry rex shot the bird at the railroad lawyers snubbed his clients and went to the bar at the best western he bought drinks for everyone and during the course of the long evening explained in detail exactly how he had wired the jury room and knew exactly what the jury was up to word spread and murphy found a series of wires running through the heating ducts to the jury room the state bar association snooped around but found nothing for twenty years the judges had ordered the bailiffs to inspect the jury room when harry rex was in any way connected with a case how do you know the vote jake asked suspicion hanging on every syllable i got sources okay what was the vote twelve to six one fewer vote and you wouldnt be holding that indictment twelve to six jake repeated buckley near bout died a guy named crowell white guy took charge and almost convinced enough of them not to indict your man do you know crowell i handled his divorce two years ago he lived in jackson until his first wife was raped by a nigger she went crazy and they got a divorce she took a steak knife and sliced her wrists then he moved to clanton and married some sleazebag out in the county lasted about a year he ate buckleys lunch told him to shut up and sit down i wish i couldve seen it sounds like you did naw just got a good source who jake come on you been wiring rooms again nope i just listen thats a good sign aint it what the close vote six outta eighteen voted to let him walk five niggers and crowell thats a good sign just get a couple of niggers on the jury and hang it right its not that easy if its tried in this county theres a good chance well have an allwhite jury theyre common here and as you know theyre still very constitutional plus this guy crowell sounds like he came outta nowhere thats what buckley thought you should see that ass hes in the courtroom strutting around ready to sign autographs over his big tv splash last night no one wants to talk about it so he manages to work it into every conversation hes like a kid begging for attention be sweet he may be your next governor not if he loses hailey and hes gonna lose hailey jake well pick us a good jury twelve good and faithful citizens then well buy them i didnt hear that works every time a few minutes after tenthirty jake entered the judges chamber behind the courtroom and coolly shook hands with buckley musgrove and ichabod they had been waiting on him noose waved him toward a seat and sat behind the desk jake this will take just a few minutes he peered down that nose i would like to arraign carl lee hailey in the morning at nine any problems with that no thatll be fine replied jake well have some other arraignments in the morning then we start a burglary case at ten right rufus yes sir okay now lets discuss a trial date for mr hailey as you know the next term of court here is in late august third mondayand im sure the docket will be just as crowded then because of the nature of this case and frankly because of the publicity i think it would be best if we had a trial as soon as practical the sooner the better inserted buckley jake how long will you need to prepare for trial sixty days sixty days buckley repeated in disbelief why so long jake ignored him and watched ichabod adjust his reading glasses and study his calendar would it be safe to anticipate a request for a change of venue he asked yes wont make any difference buckley said well get a conviction anywhere save it for the cameras rufus jake said quietly you shouldnt talk about cameras buckley shot back you seem to enjoy them yourself gentlemen please noose said what other pretrial motions can we expect from the defense jake thought for a moment there will be others may i inquire about the others asked noose with a hint of irritation judge i really dont care to discuss my defense at this time we just received the indictment and i havent discussed it with my client we obviously have some work to do how much time do you need sixty days are you kidding buckley shouted is this a joke the state could try it tomorrow judge sixty days is ridiculous jake began to burn but said nothing buckley walked to the window and mumbled to himself in disbelief noose studied his calendar why sixty days it could be a complicated case buckley laughed and continued shaking his head then we can expect a defense of insanity asked the judge yes sir and it will take time to have mr hailey examined by a psychiatrist then the state will of course want him examined by its doctors i see and we may have other pretnal matters s a oig case and i want to make sure we have time to adequately prepare mr buckley said the judge whatever it makes no difference to the state well be ready we could try it tomorrow noose scribbled on his calendar and adjusted his reading glasses which were perched on the tip of that nose and held in place by a tiny wart located perfectly at the foot of the beak due to the size of the nose and the odd shape of the head specially built reading glasses with extra long stems were required for his honor who never used them for reading or any other purpose except in a vain effort to distract from the size and shape of the nose jake had always suspected this but lacked the courage to inform his honor that the ridiculous orangetinted hexagonal glasses diverted attention from everything else directly to the nose how long do you anticipate for trial jake noose asked three or four days but it could take three days to pick the jury mr buckley sounds about right but i dont understand why it takes sixty days to prepare for a threeday trial i think it should be tried sooner relax rufus jake said calmly the cameras will be here in sixty days even ninety days they wont forget about you you can give interviews hold press conferences preach sermons everything the works but dont worry so much youll get your chance buckleys eyes narrowed and his face reddened he took three steps in jakes direction if im not mistaken mr brigance youve given more interviews and seen more cameras than i have during the past week i know and youre jealous arent you no im not jealous i dont care about the cameras since when gentlemen please noose interrupted this promises to be a long emotional case i expect my attorneys to act like professionals now my calendar is congested the only opening i have is the week of july does that present a problem we can try it that week said musgrove jake smiled at buckley and flipped through his pocket calendar looks good to me fine all motions must be filed and pretrial matters disposed of by monday july arraignment is set for tomorrow at nine any questions jake stood and shook hands with noose and musgrove and left after lunch he visited his famous client in ozzies office at the jail a copy of the indictment had been served on carl lee in his cell he had some questions for his lawyer whats capital murder the worst kind how many kinds are there basically three manslaughter regular murder and capital murder whats manslaughter twenty years whats regular murder twenty to life whats capital murder gas chamber whats aggravated assault on an officer life no parole carl lee studied the indictment carefully you mean i got two gas chambers and a life sentence not yet youre entitled to a trial first which by the way has been set for july thats two months away why so long we need the time itll take that long to find a psychiatrist wholl say you were crazy then buckley gets to send you to whitfield to be examined by the states doctors and theyll all say you were not crazy at the time we file motions buckley files motions we have a bunch of hearings it takes time no way to have it sooner we dont want it sooner what if i do carl lee snapped jake studied him carefully whats the matter dig man i gotta get outta here and fast i thought you said jail wasnt so bad it aint but i need to get home gwens outta money cant find a job lesters in trouble with his wife shes callin all the time so he wont last much longer i hate to ask my folk for help but they will wont they some they got their own problems you gotta get me outta here jake look youll be arraigned in the morning at nine the trial is july and the date wont be changed so forget about that have i explained the arraignment to you carl lee shook his head it wont last twenty minutes we appear before judge noose in the big courtroom hell ask you some questions then ask me some questions hell read the indictment to you in open court and ask if youve received a copy then hell ask you to plead guilty or not guilty when you answer not guilty hell set the trial date youll sit down and me and buckley will get into a big fight over your bond noose will refuse to set a bond then theyll bring you back to the jail where youll stay until the trial what about after the trial jake smiled naw you wont be in jail after the trial you promise nope no promises any questions about tomorrow no say jake uh how much money did i pay you jake hesitated and smelled trouble why do you ask just thinkin nine hundred plus a note gwen had less than a hundred dollars bills were due and food was low she had visited on sunday and cried for an hour panic was a part of her life her makeup her composition but he knew they were broke and she was scared her family would be of little help maybe some vegetables from the garden and a few bucks for milk and eggs when it came to funerals and hospital stays they were very dependable they were generous and gave of their time freely to wail and moan and put on a show but when real money was needed they scattered like chickens he had little use for her family and his wasnt much better he wanted to ask jake for a hundred dollars but decided to wait until gwen was completely broke it would be easier then jake flipped through his legal pad and waited for carl lee to ask for money criminal clients especially the blacks always asked for some of the fee back after it was paid he doubted he would ever see more than nine hundred dollars and he was not about to return any besides the blacks always took care of their own the families would be there and the churches would get involved no one would starve he waited and placed the legal pad and file in his briefcase any questions carl lee yeah what can i say tomorrow what do you want to say i wanna tell that judge why i shot them boys they raped my daughter they needed shootin and you want to explain that to the judge tomorrow yeah and you think hell turn you loose once you explain it all carl lee said nothing look carl lee you hired me to be your lawyer and you hired me because you have confidence in me right and if i want you to say something tomorrow ill tell you if i dont you stay quiet when you go to trial in july youll have the chance to tell your side but in the meantime ill do the talking you got that right lester and gwen piled the boys and tonya in the red cadillac and drove to the doctors building next to the hospital the rape was two weeks in the past tbnya walked with a slight limp and wanted to run and climb steps with her brothers but her mother held her hand the soreness in her legs and buttocks was almost gone the bandages on her wrists and ankles had been removed by the doctor last week and the cuts were healing nicely the gauze and cotton between her legs remained in a small room she unaressea anu sat hcai mother on a padded table her mother hugged her and helped her stay warm the doctor poked in her mouth and rubbed her jaw he held her wrists and ankles and inspected them he laid her on the table and touched between her legs she cried and clutched her mother who leaned over her she was hurting again at five wednesday morning jake sipped coffee in his office and stared through the french doors across the dark courtyard square he had slept fitfully and several hours earlier had given up and left his warm bed in a desperate effort to find a nameless georgia case that as he thought he remembered from law school required the judge to allow bail in a capital murder case if the defendant had no prior criminal record owned property in the county had a stable job and had plenty of relatives nearby it had not been found he did find a battery of recent wellreasoned clear and unambiguous mississippi cases allowing the judge complete discretion in denying bail to such defendants that was the law and jake now knew it well but he needed something to argue to ichabod he dreaded asking bail for carl lee buckley would scream and preach and cite those wonderful cases and noose would smile and listen then deny bail jake would get his tail kicked in the first skirmish youre here early this morning sweetheart dell said to her favorite customer as she poured his coffee at least im here he had missed a few mornings since the amputation looney was popular and there was resentment at the coffee shop and around town for haileys lawyer he was aware of it and tried to ignore it there was resentment among many for any lawyer who would defend a nigger for killing two white men you got a minute jake asked sure dell said looking around at fivefifteen the cafe was not yet full she sat across from jake in a small booth and poured coffee whats the talk in here he asked the usual politics fishing farming it never changes ive been here for twentyone years serving the same food to the same people and theyre still talking about the same things nothing new hailey we get a lotta talk about tnat except wiicn me strangers are here then it goes back to the usual why because if you act like you know anything about the case some reporter will follow you outside with a bunch of questions that bad huh no its great business has never been better jake smiled and buttered his grits then added tabasco how do you feel about the case dell scratched her nose with long red fake fingernails and blew into her coffee she was famous for her bluntness and he was hoping for a straight answer hes guilty he killed them its cut and dried but he had the best damned excuse ive ever seen theres some sympathy for him lets say youre on the jury guilty or innocent she watched the front door and waved at a regular well my instinct is to forgive anyone who kills a rapist especially a father but on the other hand we cant allow people to grab guns and hand out their own justice can you prove he was crazy when he did it lets assume i can then i would vote not guilty even though i dont think he was crazy he smeared strawberry preserves on dry toast and nodded his approval but what about looney she asked hes a friend of mine it was an accident is that good enough no no its not the gun did not go off by accident looney was accidentally shot but i doubt if thats a valid defense would you convict him for shooting looney maybe she answered slowly he lost a leg how could he be insane when he shot cobb and willard and not when he shot looney jake thought but didnt ask he changed the subject whats the gossip on me about the same someone was asking where you were the other day and said you dont have time for us now that youre a celebrity ive heard some mumbling about you and the nigger but its pretty quiet they dont criticize you loudly i wont let them youre a sweetheart im a mean bitch and you know it no you just try to be yeah watch this she jumped from the booth and shouted abuse at a table of farmers who had motioned for more coffee jake finished alone and returned to the office when ethel arrived at eightthirty two reporters were loitering on the sidewalk outside the locked door they followed ethel inside and demanded to see mr brigance she refused and asked them to leave they refused and repeated their demand jake heard the commotion downstairs and locked his door let ethel fight with them from his office he watched a camera crew set up by the rear door of the courthouse he smiled and felt a wonderful surge of adrenaline he could see himself on the evening news walking briskly stern businesslike across the street followed by reporters begging for dialogue but getting no comments and this was just the arraignment imagine the trial cameras everywhere reporters yelling questions front page stories perhaps magazine covers an atlanta paper had called it the most sensational murder in the south in twenty years he would have taken the case for free almost moments later he interrupted the argument downstairs and warmly greeted the reporters ethel disappeared into the conference room could you answer some questions one of them asked no jake answered politely i have to meet with judge noose just a couple of questions no but there will be a press conference at three pm jake opened the door and the reporters followed him onto the sidewalk wheres the press conference in my office whats the purpose to discuss the case jake walked slowly across the street and up the short driveway to the courthouse answering questions along me way will mr hailey be at the press conference yes along with his family the girl too yes she will be there will mr hailey answer questions maybe i havent decided jake said good day and disappeared into the courthouse leaving the reporters to chat and gossip about the press conference buckley entered the courthouse through the huge wooden front doors amid no fanfare he had hoped for a camera or two but was dismayed to learn they were gathering at the rear door to catch a glimpse of the defendant he would use the rear door in the future judge noose parked by a fire hydrant in front of the post office and loped along the east sidewalk across the courtyard square and into the courthouse he too attracted no attention except for a few curious stares ozzie peered through the front windows of the jail and watched the mob waiting for carl lee in the parking lot the ploy of another end run crossed his mind but he dismissed it his office had received two dozen death threats on carl lee and ozzie took a few seriously they were specific with dates and places but most were just general everyday death threats and this was just the arraignment he thought of the trial and mumbled something to moss junior they surrounded carl lee with uniformed bodies and marched him down the sidewalk past the press and into a rented step van six deputies and a driver piled in escorted by ozzies three newest patrol cars the van drove quickly to the courthouse noose had scheduled a dozen arraignments for am and when he settled into the chair on the bench he shifted through the files until he found haileys he looked to the front row in the courtroom and saw a somber group of suspiciouslooking men all newly indicted at the far end of the front row two deputies sat next to a handcuffed defendant and brigance was whispering to him must be hailey noose picked up a red court file and adjusted his read ing glasses so they would not hinder his reading state versus carl lee hailey case number will mr hailey come forward the handcuffs were removed and carl lee followed his attorney to the bench where they stood looking up to his honor who quietly and nervously scanned the indictment in the file the courtroom grew silent buckley rose and strutted slowly to within a few feet of the defendant the artists near the railing busily sketched the scene jake glared at buckley who had no reason to stand before the bench during the arraignment the da was dressed in his finest black threepiece polyester suit every hair on his huge head had been meticulously combed and plastered in place he had the appearance of a television evangelist jake walked to buckley and whispered thats a nice suit rufus thanks he replied somewhat offguard does it glow in the dark jake asked then returned to the side of his client are you carl lee hailey asked the judge yes mr brigance your attorney yes im holding here a copy of an indictment returned against you by the grand jury have you been served a copy of this yes have you read it yes have you discussed it with your attorney yes do you understand it yes good im required by law to read it to you in open court noose cleared his throat the grand jurors of the state of mississippi taken from the body of good and lawful citizens of ford county thereof duly elected empaneled sworn and charged to inquire in and for said county and state aforesaid in the name and under the authority of the state of mississippi upon their oaths present that carl lee hailey late of the county and state aloresaia wimm me jurisdiction of this court did unlawfully willfully and feloniously and intentionally and with malice aforethought kill and murder billy ray cobb a human being and pete willard a human being and did shoot and attempt to kill dewayne looney a peace officer in direct violation of the mississippi code and against the peace and dignity of the state of mississippi a true bill signed laverne gossett foreman of the grand jury noose caught his breath do you understand the charges against you yes do you understand that if convicted you could be put to death in the gas chamber at the state penitentiary at parchman yes do you wish to plead guilty or not guilty not guilty noose reviewed his calendar as the audience watched intently the reporters took notes the artists focusedon the principals including buckley who had managed to enter the picture and stand sideways allowing for a profile shot he was anxious to say something he scowled contemptuously at the rear of carl lees head as if he could not wait to fry this murderer he swaggered to the table where musgrove was sitting and the two whispered importantly he marched across the courtroom and engaged in hushed conversation with one of the clerks then he returned to the bench where the defendant stood motionless next to his attorney who was aware of buckleys show and was trying desperately to ignore it mr hailey noose squeaked your trial is set for monday july all pretrial motions and matters must be filed by june and disposed of by july carl lee and jake nodded anything further yes your honor buckley boomed loud enough for the reporters in the rotunda the state opposes any request for bail by this defendant jake gripped his fists and wanted to scream your honor the defendant has not yet asked for bail mr buck ley as usual is confused about the procedure he cannot oppose a request until it is made he shouldve learned that in law school buckley was stung but continued your honor mr brigance always requests bail and im sure hell request it today the state will oppose any such request well why dont you wait until he makes his request noose asked the da with a touch of irritation very well buckley said his face had reddened and he glared at jake do you plan to request bail noose asked i had planned to at the proper time but before i got a chance mr buckley intervened with his theatrics never mind mr buckley noose interrupted i know judge hes just confused bail mr brigance yes i had planned to request it i thought so and ive already considered whether bail should be allowed in this case as you know it is completely within my discretion and i never allow bail in a capital murder case i dont feel as though an exception is in order in this case you mean youve decided to deny bail yes jake shrugged his shoulders and laid a file on the table good enough anything further noose asked no your honor jake said buckley shook his head in silence good mr hailey you are hereby ordered to remain in the custody of the ford county sheriff until trial you are dismissed carl lee returned to the front row where a deputy waited with the handcuffs jake opened his briefcase and was stuffing it with files and papers when buckley grabbed his arm that was a cheap shot brigance he said through clenched teeth you asked for it jake replied let go of my arm buckley released his arm i dont appreciate it too bad big man you shouldnt talk so mucn big mouths get burned buckley had three inches and fifty pounds on jake and his irritation was growing the exchange had drawn attention and a deputy moved between them jake winked at buckley and left the courtroom at two the hailey clan led by uncle lester entered jakes office through the rear door jake met them in a small office next to the conference room downstairs they talked about the press conference twenty minutes later ozzie and carl lee strolled nonchalantly through the rear door and jake led them to the office where carl lee was reunited with his family ozzie and jake left the room the press conference was carefully orchestrated by jake who marveled at his ability to manipulate the press and its willingness to be manipulated on one side of the long conference table he sat with the three hailey boys standing behind him gwen was seated to his left carl lee to his right holding tonya legal etiquette forbade revealing the identity of a child rape victim but tonya was different her name face and age were well known because of her daddy she had already been exposed to the world and jake wanted her to be seen and photographed in her best white sunday dress sitting on her daddys knee the jurors whoever they were and wherever they lived would be watching reporters crammed into the room which overflowed and trailed down the hall to the reception area where ethel rudely ordered them to sit and leave her alone a deputy guarded the front door and two others sat on the rear steps sheriff walls and lester stood awkwardly behind the haileys and their lawyer microphones were clustered on the table in front of jake and the cameras clicked and flashed under the warm television lights i have a few prefatory remarks jake began first all questions will be answered by me no questions are to be directed to mr hailey or any member of his family if he is asked a question i will instruct him not to answer second i would like to introduce his family to my left is his wife gwen hailey standing behind us are his sons carl lee jr jarvis and robert behind the boys is mr haileys brother lester hailey jake paused and smiled at tonya sitting in her daddys lap is tonya hailey now ill answer questions what happened in court this morning mr hailey was arraigned he pled not guilty and his trial was set for july was there an altercation between you and the district attorney yes after the arraignment mr buckley approached me grabbed my arm and looked as if he planned to assault me when a deputy intervened what caused it mr buckley has a tendency to crack under pressure are you and mr buckley friends no will the trial be in clanton a motion to change venue will be filed by the defense the location of the trial will be determined by judge noose no predictions could you describe what this has done to the hailey family jake thought a minute while the cameras rolled he glanced at carl lee and tonya youre looking at a very nice family two weeks ago life was good and simple there was a job at the paper mill a little money in the bank security stability church every sunday together a loving family then for reasons known only to god two drunk drugged punks committed a horrible violent act against this little tenyearold girl they shocked us and made us all feel sick they ruined her life and the lives of her parents and family it was too much for her father he snapped he broke now hes in jail facing trial and the prospect of the gas chamber the job is gone the money is gone the innocence is gone the children face the possibility of growing up without their father their mother must now find a job to support them and shell have to beg and borrow from friends and relatives in order to survive to answer your question sir the family has been devastated and destroyed gwen began crying quietly and jake handed ner a handkerchief are you hinting at a defense of insanity yes will there in fact be a plea of insanity yes can you prove it that will be left for the jury we will provide them experts in the field of psychiatry have you already consulted with these experts yes lied jake could you give us their names no that would be inappropriate at this point weve heard rumors of death threats against mr hailey could you confirm there continue to be threats against mr hailey his family my family the sheriff the judge just about everyone involved i dont know how serious they are carl lee patted tonya on the leg and looked blankly at the table he looked scared pitiful and in need of sympathy his boys looked scared too but according to strict orders they stood at attention afraid to move carl lee jr the oldest at fifteen stood behind jake jarvis the middle son at thirteen stood behind his daddy and robert age eleven stood behind his mother they wore identical navy suits with white shirts and little red bow ties roberts suit was once carl lee jrs then jarviss and now his and it looked a bit more worn than the other two but it was clean neatly pressed and perfectly cuffed the boys looked sharp how could any juror vote to force these children to live without their father the press conference was a hit segments of it ran on the networks and local stations both on the evening and late news the thursday papers ran front page pictures of the haileys and their lawyer the swede had called several times during the two weeks her husband had been in mississippi she didnt trust him down there there were old girlfriends he had confessed to each time she called lester was not around and gwen lied and explained that he was fishing or cutting pulpwood so they could buy groceries gwen was tired of lying and lester was tired of carousing and they were tired of each other when the phone rang before dawn friday morning lester answered it it was the swede two hours later the red cadillac was parked at the jail moss junior led lester into carl lees cell the brothers whispered above the sleep of the inmates gotta go home lester mumbled somewhat ashamed somewhat timid why carl lee asked as if he had been expecting it my wife called this mornin i gotta be at work tomorrow or im fired carl lee nodded approvingly im sorry bubba i feel bad about goin but i aint got no choice i understand when you comin back when you want me back for the trial itll be real hard on gwen and the kids can you be back then you know ill be here i got some vacation time and all ill be here they sat on the edge of carl lees bunk and watched each other in silence the cell was dark and quiet the two bunks opposite carl lees were empty man i forgot how bad this place is lester said i just hope i aint here much longer they stood and embraced and lester called for moss junior to open the cell im proud of you bubba he said to his older brother then left for chicago aii jjcc a acwvjiiu vimixu ui me illuming wao ilia aliuilicy who met him in ozzies office jake was red eyed and irritable carl lee i talked to two psychiatrists in memphis yesterday do you know what the minimum fee is to evaluate you for trial purposes do you am i supposed to know asked carl lee one thousand dollars jake shouted one thousand dollars where can you find a thousand dollars i gave you all the money i got i even offered i dont want the deed to your land why because nobody wants to buy it and if you cant sell it its no good weve got to have cash carl lee not for me but for the psychiatrists why why jake repeated in disbelief why because id like to keep you away from the gas chamber and its only a hundred miles from here its not that far and to do that weve got to convince the jury that you were insane when you shot those boys i cant tell them you were crazy you cant tell them you were crazy it takes a psychiatrist an expert a doctor and they dont work for free understand carl lee leaned on his knees and watched a spider crawl across the dusty carpet after twelve days in jail and two court appearances he had had enough of the criminal justice system he thought of the hours and minutes before the killings what was he thinking sure the boys had to die he had no regrets but did he contemplate jail or poverty or lawyers or psychiatrists maybe but only in passing those unpleasantries were only byproducts to be encountered and endured temporarily before he was set free after the deed the system would process him vindicate him and send him home to his family it would be easy just as lesters episode had been virtually painless but the system was not working now it was conspiring to keep him in jail to break him to make orphans of his children it seemed determined to punish him for performing an act he considered unavoidable and now his only ally was making demands he could not meet his lawyer asked the impossible his friend jake was angry and yelling get it jake shouted as he headed for the door get it from your brothers and sisters from gwens family get it from your friends get it from your church but get it and as soon as possible jake slammed the door and marched out of the jail carl lees third visitor of the morning arrived before noon in a long black limousine with a chauffeur and tennessee plates it maneuvered through the small parking lot and came to rest straddling three spaces a large black bodyguard emergedfrom behind the wheel and opened the door to release his boss they strutted up the sidewalk and into the jail the secretary stopped typing and smiled suspiciously good mornin mornin said the smaller one the one with the patch my name is cat bruster and id like to see sheriff walls may i ask what for yes maam its regardin a mr hailey a resident of your fine facility the sheriff heard his name mentioned and appeared from his

together so they could face each other closely and talk cat spoke first im proud of you big man for what you did real proud why didnt you tell me thats why you wanted the gun just didnt how was it

gonna pay another you aint gotta pay carl lee thats where i come in hes on my retainer all the time i own him paid the guy bout a hundred thousand last year just to keep me outta trouble you dont pay

might be the difference between life and death you cant afford to have no young kid in there hopin he dont mess up one mistake cat snapped his fingers for special effect and youre in the gas chamber marsharfsky dont make mistakes carl lee was on the ropes would he work with my lawyer he asked seeking compromise no no way he dont work with nobody he dont need no help your boyd be in the way carl lee placed his elbows on his knees and stared at his feet a thousand bucks for a doctor would be impossible he did not understand the need for one since he had not felt insane at the time but evidently one would be necessary everyone seemed to think so a thousand bucks for a cheap doctor cat was offering the best money could buy i naic uo mis my lawyer ne muttered quietly dont be stupid man cat scolded you better be lookin out for carl lee and to hell with this child this aint no time to worry bout hurtin feelins hes a lawyer forget him hell get over it but i already paid him how

for the kids he said as he unraveled a onethousanddollar bill and stuffed it with the rest carl lees pulse jumped as he thought of the cash covering his heart he felt it move in the pocket and press gently against his chest he wanted to look at the big bill and hold it firmly in his hand food he thought food for his kids we gotta deal cat asked with a smile you want me to fire my lawyer and hire yours he asked carefully right right and you gonna pay for everthing right right what about this money its yours lemme know if you need more mighty nice of you cat im a very nice man im helpin two friends one saved my life many years ago and the other saves my ass ever two years why does he want my case so bad publicity you know how lawyers are look at how much press this kids already made off

person to person to bo marsharfsky on the twentieth floor in a downtown office building bo marsharfsky hung up the phone and asked his secretary if the press release was prepared she handed it to him and he read it carefully this looks fine he said get it to both newspapers immediately tell them to use the file photograph the new one see frank fields at the post tell him i want it on the front page in the morning he owes me a favor yes sir what about the tv stations she asked deliver them a copy i cant talk now but ill hold a news conference in clanton next week lucien called at sixthirty saturday morning carla was buried deep under the blankets and did not respond to the phone jake rolled toward the wall and grappled with the lamp until he found the receiver hello he managed weakly whatre you doing lucien asked i was sleeping until the phone rang you seen the paper what time is it go get the paper and call me after you read it the phone was dead jake stared at the receiver then placed it on the table he sat on the edge of the bed rubbed the fog from his eyes and tried to remember the last time lucien called his house it must be important he made the coffee turned out the dog and walked quickly in his gym shorts and sweatshirt to the edge of the street where the three morning papers had fallen within ten inches of each other he rolled the rubber bands off onto the kitchen table and spread the papers next to his coffee nothing in the jackson paper nothing from tupelo the memphis post carried a headline of death in the middle east and then he saw it on the bottom half of the front page he saw himself and under his picture was the caption jake briganceout next was a picture of carl lee and then a splendid picture of a face he had seen before under it the words bo marsharfskyin the headline announced that the noted memphis criminal attorney had been hired to represent the vigilante killer aureiy n was a mistake he had seen carl lee only yesterday he read the story slowly there were few details just a history of marsharfskys greatest verdicts he promised a news conference in clanton he said the case would present new challenges etc he had faith in the jurors of ford county jake slipped silently into starched khakis and a buttondown his wife was still lost somewhere deep in the bed he would tell her later he took the paper and drove to the office the coffee shop would not be safe at ethels desk he read the story again and stared at his picture on the front page lucien had a few words of comfort he knew marsharfsky or the shark as he was known he was a sleazy crook with polish and finesse lucien admired him moss junior led carl lee into ozzies office where jake waited with a newspaper the deputy quickly left and closed the door carl lee sat on the small black vinyl couch jake threw the newspaper at him have you seen this he demanded carl lee glared at him and ignored the paper why carl lee i dont have to explain jake yes you do you didnt have the guts to call me like a man and tell me you let me read it in the paper i demand an explanation you wanted too much money jake youre always gripin over the money here i am sittin in jail and youre bitchin bout somethin i cant help money you cant afford to pay me how can you afford marsharfsky i aint gotta pay him what you heard me i aint payin him i guess he works for free nope somebody else is payin who jake shouted i aint tellin it aint none of your business jake youve hired the biggest criminal lawyer in memphis and someone else is payin his bill yep the naacp thought jake no they wouldnt hire marsharfsky theyve got their own lawyers besidesxhe was too expensive for them who else carl lee took the newspaper and folded it neatly he was ashamed and felt bad but the decision had been made he had asked ozzie to call jake and convey the news but the sheriff wanted no part of it he should have called but he was not going to apologize he studied his picture on the front page he liked the part about the vigilante business and youre not going to tell me who jake said somewhat quieter naw jake i aint tellin did you discuss it with lester the glare returned to his eyes nope he aint on trial and it aint none of his business where is he chicago left yesterday and dont you go call him ive made up my mind jake well see jake said to himself lester would find out shortly jake opened the door thats it im fired just like that carl lee stared at his picture and said nothing carla was eating breakfast and waiting a reporter from jackson had called looking for jake and had told her about marsharfsky there were no words just motions he filled a cup with coffee and went to the back porch he sipped from the steaming cup and surveyed the unkempt hedges that lined the boundary of his long and narrow backyard a brilliant sun baked the rich green bermuda and dried the dew creating a sticky haze that drifted upward and hung to his shirt the hedges and grass were waiting on their weekly grooming he kicked off his loafersno socksand walked through the soggy turf to inspect a broken birdbath near a scrawny crepe myrtle the only tree of any significance ucu him he took her hand and smiled you okay she asked yeah im fine did you talk to him yes what did he say he shook his head and said nothing im sorry jake he nodded and stared at the birdbath there will be other cases she said without confidence i know he thought of buckley and could hear the laughter he thought of the guys at the coffee shop and vowed not to return he thought of the cameras and reporters and a dull pain moved through his stomach he thought of lester his only hope of retrieving the case would you like some breakfast she asked no im not hungry thanks look on the bright side she said we wont be afraid to answer the phone i think ill cut the grass he said the council of ministers was a group of black preachers that had been formed to coordinate political activities in the black communities of ford county it met infrequently during the off years but during election years it met weekly on sunday afternoons to interview candidates and discuss issues and more importantly to determine the benevolence of each office seeker deals were cut strategies developed money exchanged the council had proven it could deliver the black vote gifts and offerings to black churches rose dramatically during elections the reverend ollie agee called a special meeting of the council for sunday afternoon at his church he wrapped up his sermon early and by pm his flock had scattered when the cadillacs and lincolns began filling his parking lot the meetings were secret with only ministers who were council members invited there were twentythree black churches in ford county and twentytwo members were present when reverend agee called the meeting to order the meeting would be brief since some of the ministers especially from the church of christ would begin their evening services shortly the purpose of the meeting he explained was to organize moral political and financial support of carl lee hailey a member in good standing of his church a legal defense fund must be established to assure the best legal representation another fund must be established to provide support for his family he reverend agee would chair the fundraising efforts with each minister responsible for his own congregation as usual a special offering would be taken during the morning and evening services starting next sunday agee would use his discretion in disbursing the money to the family half of the proceeds would go to the defense fund time was important the trial was next month the money had to be raised quickly while the issue was hot and the people were in a giving mood cuuncn unanimously agreed witn keverend agee he continued the naacp must become active in the hailey case he would not be on trial if he was white not in ford county he was on trial only because he was black and this must be addressed by the naacp the national director had been called the memphis and jackson chapters had promised help press conferences would be held demonstrations and marches would be important maybe boycotts of whiteowned businessesthat was a popular tactic at the moment and it worked with amazing results this must be done immediately while the people were willing and in a giving mood the ministers unanimously agreed and left for their evening services in part due to fatigue and in part due to embarrassment jake slept through church carla fixed pancakes and they enjoyed a long breakfast with hanna on the patio he ignored the sunday papers after he found on the front page of the second section of the memphis post a fullpage spread on marsharfsky and his famous new client the story was complete with pictures and quotes from the great lawyer the hailey case presented his biggest challenge he said serious legal and social issues would be addressed a novel defense would be employed he promised he had not lost a murder case in twelve years he boasted it would be difficult but he had confidence in the wisdom and fairness of mississippi jurors jake read the article without comment and laid the paper in the trash can carla suggested a picnic and although he needed to work he knew better than to mention it they loaded the saab with food and toys and drove to the lake the brown muddy waters of lake chatulla had crested for the year and within days would begin their slow withdrawal to the center the high water attracted a flotilla of skiboats bass rigs catamarans and dinghies carla threw two heavy quilts under an oak on the side of a hill while jake unloaded the food and doll house hanna arranged her large family with pets and automobiles on one quilt and began giving orders and setting up house her parents listened and smiled her birth had been a harrowing gutwrenching nightmare two and a half months premature and shrouded with conflicting symptoms and prognoses for eleven days jake sat by the incubator in icu and watched the tiny purple scrawny beautiful threepound body cling to life while an army of doctors and nurses studied the monitors and adjusted tubes and needles and shook their heads when he was alone he touched the incubator and wiped tears from his cheeks he prayed as he had never prayed he slept in a rocking chair near his daughter and dreamed of a beautiful blueeyed darkhaired little girl playing with dolls and sleeping on his shoulder he could hear her voice after a month the nurses smiled and the doctors relented the tubes were removed one at a time each day for a week her weight ballooned to a hearty four and a half pounds and the proud parents took her home the doctors suggested no more children unless adopted she was perfect now and the sound of her voice could still bring tears to his eyes they ate and chuckled as hanna lectured her dolls on proper hygiene this is the first time youve relaxed in two weeks carla said as they lay on their quilt wildly colored catamarans crisscrossed the lake below dodging a hundred roaring boats pulling halfdrunken skiers we went to church last sunday he replied and all you thought about was the trial still thinking about it its over isnt it i dont know will he change his mind he might if lester talks to him its hard to say blacks are so unpredictable especially when theyre in trouble hes got a good deal really hes got the best criminal lawyer in memphis and hes free whos paying the bill an old friend of carl lees from memphis a guy by the name of cat bruster whos he f very ncn pimp dope pusher thug thief marsharfskys his lawyer a couple of crooks did carl lee tell you this no he wouldnt tell me so i asked ozzie does lester know not yet what do you mean by that youre not going to call him are you well yes i had planned to thats going a bit far isnt it i dont think so lester has a right to know and then carl lee should tell him he should but he wont hes made a mistake and he does not realize it but its his problem not yours at least not anymore carl lees too embarrassed to tell lester he knows lester will cuss him and tell him hes made another mistake so its up to you to intervene in their family affairs no but i think lester should know im sure hell see it in the papers maybe not jake said without any conviction i think hanna needs some more orange juice i think you want to change the subject the subject doesnt bother me i want the case and i intend to get it back lesters the only person who can retrieve it her eyes narrowed and he could feel them he watched a bass rig drift into a mud bar on the near shore jake thats unethical and you know it her voice was calm yet controlled and firm the words were slow and scornful thats not true carla im a very ethical attorney youve always preached ethics but at this moment youre scheming to solicit the case thats wrong jake retrieve not solicit whats the difference soliciting is unethical ive never seen a prohibition against retrieving its not right jake carl lees hired another lawyer and its time for you to forget it and i suppose you think marsharfsky reads ethics opinions how do you think he got the case hes been hired by a man whos never heard of him he chased the case and hes got it so that makes it okay if you chase it now retrieve not chase hanna demanded cookies and carla searched through the picnic basket jake reclined on an elbow and ignored them both he thought of lucien what would he do in this situation probably rent a plane fly to chicago get lester slip him some money bring him home and convince him to browbeat carl lee he would assure lester that marsharfsky could not practice in mississippi and since he was a foreigner the rednecks on the jury wouldnt believe him anyway he would call marsharfsky and curse him for chasing cases and threaten him with an ethics complaint the minute he stepped into mississippi he would get his black cronies to call gwen and ozzie and persuade them that the only lawyer with a dogs chance in hell of winning the case was lucien wilbanks finally carl lee would knuckle under and send for lucien thats exactly what lucien would do talk about ethics why are you smiling carla interrupted just thinking about how nice it is out here with you and hanna we dont do this enough youre disappointed arent you sure there will never be another case like this one win it and im the greatest lawyer in these parts we would never have to worry about money again and if you lost it it would still be a drawing card but i cant lose what i dont have embarrassed a little its hard to accept every lawyer in the county is laughing about it except maybe harry rex but ill get over it what should i do with the scrapbook save it you might fill it up yet unc nine reel long and tour feet wide made to fit inconspicuously in the long bed of a pickup much larger crosses were used for the rituals but the small ones worked better in the nocturnal raids into residential areas they were not used often or often enough according to their builders in fact it had been many years since one had been used in ford county the last one was planted in the yard of a nigger accused of raping a white woman several hours before dawn on monday morning the cross was lifted quietly and quickly from the pickup and thrust into a teninch freshly dug slot in the front yard of the quaint victorian house on adams street a small torch was thrown at the foot of the cross and in seconds it was in flames the pickup disappeared into the night and stopped at a pay phone at the edge of town where a call was placed to the dispatcher moments later deputy marshall prather turned down adams and instantly saw the blazing cross in jakes front yard he turned into the driveway and parked behind the saab he punched the doorbell and stood on the porch watching the flames it was almost threethirty he punched it again adams was dark and silent except for the glow of the cross and the snapping and crackling of the wood burning fifty feet away finally jake stumbled through the front door and froze wildeyed and stunned next to the deputy the two stood side by side on the porch mesmerized not only by the burning cross but by its purpose mornin jake prather finally said without looking from the fire who did it jake asked with a scratchy dry throat dont know they didnt leave a name just called and told us about it when did they call fifteen minutes ago jake ran his fingers through his hair in an effort to keep it from blowing wild in the soft breeze how long will it burn he asked knowing prather knew as little or even less than he about burning crosses no tellin probably soaked in kerosene smells like it anyway might burn for a couple of hours you want me to call a fire truck jake looked up and down the street every house was silent and dark naw no need to wake everybody let it burn it wont hurt anything will it its your yard prather never moved just stood there hands in his pockets his belly hanging over his belt aint had one of these in a long time around here last one i remember was in karaway nineteensixry nineteen sixtyseven you remember yeah i was in high school we drove out and watched it burn what was that niggers name robinson something robinson said he raped velma thayer did he asked prather the jury thought so hes in parchman chopping cotton for the rest of his life prather seemed satisfied let me get carla jake mumbled as he disappeared he returned with his wife behind him my god jake who did it who knows is it the kkk she asked must be answered the deputy i dont know anybody else who burns crosses do you jake jake shook his head i thought they left ford county years ago said prather looks like theyre back said jake carla stood frozen her hand over her mouth terrified the glow of the fire reddened her face do something jake put it out jake watched the fire and again glanced up and down the street the snapping and popping grew louder and the orange flames reached higher into the night for a moment he hoped it would die quickly without being seen by anyone other than the three of them and that it would simply go away and be forgotten and no one in clanton would ever know then he smiled at his foolishness iiamci giumcu anu it was oovious he was tired of standing on the porch say jake uh i dont mean to bring this up but accordin to the papers they got the wrong lawyer that true i guess they cant read jake muttered probably not tell me prather do you know of any active klan members in this county not a one got some in the southern part of the state but none around here not that i know of fbi told us the klan was a thing of the past thats not very comforting why not because these guys if theyre klan members are not from around here visitors from parts unknown it means theyre serious dont you think prather i dont know id worry more if it was local people workin with the klan could mean the klans comin back what does it mean the cross carla asked the deputy its a warnin means stop what youre doin or the next time well do more than burn a little wood they used these things for years to intimidate whites who were sympathetic to niggers and all that civil rights crap if the whites didnt stop their nigger lovin then violence followed bombs dynamite beatings even murder but that was a long time ago i thought in your case its their way of tellin jake to stay away from hailey but since he aint haileys lawyer no more i dont know what it means go check on hanna jake said to carla who went inside if you got a water hose ill be glad to put it out offered prather thats a good idea jake said id hate for the neighbors to see it jake and carla stood on the porch in their bathrobes and watched the deputy spray the burning cross the wood fizzed and smoked as the water covered the cross and snuffed out the flames prather soaked it for fifteen minutes then neatly rolled the hose and placed it behind the shrubs in the flower bed next to the front steps thanks marshall lets keep this quiet okay prather wiped his hands on his pants and straightened his hat sure yall lock up good if you hear anything call the dispatcher well keep a close watch on it for the next few days he backed from the driveway and drove slowly down adams street toward the square they sat in the swing and watched the smoking cross i feel like im looking at an old issue of life magazine jake said or a chapter from a mississippi history textbook maybe we should tell them you got fired thanks thanks for being so blunt im sorry should i say discharged or terminated or just say he found another lawyer youre really scared arent you you know im scared im terrified if they can burn a cross in our front yard whats to stop them from burning the house its not worth it jake i want you to be happy and successful and all that wonderful stuff but not at the expense of our safety no case is worth this youre glad i got fired im glad he found another lawyer maybe theyll leave us alone now jake put his arm around her and pulled her into his lap the swing rocked gently she was beautiful at threethirty in the morning in her bathrobe they wont be back will they she asked naw theyre through with us theyll find out im off the case then theyll call and apologize its not funny jake i know do you think people will know not for another hour when the coffee shop opens at five dell perkins will know every detail before she pours the first cup of coffee whatre you going to do with it she asked nodding at the cross now barely visible under the half moon i vc goi an idea let s load it up take it to memphis and burn it in marsharfskys yard im going to bed by am jake had finished dictating his motion to withdraw as counsel of record ethel was typing it with zest when she interrupted him mr brigance theres a mr marsharfsky on the phone i told him you were in conference and he said he would hold ill talk to him jake gripped the receiver hello mr brigance bo marsharfsky in memphis how are you terrific good im sure you saw the morning paper saturday and sunday you do get the paper in clantpn yes and we have telephones and mail so you saw the stories on mr hailey yes you write some very nice articles ill ignore that i wanted to discuss the hailey case if you have a minute i would love to as i understand mississippi procedure outofstate counsel must associate local counsel for trial purposes you mean you dont have a mississippi license jake asked incredulously well no i dont that wasnt mentioned in your articles ill ignore that too do the judges require local counsel in all cases some do some dont i see what about noose sometimes thanks well i usually associate local counsel when i try cases out in the country the locals feel better with one of their own sitting there at counsel table with me thats real nice i dont suppose youd be interested in you must be kidding jake yelled ive just been fired and now you want me to carry your briefcase youre crazy i wouldnt have my name associated with yours wait a minute hayseed no you wait a minute counselor this may come as a surprise to you but in this state we have ethics and laws against soliciting litigation and clients champertyever hear of it of course not its a felony in mississippi as in most states we have canons of ethics that prohibit ambulance chasing and solicitation ethics mr shark ever hear of them i dont chase cases sonny they come to me like carl lee hailey im supposed to believe he picked your name out of the yellow pages im sure you have a fullpage ad next to the abortionists he was referred to me yeah by your pimp i know exactly how you got him outright solicitation i may file a complaint with the bar better yet i might have your methods reviewed by the grand jury yeah i understand you and the da are real close good day counselor marsharfsky got the last word before he hung up jake fumed for an hour before he could concentrate on the brief he was writing lucien would have been proud of him just before lunch jake received a call from walter sullivan of the sullivan firm jake my boy how are you wonderful good listen jake bo marsharfsky is an old friend of mine we defended a couple of bank officials years ago on fraud charges got them off too hes quite a lawyer hes associated me as local counsel for carl lee hailey i was just wanting to know jake dropped the receiver and walked out of his office he spent the afternoon on luciens front porch gwen did not have lesters number neither did ozzie nor did anyone else the operator said there were two pages of haileys in the chicago phone book at least a dozen lester haileys and several l ss jake asked for the first five lester haileys and called each one they were all white he called tank scales the owner of one of the safer and finer black honky tonks in the county tanks tonk as it was known lester was especially fond of the place tank was a client and often provided jake with valuable and confidential information on various blacks their dealings and whereabouts tank stopped by the office tuesday morning on the way to the bank have you seen lester hailey in the past two weeks jake asked sure spent several days at the place shootin pool drinkin beer went back to chicago last weekend i heard mustve i didnt see him all weekend who was he with hisself mostly what about iris yeah he brung her a couple of times when henry was outta town makes me nervous when he brings her henrys a bad dude hed cut them both if he knew theys datin theyve been doing it for ten years tank yeah she got two kids by lester everbody knows it but henry poor old henry hell find out one day and youll have another murder case listen tank can you talk to iris she dont come in too often thats not what i asked i need lesters phone number in chicago i figure iris knows it im sure she does i think he sends her money can you get it for me i need to talk to lester sure jake if shes got it ill get it by wednesday jakes office had returned to normal clients began to reappear ethel was especially sweet or as sweet as possible for a cranky old nag he went through the motions of practicing law but the pain showed he skipped the coffee shop each morning and avoided the courthouse by making ethel do the filing or checking or whatever business required his presence across the street he was embarrassed humiliated and troubled it was difficult to concentrate on other cases he contemplated a long vacation but couldnt afford it money was tight and he was not motivated to work he spent most of his time in his office doing little but watching the courthouse and the town square below he dwelt on carl lee sitting in his cell a few blocks away and asked himself a thousand times why he had been betrayed he had pushed too hard for money and forgot there were other lawyers willing to take the case for free he hated marsharfsky he recalled the many times he had seen marsharfsky parade in and out of memphis courtrooms proclaiming the innocence and mistreatment of his pitiful oppressed clients dope dealers pimps crooked politicians and slimy corporate thugs all guilty all deserving of long prison terms or perhaps even death he was a yankee with an obnoxious twang from somewhere in the upper midwest it would irritate anybody south of memphis an accomplished actor he would look directly into the cameras and whine my client has been horribly abused by the memphis police jake had seen it a dozen times my client is completely totally absolutely innocent he should not be on trial my client is a model citizen a taxpayer what about his four prior convictions for extortion he was framed by the fbi set up by the government besides hes paid his debt hes innocent this time jake hated him and to his recollection he had lost as many as he had won by wednesday afternoon marsharfsky had not been seen in clanton ozzie promised to notify jake if he showed up at the jail circuit court would be in session until friday and it would be respectful to meet briefly with judge noose and explain the circumstances of his departure from the case his honor was presiding over a civil case and there was a good chance buckley would be absent he had to be absent he could not be seen or heard noose usually recessed for ten minutes around threethirty and precisely at that time jake entered chambers through the side door he had not been seen he sat patiently by the window waiting for ichabod to descend from the bench and stagger into the room five minutes later the door flung open and his honor walked in jake how are you he asked fine judge can i have a minute jake asked as he closed the door sure sit down whats on your mind noose removed his robe threw it over a chair and lay on top of the desk knocking off books files and the telephone in the process once his gawky frame had ceased moving he slowly folded his hands over his stomach closed his eyes and breathed deeply its my back jake my doctortells me to rest on a hard surface when possible uh sure judge should i leave no no whats on your mind the hailey case i thought so i saw your motion found a new lawyer huh yes sir i had no idea it was coming i expected to try the case in july you owe no apologies jake the motion to withdraw will be granted its not your fault happens all the time whos the new guy marsharfsky yes sir from memphis with a name like that he should be a hit in ford county yes sir almost as bad as noose thought jake he has no mississippi license jake explained helpfully thats interesting is he familiar with our procedure im not sure hes ever tried a case in mississippi he told me he normally associates a local boy when hes out in the country in the country thats what he said well hed better associate if he comes into my court ive had some bad experiences with outofstate attorneys especially from memphis yes sir noose was breathing harder and jake decided to leave judge i need to go if i dont see you in july ill see you during the august term of court take care of your back thanks jake take care jake almost made it to the rear door of the small office when the main door from the courtroom opened and the honorable l winston lotterhouse and another hatchet man from the sullivan firm strutted into chambers well hello jake lotterhouse announced you know k peter otter our newest associate nice to meet you k peter replied jake are we interrupting anything no i was just leaving judge noose is resting his back and i was on my way out sit down gentlemen noose said lotterhouse smelled blood say jake im sure walter sullivan has informed you that our firm will serve as local counsel for carl lee hailey i have heard im sorry it happened to you your grief is overwhelming it does present an interesting case for our firm we dont get too many criminal cases you know i know jake said looking for a hole to crawl in i need to run nice chatting with you l winston nice meeting you k peter tell j walter and f robert and all the boys i said hello jake slid out of the rear door of the courthouse and cursed himself for showing his face where he could get it slapped he ran to his office has tank scales called he asked ethel as he started up the stairs no but mr buckley is waiting jake stopped on the first step waiting where he asked without moving his jaws upstairs in your office he walked slowly to her desk and leaned across to within inches of her face she had sinned and she knew it he glared at her fiercely i didnt know he had an appointment again the jaws did not move he didnt she replied her eyes glued to the desk i didnt know he owned this building she didnt move didnt answer i didnt know he had a key to my office again no movement no answer he leaned closer i should fire you for this her lip quivered and she looked helpless im sick of you ethel sick of your attitude your voice your insubordination sick of the way you treat people sick of everything about you her eyes watered im sorry no youre not you know and have known for years that no one no one in the world not even my wife goes up those stairs into my office if im not here he insisted hes an ass he gets paid for pushing people around but not in this office shhh he can hear you i dont care he knows hes an ass he leaned even closer until their noses were six inches apart would you like to keep your job ethel she nodded unable to speak then do exactly as i say go upstairs to my office fetch mr buckley and lead him into the conference room where ill meet him and dont ever do it again ethel wiped her face and ran up the stairs moments later the da was seated in the conference room with the door closed he waited jake was next door in the small kitchen drinking orange juice and assessing buckley he drank slowly after fifteen minutes he opened the door and entered the room buckley was seated at one end of the long conference table jake sat at the other end far away hello rufus what do you want nice place you have here luciens old offices i believe thats right what brings you here just wanted to visit im very busy and i wanted to discuss the hailey case call marsharfsky i was looking forward to the battle especially with you on the other side youre a worthy adversary jake im honored dont get me wrong i dont like you and i havent for a long time since lester hailey yeah i guess youre right you won but you cheated i won thats all that counts and i didnt cheat you got caught with your pants down you cheated and noose let you by with it whatever i dont like you either good that makes me feel better what do you know about marsharfsky is that the reason youre here could be ive never met the man but if he was my father i wouldnt tell you anything what else do you want surely youve talked to him we had some words on the phone dont tell me youre worried about him no just curious hes got a good reputation yes he does you didnt come here to discuss his reputation no not really i wanted to talk about the case what about it chances for an acquittal possible defenses was he really insane things like that i thought you guaranteed a conviction in front of the cameras remember just after the indictment one of your press conferences do you miss the cameras already jake relax rufus im out of the game the cameras are all yours at least yours and marsharfskys and walter sullivans go get them tiger if ive stolen some of your spotlight then im deeply sorry i know how it hurts you apology accepted has marsharfsky been to town i dont know he promised a press conference this week and you came here to talk about his press conference right no i wanted to discuss hailey but obviously youre too busy thats right plus i have nothing to discuss with you mr governor i resent that why you know its true youd prosecute your mother for a couple of headlines buckley stood and began pacing back and forth behind his chair i wish you were still on this case brigance he said the volume increasing so do i id teach you a few things about prosecuting murderers i really wanted to clean your plow you havent been too successful in the past thats why i wanted you on this one brigance i wanted you so bad his face had returned to the deep red that was so familiar therell be others governor dont call me that he shouted its true isnt it governor thats why you chase the cameras so hard everybody knows it there goes old rufus chasing cameras running for governor sure its true im doing my job prosecuting thugs carl lee haileys no thug watch me burn him it wont bethat easy watch me it takes twelve out of twelve no problem just like your grand jury buckley froze in his tracks he squinted his eyes and frowned at jake three huge wrinkles creased neatly across his mammoth forehead what do you know about the grand jury as much as you do one vote less and youd have sucked eggs thats not true come on governor youre not talking to a reporter i know exactly what happened knew it within hours ill tell noose and ill tell the newspapers thatll look good before the trial you wouldnt dare not now i have no reason to ive been fired remember thats the reason youre here right rufus to remind me that im no longer on the case tut you are to rub a little salt in the wounds okay youve done it now i wish youd leave go check on the grand jury or maybe theres a reporter hanging around the courthouse just leave gladly im sorry i bothered me too buckley opened the door leading into the hall then stopped i lied jake im tickled to death youre not on this case i know you lied but dont count me out what does that mean good day rufus the ford county grand jury had been busy and by thursday of the second week of the term jake had been retained by two freshly indicted defendants one was a black who cut another black at masseys tonk back in april jake enjoyed the stabbings because acquittals were possible just get an allwhite jury full of rednecks who could care less if all niggers stabbed each other they were just having a little fun down at the tonk things got out of hand one got stabbed but didnt die no harm no conviction it was similar to the strategy jake had learned with lester hailey the new client promised fifteen hundred dollars but first had to post bond the other new indictee was a white kid caught driving a stolen pickup it was the third time hed been caught in a stolen pickup and there was no way to keep him out of parchman for seven years both were in jail and their presence there afforded jake the opportunity and duty to visit them and check with ozzie late thursday afternoon he found the sheriff in his office are you busy jake asked a hundred pounds of paper was strewn over the desk and onto the floor no just paperwork any more burnin crosses no thank god ones enough i havent seen your friend from memphis thats strange said jake i thought he would be here by now have you talked to carl lee every day hes gettin nervous the lawyer aint even called jake good let him sweat i dont feel sorry for him you think he made a mistake i know he did i know these rednecks around here ozzie and i know how they act when you put them on a jury they wont be impressed by some slicktalking foreigner you agree i dont know youre the lawyer i dont doubt what you say jake ive seen you work hes not even licensed to practice in mississippi judge noose is laying for him he hates outofstate lawyers youre kiddin nope i talked to him yesterday ozzie looked disturbed and eyed jake carefully you wanna see him who carl lee no i have no reason to see him jake glanced in his briefcase i need to see leroy glass aggravated assault you got leroy yeah his folks came in this morning follow me jake waited in the intoxilyzer room while a trusty went for the new client leroy wore the standard ford county jail issue of glowinthedark orange coveralls pink sponge rollers shot in all directions from his scalp and two long greasy cornrows clung to the back of his neck his black leathery feet were protected from the dirty linoleum by a pair of lime green terrycloth slides no socks a wicked aged scar started next to his right ear lobe made the ridge over his cheekbone and connected neatly with his right nostril it proved beyond a reasonable doubt that leroy was no stranger to stabbings and carvings he wore it like a medal he smoked kools leroy im jake brigance the lawyer introduced him self and pointed to a folding chair next to the pepsi machine your momma and brother hired me this morning good to know you mr jake a trusty waited in the hall by the door as jake asked questions he filled three pages of notes on leroy glass of primary interest at least at this point was money how much did he have and where could he find more they would talk about the stabbing later aunts uncles brothers sisters friends anyone with a job who might be able to make a loan jake took phone numbers who referred you to me jake asked saw you on tv mr jake you and carl lee hailey jake was proud but did not smile television was just part of his job you know carl lee yeah know lester too yous lesters lawyer wasnt you yes me and carl lee in the same cell moved me last night you dont say yeah he dont talk much he said yous a real good lawyer and all but he found somebody else from memphis thats right what does he think of his new lawyer i dont know mr jake he was fussin this mornin cause the new lawyer aint been to see him yet he say you come to see him all the time and talk bout the case but the new lawyer some funny name aint even been down to meet him yet jake concealed his delight with a grim face but it was difficult ill tell you something if you promise you wont tell carl lee okay his new lawyer cant come to see him no why not because he doesnt have a license to practice law in mississippi hes a tennessee lawyer hell get thrown out of court if he comes down here by himself im afraid carl lees made a big mistake why dont you tell him because hes already fired me i cant give him advice anymore somebody ought to you just promised you wont okay okay i wont promise i swear good i gotta go ill meet with the bondsman in the morning and maybe well have you out in a day or so not a word to carl lee right right tank scales was leaning on the saab in the parking lot when jake left the jail he stepped on a cigarette butt and pulled a piece of paper from his shirt pocket two numbers top ones for home bottom for work but dont call at work unless you have to good work tank did you get them from iris yeah she didnt want to she stopped by the tonk last night and i got her drunk i owe you one ill get it sooner or later it was dark almost eight oclock dinner was cold but that was not unusual thats why he had bought her a microwave she was accustomed to the hours and the warmedover dinners and she did not complain they would eat when he came home whether it was six or ten jake drove from the jail to his office he wouldnt dare call lester from home not with carla listening he settled behind his desk and stared at the numbers tank had located carl lee had told him not to make this call why should he do it would it be solicitation unethical would it be unethical to call lester and tell him that carl lee had fired him and hired another lawyer no and to answer lesters questions about the new lawyer no and to express concern no and to criticize the new lawyer probably not would it be unethical to encourage lester to talk to his brother no and convince him to fire marsharfsky probably so and to rehire jake yes no doubt about it that would be very unethical what if he just called lester and talked about carl lee and allowed the conversation to follow its own course hello is there a lester hailey there yes whos calling came the accented reply from the swede jake brigance from mississippi one moment jake checked his watch eightthirty it was the same time in chicago wasnt it jake lester how are you fine jake tired but fine how bout you great listen have you talked to carl lee this week no i left friday and ive been workin two shifts since sunday i aint had time for nothin you seen the newspapers no whats happened you wont believe it lester what is it jake carl lee fired me and hired a bigshot lawyer from memphis what youre kiddin when last friday i guess after you left he didnt bother to tell me i read it in the memphis paper saturday morning hes crazy whyd he do it jake whod he hire you know a guy named cat bruster from memphis of course its his lawyer cats paying for it he drove down from memphis last friday and saw carl lee at the jail next morning i saw my picture in the paper and read where ive been fired whos the lawyer bo marsharfsky he any good hes a crook he defends all the pimps and drug dealers in memphis sounds like a polack he is i think hes from chicago yeah bunch of polacks up here does he talk like these like hes got a mouthful of hot grease hell go over big in ford county stupid stupid stupid carl lee never was too bright i always had to think for him stupid stupid yeah hes made a mistake lester you know what a murder trial is like because youve been there you realize how important that jury is when they leave the courtroom and go to the jury room your life is in their hands twelve local people back there fighting and arguing over your case your life the jurys the most important part thats why you gotta be able to talk to the jury thats right jake you can do it too im sure marsharfsky can do it in memphis but not ford county not jn rural mississippi these people wont trust him youre right jake i cant believe he did it hes screwed up again he did it lester and im worried about him have you talked to him last saturday after i saw the newspaper i went straight to the jail i asked him why and he could not answer he felt bad about it i havent talked to him since then but neither has marsharfsky he hasnt found clanton yet and i understand carl lees upset as far as i can tell nothing has been done on the case this week has ozzie talked to him yeah but you know ozzie hes not gonna say too much he knows brusters a crook and marsharfskys a crook but he wont lean on carl lee man oh man i cant believe it hes stupid if he thinks those rednecksll listen to some shyster from memphis hell jake they dont trust the lawyers from tyler county and its next door man oh man jake smiled at the receiver so far nothing unethical what should i do jake i dont know lester he needs some help and youre the only one hell listen to you know how headstrong he is i guess id better call him no thought jake it would be easier for carl lee to say no over the phone confrontation was needed between the brothers a drive from chicago would make an impact i dont think youll get very far over the phone his minds made up only you can change it and you cant do it over the phone lester paused a few seconds while jake waited anxiously whats today thursday june lets see lester mumbled im ten hours away i work the fourtomidnight shift tomorrow and again sunday i could leave here midnight tomorrow and be in clanton by ten saturday mornin then i could leave early sunday mornin and be back by four thats a lot of drivin but i can handle it its very important lester i think its worth the trip where will you be saturday jake here at the office okay ill go to the jail and if i need you ill call the office sounds good one other thing lester carl lee told me not to call you dont mention it whatll i tell him tell him you called iris and she gave you the story iris who come on lester its been common knowledge around here for years everybody knows it but her husband and hell find out i hope not well have us another murder youll have another client please i cant keep the ones ive got call me saturday he ate from the microwave at tenthirty hanna was asleep they talked about leroy glass and the white kid in the stolen pickup about carl lee but not about lester she felt better safer now that carl lee hailey was behind them no more calls no more burning crosses no more stares at church there would be other cases she promised he said little just ate and smiled just before the courthouse closed on friday jake called the clerk to see if a trial was in progress no she said noose was gone buckley musgrove everybody was gone the courtroom was deserted secure with that knowledge jake eased across the street through the rear door of the courthouse and down the hall to the clerks office he flirted with the clerks and secretaries while he located carl lees file he held his breath as he flipped through the pages good just as he had hoped nothing had been added to the file all week with the exception of his motion to withdraw as counsel marsharfsky and his local counsel had not touched the file nothing had been done he flirted some more and eased back to his office leroy glass was still in jail his bond was ten thousand dollars and his family couldnt raise the thousanddollar premium to pay a bondsman so he continued to share the cell with carl lee jake had a friend who was a bondsman and who took care of jakes clients if a client needed out of jail and there was little danger of him disappearing once he was sprung the bond would be written terms were available for jakes clients say five percent down and so much a month if jake wanted leroy glass out of jail the bond could be written anytime but jake needed him in jail look leroy im sorry im working with the bondsman jake explained to his client in the intoxilyzer room but you said id be out by now your folks dont have the money leroy i cant pay it myself well get you out but itll take a few days i want you out so you can go to work make some money and pay me leroy seemed satisfied okay mr jake just do what you can foods pretty good here isnt it jake asked with a smile it aint bad better at home well get you out jake promised hows the nigger i stabbed not sure ozzie said hes still in the hospital moss thrum says hes been released who knows i dont think hes hurt too bad who was the woman jake asked unable to remember the details willies woman willie who willie hoyt jake thought for a second and tried to recall the indictment thats not the man you stabbed naw hes curtis sprawling you mean yall were fighting over another mans woman thats right where was willie he was fightin too who was he fighting some other dude you mean the four of you were fighting over willies woman yeah you got it what caused the fight her husband was outta town shes married thats right whats her husbands name johnny sands when hes outta town theres normally a fight why is that cause she aint got no kids cant have any and she likes to have company know what i mean when he leaves everybody knows it if she shows up at a tonk look out for a fight what a trial thought jake but i thought you said she showed up with willie hoyt thats right but that dont mean nothin because everybody at the tonk starts easin up on her buyin drinks wantin to dance you cant help it some woman huh oh mr jake she looks so good you oughtta see her i will on the witness stand leroy gazed at the wall smiling dreaming lusting after the wife of johnny sands never mind that he stabbed a man and could get twenty years he had proven in handtohand combat that he was worthy listen leroy you havent talked to carl lee have you sure im still in his cell we talk all the time aint much else to do you havent told him what we discussed yesterday oh no i told you i wouldnt good but ill tell you this mr jake hes some kinda worried he aint heard from his new lawyer hes bad upset i had to bite my tongue to keep from tellin him but i didnt i did tell him you were my lawyer thats okay he said you was good bout comin by the jail and talkin bout the case and all he said i hired a good lawyer not good enough for him though i think carl lees confused he aint sure who to trust or anything hes a good dude well dont be telling him what we discussed right its confidential right but somebody needs to he didnt consult with me or anyone else before he fired me and hired his new lawyer hes a grown man he made the decision its his baby jake paused and moved closer to leroy he lowered his voice and ill tell you something else but you cant tell it i checked his court file thirty minutes ago his new lawyer hasnt touched the case all week not one thing has been filed nothing leroy frowned and shook his head man oh man his lawyer continued these big shots operate like that talk a lot blow a lot of smoke fly by the seat of their pants take more cases than they can handle and end up losing more than they win i know them i watch them all the time most are overrated is that why he aint been to see carl lee sure hes too busy plus hes got plenty of other big cases he dont care about carl lee thats bad carl lee deserves better it was his choice hell have to live with it you think hell be convicted mr jake no doubt about it hes looking at the gas chamber hes hired a bogus bigshot lawyer who doesnt have time to work on his case doesnt even have the time to talk to him in jail are you sayin you could get him off jake relaxed and crossed his legs no i never make that promise and i wont make it for your trial a lawyer is stupid if he promises an acquittal too many things can go wrong at trial carl lee said his lawyer promised a not guilty in the newspaper hes a fool where you been carl lee asked his cellmate as the jailer locked the door talkin to my lawyer jake yeah leroy sat on his bunk directly across the cell from carl lee who was rereading a newspaper he folded the paper and laid it under his bunk you look worried carl lee said bad news about your case naw just cant make my bail jake says itll be a few days jake talk about me naw not much not much whatd he say just ask how you was that all yeah hes not mad at me naw he might be worried about you but i dont think hes mad whys he worried about me i dont know leroy answered as he stretched out on his bunk folding his hands behind his head come on leroy you know somethin you aint tellin whatd jake say about me jake said i cant tell you what we talk about he says its confidential you wouldnt want your lawyer repeatin what yall talk about would you i aint seen my lawyer you had a good lawyer till you fired him i gotta good one now how do you know you aint ever met him hes too busy to come talk to you and if hes that busy he aint got time to work on your case how do you know about him i asked jake yeah whatd he say leroy was silent i wanna know what he said demanded carl lee as he sat on the edge of leroys bunk he glared at his smaller weaker cellmate leroy decided he was frightened and now had a good excuse to tell carl lee either talk or get slapped hes a crook leroy said hes a bigshot crook wholl sell you out he dont care about you or your case he just wants the publicity he hasnt touched your case all week jake knows he checked in the courthouse this afternoon not a sign of mr big shot hes too busy to leave memphis and check on you hes got too many other crooked clients in memphis includin your friend mr bruster youre crazy leroy okay im crazy wait and see who pleads insaneness wait and see how hard he works on your case what makes you such an expert you asked me and im tellin you carl lee walked to the door and grabbed the bars gripping them tightly with his huge hands the cell had shrunk in three weeks and the smaller it became the harder it was for him to think to reason to plan to react he could not concentrate in jail he knew only what was told to him and had no one to trust gwen was irrational ozzie was noncommittal lester was in chicago there was no other person he trusted except jake and for some reason he had found a new lawyer money that was the reason nineteen hundred dollars cash paid by the biggest pimp and dope dealer in memphis whose lawyer specialized in defending pimps and dope dealers and all kinds of cutthroats and hoodlums did marsharfsky represent decent people what would the jury think when they watched carl lee sit at the defense table next to marsharfsky he was guilty of course why else would he hire a famous bigcity crook like marsharfsky you know what them rednecks on the juryh say when they see marsharfsky leroy asked what theyre gonna think this poor nigger is guilty and hes sold his soul to hire the biggest crook in memphis to tell us he aint guilty carl lee mumbled something through the bars theyre gonna fry you carl lee moss junior tatum was on duty at sixthirty saturday morning when the phone rang in ozzies office it was the sheriff whatre you doing awake asked moss im not sure im awake answered the sheriff listen moss do you remember an old black preacher named street reverend isaiah street not really yeah you do he preached for fifty years at springdale church north of town first member of the naacp in ford county he taught all the blacks around here how to march and boycott back in the sixties yeah now i remember didnt the klan catch him once yeah they beat him and burned his house but nothin serious summer of i thought he died a few years back naw hes been half dead for ten years but he still moves a little he called me at fivethirty and talked for an hour reminded me of all the political favors i owe him whats he want hell be there at seven to see carl lee why i dont know but treat him nice put them in my office and let them talk ill be in later ouic oneriii in his heyday in the sixties the reverend isaiah street had been the moving force behind civil rights activity in ford county he walked with martin luther king in memphis and montgomery he organized marches and protests in clanton and karaway and other towns in north mississippi in the summer of he greeted students from the north and coordinated their efforts to register black voters some had lived in his home that memorable summer and they still visited him from time to time he was no radical he was quiet compassionate intelligent and had earned the respect of all blacks and most whites his was a calm cool voice in the midst of hatred and controversy he unofficially officiated the great public school desegregation in and ford county saw little trouble a stroke in deadened the right side of his body but left his mind untouched now at seventyeight he walked by himself slowly and with a cane proud dignified erect as possible he was ushered into the sheriffs office and seated hedeclined coffee and moss junior left to get the defendant you awake carl lee he whispered loudly not wanting to wake the other prisoners who would begin screaming for breakfast medicine lawyers bondsmen and girlfriends carl lee sat up immediately yeah i didnt sleep much you have a visitor come on moss quietly unlocked the cell carl lee had met the reverend years earlier when he addressed the last senior class at east high the black school desegregation followed and east became the junior high he had not seen the reverend since the stroke carl lee do you know reverend isaiah street moss asked properly yes we met years ago good ill close the door and let yall talk how are you sir carl lee asked they sat next to each other on the couch finej my son and you as good as possible ive been in jail too you know years ago its a terri ble place but i guess its necessary how are they treating you fine just fine ozzie lets me do as i please yes ozzie were very proud of him arent we yes sub hes a good man carl lee studied the frail feeble old man with the cane his body was weak and tired but his mind was sharp his voice strong were proud of you too carl lee i dont condone violence but at times its necessary too i guess you did a good deed my son yes suh answered carl lee uncertain of the appropriate response i guess you wonder why im here carl lee nodded the reverend tapped his cane on the floor im concerned about your acquittal the black community is concerned if you were white you would most likely go to trial and most likely be acquitted the rape of a child is a horrible crime and whos to blame a father for rectifying the wrong a white father that is a black father evokes the same sympathy among blacks but theres one problem the jury will be white so a black father and a white father would not have equal chances with the jury do you follow me i think so the jury is all important guilt versus innocence freedom versus prison life versus death all to be determined by the jury its a fragile system this trusting of lives to twelve average ordinary people who do not understand the law and are intimidated by the process yes suh your acquittal by a white jury for the killings of two white men will do more for the black folk of mississippi than any event since we integrated the schools and its not just mississippi its black folk everywhere yours is a most famous case and its being watched carefully by many people i just did what i had to do precisely you did what you thought was right it was right although it was brutal and ugly it was right and most folks black and white believe that but will you be treated as though you were white thats the question ana im convicted your conviction would be another slap at us a symbol of deepseated racism of old prejudices old hatreds it would be a disaster you must not be convicted im doin all i can do are you lets talk about your attorney if we may carl lee nodded have you met him no carl lee lowered his head and rubbed his eyes have you yes i have you have when in memphis in was with dr king marsharfsky was one of the attorneys representing the garbage workers on strike against the city he asked dr king to leave memphis claimed he was agitating the whites and inciting the blacks and that he was impeding the contract negotiations he was arrogant and abusive he cursed dr kingin private of course we thought he was selling out the workers and getting money under the table from the city i think we were right carl lee breathed deeply and rubbed his temples ive followed his career the reverend continued hes made a name for himself representing gangsters thieves and pimps he gets some of them off but theyre always guilty when you see one of his clients you know hes guilty thats what worries me most about you im afraid youll be considered guilty by association carl lee sunk lower his elbows resting on his knees who told you to come here he asked softly i had a talk with an old friend who just an old friend my son hes concerned about you too were all concerned about you hes the best lawyer in memphis this isnt memphis is it hes an expert on criminal law that could be because hes a criminal carl lee stood abruptly and walked across the room his back to the reverend hes free hes not costin me a dime his fee wont seem important when youre on death row my son moments passed and neither spoke finally the reverend lowered his cane and struggled to his feet ive said enough im leaving good luck carl lee carl lee shook his hand i do appreciate your concern and i thank you for visitin my point is simply this my son your case will be difficult enough to win dont make it more difficult with a crook like marsharfsky lester left chicago just before midnight friday he headed south alone as usual earlier his wife went north to green bay for a weekend with her family he liked green bay much less than she liked mississippi and neither cared to visit the others family they were nice people the swedes and they would treat him like family if he allowed it but they were different and it wasnt just their whiteness he grew up with whites in the south and knew them he didnt like them all and didnt like most of their feelings toward him but at least he knew them but the northern whites especially the swedes were different their customs speech food almost everything was foreign to him and he would never feel comfortable with them there would be a divorce probably within a year he was black and his wifes older cousin had married a black in the early seventies and received a lot of attention lester was a fad and she was tired of him luckily there were no kids he suspected someone else he had someone else too and iris had promised to marry him and move to chicago once she ditched henry both sides of interstate looked the same after midnightscattered lights from the small neat farms strewn over the countryside and occasionally a big town like champaign or effingham the north was where he lived and worked but it wasnt home home was where momma was in mississippi although he would never live there again too much ignorance and poverty he didnt mind the racism it wasnt as bad as it once was and he was accustomed to it it would always be there but gradually becoming less visible i ne wmtes stui owned and controlled everything and that in itself was not unbearable it was not about to change what he found intolerable was the ignorance and stark poverty of many of the blacks the dilapidated shotgun houses the high infant mortality rate the hopelessly unemployed the unwed mothers and their unfed babies it was depressing to the point of being intolerable and intolerable to the point he fled mississippi like thousands of others and migrated north in search of a job any decentpaying job which could ease the pain of poverty it was both pleasant and depressing to return to mississippi pleasant in that he would see his family depressing because he would see their poverty there were bright spots carl lee had a decent job a clean house and welldressed kids he was an exception and now it was all in jeopardy because of two drunk lowbred pieces of white trash blacks had an excuse for being worthless but for whites in a white world there were no excuses they were dead thank god and he was proud of his big brother six hours out of chicago the sun appeared as he crossed the river at cairo two hours later he crossed it again at memphis he drove southeast into mississippi and an hour later circled the courthouse in clanton hed been awake for twenty hours carl lee you have a visitor ozzie said through the iron bars in the door im not surprised who is it just follow me i think you better use my office this could take a while jake loitered at his office waiting on the phone to ring ten oclock lester should be in town if hes coming eleven jake riffled through some stale files and made notes for ethel noon he called carla and lied about meeting a new client at one oclock so forget lunch he would work in the yard later one oclock he found an ancient case from wyoming where a husband was acquitted after tracking down the man who raped his wife in he copied the case then threw it in the garbage two oclock was lester in town he could go visit leroy and snoop around the jail no that didnt feel right he napped on the couch in the big office at twofifteen the phone rang jake bolted upright and scrambled from the couch his heart was pounding as he grabbed the phone hello jake this is ozzie yeah ozzie whats up your presence is requested here at the jail what jake asked feigning innocence youre needed down here by who carl lee

closed his eyes and relaxed on the couch jake sat in a padded folding chair that he leaned against the wall opposite the couch he watched lester carefully but did not look at carl lee who rocked slowly in ozzies swivel chair carl lee said nothing lester said nothing after three minutes of silence jake was annoyed who sent for me he demanded i did answered carl lee well what do you want i wanna give you my case back you assume i want it back what lester sat up and looked at jake its not a gift you give or take away its an agreement between you and your attorney dont act as though youre

hands and spoke between his palms im just confused this place is drivin me crazy my nerves are shot im worried about my little girl im worried about my family im worried about my own skin everbodys

lester same fee same arrangements is that satisfactory okay with me replied carl lee ill pay you any way i can well discuss that later what about the doctors asked carl lee well make some arrangements i dont know itll work out the defendant smiled lester snored loudly and carl lee laughed at his brother i figured you called him but he swears you didnt jake smiled awkwardly but said nothing lester was a nar a laieni wmcn naa proved extremely beneficial during his murder trial imsorry jake i was wrong no apologies theres too much work to spend time apologizing next to the parking lot outside the jail a reporter stood under a shade tree waiting for something to happen excuse me sir arent you mr brigance who wants to know im richard flay with the jackson daily youre jake brigance yes mr haileys exlawyer no mr haileys lawyer i thought he had retained bo marsharfsky in fact thats why im here i heard a rumor marsharfsky would be here thisafternoon if you see him tell him hes too late lester slept hard on the couch in ozzies office the dispatcher woke him at am sunday and after filling a tall styrofoam cup with black coffee he left for chicaga late saturday night he and carl lee had called cat in his office above the club and informed him of carl lees conversion cat was indifferent and busy he said he would call marsharfsky there was no mention of the money not long after lester disappeared jake staggered down his driveway in his bathrobe to get the sunday papers clanton was an hour southeast of memphis three hours north of jackson and fortyfive minutes from tupelo all three cities had daily papers with fat sunday editions that were available in clanton jake had long subscribed to all three and was now glad he did so carla would have plenty of material for her scrapbook he spread the papers and began the task of plowing through five inches of print nothing in the jackson paper he hoped richard flay had reported something he should have spent more time with him outside the jail nothing from memphis nothing from tupelo jake was not surprised just hopeful that somehow the story had been discovered but it happened too late yesterday maybe monday he was tired of hiding tired of feeling embarrassed until it was in the papers and read by the boys at the coffee shop and the people at church and the other lawyers including buckley and sullivan and lotterhouse until everybody knew it was his case again he would stay quiet and out of view how should he tell sullivan carl lee would call marsharfsky or the pimp probably the pimp who would then call marsharfsky with the news what kind of press release would marsharfsky write for that then the great lawyer would call walter sullivan with the wonderful news that should happen monday morning if not sooner word would spread quickly throughout the sullivan firm and the senior partners junior partners and little associates would all gather in the long mahoganylaced conference room and curse brigance and his low ethics and tactics the associates would try to impress their bosses by spouting rules and code numbers of ethics brigance probably violated jake hated them every one of them he would send sullivan a short curt letter with a copy to lotterhouse he wouldnt call or write buckley he would be in shock after he saw the paper a letter to judge noose with a copy to tsuckiey would worn nne he wouia noi nonor mm with a personal letter jake had a thought then hesitated then dialed luciens number it was a few minutes after seven the nursemaid bartender answered the phone sallie yes this is jake is lucien awake just a moment she rolled over and handed the phone to lucien hello lucien its jake yeah whatta you want good news carl lee hailey rehired me yesterday the case is mine again which case the hailey case oh the vigilante hes yours as of yesterday weve got work to do whens the trial july sometime twentysecond thats pretty close whats priority a psychiatrist a cheap one wholl say anything i know just the man said lucien good get busy ill call in a couple of days carla awoke at a decent hour and found her husband in the kitchen with newspapers strewn over and under the breakfast table she made fresh coffee and without a word sat across the table he smiled at her and continued reading what time did you get up she asked fivethirty why so early its sunday i couldnt sleep too excited jake lowered the paper as a matter of fact i am excited very excited its too bad the excitement will not be shared im sorry about last night you dont have to apologize i know how you feel your problem is that you only look at the negative never the positive you have no idea what this case can do for us jake this case scares me the phone calls the threats the burning cross if the case means a million dollars is it worth it if something happens nothing will happen well get some more threats and theyll stare at us at church and around town but nothing serious but you cant be sure we went through this last night and i dont care to rehash it this morning i do have an idea though i cant wait to hear it you and hanna fly to north carolina and stay with your parents until after the trial theyd love to have you and we wouldnt worry about the klan or whoever likes to burn crosses but the trial is six weeks away you want us to stay in wilmington for six weeks yes i love my parents but thats ridiculous you dont see enough of them and they dont see enough of hanna and we dont see enough of you im not leaving for six weeks theres a ton of preparation ill eat and sleep this case until the trial is over ill work nights weekends what else is new ill ignore yall and think of nothing but this case were used to that jake smiled at her youre saying you can handle it i can handle you its those crazies out there that scare me when the crazies get serious ill back off i will run from this case if my family is in danger you promise of course i promise lets send hanna if were not in danger why do you want to send anybody just for safety shed have a great time spending the summer with her grandparents theyd love it she wouldnt last a week without me and you wouldnt last a week without her that s true it s out of the question i don t worry about her as long as i can hold her and squeeze her the coffee was ready and carla filled their cups anything in the paper no i thought the jackson paper might run something but it happened too late i guess i guess your timing is a little rusty after a weeks layoff just wait till in the morning how do you know i promise she shook her head and searched for the fashion and food sections are you going to church no why not youve got the case youre a star again yeah but no one knows it yet i see next sunday of course at mount hebron mount zion mount pleasant and at browns chapel greens chapel and norris road section line road bethel road and at gods temple christs temple and saints temple the buckets and baskets and plates were passed and repassed and left at the altars and front doors to collect the money for carl lee hailey and his family the large familysize kentucky fried chicken buckets were used in many of the churches the bigger the bucket or basket the smaller the individual offerings appeared as they fell to the bottom thus allowing the minister just cause to order another passing through the flock it was a special offering separate from the regular giving and was preceded in virtually every church with a heartwrenching account of what happened to the precious little hailey girl and what would happen to her daddy and family if the buckets were not filled in many instances the sacred name of the naacp was invoked and the effect was a loosening of the wallets and purses it worked the buckets were emptied the money counted and the ritual repeated during the evening services late sunday night the morning offerings and evening offer ings were combined and counted by each minister who would then deliver a great percentage of the total to the reverend agee sometime monday he would keep the money somewhere in his church and a great percentage of it would be spent for the benefit of the hailey family from two to five each sunday afternoon the prisoners in the ford county jail were turned out into a large fenced yard across the small back street behind the jail a limit of three friends andor relatives for each prisoner was allowed inside for no more than an hour there were a couple of shade trees some broken picnic tables and a wellmaintained basketball hoop deputies and dogs watched carefully from the other side of the fence a routine was established gwen and the kids would leave church after the benediction around three and drive to the jail ozzie allowed carl lee early entrance to the recreation area so he could assume the best picnic table the one with four legs and a shade tree he would sit there by himself speaking to no one and watch the basketball skirmish until his family arrived it wasnt basketball but a hybrid of rugby wrestling judo and basketball no one dared officiate no blood no foul and surprisingly no fights a fight meant quick admittance to solitary and no recreation for a month there were a few visitors some girlfriends and wives and they would sit in the grass by the fence with their men and quietly watch the mayhem under the basketball hoop one couple asked carl lee if they could use his table for lunch he shook his head and they ate in the grass gwen and the kids arrived before three deputy hastings her cousin unlocked the gate and the children ran to meet their daddy gwen spread the food carl lee was aware of the stares from the less fortunate and he enjoyed the envy had he been white or smaller and weaker or perhaps charged with a lesser crime he would have been asked to share his food but he was carl lee hailey and no one stared too long thegame returned to its fury and violence and the family ate in peace tonya always sat next to her daddy they started an offerin for us this mornin gwen said after lunch who did the church reverend agee said all the black churches in the county are gonna take up money ever sunday for us and for the lawyer fees how much dont know he said they gonna pass the bucket ever sunday until the trial thats mighty nice whatd he say bout me just talked about your case and all said how expensive it would be and how wed need help from the churches talked about christian givin and all that said youre a real hero to your people what a pleasant surprise thought carl lee he expected some help from his church but nothing financial how many churches all the black ones in the county when do we get the money he didnt say after he got his cut thought carl lee boys yall take your sister and go play over there by the fence me and momma needs to talk be careful now carl lee jr and robert took their little sister by the hand and did exactly as ordered what does the doctor say carl lee asked as he watched the children walk away shes doin good her jaws healin good he might take the wire off in a month she cant run and jump and play yet but it wont be long still some soreness what about the uh the other gwen shook her head and covered her eyes she began crying and wiping her eyes she spoke and her voice cracked shell never have kids he told me she stopped wiped her face and tried to continue she began sobbing loudly and buried her face in a paper towel carl lee felt sick he placed his forehead in his palms he ground his teeth together as his eyes watered whatd he say gwen raised her head and spoke haltingly righting back tears he told me tuesday there was too much dam age she wiped her wet face with her fingers but he wants to send her to a specialist in memphis hes not sure she shook her head ninety percent sure but he thinks she should be examined by another doctor in memphis were supposed to take her in a month gwen tore off another paper towel and wiped her face she handed one to her husband who quickly dabbed his eyes next to the fence tonya sat listening to her brothers argue about which one would be a deputy and which one would be in jail she watched her parents talk and shake their heads and cry she knew something was wrong with her she rubbed her eyes and started crying too the nightmares are gettin worse gwen said interrupting the silence i have to sleep with her ever night she dreams about men comin to get her men hidin in the closets chasin her through the woods she wakes up screamin and sweatin the doctor says she needs to see a psychiatrist says itll get worse before it gets better how much will it cost i dont know i havent called yet better call where is this psychiatrist memphis figures how are the boys treatin her theyve been great they treat her special but the nightmares keep them scared when she wakes up screamin she wakes everybody the boys run to her bed and try to help but it scares them last night she wouldnt go back to sleep unless the boys slept on the floor next to her we all laid there wide awake with the lights on the boysll be all right they miss their daddy carl lee managed a forced smile it wont be much longer you really think so i dont know what to think anymore but i dont plan to spend the rest of my life in jail i hired jake back when yesterday that memphis lawyer never showed up never even called i fired him and hired jake again but you said jake is too young i was wrong he is young but hes good ask lester its your trial carl lee walked slowly around the yard never leaving the fence he thought of the two boys somewhere out there dead and buried their flesh rotting by now their souls burning in hell before they died they met his little girl only briefly and within two hours wrecked her little body and ruined her mind so brutal was their attack that she could never have children so violent the encounter that she now saw them hiding for her waiting in closets could she ever forget about it block it out erase it from her mind so her life would be normal maybe a psychiatrist could do that would other children allow her to be normal she was just a little nigger they probably thought somebodys little nigger kid illegitimate of course like all of them rape would be nothing new he remembered them in court one proud the other scared he remembered them coming down the stairs as he awaited the execution then the looks of horror as he stepped forward with the m the sound of the gunfire the cries for help the screams as they fell backward together one on top of the other handcuffed screaming and twisting going nowhere he remembered smiling even laughing as he watched them struggle with their heads half blown away and when their bodies were still he ran he smiled again he was proud of it the first gook he killed in vietnam had bothered him more the letter to walter sullivan was to the point dear j walter by now its safe to assume mr marsharfsky has informed you that his employment by carl lee hailey has been terminated your services as local counsel will of course no longer be needed have a nice day sincerely jake a copy was sent to l winston lotterhouse the letter to noose was just as short dear judge noose please be advised that i have been retained by carl lee hailey we are preparing for trial on july please show me as counsel of record sincerely jake a copy was sent to buckley marsharfsky called at ninethirty monday jake watched the hold button blink for two minutes before he lifted the receiver hello howd you do it who is this your secretary didnt tell you this is bo marsharfsky and i want to know how you did it did what hustled my case stay cool thought jake hes an agitator as i recall it was hustled from me replied jake i never met him before he hired me you didnt have to you sent your pimp remember are you accusing me of chasing cases yes marsharfsky paused and jake braced for the obscenities you know something mr brigance youre right i chase cases everyday im a pro at hustling cases thats how i make so much money if theres a big criminal case i intend to get it and ill use whatever method i find necessary funny that wasnt mentioned in the paper and if i want the hailey case ill get it come on down jake hung up and laughed for ten minutes he lit a cheap cigar and began working on his motion for a change of venue two days later lucien called and instructed ethel to instruct jake to come see him it was important he had a visitor jake needed to meet the visitor was dr wt bass a retired psychiatrist from jackson he had known lucien for years and they had collaborated on a couple of insane criminals during their friendship both of the criminals were still in parchman his retirement had been one year before the disbarment and had been precipitated by the same thing that contributed heavily to the disbarment to wit a strong affection for jack daniels he visited lucien occasionally in clanton and lucien visited him more frequently in jackson and they enjoyed their visits because they enjoyed staying drunk together they sat on the big porch and waited on jake just say he was insane instructed lucien was he asked the doctor thats not important what is important its important to give the jury an excuse to acquit the man they wont care if hes crazy or not but theyll need some reason to acquit him it would be nice to examine him you can you can talk to him all you want hes at the jail just waiting on someone to talk to ill need to meet with him several times i know that what if i dont think he was insane at the time of the shooting then you wont get to testify at trial and you wont get your name and picture in the paper and you wont be interviewed on tv lucien paused long enough to take a long drink just do as i say interview him take a bunch of notes ask stupid questions you know what to do then say he was crazy im not so sure about this it hasnt worked too well in the past look youre a doctor arent you then act proud vain arrogant act like a doctors supposed to act give your opinion and dare anyone to question it i dont know it hasnt worked too well in the past just do as i say ive done that before and theyre both at parchman they were hopeless haileys different does he have a chance slim i thought you said he was different hes a decent man with a good reason for killing then why are his chances slim the law says his reason is not good enough thats par for the law plus hes black and this is a white county i have no confidence in these bigots around here and if he were white if he were white and he killed two blacks who raped his daughter the jury would give him the courthouse bass finished one glass and poured another a fifth and a bucket of ice sat on the wicker table between the two what about his lawyer he asked he should be here in a minute he used to work for you yeah but i dont think you met him he was in the firm about two years before i left hes young early thirties clean aggressive works hard and he used to work for you thats what i said hes got trial experience for his age this is not his first murder case but if im not mistaken its his first insanity case thats nice to hear i dont want someone asking a lot of questions i like your confidence wait till you meet the da i just dont feel good about this we tried it twice and it didnt work lucien shook his head in bewilderment youve got to be the humblest doctor ive known and the poorest youre supposed to be pompous and arrogant youre the expert act like one whos gonna question your professional opinion in clanton mississippi the state will have experts they will have one psychiatrist from whitfield hell examine the defendant for a few hours and then drive up for trial and testify that the defendant is the sanest man hes ever met hes never seen a legally insane defendant to him no one is insane everybodys blessed with perfect mental health whitfield is full of sane people except when it applies for government money then half the states crazy hed get fired if he started saying defendants are legally insane so thats who youre up against and the jury will automatically believe me you act as though youve never been through one of these before twice remember one rapist one murderer neither was insane in spite of what i said both are now locked away where they belong lucien took a long drink and studied the light brown liquid and the floating ice cubes you said you would help me god knows you owe me the favor how many divorces did i handle for you three and i got cleaned out every time you deserved it every time it was either give in or go to trial and have your habits discussed in open court i remember how many clients or patients have i sent you over the years not enough to pay my alimony remember the malpractice case by the lady whose treatment consisted primarily of weekly sessions on your couch with the foldaway bed your malpractice carrier refused to defend so you called your dear friend lucien who settled it for peanuts and kept it out of court there were no witnesses just the lady herself and the court files showing where your wives had sued for divorce on the grounds of adultery they couldnt prove it they didnt get a chance we didnt want them to try remember all right enough enough i said i would help what about my credentials are you a compulsive worrier no i just get nervous when i think of courtrooms your credentials are fine youve been qualified before as an expert witness dont worry so much what about this he waved his drink at lucien you shouldnt drink so much he said piously the doctor dropped his drink and exploded in laughter he rofled out of his chair and crawled to the edge of the porch holding his stomach and shaking in laughter youre drunk lucien said as he left for another bottle when jake arrived an hour later lucien was rocking slowly in his huge wicker rocker the doctor was asleep in the swing at the far end of the porch he was barefoot and his toes had disappeared into the shrubbery that lined the porch jake walked up the steps and startled lucien jake my boy how are you he slurred fine lucien i see youre doing quite well he looked at the empty bottle and one not quite empty i wanted you to meet that man he said trying to sit up straight who is he hes our psychiatrist dr wt bass from jackson good friend of mine hell help us with hailey is he good the best weve worked together on several insanity cases jake took a few steps in the direction of the swing and stopped the doctor was lying on his back with his shirt unbuttoned and his mouth wide open he snored heavily with an unusual guttural gurgling sound a horsefly the size of a small sparrow buzzed around his nose and retreated to the top of the swing with each thunderous exhalation a rancid vapor emanated with the snoring and hung like an invisible fog over the end of the porch hes a doctor jake asked as he sat next to lucien psychiatry lucien said proudly did he help you with those jake nodded at the bottles i helped him he drinks like a fish but hes always sober at trial thats comforting youll like him hes cheap owes me a favor wont cost a dime i like him already luciens face was as red as his eyes wanna drink no its threethirty in the afternoon really what day is it wednesday june how long have yall been drinking bout thirty years lucien laughed and rattled his ice cubes i mean today we drank our breakfast what difference does it make does he work naw hes retired was his retirement voluntary you mean was he disbarred so to speak thats right so to speak no he still has his license and his credentials are impeccable he looks impeccable booze got him a few years ago booze and alimony i handled three of his divorces he reached the point where all of his income went for alimony and child support so he quit working how does he manage we uh i mean he stashed some away hid it from his wives and their hungry lawyers hes really quite comfortable he looks comfortable plus he peddles a little dope but only to a rich clientele not really dope but narcotics which he can legally prescribe its not really illegal just a little unethical whats he doing here he visits occasionally he lives in jackson but hates it i called him sunday after i talked to you he wants to meet hailey as soon as possible tomorrow if he can the doctor grunted and rolled to his side causing the swing to move suddenly it swung a few times and he moved again still snoring he stretched his right leg and his foot caught a thick branch in the shrubbery the swing jerked sideways and threw the good doctor onto the porch his head crashed onto the wooden floor while his right foot remained lodged through the end of the swing he grimaced and coughed then began snoring again jake instinctively started toward him but stopped when it was apparent he was unharmed and still asleep leave him alone ordered lucien between laughs lucien slid an ice cube down the porch and just missed the doctors head the second cube landed perfectly on the tip of his nose perfect shot lucien roared wake up you drunk jake walked down the steps toward his car listening to his former boss laugh and curse and throw ice cubes at dr wt bass psychiatrist witness for the defense deputy dewayne looney left the hospital on crutches and drove his wife and three children to the jail where the sheriff the other deputies the reserves and a few friends waited with a cake and small gifts he would be a dispatcher now and would retain his badge and uniform and full salary the fellowship hall of the springdale church had been thoroughly cleaned and shined and the folding tables and chairs dusted and placed in perfect rows around the room it was the largest black church in the county and it was in clanton so the reverend agee deemed it necessary to meet there the purpose of the press conference was to get vocal to show support of the local boy who made good and to announce the establishment of the carl lee hailey legal defense fund the national director of the naacp was present with a fivethousanddollar check and a promise of serious money later the executive director of the memphis branch brought five thousand and grandly laid it on the table they sat with agee behind the two folding tables in the front of the room with every member of the council seated behind them and two hundred black church members in the crowded audience gwen sat next to agee a few reporters and cameras much fewer than expected grouped in the center of the room and filmed away agee spoke first and was inspired by the cameras he talked of the haileys and their goodness and innocence and of baptizing tonya when she was only eight he talked of a family wrecked by racism and hatred there were sniffles in the audience then he got mean he tore into the judicial system and its desire to prosecute a good and decent man who had done no wrong a man who if white would not be on trial a man who was on trial only because he was black and that was what was so wrong with the prosecution and persecution of carl lee hailey he found his rhythm and the crowd joined in and the press conference took on the fervor of a tent revival he lasted for fortyfive minutes he was a hard act to follow but the national director did not hesitate he delivered a thirtyminute oratorical condemnation of racism he seized the moment and spouted national statistics on crime and arrests and convictions and inmate population and summed it all up by declaring that the criminal justice system was controlled by white people who unfairly persecuted black people then in a bewildering flurry of rationale he brought the national statistics to ford county and pronounced the system unfit to deal with carl lee hailey the lights from the tv cameras produced a line of sweat above his eyebrows and he warmed to the task he got angrier than reverend agee and pounded the podium and made the cluster of microphones jump and shake he exhorted the blacks of ford county and of mississippi to give until it hurt he promised demonstrations and marches the trial would be a battle cry for black and oppressed folk everywhere he answered questions how much money would be raised at least fifty thousand they hoped it would be expensive to defend carl lee hailey and fifty thousand may not be enough but they would raise whatever it took but time was running short where would the money go legal fees and litigation expenses a battery of lawyers and doctors would be needed would naacp lawyers be used of course the legal staff in washington was already at work on the case the capital defense unit would handle all aspects of the trial carl lee hailey had become their top priority and all available resources would be devoted to his defense when he finished reverend agee retook the podium and nodded at a piano player in the corner the music started they all stood hand in hand and sang a stirring rendition of we shall overcome jake read about the defense fund in tuesdays paper he had heard rumors of the special offering being administered by the council but was told the money was for the support of the family fifty thousand for legal fees he was angry but interested would he be fired again suppose carl lee refused to hire the naacp lawyers what would happen to the money the trial was five weeks away plenty of time for the capital defense team to descend on clanton he had read about these guys a team of six capital murder specialists who toured the south defending blacks accused of heinous and notorious crimes the death squad was their nickname they were very bright very talented very educated lawyers dedicated to rescuing black murderers from the vari ous gas chambers and electric chairs around the south they handled nothing but capital murder cases and were very very good at their work the naacp ran their interference raising money organizing local blacks and generating publicity racism was their best and sometimes only defense and though they lost much more than they won their record was not bad the cases they handled were supposed to be lost all of them their goal was to martyr the defendant before the trial and hopefully hang the jury now they were coming to clanton a week earlier buckley had filed the proper motions to have carl lee examined by the states doctors jake requested the doctors be required to conduct their examinations in clantqn preferably in jakes office noose declined and ordered the sheriff to transport carl lee to the mississippi state mental hospital at whitfield jake requested that he be allowed to accompany his client and be present during the examinations again noose declined early wednesday morning jake and ozzie sipped coffee in the sheriffs office and waited for carl lee to shower and change clothes whitfield was three hours away and he was to check ia at nine jake had final instructions for his client how long will yall be there jake asked ozzie youre the lawyer how long will it take three or four days youve been there before havent you sure weve had to transport plenty of crazy people but nothin like this where do they keep him theyve got all kinds of cells deputy hastings casually entered the office sleepyeyed and crunching on a stale doughnut how many cars we takin two answered ozzie ill drive mine and you drive yours ill take pirtle and carl lee you take riley and nesbit guns three shotguns in each car plenty of shells everbody wears a vest including carl lee get the cars ready id like to leave by fivethirty hastings mumbled something and disappeared are you expecting trouble jake asked weve had some phone calls two in particular mentioned the trip to whitfield lot of highway between here and there how are you going most folks take to the interstate wouldnt you say it might be safer to take some smaller highways well probably run south to that would be unexpected good im glad you approve hes my client you know for right now anyway carl lee quickly devoured the eggs and biscuits as jake briefed him on what to expect during the stay at whitfield i know jake you want me to act crazy right carl lee said with a laugh ozzie thought it was funny too this is serious carl lee listen to me why you said yourself it wont matter what i say or do down there they wont say i was insane when i shot them them doctors work for the state right the states prosecutin me right what difference does it make what i say or do theyve already made up their minds aint that right ozzie im not gettin involved i work for the state you work for the county said jake name rank and serial number thats all theyre gettin outta me carl lee said as he emptied a small paper sack very funny said jake hes crackin up jake ozzie said carl lee stuck two straws up his nose and began tiptoeing around the office staring at the ceiling and then grabbing at something above his head he put it in the sack he lunged at another one and put it in the sack hastings returned and stopped in the door carl lee grinned at him with wild eyes then grabbed at another one toward the ceiling what the hell hes doin hastings asked catchin butterflies carl lee said jake grabbed his briefcase and headed for the door i think you should leave him at whitfield he slammed the door and left the jail noose had scheduled the venue hearing for monday june in clanton the hearing would be long and well publicized jake had requested the change of venue and he had the burden of proving carl lee could not receive a fair and impartial trial in ford county he needed witnesses persons with credibility in the community who were willing to testify that a fair trial was not possible atcavage said he might do it as a favor but the bank might not want him involved harry rex had eagerly volunteered reverend agee said he would be glad to testify but that was before the naacp announced its lawyers would be handling the case lucien had no credibility and jake did not seriously consider asking him buckley on the other hand would line up a dozen credible witnesseselected officials lawyers businessmen maybe other sheriffsall of whom would testify that they had vaguely heard of carl lee hailey and he could most certainly receive a fair trial in clanton jake personally preferred the trial to be in clanton in his courthouse across the street from his office in front of his people trials were pressurefilled tedious sleepless ordeals it would be nice to have this one in a friendly arena three minutes from his driveway when the trial recessed he could spend the free moments in his office doing research preparing witnesses or relaxing he could eat at the coffee shop or claudes or even run home for a quick lunch his client could remain in the ford county jail near his family and of course his media exposure would be much greater the reporters would gather in front of his office each morning of the trial and follow him as he walked slowly toward the courthouse that thought was exciting did it matter where they tried carl lee hailey lucien was correct the publicity had reached every resident of every county in mississippi so why change venue his guilt or innocence had already been prejudged by every prospective juror in the state sure it mattered some prospective jurors were white and some were black percentagewise there would be more white ones in ford county than the surrounding counties jake loved black jurors especially in criminal cases and especially when the criminal was black they were not as anxious to convict they were open minded he preferred them in civil cases too they felt for the underdog against the big corporation or insurance company and they were more liberal with other peoples money as a rule he picked all the black jurors he could find but they were scarce in ford county it was imperative the case be tried in another county a blacker county one black could hang the jury a majority could force maybe an acquittal two weeks in a motel and strange courthouse was not appealing but the small discomforts were greatly outweighed by the need to have black faces in the jury box the venue question had been thoroughly researched by lucien as instructed jake arrived promptly although reluctantly at am sallie served breakfast on the porch jake drank coffee and orange juice lucien bourbon and water for three hours they covered every aspect of a change of venue lucien had copies of every supreme court case for the past eighty years and lectured like a professor the pupil took notes argued once or twice but mainly listened whitfield was located a few miles from jackson in a rural part of rankin county two guards waited by the front gate and argued with reporters carl lee was scheduled to arrive at nine that was all the guards knew at eightthirty two patrol cars with ford county insignia rolled to a stop at the gate the reporters and their cameramen ran to the driver of the first car ozzies window was down wheres carl lee hailey a reporter shouted in a panic hes in the other car ozzie drawled winking at carl lee in the back seat hes in the second car someone shouted and they ran to hastings car wheres hailey they demanded pirtle in the front seat pointed to hastings the driver thats him are you carl lee hailey a reporter screamed at hastings yep why are you driving whats with the uniform they made me a deputy answered hastings with a straight face the gate opened and the two cars sped through carl lee was processed in the main building and led along with ozzie and the deputies to another building where he was checked into his cell or room as it was called the door was locked behind him ozzie and his men were excused and returned to clanton after lunch an assistant of some sort with a clipboard and white jacket arrived and began asking questions starting with birth he asked carl lee about every significant event and person in his life it lasted two hours at pm two security guards handcuffed carl lee and rode him in a golf cart to a modern brick building a half mile from his room he was led to the office of dr wilbert rodeheaver head of staff the guards waited in the hall by the door it had been five weeks since the shootings of billy ray cobb and pete willard the trial was four weeks away the three motels in clanton were booked solid for the week of the trial and the week before the best western was the largest and nicest and had attracted the memphis and jackson press the clanton court had the best bar and restaurant and was booked by reporters from atlanta washington and new york at the less than elegant east side motel the rates had curiously doubled for the month of july but it had nonetheless sold out the town had been friendly at first to these outsiders most of whom were rude and spoke with different accents but some of the descriptions of clanton and its people had been less than flattering and most of the locals now honored a secret code of silence a noisy cafe would become instantly silent when a stranger walked in and took a seat merchants around the square offered little assistance to anyone they did not recognize the employees in the courthouse had become deaf to questions asked a thousand times by nosy intruders even the memphis and jackson reporters had to struggle to extract anything new from the locals the people were tired of being described as backward redneck and racist they ignored the outsiders whom they could not trust and went about their business the bar at the clanton court became the watering hole for the reporters it was the one place in town they could go to find a friendly face and good conversation they sat in the booths under the bigscreen tv and gossiped about the small town and the upcoming trial they compared notes and stories and leads and rumors and drank until they were drunk because there was nothing else to do in clanton after dark the motels filled sunday night june the night before the venue hearing early monday morning they gathered in the restaurant at the best western to drink coffee and speculate the hearing was the first major skirmish and could likely be the only courtroom action until the trial a rumor surfaced that noose was ill and did not want to hear the case and that he would ask the supreme court to appoint another judge just a rumor with no source and nothing more definite said a reporter from jackson at eight they packed their cameras and microphones and left for the square one group set up outside the jail another at the rear of the courthouse but most headed for the courtroom by eightthirty it was filled from the balcony of his office jake watched the activity around the courthouse his heart beat faster than normal and his stomach tingled he smiled he was ready for buckley ready for the cameras noose looked down past the end of his nose over his reading glasses and around the packed courtroom everyone was in place the court has before it he began the defendants motion for a change of venue the trial in this matter has been set for monday july thats four weeks from today according to my calendar i have set a deadline for filing motions and disposing of same and i believe those are the only two deadlines between now and trial thats correct your honor thundered buckley half standing behind his table jake rolled his eyes and shook his head thank you mr buckley noose said dryly the defendant has filed the proper notice that he intends to use an insanity defense has he been examined at whitfield yes sir your honor last week jake answered will he employ his own psychiatrist of course your honor has he been examined by his own yes sir good so thats out of the way what other motions do you anticipate filing your honor we expect to file a motion requesting the clerk to summons more than the usual number of prospective jurors the state will oppose that motion buckley yelled as he jumped to his feet sit down mr buckley noose said sternly ripping off his glasses and glaring at the da please dont yell at me again of course you will oppose it you will oppose any motion filed by the defense thats your job dont interrupt again youll have ample opportunity after we adjourn to perform for the media buckley slumped in his chair and hid his red face noose had never screamed at him before continue mr brigance jake was startled by ichabods meanness he looked tired and ill perhaps it was the pressure we may have some written objections to anticipated evidence motions in liminet yes sir well hear those at trial anything else not at this time now mr buckley will the state file any motions i cant think of any buckley answered meekly good i want to make sure there are no surprises between now and trial i will be here one week before trial to hear and decide any pretrial matters i expect any motions to be filed promptly so that we can tie up any loose ends well before the twentysecond noose flipped through his file and studied jakes motion for a change of venue jake whispered to carl lee whose presence was not required for the hearing but he insisted gwen and the three boys sat in the first row behind their daddy tonya was not in the courtroom mr brigance your motion appears to be in order how many witnesses three your honor mr buckley how many will you call we have twentyone buckley said proudly twentyone yelled the judge buckley cowered and glanced at musgrove bbut we probably wont need them all in fact i know we wont call all of them pick your best five mr buckley i dont plan to be here all day yes your honor mr brigance youve asked for a change of venue its your motion you may proceed jake stood and walked slowly across the courtroom behind buckley to the wooden podium in front of the jury box may it please the court your honor mr hailey has requested that his trial be moved from ford county the reason is obvious the publicity in this case will prevent a fair trial the good people of this county have prejudged the guilt or innocence of carl lee hailey he is charged with killing two men both of whom were born here and left families here their lives were not famous but their deaths certainly have been mr hailey was known by few outside his community until now now everyone in this county knows who he is knows about his family and his daughter and what happened to her and knows most of the details of his alleged crimes it will be impossible to find twelve people in ford county who have not already prejudged this case this trial should be held in another part of the state where the people are not so familiar with the facts where would you suggest interrupted the judge i wouldnt recommend a specific county but it should be as far away as possible perhaps the gulf coast why obvious reasons your honor its four hundred miles away and im sure the people down there do not know as much as the people around here and you think the people in south mississippi havent heard about it im sure they have but they are much further away but they have televisions and newspapers dont they mr brigance im sure they do do you believe you could go to any county in this state and find twelve people who havent heard the details of this case jake looked at his legal pad he could hear the artists sketching on their pads behind him he could see buckley grinning out ot the corner of his eye it would be difficult he said quietly call your first witness harry rex vonner was sworn in and took his seat on the witness stand the wooden swivel chair popped and creaked under the heavy load he blew into the microphone and a loud hiss echoed around the courtroom he smiled at jake and nodded would you state your name harry rex vonner and your address eightyfour ninetythree cedarbrush clanton mississippi how long have you lived in clanton all my life fortysix years your occupation im a lawyer ive had my license for twentytwo years have you ever met carl lee hailey once what do you know about him he supposedly shot two men billy ray cobb and pete willard and he wounded a deputy dewayne looney did you know either of those boys not personally i knew of billy ray cobb how did you learn of the shootings well it happened on a monday i believe i was in the courthouse on the first floor checking title on some land in the clerks office when i heard the gunshots i ran out into the hall and bedlam had broken loose i asked a deputy and he told me that the boys had been killed near the back door of the courthouse i hung around here for a while and pretty soon there was a rumor that the killer was the father of the little girl who got raped what was your initial reaction i was shocked like most people but i was shocked when i first heard of the rape too when did you learn that mr hailey had been arrested later that night it was all over the television what did you see on tv well i watched as much of it as i could there were news reports from the local stations in memphis and tupelo weve got the cable you know so i watched the news out of new york chicago and atlanta just about every channel had something about the shootings and the arrest there was footage from the courthouse and jail it was a big deal biggest thing that ever happened in clanton mississippi how did you react when you learned that the girls father had supposedly done the shooting it was no big surprise to me i mean we all sort of figured it was him i admired him ive got kids and i sympathize with what he did i still admire him how much do you know about the rape buckley leapt to his feet objection the rape is irrelevant noose ripped off his glasses again and stared angrily at the da seconds passed and buckley glanced at the table he shifted his weight from one foot to the next then sat down noose leaned forward and glared down from the bench mr buckley dont yell at me if you do it again so help me god i will hold you in contempt you may be correct the rape may be irrelevant but this is not the trial is it this is simply a hearing isnt it we dont have a jury in the box do we youre overruled and out of order now stay in your seat i know its hard with this sort of audience but i instruct you to stay in your seat unless you have something truly worthy to say at that point you may stand and politely and quietly tell me whats on your mind thank you your honor jake said as he smiled at buckley now mr vonner as i was saying how much do you know about the rape just what ive heard and whats that buckley stood and bowed like a japanese sumo wrestler if your honor please he said softly and sweetly i would like to object at this point if it pleases the court the witness may testify to only what he knows from firsthand knowledge not from what hes heard from other people noose answered just as sweetly thank you mr buck ley your objection is noted and you are overruled please continue mr brigance thank you your honor what have you heard about the rape cobb and willard grabbed the little hailey girl and took her out in the woods somewhere they were drunk they tied her to a tree raped her repeatedly and tried to hang her they even urinated on her they what asked noose they pissed on her judge the courtroom buzzed at this revelation jake had never heard it buckley hadnt heard it and evidently no one knew it but harry rex noose shook his head and lightly rapped his gavel jake scribbled something on his legal pad and marveled at his friends esoteric knowledge where did you learn about the rape all over town its common knowledge the cops were giving the details the next morning at the coffee shop everybody knows it is it common knowledge throughout the county yes i havent talked to anybody in a month who did not know the details of the rape tell us what you know about the shootings well like i said it was a monday afternoon the boys were here in this courtroom for a bail hearing i believe and when they left the courtroom they were handcuffed and led by the deputies down the back stairs when they got down the stairs mr hailey jumped out of a closet with an m they were killed and dewayne looney was shot part of his leg was amputated exactly where did this take place right below us here at the rear entrance of the courthouse mr hailey was hiding in a janitors closet and just stepped out and opened fire do you believe this to be true i know its true where did you learn all this here and there around town in the newspapers everybody knows about it where have you heard it discussed everywhere in bars in churches at the bank at the cleaners at the tea shoppe at the cafes around town at the liquor store everywhere have you talked to anyone who believes mr hailey did not kill billy ray cobb and pete willard no you wont find a single person in this county who believes he didnt do it have most folks around here made up their minds about his guilt or innocence every single one of them there are no fence straddlers on this one its a hot topic and everyone has an opinion in your opinion could mr hailey receive a fair trial in ford county no sir you couldnt find three people in this county of thirty thousand who have not already made up their minds one way or the other mr hailey has been judged already theres just no way to find an impartial jury thank you mr vonner no further questions your honor buckley patted his pompadour and ran his fingers over his ears to make sure every hair was in place he walked purposefully to the podium mr vonner he bellowed magnificently have you already prejudged carl lee hailey damn right i have your language please said noose and what would your judgment be mr buckley let me explain it this way and ill do so very carefully and slowly so that even you will understand it if i was the sheriff i would not have arrested him if i was on the grand jury i would not have indicted him if i was the judge i would not try him if i was the da i would not prosecute him if i was on the trial jury i would vote to give him a key to the city a plaque to hang on his wall and i would send him home to his family and mr buckley if my daughter is ever raped i hope i have the guts to do what he did i see you think people should carry guns and settle their disputes in shootouts i think children have a right not to be raped and their parents have the right to protect them i think little girls are special and if mine was tied to a tree and gang raped by two dopeheads im sure it would make me crazy i think good and decent fathers should have a constitutional right to execute any pervert who touches their children and i think youre a lying coward when you claim you would not want to kill the man who raped your daughter mr vonner please noose said buckley struggled but kept his cool you obviously feel very strongly about this case dont you youre very perceptive and you want to see him acquitted dont you i would pay money if i had any and you think he stands a better chance of acquittal in another county dont you i think hes entitled to a jury made up of people who dont know everything about the case before the trial starts you would acquit him wouldnt you thats what i said and youve no doubt talked to other people who would acquit him i have talked to many are there folks in ford county who would vote to convict him of course plenty of them hes black isnt he in all your discussions around the county have you detected a clear majority one way or the other not really buckley looked at his legal pad and made a note mr vonner is jake brigance a close friend of yours harry rex smiled and rolled his eyes at noose im a lawyer mr buckley my friends are few and far between but he is one of them yes sir and he asked you to come testify no i just happened to stumble through the courtroom a few moments ago and landed here in this chair i had no idea you guys were having a hearing this morning buckley threw his legal pad on the table and sat down harry rex was excused call your next witness noose ordered reverend ollie agee jake said the reverend was led from the witness room and seated in the witness stand jake had met him at his church the day before with a list of questions he wanted to testify they did not discuss the naacp lawyers the reverend was an excellent witness his deep graveled voice needed no microphone as it carried around the courtroom yes he knew the details of the rape and the shooting they were members of his church he had known them for years they were family almost and he had held their hands and suffered with them after the rape yes he had talked to countless people since it happened and everyone had an opinion on guilt or innocence he and twentytwo other black ministers were members of the council and they had all talked about the hailey case and no there were no unmade minds in ford county a fair trial was not possible in ford county in his opinion buckley asked one question reverend agee have you talked to any black who would vote to convict carl lee hailey no suh i have not the reverend was excused he took a seat in the courtroom between two of his brethren on the council call your next witness noose said jake smiled at the da and announced sheriff ozzie walls buckley and musgrove immediately locked heads and whispered ozzie was on their side the side of law and order the prosecutions side it was not his job to help the defense proves you cant trust a nigger thought buckley they take up for each other when they know theyre guilty jake led ozzie through a discussion of the rape and the backgrounds of cobb and willard it was boring and repetitious and buckley wanted to object but hed been embarrassed enough for one day jake sensed that buckley would remain in his seat so he dwelt on the rape and the gory details finally noose had enough move on please mr brigance yes your honor sheriff walls did you arrest carl lee hailey i did do you believe he killed billy ray cobb and pete willard i do have you met anybody in this county who believes he did not shoot them no sir is it widely believed in this county that mr hailey killed them yes everbody believes it at least everbody ive talked to sheriff do you circulate in this county yes sir its my job to know whats goin on and you talk to a lot of people more than i would like have you run across anyone who hasnt heard of carl lee hailey ozzie paused and answered slowly a person would have to be deaf dumb and blind not to know of carl lee hailey have you met anyone without an opinion on his guilt or innocence theres no such person in this county can he get a fair trial here i dont know about that i do know you cant find twelve people who dont know all about the rape and the shootin no further questions jake said to noose is he your last witness yes sir any crossexamination mr buckley buckley remained in his seat and shook his head good said his honor lets take a short recess i would like to see the attorneys in chambers the courtroom erupted in conversation as the attorneys followed noose and mr pate through the door beside the bench noose closed the door to his chambers and removed his robe mr pate brought him a cup of black coffee gentlemen i am considering imposing a gag order from now until the trial is over i am disturbed by the publicity and i dont want this case tried by the press any comments buckley looked pale and shaken he opened his mouth but nothing happened good idea your honor jake said painfully had considered requesting such an order yes im sure you have ive noticed how you run from publicity what about you mr buckley uh who would it apply to you mr buckley you and mr brigance would be ordered not to discuss any aspect of the case or the trial with the press it would apply to everyone at least everyone under the control of this court the attorneys the clerks the court officials the sheriff but why asked buckley i dont like the idea of the two of you trying this case through the media im not blind youve both fought for the spotlight and i can only imagine what the trial will be like a circus thats what it will be not a trial but a threering circus noose walked to the window and mumbled something to himself he paused for a moment then continued mumbling the attorneys looked at each other then at the awkward frame standing in the window im imposing a gag order effective immediately from now until the trial is over violation of the order will result in contempt of court proceedings you are not to discuss any aspect of this case with any member of the press any questions no sir jake said quickly buckley looked at musgrove and shook his head now back to this hearing mr buckley you said you have over twenty witnesses how many do you really need five or six thats much better who are they floyd loyd whos he supervisor first district ford county whats his testimony hes lived here for fifty years been in office ten years or so in his opinion a fair trial is possible in this county i suppose hes never heard of this case noose said sarcastically im not sure who else nathan baker justice of the peace third district ford county same testimony well basically yes who else edgar lee baldwin former supervisor ford county he was indicted a few years back wasnt he jake asked buckleys face turned redder than jake had ever seen it his huge mouth dropped open and his eyes glazed over he was not convicted shot musgrove i didnt say he was i simply said he was indicted fbi wasnt it enough enough said noose what will mr baldwin tell us hes lived here all his life he knows the people of ford county and thinks mr hailey can receive a fair trial here musgrove answered buckley remained speechless as he stared at jake who else sheriff harry bryant tyler county sheriff bryant whatll he say musgrove was talking for the state now your honor we have two theories we are submitting in opposition to the motion for a change of venue first we contend a fair trial is possible here in ford county second if the court is of the opinion that a fair trial is not possible here the state contends that the immense publicity has reached every prospective juror in this state the same prejudices and opinions for and against which exist in this county exist in every county therefore nothing will be gained by moving the trial we have witnesses to support this second theory thats a novel concept mr musgrove i dont think ive heard it before neither have i added jake who else do you have robert kelly williams district attorney for the ninth district wheresthat southwestern tip of the state he drove all the way up here to testify that everyone in his neck of the woods has already prejudged the case yes sir who else grady listen district attorney fourteenth district same testimony yes sir is that all well your honor we have several more but their testimony will pretty much follow the other witnesses good then we can limit your proof to these six witnesses yes sir i will hear your proof i will allow each of you five minutes to conclude your arguments and i will rule on this motion within two weeks any questions it hurt to say no to the reporters they followed jake across washington street where he excused himself offered his no comments and sought refuge in his office undaunted a photographer from newsweek pushed his way inside and asked if jake would pose for a photograph he wanted one of those important ones with a stern look and thick leather books in the background jake straightened his tie and showed the photographer into the conference room where he posed in courtordered silence the photographer thanked him and left may i have a few minutes of your time ethel asked politely as her boss headed for the stairs certainly why dont you sit down we need to talk shes finally quitting jake thought as he took a seat by the front window whats on your mind money youre the highestpaid legal secretary in town you got a raise three months ago not my money please listen you dont have enough in the bank to pay this months bills june is almost gone and weve grossed seventeen hundred dollars jake closed his eyes and rubbed his forehead look at these bills she said waving a stack of invoices four thousand dollars worth how am i supposed to pay these how much is in the bank nineteen hundred dollars as of friday nothing came in this morning nothing not a dime what about the settlement on the liford case thats three thousand in fees ethel shook her head mr brigance that file has not been closed mr liford has not signed the release you were to take it by his house three weeks ago remember no i dont remember what about buck britts retainer thats a thousand dollars his check bounced the bank returned it and its been on your desk for two weeks she paused and took a deep breath youve stopped seeing clients you dont return phone calls and dont lecture me ethel and youre a month behind on everything thats enough ever since you took the hailey case thats all you think about youre obsessed with it its going to break us us how many paychecks have you missed ethel how many of those bills are past due huh several but no more than usual right yes but what about next

watered she dropped her head im sorry she muttered im just worried worried about what me and bud whats wrong with bud hes a very sick man i know that his blood pressure keeps acting up especially after the phone calls hes had three strokes in five years and hes due for another one hes scared were both scared how many phone calls several they threaten to burn our house or blow it up they always

you worry too much ill tell ozzie to watch your house a bit closer will you do that sure theyve been watching mine take my word ethel theres nothing to worry about probably just some young punks she wiped her eyes im sorry for crying and im sorry for being so irritable lately youve been irritable for forty years jake thought thats okay what about these she asked pointing to the invoices ill get the money dont worry about it willie hastings finished the second shift at pm and punched the clock next to ozzies office he drove straight to the hailey house it was his night to sleep on the couch someone slept on owens couch every night a brother a cousin or a friend wednesday was his night it was impossible to sleep with the lights on tonya refused to go near the bed unless every light in the house was on those men could be in the dark waiting for her she had seen them many times crawling along the floor toward her bed and lurking in the closets she had heard their voices outside her window and she had seen their bloodshot eyes peering in watching her as she got ready for bed she heard noises in the attic like the footsteps of the bulky cowboy boots they had kicked her with she knew they were up there waiting for everyone to go to sleep so they could come down and take her back to the woods once a week her mother and oldest brother climbed the folding stairs and inspected the attic with a flashlight and a pistol not a single room in the house could be dark when she went to bed one night as she lay wide awake next to her mother a light in the hall burned out she screamed violently until gwens brother drove to clanton to an allnight quick shop for more bulbs she slept with her mother who held her firmly for hours until the demons faded into the night and she drifted away at first gwen had trouble with the lights but after five weeks she napped periodically through the night the small body next to her wiggled and jerked even while it slept willie said good night to the boys and kissed tonya he showed her his gun and promised to stay awake on the couch he walked through the house and checked the closets when tonya was satisfied she lay next to her mother and stared at the ceiling she cried softly around midnight willie took off his boots and relaxed on the couch he removed his holster and placed the gun on the floor he was almost asleep when he heard the scream it was the horrible highpitched cry of a child being tortured he grabbed his gun and ran to the bedroom tonya was sitting on the bed facing the wall screaming and shaking she had seen them in the window waiting for her gwen hugged her the three boys ran to the foot of the bed and watched helplessly carl lee jr went to the window and saw nothing they had been through it many times in five weeks and knew there was little they could do gwen soothed her and laid her head gently on the pillow its okay baby mommas here and uncle willies here nobodys gonna get you its okay baby she wanted uncle willie to sit under the window with his gun and the boys to sleep on the floor around the bed they took their positions she moaned pitifully for a few moments then grew quiet and still willie sat on the floor by the window until they were all asleep he carried the boys one at a time to their beds and tucked them in he sat under her window and waited for the morning sun jake and atcavage met for lunch at claudes on friday they ordered ribs and slaw the place was packed as usual and for the first time in four weeks there were no strange faces the regulars talked and gossiped like old times claude was in fine formranting and scolding and cursing his loyal customers claude was one of those rare people who could curse a man and make him enjoy it atcavage had watched the venue hearing and would have testified had he been needed the bank had discouraged his testifying and jake did not want to cause trouble bankers have an innate fear of courtrooms and jake admired his friend for overcoming this paranoia and attending the hearing in doing so he became the first banker in the history of ford county to voluntarily appear in a courtroom without a subpoena while court was in session jake was proud of him claude raced by and told them they had ten minutes so shut up and eat jake finished a rib and mopped his face say stan speaking of loans i need to borrow five thousand for ninety days unsecured who said anything about loans you said something about banks i thought we were condemning buckley i was enjoying it you shouldnt criticize stan its an easy habit to acquire and an impossible one to break it robs your soul of character im terribly sorry how can you ever forgive me about the loan okay why do you need it why is that relevant what do you mean why is that relevant look stan all you should worry about is whether or not i can repay the money in ninety days okay can you repay the money in ninety days good question of course i can the banker smiled haileys got you bogged down huh the lawyer smiled yeah he admitted its hard to concentrate on anything else the trial is three weeks from monday and until then i wont concentrate on anything else how much will you make off this case nine hundred minus ten thousand nine hundred dollars yeah he couldnt borrow on his land remember cheap shot of course if youd loan carl lee the money on his land then i wouldnt have to borrow any i prefer to loan it to you great when can i get a check you sound desperate i know how long you guys take with your loan committees and auditors and vicepresidents here and vicepresidents there and maybe a vicepresident will finally approve my loan in a month or so if the manual says he can and if the home office is in the right mood i know how you operate atcavage looked at his watch three oclock soon enough i guess unsecured jake wiped his mouth and leaned across the table he spoke quietly my house is a landmark with landmark mortgages and youve got the lien on my car remember ill give you the first mortgage on my daughter but if you try to foreclose ill kill you now what security do you have in mind sorry i asked when can i get the check three pm claude appeared and refilled the tea glasses you got five minutes he said loudly eight replied jake listen mr big shot claude said with a grin this aint no courtroom and your picture in the paper aint worth two cents in here i said five minutes just as well my ribs were tough anyway i notice you didnt leave any might as well eat them as much as they cost they cost more if you complain were leaving atcavage said as he stood and threw a dollar on the table sunday afternoon the haileys picnicked under the tree away from the violence under the basketball goal the first heat wave of the summer had settled in and the heavy sticky humidity hung close to the ground and penetrated the shade gwen swatted flies as the children and their daddy ate warm fried chicken and sweated the children ate hurriedly and ran to a new swing ozzie had installed for the children of his inmates whatd they do at whitfield gwen asked nothin really asked a bunch of questions made me do some tests bunch of crap howd they treat you with handcuffs and padded walls no kiddin they put you in a room with padded walls gwen was amused and managed a rare giggle sure did they watched me like i was some animal said i was famous my guards told me they was proud of me one was white and one was black said that i did the right thing and they hoped i got off they was nice to me whatd the doctors say they wont say nothin till we get to trial and then theyll say im fine how do you know what theyll say jake told me he aint been wrong yet has he found you a doctor yeah some crazy drunk he drug up somewhere says hes a psychiatrist weve talked a couple of times in ozzies office whatd he say not much jake said hell say whatever we want him to say must be a real good doctor hed fit in good with those folks in whitfield wheres he from jackson i think he wasnt too sure of anything he acted like i was gonna kill him too i swear he was drunk bolh times we talked he asked some questions that neither one of us understood took some notes like a real big shot said he thought he could help me i asked jake about him jake said not to worry that he would be sober at the trial but i think jakes worried too then why are we usin him cause hes free owes somebody some favors a real shrinkd cost over a thousand dollars just to evaluate me and then another thousand or so to come testify at trial a cheap shrink needless to say i cant pay it gwen lost her smile and looked away we need some money around the house she said without looking at him how much coupla hundred for groceries and bills how much you got less than fifty ill see what i can do she looked at him what does that mean what makes you think you can get money while youre in jail carl lee raised his eyebrows and pointed at his wife she was not to question him he still wore the pants even though he put them on in jail he was the boss im sorry she whispered reverend agee peered through a crack in one of the huge stained glass windows of his church and watched with satisfaction as the clean cadillacs and lincolns arrived just before five sunday afternoon he had called a meeting of the council to assess the hailey situation and plan strategy for the final three weeks before the trial and to prepare for the arrival of the naacp lawyers the weekly collections had gone wellover seven thousand dollars had been gathered throughout the county and almost six thousand had been deposited by the reverend in a special account for the carl lee hailey legal defense fund none had been given to the family agee was waiting for the naacp to direct him in spending the money most of which he thought should go to the defense fund the sisters in the church could feed the family if they got hungry the cash was needed elsewhere the council talked of ways to raise more money it was not easy getting money from poor people but the issue was hot and the time was right and if they didnt raise it now it would not be raised they agreed to meet the following day at the springdale church in clanton the naacp people were expected in town by morning no press it was to be a work session norman reinfeld was a thirtyyearold genius in criminal law who held the record for finishing harvards law school at the age of twentyone and after graduation declined a most generous offer to join his father and grandfathers prestigious wall street law factory opting instead to take a job with the naacp and spend his time fighting furiously to keep southern blacks off death row he was very good at what he did although through no fault of his own he was not very successful at what he did most southern blacks along with most southern whites who faced the gas chamber deserved the gas chamber but reinfeld and his team of capital murder defense specialists won more than their share and even in the ones they lost they usually managed to keep the convicts alive through a myriad of exhausting delays and appeals four of his former clients had either been gassed electrocuted or lethally injected and that was four too many for reinfeld he had watched them all die and with each execution he renewed his vow to break any law violate any ethic contempt any court disrespect any judge ignore any mandate or do whatever it took to prevent a human from legally killing another human he didnt worry much about the illegal killings of humans such as those killings so artfully and cruelly achieved by his clients it wasnt his business to think about those killings so he didnt instead he vented his righteous and sanctimonious anger and zeal at the legal killings he seldom slept more than three hours a night sleep was difficult with thirtyone clients on death row plus seventeen clients awaiting trial plus eight egotistical attorneys to supervise he was thirty and looked fortyfive he was old abrasive and illtempered in the normal course of his business he would have been much too busy to attend a gathering of local black ministers in clanton mississippi but this was not the normal case this was hailey the vigilante the father driven to revenge the most famous criminal case in the country at the moment this was mississippi where for years whites shot blacks for any reason or no reason and no one cared where whites raped blacks and it was considered sport where blacks were hanged for fighting back and now a black father had killed two white men who raped his daughter and faced the gas chamber for something that thirty years earlier would have gone unnoticed had he been white this was the case his case and he would handle it personally on monday he was introduced to the council by reverend agee who opened the meeting with a lengthy and detailed review of the activities in ford county reinfeld was brief he and his team could not represent mr hailey because he had not been hired by mr hailey so a meeting was imperative today preferably tomorrow morning at the latest because he had a flight out of memphis at noon he was needed in a murder trial somewhere in georgia reverend agee promised to arrange a meeting with the defendant as soon as possible he was friends with the sheriff fine said reinfeld just get it done how much money have you raised reinfeld asked fifteen thousand from you folks agee answered i know that how much locally six thousand agee said proudly six thousand repeated reinfeld is that all i thought you people were organized wheres all this great local support you were talking about six thousand how much more can you raise weve only got three weeks the council members were silent this jew had a lot of nerve the only white man in the group and he was on the attack how much do we need asked agee that depends reverend on how good a defense you want for mr hailey ive only got eight other attorneys on my staff five are in trial at this very moment weve got thirtyone capital murder convictions at various stages of appeal weve got seventeen trials scheduled in ten states over the next five months we get ten requests each week to represent defendants eight of which we turn down because we simply dont have the staff or the money for mr hailey fifteen thousand has been contributed by two local chapters and the home office now you tell me that only six thousand has been raised locally thats twentyone thousand fpr that amount youll get the best defense we can afford two attorneys at least one psychiatrist but nothing fancy twentyone thousand gets a good defense but not what i had in mind what exactly did you have in mind a firstclass defense three or four attorneys a battery of psychiatrists half dozen investigators a jury psychologist just to name a few this is not your runofthemill murder case i want to win i was led to believe that you folks wanted to win how much asked agee fifty thousand minimum a hundred thousand would be nice look mr reinfeld youre in mississippi our people are poor theyve given generously so far but theres no way we can raise another thirty thousand here reinfeld adjusted his hornrimmed glasses and scratched his graying beard how much more can you raise another five thousand maybe thats not much money not to you but it is to the black folk of ford county reinfeld studied the floor and continued stroking his beard how much has the memphis chapter given five thousand answered someone from memphis atlanta five thousand how about the state chapter which state mississippi none none none why not ask him agee said pointing at reverend henry hillman the state director uh we tryin to raise some money now hillman said weakly but how much have you raised so far asked agee well uh we got nothin right you aint raised nothin have you hillman agee said loudly come on hillman tell us how much you raised chimed in reverend roosevelt vicechairman of the council hillman was dumbfounded and speechless he had been sitting quietly on the front pew minding his own business half asleep suddenly he was under attack the state chapter will contribute sure you will hillman you folks at state are constantly badgerin us locals to contribute here and donate there for this cause and that cause and we never see any of the money you always cryin about bein so broke and were always sendin money to state but when we need help state dont do a thing but show up here and talk thats not true dont start lyin hillman reinfeld was embarrassed and immediately aware that a nerve had been touched gentlemen gentlemen lets move on he said diplomatically good idea hillman said when can we meet with mr hailey reinfeld asked ill arrange a meetin for in the mornin agee said where can we meet i suggest we meet in sheriff walls office in the jail hes black you know the only black sheriff in mississippi yes ive heard i think hell let us meet in his office good who is mr haileys attorney local boy jake brigance make sure hes invited well ask him to help us on the case itll ease the pain ethels obnoxious highpitched bitchy voice broke the tranquility of the late afternoon and startled her boss mr brigance sheriff walls is on line two she said through the intercom okay do you need me for anything else sir no see you in the morning jake punched line two hello ozzie whats up listen jake weve got a bunch of naacp big shots in town what else is new no this is different they wanna meet with carl lee in the mornin why some guy named reinfeld ive heard of him he heads up their capital murder team norman reinfeld yeah thats him ive been waiting for this well hes here and he wants to talk to carl lee why are you involved reverend agee called me he wants a favor of course he asked me to call you the answer is no emphatically no ozzie paused a few seconds jake they want you oe present you mean im invited yes agee said reinfeld insisted on it he wants you to be here where in my office nine am jake breathed deeply and replied slowly okay ill be there wheres carl lee in his cell get him in your office ill be there in five minutes what for we need to have a prayer meeting reinfeld and reverends agee roosevelt and hillman sat in a perfect row of folding chairs and faced the sheriff the defendant and jake who puffed a cheap cigar in a determined effort to pollute the small office he puffed mightily and stared nonchalantly at the floor trying his best to show nothing but absolute contempt for reinfeld and the reverends reinfeld was no pushover when it came to arrogance and his disdain for this simple smalltime lawyer was not well hidden because he made no attempt to hide it he was arrogant and insolent by nature jake had to work at it who called this meeting jake asked impatiently after a long uncomfortable silence uh well i guess we did answered agee as he searched reinfeld for guidance well get on with it what do you want take it easy now jake ozzie said reverend agee asked me to arrange the meeting so carl lee could meet mr reinfeld here fine theyve met now what mr reinfeld im here to offer my services and the services of my staff and the entire naacp to mr hailey said reinfeld what type of services asked jake legal of course carl lee did you ask mr reinfeld to come here asked jake nope sounds like solicitation to me mr reinfeld skip the lecture mr brigance you know what i do and you know why im here so you chase all your cases we dont chase anything were called in by local naacp members and other civil rights activists we handle only capital murder cases and were very good at what we do i suppose youre the only attorney competent to handle a case of this magnitude ive handled my share and lost your share most of my cases are supposed to be lost i see is that your position on this case do you expect to lose it reinfeld picked at his beard and glared at jake i didnt come here to argue with you mr brigance i know you came here to offer your formidable legal skills to a defendant whos never heard of you and happens to be satisfied with his attorney you came here to take my client i know exactly why youre here im here because the naacp invited me nothing more or less i see do you get all your cases from the naacp i work for the naacp mr brigance im in charge of its capital murder defense team i go where the naacp sends me how many clients do you have several dozen why is that important did they all have attorneys before you pushed yourself into their cases some did some didnt we always try to work with the local attorney jake smiled thats marvelous youre offering me a chance to carry your briefcase and chauffeur you around clanton i might even get to fetch you a sandwich during the noon recess what a thrill carl lee sat frozen with arms crossed and his eyes fixed on a spot in the rug the reverends watched him closely waiting for him to say something to his lawyer to tell him to shut up that he was fired and the naacp lawyers would handle the case they watched ana wauea dui sat calmly and listened we have a lot to offer mr hailey reinfeld said it was best to stay calm until the defendant decided who would represent him a tantrum might ruin things such as jake asked staff resources expertise experienced trial lawyers who do nothing but capital defense plus we have a number of highly competent doctors we use in these cases you name it we have it how much money do you have to spend thats none of your business is that so is it mr haileys business after all its his case perhaps mr hailey would like to know how much you have to spend in his defense would you mr hailey yep all right mr reinfeld how much do you have to spend reinfeld squirmed and looked hard at the reverends who looked hard at carl lee approximately twenty thousand so far reinfeld admitted sheepishly jake laughed and shook his head in disbelief twenty thousand yall are really serious about this arent you twenty thousand i thought you guys played in the big leagues you raised a hundred and fifty thousand for the cop killer in birmingham last year and he was convicted by the way you spent a hundred thousand for the whore in shreveport who killed her customer and she too was convicted i might add and you think this case is worth only twenty thousand how much do you have to spend asked reinfeld if you can explain to me how thats any of your business ill be glad to discuss it with you reinfeld started to speak then leaned forward and rubbed his temples why dont you talk to him reverend agee the reverends stared at carl lee they wished they were alone with him with no white folks around they could talk to him like he was a nigger they could explain things to him tell him to fire this young white boy and get him some real lawyers naacp lawyers lawyers who knew how to fight for blacks but they were not alone with him and they couldnt curse him they had to show respect for the white folks present agee spoke first look here carl lee we tryin to help you we brought in mr reinfeld here and hes got all his lawyers and everbody at your disposal to help you now we aint got nothin against jake here hes a fine young lawyer but he can work with mr reinfeld we dont want you to fire jake we just want you to hire mr reinfeld too they can all work together forget that said jake agee paused and looked helplessly at jake come on jake we aint got nothin against you its a big chance for you you can work with some real big lawyers get some real good experience we let me make it real clear reverend if carl lee wants your lawyers fine but im not playing gofer for anyone im either in or out nothing in between my case or your case the courtroom is not big enough for me reinfeld and rufus buckley reinfeld rolled his eyes and looked at the ceiling shaking his head slowly and grinning with an arrogant little smirk you sayin its up to carl lee asked reverend agee of course its up to him hes hired me he can fire me hes already done it once im not the one facing the gas chamber how bout it carl lee asked agee carl lee uncrossed his arms and stared at agee this twenty thousand whats it for really its more like thirty thousand answered reinfeld the local folks have pledged another ten thousand the money will be used for your defense none of its attorney fees well need two or three investigators two maybe three psychiatric experts we often use a jury psychologist to assist us in selecting the jury our defenses are very expensive uh huh how much money has been raised by local people asked carl lee about six thousand answered reinfeld who collected mis money reinfeld looked at agee the churches answered the reverend who collected the money from the churches asked carl lee we did answered agee you mean you did said carl lee well uh right i mean each church gave the money to me and i deposited it in a special bank account yeah and you deposited every nickel you received of course i did of course let me ask you this how much of the money have you offered to my wife and kids agee looked a bit pale or as pale as possible and quickly searched the faces of the other reverends who at the moment were preoccupied with a stink bug on the carpet they offered no help each knew agee had been taking his cut and each knew the family had received nothing agee had profited more than the family they knew it and carl lee knew it how much reverend repeated carl lee well we thought the money how much reverend the money is gonna be spent on lawyer fees and stuff like that that aint what you told your church is it you said it was for the support of the family you almost cried when you talked about how my family might starve to death if the folks didnt donate all they could didnt you reverend the moneys for you carl lee you and your family right now we think it could be better spent on your defense and what if i dont want your lawyers what happens to the twenty thousand jake chuckled good question what happens to the money if mr hailey doesnt hire you mr reinfeld its not my money answered reinfeld reverend agee asked jake the reverend had had enough he grew defiant and belligerent he pointed at carl lee listen here carl lee we busted our butts to raise this money six thousand bucks from the poor people of this county people who didnt have it to give we worked hard for this money and it was given by poor people your people people on food stamps and welfare and medicaid people who couldnt afford to donate a dime but they gave for one reason and only one reason they believe in you and what you did and they want you to walk outta that courtroom a free man dont say you dont want the money dont preach to me carl lee replied softly you say the poor folks of this county gave six thousand right whered the rest of the money come from naacp five thousand from atlanta five from memphis and five from national and its strictly for your defense fees if i use mr reinfeld here right and if i dont use him the fifteen thousand disappears right what about the other six thousand good question we aint discussed that yet we thought youd appreciate us for raisin money and tryin to help were offerin the best lawyers and obviously you dont care the room was silent for an eternity as the preachers the lawyers and the sheriff waited for some message from the defendant carl lee chewed on his lower lip and stared at the floor jake lit another cigar he had been fired before and he could handle it again you gotta know right now carl lee asked finally no said agee yes said reinfeld the trial is less than three weeks away and were two months behind already my time is too valuable to wait on you mr hailey either you hire me now or forget it ive got a plane to catch well ill tell you what you do mr reinfeld you go and catch your plane and dont ever worry bout comin back to clanton on my behalf ill take my chances with my friend jake the ford county klavern was founded at midnight thursday july in a small pasture next to a dirt road deep in a forest somewhere in the northern part of the county the six inductees stood nervously before the huge burning cross and repeated strange words offered by a wizard a dragon and two dozen whiterobed klansmen watched and chanted when appropriate a guard with a gun stood quietly down the road occasionally watching the ceremony but primarily watching for uninvited guests there were none precisely at midnight the six fell to their knees and closed their eyes as the white hoods were ceremoniously placed onto their heads they were klansmen now these six freddie cobb brother of the deceased jerry maples clifton cobb ed wilburn morris lancaster and terrell grist the grand dragon hovered above each one and chanted the sacred vows of klanhood the flames from the cross scorched the faces of the new members as they knelt and quietly suffocated under the heavy robes and hoods sweat dripped from their red faces as they prayed fervently for the dragon to shut up with his nonsense and finish the ceremony when the chanting stopped the new members rose and quickly retreated from the cross they were embraced by their new brothers who grabbed their shoulders firmly and pounded primal incantations onto their sweaty collarbones the heavy hoods were removed and the klansmen both new members and old walked proudly from the pasture and into the rustic cabin across the dirt road the same guard sat on the front steps as the whiskey was poured around the table and plans were made for the trial of carl lee hailey deputy pirtle pulled the graveyard shift ten to six and had stopped for coffee and pie at gurdys allnight diner on the highway north of town when his radio blared out the news that he was wanted at the jail it was three minutes after midnight friday morning pirtle left his pie and drove a mile south to the jail whats up he asked the dispatcher we got a call a few minutes ago anonymous from someone lookin for the sheriff i explained that he was not on duty so they asked for whoever was on duty thats you they said it was very important and theyd call back in fifteen minutes pirtle poured some coffee and relaxed in ozzies big chair the phone rang its for you yelled the dispatcher hello answered pirtle whos this asked the

this aint no joke and if you think its a joke just sit there and wait for his house to go up it may happen any minute the voice became silent but did not disappear pirtle listened you still there good night deputy the receiver clicked pirtle jumped to his feet and ran to the dispatcher did you listen of course i did call ozzie and tell him to get down here ill be at the brigance house pirtle hid his patrol car in a driveway on monroe street and walked across the front lawns to jakes house he saw noth ing it was am he walked arouno me nuusc wim flashlight and noticed nothing unusual every house on the street was dark and asleep he unscrewed the light bulb on the front porch and took a seat in a wicker chair he waited the oddlooking foreign car was parked next to the oldsmobile under the veranda he would wait and ask ozzie about notifying jake headlights appeared at the end of the street pirtle slumped lower in the chair certain he could not be seen a red pickup moved suspiciously toward the brigance house but did not stop he sat up and watched it disappear down the street moments later he noticed two figures jogging from the direction of the square he unbuttoned his holster and removed his service revolver the first figure was much larger than the second and seemed to run with more ease and grace it was ozzie the other was nesbit pirtle met the two in the driveway and they retreated into the darkness of the front porch they whispered and watched the street what exactly did he say asked ozzie said someones gonna blow up jakes house between now and three am said it was no joke is that all yep he wasnt real friendly how long you been here twenty minutes ozzie turned to nesbit give me your radio and go hide in the backyard stay quiet and keep your eyes open nesbit scurried to the rear of the house and found a small opening between the shrubs along the back fence crawling on all fours he disappeared into the shrubs from his nest he could see the entire rear of the house you gonna tell jake asked pirtle not yet we might in a minute if we knock on the door theyll be turnin on lights and we dont need that right now yeah but what if jake hears us and comes through the door firin away he might think were just a couple of niggers tryin to break in ozzie watched the street and said nothing look ozzie put yourself in his place the cops have your house surrounded at one oclock in the mornin waitin for somebody to throw a bomb now would you wanna stay in bed asleep or would you wanna know about it ozzie studied the houses in the distance listen sheriff we better wake them up what if we dont stop whoevers plannin this and somebody inside the house gets hurt we get blamed right ozzie stood and punched the doorbell unscrew that light bulb he ordered pointing at the porch ceiling i already did ozzie punched the doorbell again the wooden door swung open and jake walked to the storm door and stared at the sheriff he was wearing a wrinkled nightshirt that fell just below his knees and he held a loaded in his right hand he slowly opened the storm door what is it ozzie he asked can i come in yeah whats going on stay here on the porch ozzie told pirtle ill be just a minute ozzie closed the front door behind them and turned off the light in the foyer they sat in the dark living room overlooking the porch and the front yard start talking jake said bout a half hour ago we took an anonymous call from someone who said that someone planned to blow up your house between now and three am were takin it serious thanks ive got pirtle on the front porch and nesbit in the backyard bout ten minutes ago pirtle saw a pickup drive by real interested like but thats all weve seen have you searched around the house yeah nothin they aint been here yet but somethin tells me this is the real thing why just a hunch jake laid the beside him on the couch and rubbed his temples whats your suggestion sit and wait thats all we can do you got a rifle ive got enough guns to invade cuba why dont you get it and get dressed take a position in one of those cute little windows upstairs well niae ouiside and wait have you got enough men yeah i figure therell only be one or two of them whos them dont know could be the klan could be some freelancers who knows both men sat in deep thought and stared at the dark street they could see the top of pirtles head as he slumped in the wicker chair just outside the window jake you remember those three civil rights workers killed by the klan back in found them buried in a levee down around philadelphia sure i was a kid but i remember those boys woulcpve never been found if someone hadnt told where they was that someone was in the klan an informant seems like that always happened to the klan somebody on the inside was always squealin you think its the klan sure looks like it if it was just one or two freelancers then who else would know about it the bigger the group the better the chance of someone tippin us off that makes sense but for some reason im not comforted by it of course it could be a joke nobodys laughing you gonna tell your wife yeah id better go do that i would too but dont be turnin on lights you might scare them off but i would like to scare them off and id like to catch them if we dont catch them now theyll try again and next time they might forget to call us ahead of time carla dressed hurriedly in the dark she was terrified jake laid hanna on the couch in the den where she mumbled something and went back to sleep carla held her head and watched jake load a rifle ill be upstairs in the guest room dont turn on any lights the cops have the place surrounded so dont worry dont worry are you crazy try to go back to sleep sleep jake youve lost your mind they didnt wait long from his vantage point somewhere deep in the shrubs in front of the house ozzie saw him first a lone figure walking casually down the street from the direction opposite the square he had in his hand a small box or case of some sort when he was two houses away he left the street and cut through the front lawns of the neighbors ozzie pulled his revolver and nightstick and watched the man walk directly toward him jake had him in the scope of his deer rifle pirtle crawled like a snake across the porch and into the shrubs ready to strike suddenly the figure darted across the front lawn next door and to the side of jakes house he carefully laid the small suitcase under jakes bedroom window as he turned to run a huge black nightstick crashed across the side of his head ripping his right ear in two places each barely hanging to his head he screamed and fell to the ground i got him ozzie yelled pirtle and nesbit sprinted to the side of the house jake calmly walked down the stairs ill be back in a minute he told carla ozzie grabbed the suspect by the neck and sat him next to the house he was conscious but dazed the suitcase was inches away whats your name ozzie demanded he moaned and clutched his head and said nothing i asked you a question ozzie said as he hovered over his suspect pirtle and nesbit stood nearby guns drawn too frightened to speak or move jake stared at the suitcase i aint sayin came the reply ozzie raised the nightstick high over his head and drove it solidly against the mans right ankle the crack of the bone was sickening he howled and grabbed his leg ozzie kicked him in the face he fell backward and his head smashed into the side of the house he rolled to his side and groaned in pain jake knelt above the suitcase and put his ear next to it he jumped and retreated its ticking he said weakly ozzie bent over the suspect and laid the nightstick softly against his nose ive got one more question before i break ever bone in your body whats in the box no answer ozzie recoiled the nightstick and broke the other ankle whats in the box he shouted dynamite came the anguished reply pirtle dropped his gun nesbits blood pressure shot through his cap and he leaned on the house jake turned white and his knees vibrated he ran through the front door yelling at carla get the car keys get the car keys what for she asked nervously just do as i say get the car keys and get in the car he lifted hanna and carried her through the kitchen into the carport and laid her in the back seat of carlas cutlass he took carla by the arm and helped her into the car leave and dont come back for thirty minutes jake whats going on she demanded ill tell you later theres no time now just leave go drive around for thirty minutes stay away from this street but why jake what have you found dynamite she backed out of the driveway and disappeared when jake returned to the side of the house the suspects left hand had been handcuffed to the gas meter next to the window he was moaning mumbling cursing ozzie carefully lifted the suitcase by the handle and sat it neatly between the suspects broken legs ozzie kicked both legs to spread them he groaned louder ozzie the deputies and jake backed away slowly and watched him he began to cry i dont know how to defuse it he said through clenched teeth youd better learn fast jake said his voice somewhat stronger the suspect closed his eyes and lowered his head he bit his lip and breathed loudly and rapidly sweat dripped from his chin and eyebrows his ear was shredded and hung like a falling leaf give me a flashlight pirtle handed him a flashlight i need both hands he said try it with one ozzie said he placed his fingers gently on the latch and closed his eyes lets get outta here ozzie said they ran around the corner of the house and into the carport as far away as possible wheres your family ozzie asked gone recognize him nope said ozzie i never seen him said nesbit pirtle shook his head

together with silver electrical tape is it defused ozzie asked anxiously yeah he replied between heavy rapid breaths ozzie knelt before him and removed the clock and the wires he did not touch the dynamite where are your buddies no response he removed his nightstick and moved closer to the man im gonna start breakin ribs one at a time you better start talkin now where are your buddies kiss my ass ozzie stood and quickly looked around not at jake and the deputies but at the house next door seeing nothing he raised the nightstick the suspects left arm hung from the gas meter and ozzie planted the stick just below the left armpit he squealed and jerked to the left jake almost felt sorry for him where are they ozzie demanded no response jake turned his head as the sheriff landed

opened the door yes good leave her there well be leaving in a few minutes where are we going well discuss it inside jake poured the coffee and tried to act calm carla was scared and shaking and angry and making it difficult to act calm he described the bomb and suspect and explained that ozzie was searching for the accomplice i want you and hanna to go to wilmington and stay with your parents until after the trial he said she stared at the coffee and said nothing ive already called your dad and explained everything theyre scared too and they insist you stay with them until this thing is

youve lied to me thats not fair i think i underestimated this thing and now its too late she walked to the bedroom and began packing the plane leaves memphis at sixthirty your father will meet you at the raleigh airport at ninethirty yes sir fifteen minutes later they left clanton jake drove and carla ignored him at five they ate breakfast in the memphis airport hanna was sleepy but excited about seeing her grandparents carla said little she had much to say but as a rule they didnt argue in front of hanna she ate quietly and sipped her coffee and watched her husband casually read the paper as if nothing had happened jake kissed them goodbye and promised to call every day the plane left on time at seventhirty he was in ozzies office who is he jake asked the sheriff we have no idea no wallet no identification nothin and he aint talkin does anybody recognize him ozzie thought for a second well jake hes kinda hard to recognize right now got a lot of bandages on his face jake smiled you play rough dont you big guy only when i have to i didnt hear you object no i wanted to help what about his friend we found him sleepin in a red gmc bout a half a mile from your house terrell grist local

your daughter probably never found your house it was set for two am without the tip youd be dead jake so would your family jake felt dizzy and sat on the couch reaction set in like a hard kick to the groin a case of diarrhea almost manifested itself and he was nauseated you get your family off yeah he said weakly im gonna assign a deputy to you fulltime got a preference not really how bout nesbit fine thanks one other thing i guess you want this kept quiet if possible who knows about it just me and the deputies i think we can keep it under wraps until after the trial but i cant guarantee anything i understand try your best i will jake i know you will ozzie i appreciate you jake drove to the office made the coffee and lay on the couch in his office he wanted a quick nap but sleep was impossible his eyes burned but he could not close them he stared at the ceiling fan mr brigance ethel called over the intercom no response mr brigance somewhere in the deep recesses of his subconscious jake heard himself being pagedhe bolted upright yes he yelled judge noose is on the phone okay okay he mumbled as he staggered to his desk he checked his watch nine am he had slept for an hour good morning judge he said cheerfully trying to sound alert and awake good morning jake how are you just fine judge busy getting ready for the big trial i thought so jake what is your schedule today whats today he thought he grabbed his appointment book nothing but office work good i would like to have lunch with you at my home say around eleventhirty i would be delighted judge whats the occasion i want to discuss the hailey case fine judge ill see you at eleventhirty the nooses lived in a stately antebellum home off the town square in chester the home had been in the wifes family for over a century and although it could stand some maintenance and repair it was in decent condition jake had never been a guest in the house and had never met mrs noose although he had heard she was a snobby blue blood whose family at one time had money but lost it she was as unattractive as ichabod and jake wondered what the children looked like she was properly polite when she met jake at the door and attempted small talk as she led him to the patio where his honor was drinking iced tea and reviewing correspondence a maid was preparing a small table nearby good to see you jake ichabod said warmly thanks for coming over my pleasure judge beautiful place you have here they discussed the hailey trial over soup and chicken salad sandwiches ichabod was dreading the ordeal although he didnt admit it he seemed tired as if the case was already a burden he surprised jake with an admission that he detested buckley jake said he felt the same way jake im perplexed over this venue ruling he said ive studied your brief and buckleys brief and ive researched the law myself its a tough question last weekend i attended a judges conference on the gulf coast and i had a few drinks with judge denton on the supreme court he and i were in law school together and we were colleagues in the state senate were very close hes from dupree county in south mississippi and he says that everybody down there talks about the case people on the street ask him how hes gonna rule if the case winds up on appeal everybodys got an opinion and thats almost four hundred miles away now if i agree to change venue where do we go we cant leave the state and im convinced that everyone has not only heard about your client but already prejudged him would you agree well theres been a lot of publicity jake said carefully talk to me jake were not in court thats why i invited you here i want to pick your brain i know theres been a lot of publicity if we move it where do we go how about the delta noose smiled youd like that wouldnt you of course we could pick us a good jury over there one that would truly understand the issues yeah and one that would be half black i hadnt thought about that do you really believe those folks havent already prejudged this defendant i suppose so so where do we go did judge denton have a suggestion not really we discussed the courts traditional refusal to allow changes of venue except in the most heinous of cases its a difficult issue with a notorious crime that arouses passion both for and against the defendant with television and all the press nowadays these crimes are instant news and everyone knows the details long before the trial and this case tops them all even denton admitted hed never seen a case with this much publicity and he admitted it would be impossible to find a fair and impartial jury anywhere in mississippi suppose i leave it in ford county and your man is convicted then you appeal claiming venue should have been changed denton indicated he would be sympathetic with my decision not to move it he thinks a majority of the court would uphold my denial of the venue change of course thats no guarantee and we discussed it over several long drinks would you like a drink no thanks i just dont see any reason to move the trial from clanton if we did wed be fooling ourselves if we thought we could find twelve people who are undecided about mr haileys guilt sounds like youve already made up your mind judge i have were not changing venue the trial will be held in clanton im not comfortable with it but i see no reason to move the trial besides i like clanton its close to home and the air conditioning works in the courthouse noose reached for a file and found an envelope jake this is an order dated today overruling the request to change venue ive sent a copy to buckley and theres a copy for you the original is in here and i would appreciate you filing this with the clerk in clanton ill be glad to i just hope im doing the right thing ive really struggled with this its a tough job jake offered attempting sympathy noose called the maid and ordered a gin and tonic he insisted that jake view his rose garden and they spent an hour in the sprawling rear lawn admiring his honors flow ers jake thought of carla and hanna and his home and the dynamite but gallantly remained interested in ichabods handiwork friday afternoons often reminded jake of law school when depending on the weather he and his friends would either group in their favorite bar in oxford and guzzle happyhour beer and debate their newfound theories of law or curse the insolent arrogant terroristic law professors or if the weather was warm and sunny pile the beer in jakes wellused convertible beetle and head for the beach at sardis lake where the women from sorority row plastered their beautiful bronze bodies with oil and sweated in the sun and coolly ignored the catcalls from the drunken law students and fraternity rats he missed those innocent days he hated law schoolevery law student with any sense hated law schoolbut he missed the friends and good times especially the fridays he missed the pressureless lifestyle although at times the pressure had seemed unbearable especially during the first year when the professors were more abusive than normal he missed being broke because when he had nothing he owed nothing and most of his classmates were in the same boat now that he had an income he worried constantly about mortgages the overhead credit cards and realizing the american dream of becoming affluent not wealthy just affluent he missed his volkswagen because it had been his first new car a gift at high school graduation and it was paid for unlike the saab he missed being single occasionally although he was happily married and he missed beer either from a pitcher can or bottle it didnt matter he had been a social drinker only with friends and he spent as much time as possible with his friends he didnt drink every day in law school and he seldom got drunk but there had been several painful memorable hangovers then came carla he met her at the beginning of his last semester and six months later they married she was beautiful and thats what got his attention she was quiet and a little snobby at first like most of the wealthy sorority girls at ole miss but he found her to be warm and personable and lacking in selfconfidence he had never under stood how someone as beautiful as carla could be insecure she was a deans list scholar in liberal arts with no intention of ever doing more than teaching school for a few years her family had money and her mother had never worked this appealed to jakethe family money and the absence of a career ambition he wanted a wife who would stay home and stay beautiful and have babies and not try to wear the pants it was love at first sight but she frowned on drinking any type of drinking her father drank heavily when she was a child and there were painful memories so jake dried out his last semester in law school and lost fifteen pounds he looked great felt great and he was madly in love but he missed beer there was a country grocery a few miles out of chester with a coors sign in the window coors had been his favorite in law school although at that time it was not for sale east of the river it was a delicacy at ole miss and the bootlegging of coors had been profitable around the campus now that it was available everywhere most folks had returned to budweiser it was friday and hot carla was nine hundred miles away he had no desire to go to the office and anything there could wait until tomorrow some nut just tried to kill his family and remove his landmark from the national register of historic places the biggest trial of his career was ten days away he was not readyand the pressure was mounting he had just lost his most critical pretrial motion and he was thirsty jake stopped and bought a sixpack of coors it took almost two hours to travel the sixty miles from chester to clanton he enjoyed the diversion the scenery the beer he stopped twice to relieve himself and once to get another sixpack he felt great there was only one place to go in his condition not home not the office certainly not the courthouse to file ichabods villainous order he parked the saab behind the nasty little porsche and glided up the sidewalk with cold beer in hand as usual lucien was rocking slowly on the front porch drinking and reading a treatise on the insanity defense he closed the book and noticing the beer smiled at his former associate jake just grinned at him whats the occasion jake nothing really just got thirsty i see what about your wife she doesnt tell me what to do im my own man im the boss if i want beer ill drink some beer and shell say nothing jake took a long sip she must be outta town north carolina when did she leave six this morning flew from memphis with hanna shell stay with her parents in wilmington until the trials over theyve got a fancy little beach house where they spend their summers she left this morning and youre drunk by midafternoon im not drunk jake answered yet how long you been drinkin coupla hours i bought a sixpack when i left nooses house around onethirty how long have you been drinking i normally drink my breakfast why were you at his house we discussed the trial over lunch he refused to change venue he what you heard me the trial will be in clanton lucien took a drink and rattled his ice sallie he screamed did he give any reason yeah said it would be impossible to find jurors anywhere who hadnt heard of the case i told you so thats a good common sense reason not to move it but its a poor legal reason noose is wrong sallie returned with a fresh drink and took jakes beer to the refrigerator lucien took a slug and smacked his lips he wiped his mouth with his arm and took another long drink you know what that means dont you he asked sure an allwhite jury that plus a reversal on appeal if hes convicted dont bet on it noose has already consulted with the supreme court he thinks the court will affirm him if challenged he thinks hes on solid ground hes an idiot i can show him twenty cases that say the trial should be moved i think hes afraid to move it why would noose be afraid hes taking some heat from who lucien admired the golden liquid in his large glass and slowly stirred the ice cubes with a finger he grinned and looked as though he knew something but wouldnt tell unless he was begged from who jake demanded glaring at his friend with shiny pink eyes buckley lucien said smugly buckley jake repeated i dont understand i knew you wouldnt do you mind explaining i guess i could but you cant repeat it its very confidential came from good sources who cant tell who are your sources jake insisted i said i cant tell wont tell okay how can buckley put pressure on noose if youll listen ill tell you buckley has no influence over noose noose despises him told me so himself today over lunch i realize that then how can you say noose is feeling some heat from buckley if youll shut up ill tell you jake finished a beer and called for sallie you know what a cutthroat and political whore buckley is jake nodded you know how bad he wants to win this trial if he wins he thinks it will launch his campaign for attorney general governor said jake whatever hes ambitious okay okay well hes been getting political chums throughout the district to call noose and suggest that the trial be held in ford county some have been real blunt with noose like move the trial and well get you in the next election leave it in clanton and well help you get reelected i dont believe that fine but its true how do you know sources whos called him one example remember that thug that used to be sheriff in van buren county motley fbi got him but hes out now still a very popular man in that county yeah i remember i know for a fact he went to nooses house with a couple of sidekicks and suggested very strongly that noose leave the trial here buckley put them up to it what did noose say they all cussed each other real good motley told noose he wouldnt get fifty votes in van buren county next election they promised to stuff ballot boxes harass the blacks rig the absentee ballots the usual election practices in van buren county and noose knows theyll do it why should he worry about it dont be stupid jake hes an old man who can do nothing but be a judge can you imagine him trying to start a law practice he makes sixty thousand a year and would starve if he got beat most judges are like that hes got to keep that job buckley knows it so hes talking to the local bigots and pumping them up and telling how this nogood nigger might be acquitted if the trial is moved and that they should put a little heat on the judge thats why noose is feeling some pressure they drank for a few minutes in silence both rocking quietly in the tall wooden rockers the beer felt great theres more lucien said to what to noose what is it hes had some threats not political threats but death threats i hear hes scared to death got the police over there guarding his house carries a gun now i know the feeling jake mumbled yeah i heard heard what about the dynamite who was he jake was flabbergasted he stared blankly at lucien unable to speak dont ask i got connections who was he no one knows sounds like a pro thanks youre welcome to stay here ive got five bedrooms the sun was gone by eightfifteen when ozzie parked his patrol car behind the saab which was still parked behind the porsche he walked to the foot of the steps leading up to the porch lucien saw him first hello sheriff he attempted to say his tongue thick and ponderous evenin lucien wheres jake lucien nodded toward the end of the porch where jake lay sprawled on the swing hes taking a nap lucien explained helpfully ozzie walked across the squeaking boards and stood above the comatose figure snoring peacefully he punched him gently in the ribs jake opened his eyes and struggled desperately to sit up carla called my office lookin for you shes worried sick shes been callin all afternoon and couldnt find you nobodys seen you she thinks youre dead jake rubbed his eyes as the swing rocked gently tell her im not dead tell her youve seen me and talked to me and you are convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that i am not dead tell her ill call her tomorrow tell her ozzie please tell her no way buddy youre a big boy you call her and tell her ozzie walked off the porch he was not amused jake struggled to his feet and staggered into the house wheres the phone he yelled at sallie as he dialed he could hear lucien on the porch laughing uncontrollably the last hangover had been in law school six or seven years earlier he couldnt remember the date that is he couldnt remember the date but the pounding head dry mouth short breath and burning eyes brought back painful vivid memories of long and unforgettable bouts with the tasty brown stuff he knew he was in trouble immediately when his left eye opened the eyelids on the right one were matted firmly together and they would not open unless manually opened with fingers and he did not dare move he lay there in the dark room on a couch fully dressed including shoes listening to his head pound and watching the ceiling fan rotate slowly he felt nauseated his neck ached because there was no pillow his feet throbbed because of the shoes his stomach rolled and flipped and promised to erupt death would have been welcome jake had problems with hangovers because he could not sleep them off once his eyes opened and his brain awoke and began spinning again and the throbbing between his temples set in he could not sleep he had never understood this his friends in law school could sleep for days with a hangover but not jake he never managed more than a few hours after the last can or bottle was empty why that was always the question the next morning why did he do it a cold beer was refreshing maybe two or three but ten fifteen even twenty he had lost count after six beer lost its taste and from then on the drinking was just for the sake of drinking and getting drunk lucien had been very helpful before dark he had sent sallie to the store for a whole case of coors which he gladly paid for then encouraged jake to drink there were a few cans left it was luciens fault slowly he lifted his legs one at a time and placed his feet on the floor he gently rubbed his temples to no avail he breathed deeply but his heart pounded rapidly pumping more blood to his brain and fueling the small jackhammers at work on the inside of his head he had to have water his putted to the point where it was easier to leave his mouth open like a dog in heat why oh why he stood carefully slowly retardedly and crept into the kitchen the light above the stove was shielded and dim but it penetrated the darkness and pierced his eyes he rubbed his eyes and tried to clean them with his smelly fingers he drank the warmwater slowly and allowed it to run from his mouth and drip on the floor he didnt care sallie would clean it the clock on the counter said it was twothirty gaining momentum he walked awkwardly yet quietly through the living room past the couch with no pillow and out the door the porch was littered with empty cans and bottles why he sat in the hot shower in his office for an hour unable to move it relieved some of the aches and soreness but not the violence swirling around his brain once in law school he had managed to crawl from his bed to the refrigerator for a beer he drank it and it helped then he drank another and felt much better he remembered this now while sitting in the shower and the thought of another beer made him vomit he lay on the conference table in his underwear and tried his best to die he had plenty of life insurance they would leave his house alone the new lawyer could get a continuance nine days to trial time was scarce precious and he had just wasted one day with a massive hangover then he thought of carla and his head pounded harder he had tried to sound sober told her he and lucien had spent the afternoon reviewing insanity cases and he would have called earlier but the phones werent working at least luciens werent but his tongue was heavy and his speech slow and she knew he was drunk she was furiousa controlled fury yes her house was still standing that was all she believed at sixthirty he called her again she might be impressed if she knew he was at the office by dawn working diligently she wasnt with great pain and fortitude he sounded cheerful even hyper she was not impressed how do you feel she insisted great he answered with closed eyes what time did you go to bed what bed thought jake right after i called you she said nothing i got to the office at three oclock this morning he said proudly three oclock yeah i couldnt sleep but you didnt sleep any thursday night a touch of concern edged through her icy words and he felt better ill be okay i may stay with lucien some this week and next it might be safer over there what about the bodyguard yeah deputy nesbit hes parked outside asleep in his car she hesitated and jake could feel the phone lines thawing im worried about you she said warmly ill be fine dear ill call tomorrow ive got work to do he replaced the receiver ran to the restroom and vomited again the knocking persisted at the front door jake ignored it for fifteen minutes but whoever it was knew he was there and kept knocking he walked to the balcony who is it he yelled at the street the woman walked from the sidewalk under the balcony and leaned on a black bmw parked next to the saab her hands were thrust deep into the pockets of faded starched wellfitting jeans the noon sun burned brightly and blinded her as she looked up in his direction it also illuminated her light goldish red hair are you jake brigance she asked shielding her eyes with a forearm yeah whatta you want i need to talk to you im very busy its very important youre not a client are you he asked focusing his anu knowing sne was indeed not a client no i just need five minutes of your time jake unlocked the door she walked in casually as if she owned the place she shook his hand firmly im ellen roark he pointed to a seat by the door nice to meet you sit down jake sat on the edge of ethels desk one syllable or two i beg your pardon she had a quick cocky northeast accent but tempered with some time in the south is it rork or row ark roark thats rork in boston and row ark in mississippi mind if i call you ellen please do with two syllables can i call you jake yes please good i hadnt planned to call you mister boston huh yeah i was born there went to boston college my dad is sheldon roark a notorious criminal lawyer in boston i guess ive missed him what brings you to mississippi im in law school at ole miss ole miss howd you

oxford this summer im taking criminal procedure under guthrie and im bored crazy george guthrie yeah hes still crazy he flunked me in constitutional law my first year anyway id like to help you with the trial jake smiled and took a seat in ethels heavyduty rotating secretarial chair he studied her carefully her black cotton polo shirt was fashionably weathered and neatly pressed the outlines and subtle shadows revealed a healthy bustline no bra the thick wavy hair fell perfectly on her shoulders what makes you think i need help i know you practice alone and i know you dont have a law clerk how do you know all this newsweek ah yes a wonderful publication it was a good picture wasnt it you looked a bit stuffy but it was okay you look better in person what credentials do you bring with you genius runs in my family i finished summa cum laude at bc and im second in my law class last summer i spent three months with the southern prisoners defense league in birmingham and played gofer in seven capital trials i watched elmer wayne doss die in the florida electric chair and i watched willie ray ash get lethally injected in texas in my spare time at ole miss i write briefs for the aclu and im working on two death penalty appeals for a law firm in spartanburg south carolina i was raised in my fathers law office and i was proficient in legal research before i could drive ive watched him defend murderers rapists embezzlers extortionists terrorists assassins child abusers child fondlers child killers and children who killed their parents i worked forty hours a week in his office when i was in high school and fifty when i was in college he has eighteen lawyers in his firm all very bright very talented its a great training ground for criminal lawyers and ive been there for fourteen years im twentyfive years old and when i grow up i want to be a radical criminal lawyer like my dad stamping out me death penalty is that all my dads filthy rich and even though were irish catholic im an only child ive got more money than you do so ill work for free no charge a free law clerk for three weeks ill do all the research typing answering the phone ill even carry your briefcase and make the coffee i was afraid youd want to be a law partner no im a woman and im in the south i know my place why are you so interested in this case i want to be in the courtroom i love criminal trials big trials where theres a life on the line and pressure so thick you can see it in the air where the courtrooms packed and security is tight where half the people hate the defendant and his lawyers and the other half pray he gets off i love it and this is the trial of all trials im not a southerner and i find this place bewildering most of the time but i have developed a perverse love for it itll never make sense to me but it is fascinating the racial implications are enormous the trial of a black father for killing two white men who raped his daughtermy father said he would take the case for free tell him to stay in boston its a trial lawyers dream i just want to be there ill stay out of the way i promise just let me work in the background and watch the trial judge noose hates women lawyers so does every male lawyer in the south besides im not a lawyer im a law student ill let you explain that to him so ive got the job jake stopped staring at her and breathed deeply a minor wave of nausea vibrated through his stomach and lungs and took his breath the jackhammers had returned with a fury and he needed to be near the restroom yes youve got the job i could use some free research these cases are complicated as im sure you are aware she flashed a comely confident smile when do i start now jake led her through a quick tour of the office and assigned her to the war room upstairs they laid the hailey file on the conference table and she spent an hour copying it at twothirty jake awoke from a nap on his couch he walked downstairs to the conference room she had removed half the books from the shelves and had them scattered the length of the table with page markers sticking up every fifty or so pages she was busy taking notes not a bad library she said some of these books havent been used in twenty years i noticed the dust are you hungry yes im starving theres a little cafe around the corner where the specialty is grease and fried corn meal my system needs a shot of grease sounds delicious they walked around the square to claudes where the crowd was thin for a saturday afternoon there were no other whites in the place claude was absent and the silence was deafening jake ordered a cheeseburger onion rings and three headache powders got a headache ellen asked massive stress hangover hangover i thought you were a teetotaler and whered you hear that newsweek the article said you were a cleancut family man workaholic devout presbyterian who drank nothing and smoked cheap cigars remember how could you forget right you believe everything you read no good because last night i got plastered and ive puked all morning the law clerk was amused what do you drink i dontremember at least i didnt until last night i ano i nope its my last id forgotten how terrible these things are why do lawyers drink so much they learn how in law school does your dad drink are you kidding were catholic hes careful though do you drink sure all the time she said proudly then youll make a great lawyer jake carefully mixed the three powders in a glass of ice water and slugged it down he grimaced and wiped his mouth she watched intently with an amused smile whatd your wife say about what the hangover from such a devout and religious family man she doesnt know about it she left me early yesterday morning im sorry she went to stay with her parents until the trial is over weve had anonymous phone calls and death threats for two months now and early yesterday morning they planted dynamite outside our bedroom window the cops found it in time and they caught the men probably the klan enough dynamite to level the house and kill all of us that was a good excuse to get drunk im sorry to hear that the job youve just taken could be very dangerous you should know that at this point ive been threatened before last summer in dothan alabama we defended two black teenagers who had sodomized and strangled an eightyyearold woman no lawyer in the state would take the case so they called the defense league we rode into town on black horses and the mere sight of us would cause lynch mobs to form instantly on street corners ive never felt so hated in my life we hid in a motel in another town and felt safe until one night two men cornered me in the motel lounge and tried to abduct me what happened i carry a snubnosed in my purse and i convinced them i knew how to use it a snubnosed my father gave it to me for my fifteenth birthday i have a license he must be a hell of a guy hes been shot at several times he takes very controversial cases the kind you read about in the papers where the public is outraged and demanding that the defendant be hanged without a trial or a lawyer those are the cases he likes best he has a fulltime bodyguard big deal so do i his name is deputy nesbit and he couldnt hit the side of a barn with a shotgun he was assigned to me yesterday the food arrived she removed the onions and tomatoes from her claudeburger and offered him the french fries she cut it in half and nibbled around the edges like a bird hot grease dripped to her plate with each small bite she carefully wiped her mouth her face was gentle and pleasant with an easy smile that belied the aclu era burnthebra icanoutcussyou bitchiness jake knew was lurking somewhere near the surface there was not a trace of makeup anywhere on the face none was needed she was not beautiful not cute and evidently determined not to be so she had the pale skin of a redhead but it was healthy skin with seven or eight freckles splattered about the small pointed nose with each frequent smile her lips spread wonderfully and folded her cheeks into neat transient hollow dimples the smiles were confident challenging and mysterious the metallic green eyes radiated a soft fury and were fixed and unblinking when she talked it was an intelligent face attractive as hell jake chewed on his burger and tried to nonchalantly ignore her eyes the heavy food settled his stomach and for the first time in ten hours he began to think he might live seriously whyd you choose ole miss he asked its a good law school its my school but we dont normally attract the brightest students from the northeast thats ivy league country we send our smartest kids up there my father hates every lawyer with an ivy league degree he was dirt poor and scratched his way through law i v o cuuuicu me snuos from rich welleducated and incompetent lawyers all his life now he laughs at them he told me i could go to law school anywhere in the country but if i chose an ivy league school he would not pay for it then theres my mother i was raised on these enchanting stories of life in the deep south and i had to see for myself plus the southern states seemed determined to practice the death penalty so i think ill end up here why are you so opposed to the death penalty and youre not no im very much in favor of it thats incredible coming from a criminal defense lawyer id like to go back to public hangings on the courthouse lawn youre kidding arent you i hope tell me you are i am not she stopped chewing and smiling the eyes glowed fiercely and watched him for a signal of weakness you are serious i am very serious the problem with the death penalty is that we dont use it enough have you explained that to mr hailey mr hailey does not deserve the death penalty but the two men who raped his daughter certainly did i see how do you determine who gets it and who doesnt thats very simple you look at the crime and you look at the criminal if its a dope dealer who guns down an undercover narcotics officer then he gets the gas if its a drifter who rapes a threeyearold girl drowns her by holding her little head in a mudhole then throws her body off a bridge then you take his life and thank god hes gone if its an escaped convict who breaks into a farmhouse late at night and beats and tortures an elderly couple before burning them with their house then you strap him in a chair hook up a few wires pray for his soul and pull the switch and if its two dopeheads who gangrape a tenyearold girl and kick her with pointedtoe cowboy boots until her jaws break then you happily merrily thankfully gleefully lock them in a gas chamber and listen to them squeal its very simple its barbaric their crimes were barbaric death is too good for them much too good and if mr hailey is convicted and sentenced to die if that happens im sure ill spend the next ten years cranking out appeals and fighting furiously to save his life and if they ever strap him in the chair im sure ill be outside the prison with you and the jesuits and a hundred other kindly souls marching and holding candles and singing hymns and then stand beside his grave behind his church with his widow and children and wish id never met him have you ever witnessed an execution not that i recall ive watched two youd change your mind if you saw one good i wont see one its a horrible thing to watch were the victims families there yes in both instances were they horrified were their minds changed of course not their nightmares were over im surprised at you and im bewildered by people like you how can you be so zealous and dedicated in trying to save people who have begged for the death penalty and according to the law should get it whose law its not the law in massachusetts you dont say what do you expect from the only state mcgovern carried in you folks have always been tuned in with the rest of the country the claudeburgers were being ignored and their voices had grown too loud jake glanced around and caught a few stares ellen smiled again and took one of his onion rings what do you think of the aclu she asked crunching i suppose youve got a membership card in your purse i do then youre fired i joined when i was sixteen why so late you must have been the last one in your girl scout troop to join do you have any respect for the bill of rights i adore the bill of rights i despise the judges who interpret them eat they finished the burgers in silence watching each other carefully jake ordered coffee and two more headache powders so how do we plan to win this case she asked we i still have the job dont i yes just remember that im the boss and youre the clerk sure boss whats your strategy how would you handle it well from what i gather our client carefully planned the killings and shot them in cold blood six days after the rape it sounds exactly like he knew what he was doing he did so we have no defense and i think you should plead him guilty for a life sentence and avoid the gas chamber youre a real fighter just kidding insanity is our only defense and it sounds impossible to prove youre familiar with the mnaghten rule jake asked yes do we have a psychiatrist sort of hell say anything we want him to say that is if hes sober at trial one of your more difficult tasks as my new law clerk will be to make sure he is sober at trial it wont be easy believe me i live for new challenges in the courtroom all right row ark take a pen heres a napkin your boss is about to give you instructions she began making notes on a paper napkin i want a brief on the mnaghten decisions rendered by the mississippi supreme court in the past fifty years theres probably a hundred theres a big case from state vs hill where the court was bitterly divided five to four with the dissenters opting for a more liberal definition of insanity keep the brief short less than twenty pages can you type ninety words a minute i shouldve known id like it by wednesday youll have it there are some evidentiary points i need researched you saw those gruesome pictures of the two bodies noose normally allows the jury to see the blood and gore but id like to keep them away from the jury see if theres a way it wont be easy the rape is crucial to his defense i want the jury to know details this needs to be researched thoroughly ive got two or three cases you can start from and i think we can prove to noose that the rape is very relevant okay what else i dont know when my brain is alive again ill think of more but that will do it for now do i report monday morning yes but no sooner than nine i like my quiet time whats the dress code you look fine jeans and no socks i have one other employee a secretary by the name of ethel shes sixtyfour top heavy and thankfully she wears a bra it wouldnt be a bad idea for you ill think about it i dont need the distraction monday july one week until trial over the weekend word spread quickly that the trial would be in clanton and the small town braced for the spectacle the phones rang steadily at the three motels as the journalists and their crews confirmed reservations the cafes buzzed with anticipation a county maintenance crew swarmed around the courthouse after breakfast and began painting and polishing ozzie sent the yardboys from the jail with their mowers and weedeaters the old men under the vietnam monument whittled cautiously and watched all this activity the trusty who supervised the yard work asked them to spit their red man in the grass not on the sidewalk he was told to go to hell the thick dark bermuda was given an extra layer of fertilizer and a dozen lawn sprinklers were hissing and splashing by am by am the temperature was ninetytwo the merchants in the small shops around the square opened their doors to the humidity and ran their ceiling fans they called memphis and jackson and chicago for inventory to be sold at special prices next week noose had called jean gillespie the circuit court clerk late friday and informed her that the trial would be in her courtroom he instructed her to summon one hundred and fifty prospective jurors the defense had requested an enlarged panel from which to select the twelve and noose agreed jean and two deputy clerks spent saturday combing the voter registration books randomly selecting potential jurors following nooses specific instructions they culled those over sixtyfive one thousand names were chosen and each name along with its address was written on a small index card and thrown into a cardboard box the two deputy clerks then took turns drawing cards at random from the box one clerk was white one black each would pull a card blindly from the box and arrange it neatly on a folding table with the other cards when the count reached one hundred and fifty the drawing ceased and a master list was typed these were the jurors for state vs hailey each step of their selection had been carefully dictated by the honorable omar noose who knew exactly what he was doing if there was an allwhite jury and a conviction and a death sentence every single elementary step of the jury selection procedure would be attacked on appeal he had been through it before and had been reversed but not this time from the master list the name and address of each juror was typed on a separate jury summons the stack of summonses was kept in jeans office under lock until eight monday morning when sheriff ozzie walls arrived he drank coffee with jean and received his instructions judge noose wants these served between four pm and midnight tonight she said okay the jurors are to report to the courtroom promptly by nine next monday okay the summons does not indicate the name or nature of the trial and the jurors are not to be told anything i reckon theyll know probably so but noose was very specific your men are to say nothing about the case when the summonses are served the names of the jurors are very confidential at least until wednesday dont ask whynooses orders ozzie flipped through the stack how many do we have here one fifty a hundred and fifty why so many its a big case nooses orders itll take ever man ive got to serve these papers im sorry oh well if thats what his honor wants ozzie left and within seconds jake was standing at the counter flirting with the secretaries and smiling at jean gillespie he followed her back to her office he closed the door she retreated behind her desk and pointed at him he kept smiling i know why youre here she said sternly and you cant have it give me the list jean not until wednesday nooses orders wednesday why wednesday i dont know but omar was very specific give me the list jean jake i cant do you want me to get in trouble you wont get in trouble because no one will know it you know how well i can keep a secret he was not smiling now jean give me the damned list jake i just cant i need it and i need it now i cant wait until wednesday ive got work to do it wouldnt be fair to buckley she said weakly to hell with buckley do you think he plays fair hes a snake and you dislike him as much as i do probably more give me the list jean look jake weve always been close i think more of you than any lawyer i know when my son got in trouble i called you right i trust you and i want you to win this case but i cant defy a judges orders who helped you get elected last time me or buckley come on jake who kept your son out of jail me or buckley please who tried to put your son in jail me or buckley thats not fair jake who stood up for your husband when everybody and i mean everybody in the church wanted him gone when the books didnt balance its not a questionof loyalty jake i love you and carla and hanna but i just cant do it jake slammed the door and stormed out of the office jean sat at her desk and wiped tears from her cheeks at am harry rex barged into jakes office and threw a copy of the jury list on his desk dont ask he said beside each name he had made notes such as dont know or former clienthates niggers or works at the shoe factory might be sympathetic jake read each name slowly trying to place it with a face or a reputation there was nothing but names no addresses ages occupations nothing but names his fourthgrade schoolteacher from karaway one of his mothers friends from the garden club a former client shoplifting he thought a name from church a regular at the coffee shop a prominent farmer most of the names sounded white there was a willie mae jones leroy washington roosevelt tucker bessie lou bean and a few other black names but the list looked awfully pale he recognized thirty names at most whatta you think asked harry rex hard to tell mostly white but thats to be expected whered you get this dont ask i made notes by twentysix names thats the best i can do the rest i dont know youre a true friend harry rex im a prince are you ready for trial not yet but ive found a secret weapon what youll meet her later her yeah you busy wednesday night i dont think so why good meet here at eight lucien will be here maybe one or two others i want to take a couple of hours and talk about the jury who do we want lets get a profile of the model juror and go from there well cover each name and hopefully identify most of these people sounds like fun ill be here whats your model juror im not sure i think the vigilante would appeal to rednecks guns violence protection of women the rednecks would eat it up but my man is black and a bunch of rednecks would fry him he killed two of their own i agree id stay away from women they would have no sympathy for the rapists but they place a higher value on life taking an m and blowing their heads off is something women just dont understand you and i understand it because were fathers it appeals to us the violence and blood doesnt bother us we admire him youve got to pick oumc aumirers on tnat jury young fathers with some education thats interesting lucien said he would stick with women because theyre more sympathetic i dont think so i know some women whod cut your throat if you crossed them some of your clients yeah and one is on that list frances burdeen pick her and ill tell her how to vote you serious yep shell do anything i tell her can you be in court monday i want you to watch the jury during the selection process then help me decide on the twelve i wouldnt miss it jake heard voices downstairs and pressed his finger to his lips he listened then smiled and motioned for harry rex to follow him they tiptoed to the top of the stairs and listened to the commotion around ethels desk you most certainly do not work here ethel insisted i most certainly do i was hired saturday by jake brigance who i believe is your boss hired for what ethel demanded as a law clerk well he didnt discuss it with me he discussed it with me and gave me the job how much is he paying you a hundred bucks an hour oh my god ill have to speak with him first ive already spoken with him ethel its mrs twitty to you ethel studied her carefully from head to toe acidwashed jeans penny loafers no socks an oversized white cotton buttondown with evidently nothing on underneath youre not dressed appropriately for this office youre youre indecent harry rex raised his eyebrows and smiled at jake they watched the stairs and listened my boss who happens to be your boss said i could dress like this but you forgot something didnt you jake said i could forget it he told me you hadnt worn a bra in twenty years he said most of the women in clanton go braless so i left mine at home he what ethel screamed with arms crossed over her chest is he upstairs ellen asked coolly yes ill call him dont bother jake and harry rex retreated into the big office and waited for the law clerk she entered carrying a large briefcase good morning row ark jake said i want you to meet a good friend harry rex vonner harry rex shook her hand and stared at her shirt nice to meet you what was your first name ellen just call her row ark jake said shell clerk here until haileys over thats nice said harry rex still staring harry rex is a local lawyer row ark and one of the many you cannot trust whatd you hire a female law clerk for jake he asked bluntly row arks a genius in criminal law like most thirdyear law students and she works very cheap you have something against females sir ellen asked no maam i love females ive married four of them harry rex is the meanest divorce lawyer in ford county jake explained in fact hes the meanest lawyer period come to think of it hes the meanest man i know thanks said harry rex he had stopped staring at her she looked at his huge dirty scuffed worn wirigtips his ribbed nylon socks that had drooped into thick wads around his ankles his soiled and battered khaki pants his frayed navy blazer his brilliant pink wool tie that fell eight inches above his belt and she said i think hes cute i might make you wife number five harry rex said the attraction is purely physical she said watch it jake said theres been no sex in this office since lucien left said harry rex whos lucien jake and harry rex looked at each other youll meet him soon enough jake explained your secretary is very sweet ellen said i knew yall would hit it off shes really a doll once you get to know her how long does that take ive known her for twenty years said harry rex and im still waiting hows the research coming jake asked slow there are dozens of mnaghten cases and they are all very long im about half through i planned to work on it all day here that is if that pit bull downstairs doesnt attack me ill take care of her jake said harry rex headed for the door nice meetin you row ark ill see you around thanks harry rex said jake see you wednesday night the dirt and gravel parking lot of tanks tonk was full when jake finally found it after dark there had been no reason to visit tanks before and he was not thrilled about seeing the place now it was well hidden off a dirt road six miles out of clanton he parked far away from the small cinderblock building and toyed with the idea of leaving the engine running in case tank was not there and a quick escape became necessary but he quickly dismissed the stupid idea because he liked his car and theft was not only likely but highly probable he locked it then doublechecked it almost certain that all or part of it would be missing when he returned the juke box blasted from the open windows and he thought he heard a bottle crash on the floor or across a table or someones head he hesitated beside his car and decided to leave no it was important he sucked in his stomach held his breath and opened the ragged wooden door forty sets of black eyes immediately focused on this poor lost white boy with a coat and tie who was squinting and trying to focus inside the vast blackness of their tonk he stood there awkwardly desperately searching for a friend there were none michael jackson conveniently finished his song on the juke box and for an eternity the tonk was silent jake stayed close to the door he nodded and smiled and tried to act like one of the gang there were no other smiles suddenly there was movement at the bar and jakes knees began vibrating jake jake someone shouted it was the sweetest two words he had ever heard from behind the bar he saw his friend tank removing his apron and heading for him they shook hands warmly what brings you here i need to talk to you for a minute can we step outside sure whats up just business tank flipped on a light switch by the front door say everbody this here is carl lee haileys lawyer jake brigance a good friend of mine lets hear it for him the small room exploded in applause and bravos several of the boys at the bar grabbed jake and shook his hand tank reached in a drawer under the bar and pulled out a handful of jakes cards which he passed out like candy jake was breathing again and the color returned to his face outside they leaned on the hood of tanks yellow cadillac lionel richie echoed through the windows and the crowd returned to normal jake handed tank a copy of the list look at each name see how many of these folks you know ask around and find out what you can tank held the list near his eyes the light from the michelob sign in the window glowed over his shoulder how many are black you tell me thats one reason i want you to look at it circle the black ones if youre not sure find out if you know any of the white folks make a note ill be glad to jake this aint illegal is it naw but dont tell anybody i need it back by wednesday morning youre the boss tm uu jukc ncaciea tor the office it was almost ten ethel had retyped the list from the initial one provided by harry rex and a dozen copies had been handdelivered to selected trusted friends lucien stan atcavage tank dell at the coffee shop a lawyer in karaway named roland isom and a few others even ozzie got a list less than three miles from the tonk was a small neat whiteframed country house where ethel and bud iwitty had lived for almost forty years it was a pleasant house with pleasant memories of raising children who were now scattered up north the retarded son the one who greatly resembled lucien lived in miami for some reason the house was quieter now bud hadnt worked in years not since his first stroke in then a heart attack followed by two more major strokes and several small ones his days were numbered and he had long since accepted the fact that he would most likely catch the big one and die on his front porch shelling butterbeans thats what he hoped for anyway monday night he sat on the porch shelling butterbeans and listening to the cardinals on the radio ethel was working in the kitchen in the bottom of the eighth with the cards at bat and two on he heard a noise from the side of the house he turned the volume down probably just a dog then another noise he stood and walked to the end of the porch suddenly a huge figure dressed in solid black with red white and black war paint smeared wickedly across his face jumped from the bushes grabbed bud and yanked him off the porch buds anguished cry was not heard in the kitchen another warrior joined in and they dragged the old man to the foot of the steps leading up to the front porch one maneuvered him into a halfnelson while the other pounded his soft belly and bloodied his face within seconds he was unconscious ethel heard noises and scurried through the front door she was grabbed by a third member of the gang who twisted her arm tightly behind her and wrapped a huge arm around her throat she couldnt scream or talk or move and was held there on the porch terrified watching below as the two thugs took turns with her husband on the front sidewalk ten feet behind the violence stood three figures each garbed in a full flowing white robe with red garnishment each with a tall white pointed headdress from which fell a red and white mask that loosely covered each face they emerged from the darkness and watched over the scene as though they were the three wise men attending the manger after a long agonizing minute the beating grew monotonous enough said the ruler in the middle the three terrorists in black ran ethel rushed down the steps and slumped over her battered husband the three in white disappeared jake left the hospital after midnight with bud still alive but everyone pessimistic along with the broken bones he had suffered another major heart attack ethel had made a scene and blamed it all on jake you said there was no danger she screamed tell that to my husband its all your fault he had listened to her rant and rave and the embarrassment turned to anger he glanced around the small waiting room at the friends and relatives all eyes were on him yes they seemed to say it was all his fault gwen called the office early tuesday morning and the new secretary ellen roark answered the phone she fumbled with the intercom until she broke it then walked to the stairs and yelled jake its mr haileys wife he slammed a book shut and angrily picked up the receiver hello jake are you busy very whats on your mind she started crying jake we need money were broke and the bills are past due i havent paid the house note in two months and the mortgage company is callin i dont know who else to turn to what about your family theyre poor folks jake you know that theyll feed us and do what they can but they cant make our house notes and pay the utilities have you talked to carl lee not about money not lately theres not much he can do except worry and lord knows hes got enough to worry about what about the churches aint seen a dime how much do you need at least five hundred just to catch up i dont know bout next month ill guess ill worry then nine hundred minus five hundred left jake with four hundred dollars for a capital murder defense that had to be a record four hundred dollars he had an idea can you be at my office at two this afternoon ill have to bring the kids thats okay just be here ill be there he hung up and quickly searched the phone book for reverend ollie agee he found him at the church jake fed him a line about meeting to discuss the hailey trial and covering agees testimony said the reverend would be an important witness agee said he would be there at two the hailey clan arrived first and jake seated them around the conference table the kids remembered the room from the press conference and were awed by the long table thick swivel chairs and impressive rows of books when the reverend arrived he hugged gwen and made a fuss over the kids especially tonya ill be very brief reverend started jake there are some things we need to discuss for several weeks now you and the other black ministers in this county have been raising money for the haileys and youve done a real good job over six thousand i believe i dont know where the money is and its none of my business you offered the money to the naacp lawyers to represent carl lee but as you and i know those lawyers wont be involved in this case im the lawyer the only lawyer and so far none of the money has been offered to me i dont expect any of it evidently you dont care about what kind of defense he gets if you cant pick his lawyer thats fine i can live with that what really bothers me reverend is the fact that none and i repeat none of the money has been given to the haileys right gwen the empty look on her face had turned to one of amazement then disbelief then anger as she glared at the reverend six thousand dollars she repeated over six thousand at last reported count said jake and the money is lying in some bank while carl lee sits in jail gwens not working the bills are past due the only food comes from friends and foreclosure is a few days away now tell us reverend whatre your plans with the money agee smiled and said with an oily voice thats none of your business but its my business gwen said loudly you used my name and my familys name when you raised that money didnt you reverend i heard it myself told all the church folk that the love offerin as you called it was for my family i figured you had done spent the money on lawyers fee or somethin like that and now today i find out youve got it stuck in the bank i guess you plan to keep it agee was unmoved now wait a minute gwen we thought the money could best be spent on carl lee he declined the money when he refused to hire the naacp lawyers so i asked mr reinfeld the head lawyer what to do with the money he told me to save it because carl lee will need it for his appeal jake cocked his head sideways and clenched his teeth he started to rebuke this ignorant fool but realized agee did not understand what he was saying jake bit his lip i dont understand said gwen its simple said the reverend with an accommodating smile mr reinfeld said that carl lee would be convicted because he didnt hire him so then weve got to appeal right and after jake here loses the trial you and carl lee will of course be lookin for another lawyer who can save his life thats when well need reinfeld and thats when well need the money so you see its all for carl lee jake shook his head and silently cursed he cursed reinfeld more than agee gwens eyes flooded and she clenched her fists i dont understand all that and i dont want to understand it all i know is that im tired of beggin for food tired of dependin on others and tired of worryin about losin my house agee looked at her sadly i understand gwen but and if you got six thousand dollars of our money in the bank youre wrong not to give it to us weve got enough sense to spend it right carl lee jr and jarvis stood next to their mother and comforted her they stared at agee but its for carl lee the reverend said good jake said have you asked carl lee how he wants his money spent the dirty little grin left agees face and he squirmed in his chair carl lee understands what were doin he said without much conviction thank you thats not what i asked listen to me carefully have you asked carl lee how he wants his money spent i think its been discussed with him agee lied lets see jake said he stood and walked to the door leading to the small office next to the conference room the reverend watched nervously almost in panic jake opened the door and nodded to someone carl lee and ozzie casually walked in the kids yelled and ran to their father agee looked devastated after a few awkward minutes of hugs and kisses jake moved in for the kill now reverend why dont you ask carl lee how he wants to spend his six thousand dollars it aint exactly his said agee and it aint exactly yours shot ozzie carl lee removed tonya from his knee and walked to the chair where agee was sitting he sat on the edge of the table above the reverend poised and ready to strike if necessary let me make it real simple preacher so you wont have trouble understandin it you raised that money in my name for the benefit of my family you took it from the black folk of this county and you took it with the promise that itd go to help me and my family you lied you raised it so you could impress the naacp not to help my family you lied in church you lied in the newspapers you lied everwhere agee looked around the room and noticed that everyone including the kids was staring at him and nodding slowly carl lee put his foot in agees chair and leaned closer if you dont give us that money ill tell ever nigger i know that youre a lyin crook ill call ever member of your church and im one too remember and tell them we aint got a dime from you and when i get through you wont be able to raise two dollars on sunday mornin youll lose your fancy cadillacs and your fancy suits you may even lose your church cause ill ask everbody to leave you finished agee asked if you are i just wanna say that im hurt hurt real bad that you and gwen feel this way thats the way we feel and i dont care how hurt you are ozzie stepped forward i agree with them reverend agee you aint done right and you know it that hurts ozzie comin from you it really

the time you get ready to preach well walk in the front door down the aisle and up to the pulpit if you get in my way ill put handcuffs on you carl lee will do the preachin hell tell all your people that the money theyve given so generously has so far not left your pocket that gwen and the kids are about to lose their house cause youre tryin to bigshot with the naacp hell tell them that you lied

memphis for a hundred dollars and almost got indicted ill tell them about the kickbacks from the funeral home ill tell them about the dui charge in jackson i got dismissed for you two years ago and reverend ill tell dont say it ozzie agee begged ill tell them a dirty little secret that only you and me and a certain woman of ill repute know about when do yall want the money how soon can you get it carl lee demanded awfully damned quick jake and ozzie left the haileys to themselves and went upstairs to the big office where ellen was buried in law books jake introduced ozzie to his law clerk and the three sat around the big desk how are my buddies jake asked the dynamite boys theyre recuperatin nicely well keep them in the hospital until the trials over we fixed a lock on the door and i keep a deputy in the hall they aint goin anywhere whos the main man we still dont know fingerprint tests havent come back yet there may be no prints to match he aint talkin the other is a local boy

klavern whatever that is whos in it he aint much on details he promised to call me only if someone is about to get hurt how nice can you trust him he saved your life good point is he a member didnt

thursday how many the mouse didnt say like i said he aint much on details the klan marching in clanton i cant believe it this is heavy stuff ellen said itll get heavier ozzie replied ive asked the gover nor to keep the highway patrol on standby it could be a rough week can you believe noose is willing to try this case in this town asked jake its too big to move jake it would draw marches and protests and klansmen anywhere you tried it maybe youre right how about your jury list ill have it tomorrow after supper tuesday joe frank ferryman sat on his front porch with the evening paper and a fresh chew of red man and spat carefully neatly through a small handcarved hole in the porch this was the evening ritual lela would finish the dishes and fix them a tall glass of iced tea and they would sit on the porch until dark and talk about the crops the grandchildren the humidity they lived out from karaway on eighty acres of neatly trimmed and cultivated farmland that joe franks father had stolen during the depression they were quiet hardworking christian folks after a few discharges through the hole a pickup slowed out on the highway and turned into the perrymans long gravel driveway it parked next to the front lawn and a familiar face emerged it was will tierce former president of the ford county board of supervisors will had served his district for twentyfour years six consecutive terms but had lost the last election in by seven votes the perrymans had always supported tierce because he took care of them with an occasional load of gravel or a culvert for the driveway evenin will said joe frank as the exsupervisor walked across the lawn and up the steps evenin joe frank they shook hands and relaxed on the porch gimme a chew tierce said sure what brings you around here just passin by thought about lelas iced tea and got real thirsty hadnt seen you folks in a while they sat and talked chewed and spat and drank iced tea until it was dark and time for the mosquitoes the drought required most of their time and joe frank talked at length of the dry spell and how it was the worst in ten years hadnt had a drop of rain since the third week of june and if it didnt let up he could forget the cotton crop the beans might make it but he was worried about the cotton say joe frank i hear you got one of those jury summons for the trial next week yeah afraid so who told you i dont know i just heard it around tf i didnt know it was public knowledge well i guess i mustve heard it in clanton today i had business at the courthouse thats where i heard it its that niggers trial you know thats what i figured how do you feel about that nigger shootin them boys like he did i dont blame him inserted lela yeah but you cant take the law into your own hands explained joe frank to his wife thats what the court system is for ill tell you what bothers me said tierce is this insanity crap theyre gonna say the nigger was crazy and try to get him off by insanity like that nut who shot reagan its a crooked way to get off plus its a lie that nigger planned to kill them boys and just sat there and waited on them it was coldblooded murder what if it was your daughter will asked lela id let the courts handle it when we catch a rapist around here especially a nigger we generally lock him up parchmans full of rapists wholl never get out this aint new york or california or some crazy place where criminals go free weve got a good system and old judge noose hands down tough sentences you gotta let the courts handle it our system wont survive if we allow people especially niggers to take the law into their own hands thats what really scares me suppose this nigger gets off walks out of the courthouse a free man everbody in the country will know it and the niggers will go crazy evertime somebody crosses a nigger hell just kill him then say he was insane and try to get off thats whats dangerous about this trial you gotta keep the niggers under control agreed joe frank you better believe it and if hailey gets off none of us will be safe ever nigger in this countyll carry a gun and just look for trouble i hadnt really thought about that admitted joe frank i hope you do the right thing joe frank i just hope they put you in that jury box we need some people with some sense wonder why they picked me i heard they fixed up a hundred and fifty summonses theyre expectin about a hundred to show up whatre my chances of gettin picked one in a hundred said lela i feel better then i really aint got time to serve what with my farmin and all we sure need you on that jury said tierce the conversation drifted to local politics and the new supervisor and what a sorry job he was doing with the roads darkness meant bedtime for the perrymans tierce said good night and drove home he sat at his kitchen table with a cup of coffee and reviewed the jury list his friend rufus would be proud six names had been circled on wills list and he had talked to all six he put an okay by each name they would be good jurors people rufus could count on to keep law and order in ford county a couple had been noncommittal at first but their good and trusted friend will tierce had explained justice to them and they were now ready to convict rufus would be real proud and he had promised that young jason tierce a nephew would never be tried on those dope charges jake picked at the greasy pork chops and butterbeans and watched ellen across the table do the same thing lucien sat at the head of the table ignored his food fondled his drink and flipped through the jury list offering comments on every name he recognized he was drunker than normal most of the names he didnt recognize but he commented on them anyway ellen was amused and winked repeatedly at her boss he dropped the list and knocked his fork off the table sallie he yelled do you know how many aclu members are in ford county he asked ellen at least eighty percent of the population she said one me i was the first in history and evidently the last these people are fools around here row ark they dont appreciate civil liberties theyre a bunch of rightwing kneejerk conservative republican fanatics like our friend jake here thats not true i eat at claudes at least once a week jake said so that makes you progressive asked lucien it makes me a radical i still think

involuntarily he slapped sallie on the rear as she cleaned up his mess that was a cheap shot jake he said seriously row ark jake said imitating lucien guess who was the last lawyer permanently disbarred by the mississippi supreme court ellen gracefully smiled at both men and said nothing row ark lucien said loudly guess who will be the next lawyer in this county to be evicted from his

row ark lets get drunk no thanks lucien ive enjoyed dinner and the conversation but i need to get back to oxford they stood and left lucien at the table jake declined the usual invitation to sit on the porch ellen left and he went to his temporary room upstairs he had promised carla he would not sleep at home he called her she and hanna were fine worried but fine he didnt mention bud twitty a convoy of converted school buses each with an original paint job of white and red or green and black or a hundred other combinations and the name of a church emblazoned along the sides under the windows rolled slowly around the clanton square after lunch wednesday there were thirtyone in all each packed tightly with elderly black people who waved paper fans and handkerchiefs in a futile effort to overcome the stifling heat after three trips around the courthouse the lead bus stopped by the post office and thirtyone doors flew open the buses emptied in a frenzy the people were directed to a gazebo on the courthouse lawn where reverend ollie agee was shouting orders and handing out blue and white free carl lee placards the side streets leading into the square became congested as cars from all directions inched toward the courthouse and finally parked when they could move no closer hundreds of blacks left their vehicles in the streets and walked solemnly toward the square they mingled around the gazebo and waited for their placards then wandered through the oaks and magnolias looking for shade and greeting friends more church buses arrived and were unable to circle the square because of the traffic they unloaded next to the coffee shop for the first time that year the temperature hit a hundred and promised to go higher the sky produced no clouds for protection and there were no winds or breezes to weaken the burning rays or to blow away the humidity a mans shirt would soak and stick to his back in fifteen minutes under a shade tree five minutes without shade some of the weaker old folks found refuge inside the courthouse the crowd continued to grow it was predominantly elderly but there were many younger militant angrylooking blacks who had missed the great civil rights marches and demonstrations of the sixties and now realized that this might be a rare opportunity to shout and protest and sing we shall overcome and in general celebrate being black and oppressed in a white world they meandered about waiting for someone to take charge finally three students marched to the front steps of the courthouse lifted their placards and shouted free carl lee free carl lee instantly the mob repeated the war cry free carl lee free carl lee free carl lee they left the shade trees and courthouse and moved closer together near the steps where a makeshift podium and pa system had been set up they yelled in unison at no one or no place or nothing in particular just howled the newly established battle cry in a perfect chorus free carl lee free carl lee the windows of the courthouse flew open as the clerks and secretaries gawked at the happening below the roar could be heard for blocks and the small shops and offices around the square emptied the owners and customers filled the sidewalks and watched in astonishment the demonstrators noticed their spectators and the attention fueled the chanting which increased in tempo and volume the vultures had loitered about waiting and watching and the noise excited them they descended upon the front lawn of the courthouse with cameras and microphones ozzie and his men directed traffic until the highway and the streets were hopelessly gridlocked they maintained a presence although there was no hint they would be needed agee and every fulltime parttime retired and prospective black preacher in three counties paraded through the dense mass of black screaming faces and made their way to the podium the sight of the ministers pumped up the celebrants and their unified chants reverberated around the square down the side streets into the sleepy residential districts and out into the countryside thousands of blacks waved their placards and yelled their lungs out agee swayed with the crowd he danced across the small podium he slapped hands with the other ministers he led the rhythmic noise like a choir director he was a sight free carl lee free carl lee for fifteen minutes agee whipped the crowd into a frenzied coalescent mob then when with his finely trained ear he detected the first hint of fatigue he walked to the microphones and asked for quiet the panting sweating faces yelled on but with less volume the chants of freedom died quickly agee asked for room near the front so the press could congregate and do its job he asked for stillness so they could go to the lord in prayer reverend roosevelt offered a marathon to the lord an eloquent alliterative oratorical fiesta that brought tears to the eyes of many when he finally said amen an enormous black woman with a sparkling red wig stepped to the microphones and opened her vast mouth the opening stanza of we shall overcome flowed forth in a deep rich mellow river of glorious a cappella the ministers behind her immediately clasped hands and began to sway spontaneity swept the crowd and two thousand voices joined her in surprising harmony the mournful promising anthem rose above the small town when they finished someone shouted free carl lee and ignited another round of chanting agee quieted them again and stepped to the microphones he pulled an index card from his pocket and began his sermon as expected lucien arrived late and half loaded he brought a bottle and offered a drink to jake atcavage and harry rex and each declined its a quarter till nine lucien jake said weve been waiting for almost an hour im being paid for this am i he asked no but i asked you to be here at eight sharp and you also told me not to bring a bottle and i informed you this was my building built by my grandfather leased to you as my tenant for a very reasonable rent i might add and i will come and go as i please with or without a bottle forget it did you whatre those blacks doing across the street walking around the courthouse in the dark its called a vigil explained harry rex theyve vowed to walk around the courthouse with candles keeping a vigil until their man is free that could be an awfully long vigil i mean those poor people could be walking until they die i mean this could be a twelve fifteenyear vigil they might set a record they might have candle wax up to their asses evenin row ark ellen sat at the rolltop desk under william faulkner she looked at a wellmarked copy of the jury list she nodded and smiled at lucien row ark lucien said i have all the respect in the world for you i view you as an equal i believe in your right to equal pay for equal work i believe in your right to choose whether to have a child or abort i believe in all that crap you are a woman and entitled to no special privileges because of your gender you should be treated just like a man lucien reached in his pocket and pulled out a clip of cash and since you are a law clerk genderless in my eyes i think you should be the one to go buy a case of cold coors no lucien jake said shut up jake ellen stood and stared at lucien sure lucien but ill pay for the beer she left the office jake shook his head and fumed at lucien this could be a long night harry rex changed his mind and poured a shot of whiskey into his coffee cup please dont get drunk jake begged weve got work to do i work better when im drunk said lucien me too said harry rex this could be interesting said atcavage jake laid his feet on his desk and puffed on a cigar okay the first thing i want to do is decide on a model juror black said lucien black as old coalys ass said harry rex i agree said jake but we wont get a chance buckley will save his peremptory challenges for the blacks we know that weve got to concentrate on white people women said lucien always pick women for crimi nal trials they have bigger hearts bleeding hearts and theyre much more sympathetic always go for women naw said harry rex not in this case women dont understand things like taking a gun and blowing people away you need fathers young fathers who would want to do the same thing hailey did daddies with little girls since when did you get to be such an expert on picking juries asked lucien i thought you were a sleazy divorce lawyer i am a sleazy divorce lawyer but i know how to pick juries and listen to them through the wall cheap shot jake raised his arms fellas please how about victor onzell you know him stan yeah he banks with us hes about forty married three or four kids white from somewhere up north runs the truck stop on the highway north of town hes been here about five years i wouldnt take him lucien said if hes from up north he doesnt think like we do probably in favor of gun control and all that crap yankees always scare me in criminal cases ive always thought we should have a law in mississippi that no certified yankee could sit on a jury down here regardless of how long hes lived here thank you so much said jake id take him said harry rex why hes got kids probably a daughter if hes from the north hes probably not as prejudiced sounds good to me john tate aston hes dead said lucien what i said hes dead been dead for three years whys he on the list asked atcavage the nonlawyer they dont purge the voter registration list explained harry rex between drinks some die and some move away and its impossible to keep the list up to date theyve issued a hundred and fifty summons and you can expect a hundred to a hundred and twenty to show up the rest have died or moved away caroline baxter ozzie says shes black jake said flipping through his notes works at the carburetor plant in karaway take her said lucien i wish said jake ellen returned with the beer she dropped it in luciens lap and tore a sixteenounce can out of a sixpack she popped the top and returned to the rolltop desk jake declined but atcavage decided he was thirsty jake remained the nondrinker jpe kitt shepherd sounds like a redneck said lucien why do you say that asked harry rex the double first name lucien explained most rednecks have double first names like billy ray johnny ray bobby lee harry lee jesse earl billy wayne jerry wayne eddie mack even their women have double first names bobbie sue betty pearl mary belle thelma lou sally faye what about harry rex asked harry rex never heard of a woman named harry rex i mean for a male redneck i guess itll do jake interrupted dell perry said he used to own a bait shop down by the lake i take it no one knows him no but i bet hes a redneck said lucien because of his name id scratch him arent you given their addresses ages occupations basic information like that asked atcavage not until the day of trial on monday each prospective juror fills out a questionnaire in the courtroom but until then we have only the names what kind of juror are we looking for jake ellen asked young to middleaged men with families i would prefer to have no one over fifty why lucien asked belligerently younger whites are more tolerant of blacks like cobb and willard lucien said most of the older folks will always dislike blacks but the younger generation has accepted an integrated society less bigotry as a rule with youth i agree said harry rex and i would stay away from women and rednecks thats my plan i think youre wrong said lucien women are more sympathetic just look at row ark shes sympathetic toward everyone right row ark right lucien she has sympathy for criminals child pornographers atheists illegal immigrants gays dont you row ark right lucien she and i hold the only two aclu cards existing at this very moment in ford county mississippi thats sick said atcavage the banker clyde sisco jake said loudly trying to minimize controversy he can be bought lucien said smugly what do you mean he can be bought jake asked just what i said he can be bought how do you know asked harry rex are you kidding hes a sisco biggest bunch of crooks in the eastern part of the county they all live around the mays community theyre professional thieves and insurance defrauders they burn their houses every three years youve never heard of them he was shouting at harry rex no how do you know he can be bought because i bought him once in a civil case ten years ago he was on the jury list and i got word to him that id give him ten percent of the jury verdict hes very persuasive jake dropped the jury lists and rubbed his eyes he knew this was probably true but didnt want to believe it and asked harry rex and he was selected for the jury and i got the largest verdict in the history of ford county its still the record stubblefield jake asked in disbelief thats it my boy stubblefield versus north texas pipeline september eight hundred thousand dollars appealed and affirmed by the supreme court did you pay him asked harry rex lucien finished a long drink and smacked his lips eighty thousand cash in onehundreddollar bills he said proudly he built a new house then burned it down what was your cut asked atcavage forty percent minus eighty thousand the room was silent as everybody but lucien made the calculation wow atcavage mumbled youre kidding arent you lucien jake asked halfheartedly you know im serious jake you know i lie compulsively but never about things like this im telling the truth and im telling you this guy can be bought how much asked harry rex forget it said jake five thousand cash just guessing forget it there was a pause as each one looked at jake to make sure he was not interested in clyde sisco and when it was obvious he was not interested they took a drink and waited for the next name around tenthirty jake had his first beer and an hour later the case was gone and forty names remained lucien staggered to the balcony and watched the blacks carry their candles along the sidewalks next to the streets around the courthouse jake why is this deputy sitting in his car in front of my office he asked thats my bodyguard whats his name nesbit is he awake probably not lucien leaned dangerously over the railing hey nesbit he yelled nesbit opened the door of his patrol car yeah what is it jake here wants you to go to the store and get us some more beer hes very thirsty heres a twenty hed like a case of coors i cant buy it when im on duty nesbit protested since when lucien laughed at himself i cant do it its not for you nesbit its for mr brigance and he really needs it hes already called the sheriff and its okay who called the sheriff mr brigance lied lucien sheriff said he didnt care what you did as long as you didnt drink any nesbit shrugged and appeared satisfied lucien dropped a twenty from the balcony within minutes nesbit was back with a case minus one which had been opened and was sitting on his radar gun lucien ordered atcavage to fetch the beer from below and distribute the first sixpack an hour later the list was finished and the party was over nesbit loaded harry rex lucien and atcavage into his patrol car and took them home jake andhis clerk sat on the balcony sipping and watching the candles flicker and move slowly around the courthouse several cars were parked on the west side of the square and a small group of blacks sat nearby in lawn chairs waiting to take their turns with the candles we didnt do bad jake said quietly staring at the vigil we made notes on all but twenty of the hundred and fifty whats next ill try to find something on the other twenty then well make an index card for each juror well know them like family by monday nesbit returned to the square and circled twice watching the blacks he parked between the saab and the bmw the mnaghten brief is a masterpiece our psychiatrist dr bass will be here tomorrow and i want you to review mnaghten with him you need to outline in detail the necessary questions to ask him at trial and cover these with him he worries me i dont know him and im relying on lucien get his resume and investigate his background make whatever phone calls are necessary check with the state medical association to make sure he has no history of disciplinary problems he is very important to our case and i dont want any surprises okay boss jake finished his last beer look row ark this is a very small town my wife left five days ago and im sure people will know it soon you look suspicious people love to talk so be discreet stay in the office and do your research and tell anyone who asks that youre ethels replacement thats a big bra to fill you could do it if you wanted to i hope you know that im not nearly as sweet as im being forced to act i know that they watched the blacks change shifts and a new crew take up the candles nesbit threw an empty beer can onto the sidewalk youre not driving home are you jake asked it would not be a good idea id register at least you can sleep on the couch in my office thanks i will jake said good night locked the office and spoke briefly to nesbit then he placed himself carefully behind the wheel of the saab nesbit followed him to his home on adams he parked under the carport next to carlas car and nesbit parked in the driveway it was am thursday july they arrived in groups of two and three and came from all over the state they parked along the gravel road by the cabin deep in the woods they entered the cabin dressed as normal working men but once inside they slowly and meticulously changed into their neatly pressed and neatly folded robes and headdresses they admired one anothers uniforms and helped each other into the bulky outfits most of them knew each other but a few introductions were necessary they were forty in number a good turnout stump sisson was pleased he sipped whiskey and moved around the room like a head coach reassuring his team before the kickoff he inspected the uniforms and made adjustments he was proud of his men and told them so it was the biggest meeting of its kind in years he said he admired them and their sacrifices in being there he knew they had jobs and families but this was important he talked about the glory days when they were feared in mississippi and had clout those days must return and it was up to this very group of dedicated men to take a stand for white people the march could be dangerous he explained niggers could march and demonstrate all day long and no one cared but let white folks try and march and it was dangerous the city had issued a permit and the nigger sheriff promised order but most klan marches nowadays were disrupted by roving bands of young wild nigger punks so be careful and keep ranks he stump would do the talking they listened intently to stumpsrep talk and when he finished they loaded into a dozen cars and followed him to town few if any people in clanton had ever seen the klan march and as pm approached a great wave of excitement rippled around the square the merchants and their customers found excuses to inspect the sidewalks they milled about importantly and watched the side streets the vultures were out in full force and had congregated near the gazebo on the front lawn a group of young blacks gathered nearby under a massive oak ozzie smelled trouble they assured him they had only come to watch and listen he threatened them with jail if trouble started he stationed his men at various points around the courthouse here they come someone yelled and the spectators strained to get a glimpse of the marching klansmen as they strutted importantly from a small street onto washington avenue the north border of the square they walked cautiously but arrogantly their faces hidden by the sinister red and white masks hanging from the royal headdresses the spectators gawked at the faceless figures as the procession moved slowly along washington then south along caffey street then east along jackson street stump waddled proudly in front of his men when he neared the front of the courthouse he made a sharp left turn and led his troops down the long sidewalk in the center of the front lawn they closed ranks in a loose semicircle around the podium on the courthouse steps the vultures had scrambled and fallen over themselves following the march and when stump stopped his men the podium was quickly adorned with a dozen microphones trailing wires in all directions to the cameras and recorders under the tree the group of blacks had grown larger much larger and some of them walked to within a few feet of the semicircle the sidewalks emptied as the merchants and shopkeepers their customers and the other curious streamed across the streets onto the lawn to hear what the leader the short fat one was about to say the deputies walked slowly through the crowd paying particular attention to the group of blacks ozzie placed himself under the oak in the midst of his people jake watched intently from the window in jean gillespies second floor office the sight of the klansmen in full regalia their cowardly faces hidden behind the ominous masks gave him a sick feeling the white hood for decades a symbol of hatred and violence in the south was back which one of those men had burned the cross in his yard were they all active in planning the bombing of his home which one would try something next from the second floor he could see the blacks inch closer you niggers were not invited to this rally stump screamed into the microphone pointing at the blacks this is a klan meetin not a meetin for a buncha niggers from the side streets and small alleys behind the rows of red brick buildings a steady stream of blacks moved toward the courthouse they joined the others and in seconds stump andhis boys were outnumbered ten to one ozzie radioed for backup my names stump sisson he said as he removed his mask and im proud to say im the mississippi imperial wizard for the invisible empire of the ku klux klan im here to say that the lawabidin white folks of mississippi are sick and tired of niggers stealin rapin killin and gettin by with it we demand justice and we demand that this hailey nigger be convicted and his black ass sent to the gas chamber free carl lee screamed one of the blacks free carl lee they repeated in unison free carl lee shut up you wild niggers stump shrieked back shut up you animals his troops stood facing him frozen with their backs to the screaming crowd ozzie and six deputies moved between the groups free carl lee free carl lee stumps naturally colorful face had turned an even deeper red his teeth nearly touched the microphones shut up you wild niggers you had your rally yesterday and we didnt disturb you we have a right to assemble in peace just like you do now shut up the chanting intensified free carl lee free carl lee wheres the sheriff hes supposed to keep law and order sheriff do your job shut those niggers up so we can assemble in peace cant you do your job sheriff cant you control your own people see folks thats what you get when you elect niggers to public office the shouting continued and stump stepped back from the microphones and watched the blacks the photographers and tv crews spun in circles trying to record it all no one noticed a small window on the third floor of the courthouse it opened slowly and from the darkness within a wuuc mcuumo was tnrown onto the podium below it landed perfectly at stumps feet and exploded engulfing the wizard in dames the riot was on stump screamed and rolled wildly down the front steps three of his men shed their heavy robes and masks and attempted to cover him and smother the flames the wooden podium and platform burned with the thick unmistakable smell of gasoline the blacks charged wielding sticks and knives and hacking at anything with a white face or white robe under each white robe was a short black nightstick and the klansmen proved ready for the assault within seconds of the explosion the front lawn of the ford county courthouse was a battlefield as men screamed and cursed and howled in pain through thick heavy smoke the air was filled with rocks and stones and nightsticks as the two groups brawled in handtohand combat bodies began falling on the lush green grass ozzie fell first the victim of a wicked smash to the base of his skull with a wrecking bar nesbit prather hastings pirtle tatum and other deputies ran here and there attempting unsuccessfully to separate various combatants before they killed each other instead of running for cover the vultures darted crazily through the midst of the smoke and violence valiantly trying to capture yet a better shot of the blood and gore they were sitting ducks one cameraman his right eye buried deep in his camera caught a jagged piece of brick with his left eye he and his camera dropped quickly to the sidewalk where after a few seconds another cameraman appeared and filmed his fallen comrade a fearless busy female reporter from a memphis station charged into the melee with her microphone in hand and her cameraman at her heels she dodged a brick then maneuvered too close to a large klansman who was just finishing off a couple of black teenagers when with a loud piercing scream he slapped her pretty head with his nightstick kicked her as she fell then brutally attacked her cameraman fresh troops from the clanton city police arrived in the center of the battle nesbit prather and hastings came together stood with their backs to each other and began firing their smith wesson magnum service revolvers into the air the sound of the gunfire quelled the riot the warriors froze and searched for the gunfire then quickly separated and glared at each other they retreated slowly to their own groups the officers formed a dividing line between the blacks and the klansmen all of whom were thankful for the truce a dozen wounded bodies were unable to retreat ozzie sat dazed rubbing his neck the lady from memphis was unconscious and bleeding profusely from the head several klansmen their white robes soiled and bloody lay sprawled near the sidewalk the fire continued to burn the sirens drew closer and finally the fire trucks and ambulances arrived and drove onto the battlefield firemen and medics attended the wounded none were dead stump sisson was taken away first ozzie was half dragged and half carried to a patrol car more police arrived and broke up the crowd jake harry rex and ellen ate a lukewarm pizza and watched intently as the small television in the conference room broadcasted the days events in clanton mississippi cbs ran the story halfway through the news the reporter had apparently escaped the riot unscathed and he narrated the video with a play by play of the march the shouting the firebomb and the melee as of late this afternoon he reported the exact number of casualties is unknown the most serious injuries are believed to be the extensive burns suffered by a mr sisson who identified himself as an imperial wizard of the ku klux klan he is listed in serious condition at the mid south burn hospital in memphis the video showed a closeup of stump burning while all hell broke loose he continued the trial of carl lee hailey is scheduled to start monday here in clanton it is unknown at this time what effect if any todays riot will have on this trial there is some speculation the trial will be postponed andor moved to another county thats news to me said jake you havent heard anything asked harry rex not a word and i presume i would be notified before cbs the reporter disappeared and dan rather said he would return in a moment what does this mean asked ellen it means noose is stupid for not changing venue be glad he didnt said harry rex itll give you something to argue on appeal thanks harry rex i appreciate your confidence in my ability as a trial lawyer the phone rang harry rex grabbed it and said hello to carla he handed it to jake its your wife can we listen no go get another pizza hello dear jake are you all right of course im all right i just saw it

hanna goodbye goodbye jake handed the receiver to ellen where is she wilmington north carolina her parents spend the summers there harry rex had left for another pizza you miss her dont you asked elleri in more ways than you can imagine oh i can imagine at midnight they were in the cabin drinking whiskey cussing niggers and comparing wounds several had returned from the hospital in memphis where they had visited briefly with stump sisson he told them to proceed as planned eleven had been released from the ford county hospital with various cuts and bruises and the others admired their wounds as each took his turn describing to the last detail how he had gallantly battled multiple niggers before being wounded usually from the rear or blind side they were the heroes the ones with the bandages then the others told their stories and the whiskey flowed they heaped praise upon the largest one when he told of his attack on the pretty television reporter and her nigger cameraman after a couple of hours of drinking and storytelling the talk turned to the task at hand a map of the county was produced and one of the locals pinpointed the targets there were twenty homes this nighttwenty names taken from the list of prospective jurors someone had furnished five teams of four each left the cabin in pickups and headed into the darkness to further their mischief in each pickup were four wooden crosses the smaller models nine feet by four feet each soaked with kerosene they avoided clanton and the small towns in the county and instead kept to the dark countryside the targets were in isolated areas away from traffic and neighbors out in the country where things go unnoticed and people go to bed early and sleep soundly the plan of attack was simple a truck would stop a few hundred feet down the road out of sight no headlights and the driver remained with engine running while the other three carried the cross to the front yard stuck it in the ground and threw a torch on it the pickup then met them in front of the house for a quiet getaway and joyride to the next target the plan worked simply and with no complications at nineteen of the twenty targets but at luther picketts residence a strange noise earlier in the night had aroused luther and he sat in the darkness of his front porch waiting for nothing in particular when he saw a strange pickup move suspiciously along the gravel road out beyond his pecan tree he grabbed his shotgun and listened as the truck turned around and stopped down the road he heard voices and then saw three figures carrying a pole or something into his front yard next to the gravel road luther crouched behind a shrub next to the porch and aimed the driver took a slug of cold beer and watched to see the cross go up in flames he heard a shotgun instead his buddies abandoned the cross and the torch and the front yard and jumped into a small ditch next to the road another shotgun blast the driver could hear the screams and obscenities they had to be rescued he threw down his beer and stepped on the gas old luther fired again as he came off the porch and again as the truck appeared and stopped by the shallow ditch the three scrambled desperately from the mud stum bling and sliding cussing and yelling as they attacked the truck and furiously fought to jump into the bed hang on yelled the driver just as old luther fired again this time spraying the pickup he watched with a smile as the truck sped away spinning gravel and fishtailing from ditch to ditch just a bunch of drunk kids he thought from a pay phone a kluxer held the list of twenty names and twenty phone numbers he called them all simply to ask them to take a look in their front yards friday morning jake phoned the noose home and was informed by mrs ichabod that his honor was presiding over a civil trial in polk county jake gave instructions to ellen and left for smithfield an hour away he nodded at his honor as he entered the empty courtroom and sat on the front row except for the jurors there were no other spectators noose was bored the jurors were bored the lawyers were bored and after two minutes jake was bored after the witness finished noose called for a short recess and jake went to his chambers hello jake whyre you here you heard what happened yesterday i saw it on the news last night have you heard what happened this morning no evidently someone gave the klan a list of the prospective jurors last night they burned crosses in the yards of twenty of the jurors noose was shocked our jurors yes sir did they catch anybody of course not they were too busy putting out fires besides you dont catch these people twenty of our jurors noose repeated yes sir noose pawed at his mangled mass of brilliant gray hair and walked slowly around the small room shaking his head and occasionally scratching his crotch sounds like intimidation to me he muttered what a mind thought jake a real genius i would say so so what am i supposed to do he asked with a touch of frustration change venue to where southern part of the state i see perhaps carey county i believe its sixty percent black that would generate at least a hung jury wouldnt it or maybe you would like brower county i think its even blacker youd probably get an acquittal there wouldnt you i dont care where you move it its not fair to try him in ford county things were bad enough before the war yesterday now the white folks are really in a lynching mood and my mans got the nearest available neck the situation was terrible before the klan started decorating the county with christmas trees who knows what else theyll try before monday theres no way to pick a fair and impartial jury in ford county you mean black jury no sir i mean a jury that hasnt prejudged this case carl lee hailey is entitled to twelve people who havent already decided his guilt or innocence noose lumbered toward his chair and fell into it he removed those glasses from that nose and picked at the end of it we could excuse the twenty he wondered aloud that wont help the entire county knows about it or will know about it within a few hours you know how fast word travels the entire panel will feel threatened then we could disqualify the entire panel and summon a new one wont work jake answered sharply frustrated by nooses stubbornness all jurors must come from ford county and everybody in the county knows about it and how do you keep the klan from harassing the next panel it wont work what makes you so confident the klan wont follow the case if i move it to another county the sarcasm dripped from every word i think they will follow it jake admitted but we dont know that for sure what we do know is that the klan is already in ford county that its quite active now and that it has already intimidated some potential jurors thats the issue the question is what will you do about it nothing noose said bluntly sir nothing i will do nothing but dismiss the twenty i will carefully interrogate the panel next monday when the trial starts in clanton jake stared in disbelief noose had a reason a motive a fear something he was not telling lucien was rightsomeone had gotten to him may i ask why i dont think it matters where we try carl lee hailey i dont think it matters who we put in the jury box i dont think it matters what color they are their minds are made up all of them wherever and whoever they are theyve already made up their minds jake and its your job to pick those who think your man is a hero thats probably true thought jake but he wouldnt admit it he continued staring at the trees outside why are you afraid to move it ichabods eyes narrowed and he glared at jake afraid im not afraid of any ruling i make why are you afraid to try it in ford county i thought i just explained it mr hailey will be tried in ford county starting monday thats three days from today and he will be tried there not because im afraid to move it but because it wouldnt do any good to move it ive considered all this very carefully mr brigance many times and i feel comfortable with the trial in clanton it will not be moved anything further no sir good see you monday jake entered his office through the rear door the front door had been locked for a week now and there was always someone banging on it and yelling at it most of them were reporters but many were friends just stopping by to gossip and find out what they could about the big trial clients were a thing of the past the phone rang constantly jake never touched it and ellen grabbed it if she was nearby he found her in the conference room up to her elbows in law books the mnaghten brief was a masterpiece he had requested no more than twenty pages she gave him seventyfive perfectly typed and plainly worded pages and explained there was no way to cover the mississippi version of mnaghten in fewer words her research was painstaking and detailed she had started with the original mnaghten case in england in the s and worked through a hundred and fifty years of insanity law in mississippi she discarded insignificant or confusing cases and explained in wonderful simplicity the complicated major cases the brief concluded with a summary of current law and applied it to the trial of carl lee hailey in a smaller brief only fourteen pages she had reached the unmistakable conclusion that the jury would see the sickening pictures of cobb and willard with their brains splattered about the stairway mississippi admitted such inflammatory evidence and she had found no way around it she had typed thirtyone pages of research on the defense of justifiable homicide something jake had considered briefly after the killings she reached the same conclusion jake had reachedit wouldnt work she had found an old mississippi case where a man had caught and killed an escaped convict who was armed he had been acquitted but the differences in that case and carl lees case were enormous jake had not asked for the brief and was irritated that so much energy had been spent on it he said nothing however since she had produced everything he had asked for the most pleasant surprise had been her work with dr wt bass she had met with him twice during the week and they had covered mnaghten in great detail she prepared a twentyfivepage script of the questions to be asked by jake and the answers to be given by bass it was a skillfully crafted dialogue and he marveled at her seasoning when he was her age he was an average student more concerned with romance than research she on the other hand as a thirdyear law student was writing briefs that read like treatises howd it go she asked as expected he did not budge the trial will start here monday with the same panel minus the twenty who received their subtle warnings hes crazy whatre you working on im finishing the brief to support our position that the details of the rape should be discussed before the jury it looks good at this point when will you finish it is there some hurry by sunday if possible ive got another chore something a little different she slid her legal pad away and listened the states psychiatrist will be dr wilbert rodeheaver head of staff at whitfield hes been there forever and has testifed in hundreds of cases i want you to dig a little and see how often his name appears in court decisions fve already run across his name good as you know the only cases we read about from the supreme court are the ones where the defendant at trial was convicted and has appealed the acquittals are not reported im more interested in these where are you coming from i have a hunch rodeheaver is very reluctant to give an opinion that a defendant was legally insane theres a chance hes never done it even in cases where the defendant was clearly crazy and did not know what he was doing id like to ask rodeheaver on crossexamination about some of the cases in which hes said theres nothing wrong with an obviously sick man and the jury acquitted him those cases will be very hard to find i know but you can do it row ark ive watched you work for a week now and i know you can do it im flattered boss you may have to make phone calls to attorneys around the state whove crossed rodeheaver before itll be hard row ark but get it done yes boss im sure you wanted it yesterday not really i doubt if well get to rodeheaver next week so you have some time i dont know how to act you mean its not urgent no but that rape brief is yes boss have you had lunch im not hungry good dont make any plans for dinner what does that mean it means ive got an idea sort of like a date no sort of like a business lunch with two professionals jake packed two briefcases and left ill be at luciens he told her but dont call unless its a dire emergency dont tell anyone where i am what are you working on the jury lucien had passed out drunk in the swing on the porch and sallie was not around jake helped himself to the spacious study upstairs lucien had more law books in his home than most lawyers had in their offices he unpacked his mess in a chair and on the desk he placed an alphabetical list of the jurors a stack of threebyfive notecards and several magic markers the first name was acker barry acker the last name was written in large print across the top of a notecard with a blue magic marker blue for men red for women black for blacks regardless of gender under ackers name he made notes with a pencil age about forty married to his second wife three children two daughters runs a small unprofitable hardware store on the highway in clanton wife secretary at a bank drives a pickup likes to hunt wears cowboy boots pretty nice guy atcavage had gone to the hardware store thursday to get a look at barry acker said he looked okay talked like he had some education jake wrote the number nine by the name acker jake was impressed with his research surely buckley would not be as thorough the next name was bill andrews what a name there were six of them in the phonebook jake knew one harry rex knew another one and ozzie knew a black one but nobody knew which one got the summons he pvut a question mark by the name gerald ault jake smiled when he wrote the name on the notecard ault had passed through his office a few years back when the bank foreclosed on his house in clanton his wife was stricken with kidney disease and the medical bills broke them he was an intellectual educated at princeton where he met his wife she was from ford county the only child of a once prominent family of fools who had invested all their money in railroads he arrived in ford county just in time for his inlaws to go under and the easy life he had married dissolved into one of struggle he taught school for a while then ran the library then worked as a clerk in the courthouse he developed an aversion to hard work then his wife got sick and they lost their modest house he now worked in a convenience store jake knew something about gerald ault that no one else knew as a child in pennsylvania his family lived in a farmhouse near the highway one night while they slept the house caught fire a passing motorist stopped kicked in the front door and began rescuing the aults the fire spread quickly and when gerald and his brother awoke they were trapped in their upstairs bedroom they ran to the window and screamed their parents and siblings yelled helplessly from the front lawn flames poured from every window in the house except for their bedroom suddenly the rescuer soaked himself with water from the garden hose dashed into the burning house fought the flames and smoke as he raced upstairs then bolted through the bedroom door he kicked out the window grabbed gerald and his brother and jumped to the ground miraculously they were not hurt they thanked him through tears and embraces they thanked this stranger whose skin was black he was the first negro the children had ever seen gerald ault was one of the few white people in ford county who truly loved black people jake put a ten by his name for six hours he went through the jury list making notecards concentrating on each name envisioning each juror in the box and in deliberation talking to each one he rated them every black got an automatic ten the whites were not so easy the men rated higher than the women the young men higher than the old men the educated slightly higher than the uneducated the liberals both of them received the highest ratings he eliminated the twenty noose planned to exclude he knew something about one hundred and eleven of the prospective jurors surely buckley could not know so much ellen was typing on ethels machine when jake returned from luciens she turned it off closed the law books she was typing from and watched him wheres dinner she asked with a wicked smile were taking a road trip all right where to have you ever been to robinsonville mississippi no but im ready whats there nothing but cotton soybeans and a great little restaurant whats the dress code jake inspected her she wore the usualjeans neatly starched and faded no socks a navy buttondown that was four sizes too big but tucked in nicely above her slender hips you look fine he said they turned off the copier and the lights and left clanton in the saab jake stopped at a liquor store in the black section of town and bought a sixpack of coors and a tall cold bottle of chablis you have to bring your own bottle to this place he explained as they left town the sun was setting into the highway ahead and jake flipped down the sun visors ellen played bartender and opened two cans how far is this place she asked hour and a half hour and a half im starving then fill up on beer believe me its worth it whats on the menu barbecued sauteed shrimp frog legs and charbroiled catfish she sipped on the beer well see jake stepped on the gas and they raced across bridges over the countless tributaries of lake chatulla they climbed steep hills covered with layers of dark green kudzu they flew around corners and dodged pulpwood trucks making their last runs of the day jake opened the sunroof lowered the windows and let the wind blow ellen leaned back in the seat and dosed her eyes her thick wavy hair swirled around her face look row ark this dinner is strictly business sure sure i mean it im the employer youre the employee and this is a business meal nothing more or less so dont get any lustful ideas in your era sexually liberated brain sounds like youre the one with the ideas

wonderfully happily married man with a gorgeous wife whod kill if she thought i was fooling around okay lets pretend to be friends just two friends having dinner that doesnt work in the south a male

boss youre the gofer youre the male im the female jake admired her jeans and bulky shirt theres not much doubt about that ellen shook her head and stared at the mountains of kudzu flying by jake smiled drove faster and sipped his beer he negotiated a series of intersections on the rural deserted highways and suddenly the hills disappeared and the land became flat whats the name of the restaurant she asked the hollywood the what the hollywood why is it called that it was once located in a small town a few miles away by the name of hollywood mississippi it burned and they moved it to robinsonville they still call it the hollywood whats so great about it great food great music great atmosphere and its a thousand miles from clanton and no one will see me having dinner with a strange and beautiful woman im not a woman im a gofer a strange and beautiful gofer ellen smiled to herself and ran her fingers through her hair at another intersection he turned left and headed west until they found a settlement near a railroad a row of wooden buildings sat empty on one side of the road and across the street all by itself was an old dry goods store with a dozen cars parked around it and music rolling softly out the windows jake grabbed the bottle of chablis and escorted his law clerk up the steps onto the front porch and inside the building next to the door was a small stage where a beautiful old black lady merle sat at her piano and sang rainy night in georgia three long rows of tables ran to the front and stopped next to the stage the tables were half full and a waitress in the back poured beer from a pitcher and motioned for them to come on in she seated them in the rear at a small table with a redcheckered tablecloth yall want some fried dill pickles honey she asked jake yes two orders ellen frowned and looked at jake fried dill pickles yes of course they dont serve them in boston do you people fry everything everything thats worth eating if you dont like them ill eat them a yell went up from the table across the aisle four couples toasted something or somebody then broke into riotous laughing the restaurant maintained a constant roar of yelling and talking the good thing about the hollywood jake explained is that you can make all the noise you want and stay as long as you want and nobody cares when you get a table here its yours for the night theyll start singing and dancing in a minute jake ordered sauteed shrimp and charbroiled catfish for both of them ellen passed on the frog legs the waitress hurried back with the chablis and two chilled glasses they toasted carl lee hailey and his insane mind whatta you think of bass jake asked hes the perfect witness hell say anything we want him to say does that bother you it would if he was a fact witness but hes an expert and he can get by with his opinions who will challenge him is he believable when hes sober we talked twice this week on luesday he was lucid and helpful on wednesday he was drunk and indifferent i think hell be as helpful as any psychiatrist we could find he doesnt care what the truth is and hell tell us what we want to hear does he think carl lee was legally insane no do you no row ark carl lee told me five days before the killings that he would do it he showed me the exact place where he would ambush them although at the time i didnt realize it our client knew exactly what he was doing why didnt you stop him because i didnt believe him his daughter had just been raped and was fighting for her life would you have stopped him if you could i did tell ozzie but at the time neither of us dreamed it could happen no i would not have stopped him if i knew for certain i would have done the same thing how exactly as he did it it was very easy ellen approached a fried dill pickle with her fork and played with it suspiciously she cut it in half pierced it with the fork and sniffed it carefully she put it in her mouth and chewed slowly she swallowed then pushed her pile of pickles across the table toward jake typical yankee he said i dont understand you row ark you dont like fried dill pickles youre attractive very bright you could go to work with any bluechip law firm in the country for megabucks yet you want to spend your career losing sleep over cutthroat murderers who are on death row and about to get their just rewards what makes you tick row ark you lose sleep over the same people now its carl lee hailey next year itll be some other murderer who everybody hates but youll lose sleep over him because he happens to be your client one of these days brigance youll have a client on death row and youll learn how terrible it is when they strap him in the chair and he looks at you for the last time youll be a changed man youll know how barbaric the system is and youll remember row ark then ill grow a beard and join the aclu probably if they would accept you the sauteed shrimp arrived in a small black skillet it simmered in butter and garlic and barbeque sauce ellen dipped spoonfuls onto her plate and ate like a refugee merle lit into a stirring rendition of dixie and the crowd sang and clapped along the waitress ran by and threw a platter of battered and crunchy frog legs on the table jake finished a glass of wine and grabbed a handful of the frog legs ellen tried to ignore them when they were full of appetizers the catfish was served the grease popped and fizzed and they did not touch the china it was charbroiled to a deep brown crisp with black squares from the grill burned on each side they ate and drank slowly watching each other and savoring the delicious entree at midnight the bottle was empty and the lights were dimmed they said good night to the waitress and to merle they walked carefully down the steps and to the car jake buckled his seat belt im too drunk to drive he said so am i i saw a little motel not far down the road i saw it too and there were no vacancies nice try row ark get me drunk and try to take advantage of me i would if i could mister for a moment their eyes met ellens face reflected the red light cast by the neon sign that flashed hollywood atop the restaurant the moment grew longer and then the sign was turned off the restaurant had closed jake started the saab let it warm and raced away into the darkness mickey mouse called ozzie early saturday morning at his home and promised more trouble from the klan file riot on thursday had not been their fault he explained yet they were being blamed for it they had marched in peace and now their leader lay near death with seventy percent of his body covered with thirddegree burns there would be retaliation it had been ordered from above reinforcements were on the way from other states and there would be violence no specifics now but he would call later when he knew more ozzie sat on the side of his bed rubbed the swollen hump on the back of his neck and called the mayor and he called jake an hour later they met in ozzies office the situation is about to get outta hand ozzie said holding an ice pack to his neck and grimacing with every word ive got it from a reliable informant that the klan plans to retaliate for what happened thursday theyre supposed to bring fresh troops from other states do you believe it asked the mayor im afraid not to believe it same informant asked jake yep then i believe it somebody said there was talk of movin or postponin the trial ozzie said any chance of it no i met with judge noose yesterday it wont be moved and itll start monday did you tell him about the burnin crosses i told him everything is he crazy asked the mayor yes and stupid but dont quote me on that is he on solid legal ground asked ozzie jake shook his head more like quicksand what have you got in mind asked the mayor ozzie changed ice packs and carefully rubbed his neck he spoke with pain i have a strong desire to prevent another riot our hospital is not big enough to allow this crap to continue we must do something the blacks are angry and volatile and it wouldnt take much to ignite them some blacks are just lookin for a reason to start shootin and those white robes are good targets ive got a hunch the klan may do somethin really stupid like try to kill somebody theyre gettin more national exposure off this than theyve had in ten years the informant told me that after thursday theyve had calls from all over the country from volunteers wantin to come down here and join the fun he slowly rolled his head around his shoulders and changed ice packs again i hate to say it mayor but i think you should call the governor and ask for the national guard i know its a drastic step but id hate to get someone killed the national guard the mayor repeated in disbelief thats what i said occupying clanton yep protectin your people patrolling the streets yep with guns and everthing oh my this is drastic arent you overreacting a bit no its evident i dont have enough men to keep peace around here we couldnt even stop a riot that happened right in front of us the klans burnin crosses all over the county and we cant do anything about it what will we do when the blacks decide to start some trouble i dont have enough men mayor i need some help jake thought it was a marvelous idea how could a fair and impartial jury be chosen when the national guard had the courthouse surrounded he thought of the jurors arriving for court monday and walking past the soldiers with guns and jeeps and maybe even a tank or two parked in front of the courthouse how could they be fair and impartial how could noose insist on trying the case in clanton how could the supreme court refuse to reverse if heaven forbid there was a conviction it was a great idea whatta you think jake asked the mayor looking for help i dont think you have a choice mayor we cant stand another riot it could hurt you politically im not worried about politics the mayor replied angrily knowing jake and ozie knew better the mayor had been reelected last time by less than fifty votes and did not make a move without weighing the political fallout ozzie caught a grin from jake as the mayor squirmed with the thought of having his quiet little town occupied by the army after dark saturday ozzie and hastings led carl lee out the rear door of the jail and into the sheriffs patrol car they talked and laughed as hastings drove in slow motion out into the country past bates grocery and onto craft road the haileys front yard was covered with cars when they arrived so he parked in the road carl lee walked through his front door like a free man and was immediately embraced by a mob of kinfolks friends and his children they had not been told he was coming he hugged them desperately all four at the same time in one long bear hug as if there might be no more for a long time the crowd watched in silence as this huge man knelt on the floor and buried his head among his weeping children most of those in the crowd wept too the kitchen was covered with food and the guest of honor was seated in his usual chair at the head of the table with his wife and children seated around him reverend agee returned thanks with a short prayer of hope and homecoming a hundred friends waited on the family ozzie and hastings filled their plates and retreated to the front porch where they swatted mosquitoes and planned strategy for the trial ozzie was deeply concerned about carl lees safety while they moved him from the jail to court and back each day the defendant himself had proven clearly that such journeys are not always safe after supper the crowd spilled out into the front yard the children played while the adults stayed on the porch as close as possible to carl lee he was their hero the most famous man most of them would ever see and they knew him personally to his people he was on trial for one reason only sure he killed those boys but that wasnt the issue if he was white he would receive civic awards for what he did they would halfheartedly prosecute him but with a white jury the trial would be a joke carl lee was on trial because he was black and if they convicted him it would be because he was black no other reason they believed that they listened carefully as he talked about the trial he wanted their prayers and support and wanted them all to be there and watch it and to protect his family they sat for hours in the sweltering humidity carl lee and gwen in the swing rocking slowly surrounded by admirers all wanting to be near this great man when they began to leave they all embraced him and promised to be there monday they wondered if they would see him again sitting on his front porch at midnight ozzie said it was time to go carl lee hugged gwen and the kids one last time then took his seat in ozzies car bud twitty died during the night the dispatcher called nesbit who told jake he made a note to send flowers sunday one day before trial jake awoke at am with a knot in his stomach that he attributed to the trial and a headache that he attributed to the trial and a late saturday night session on luciens porch with his law clerk and former boss ellen had decided to sleep in a guest room at luciens so jake spent the night on his couch in the office he lay on the couch and heard voices from the street below he staggered in the dark to the balcony and stopped in amazement at the scene around the courthouse dday the war was on patton had arrived the streets around the square were lined with transport trucks jeeps and soldiers busy running here and there in an effort to get organized and look military radios squawked and potbellied commanders yelled to their men to hurry and get organized a command post was set up near the gazebo on the front lawn three squads of soldiers hammered on stakes and pulled ropes and strung up three enormous canvas camouflage pavilions barricades were set up on the four corners of the square and sentries took their positions they smoked cigarettes and leaned on the street lights nesbit sat on the trunk of his car and watched the fortifying of downtown clanton he chatted with a few of the guardsmen jake made coffee and took him a cup he was awake now safe and secure and nesbit could go home and rest until dark jake returned to the balcony and watched the activity until dawn once the troops were unloaded the transport trucks were moved to the national guard armory north of town where the men would sleep he estimated their number at two hundred they piddled around the courthouse and walked in small groups around the square looking in shops waiting for daylight and the hope of some excitement noose would be furious how dare they call the national guard without asking him it was his trial the mayor had mentioned this and jake had explained that it was the mayors responsiomiy keep laniun saie iiui me iriai judges ozzie concurred and noose was not called the sheriff and moss junior latum arrived and met with the colonel in the gazebo they walked around the courthouse inspecting troops and pavilions ozzie pointed in various directions and the colonel seemed to agree with whatever he wanted moss junior unlocked the courthouse so the troops would have drinking water and toilet facilities it was after nine before the first of the vultures stumbled onto the occupation of downtown clanton within an hour they were running everywhere with cameras and microphones gathering important words from a sergeant or a corporal what is your name sir sergeant drumwright where are you from booneville wheres that bout a hundred miles from here why are you here governor called us why did he call you keep things under control are you expecting trouble no how long will you be here dont know will you be here until the trials over dont know who knows the governor i reckon and so on word of the invasion spread quickly through the quiet sunday morning and after church the townfolk streamed to the square to verify for themselves that the army had indeed captured the courthouse the sentries removed the barricades and allowed the curious to drive around their square and gawk at the real live soldiers with their rifles and jeeps jake sat on the balcony drinking coffee and memorizing the notecards of his jurors he called carla and explained that the national guard had been deployed but he was still sate in tact ne naa never felt so safe as he talked to her he explained there were hundreds of heavily armed army militiamen across washington street just waiting to protect him yes he still had his bodyguard yes the house was still standing he doubted if the death of bud twitty had been reported yet so he did not tell her maybe she would not hear of it they were going fishing on her fathers boat and hanna wanted her daddy to go he said goodbye and missed the two women in his life more than ever ellen roark unlocked the rear door of the office and placed a small grocery sack on the table in the kitchen she pulled a file out of her briefcase and began looking for her boss he was on the balcony staring at notecards and watching the courthouse evenin row ark good evening boss she handed him a brief an inch thick its the research you requested on the admissibility of the rape its a tough issue and it got involved i apologize for the size of it it was as neat as her other briefs complete with a table of contents bibliography and numbered pages he flipped through it damn row ark i didnt ask for a textbook i know youre intimidated by scholarly work so i made a conscious effort to use words with fewer than three syllables my arent we frisky today could you summarize this in a dissertation of say thirty pages or so look its a thorough study of the law by a gifted law student with a remarkable ability to think and write clearly its a work of genius and its yours and its absolutely free so quit bitching yes maam does your head hurt yes its been aching since i woke up this morning ive typed on that brief for ten hours and i need a drink do you have a blender a what blender its a new invention we have up north theyre kitchen appliances theres one in the shelves next to the microwave she disappeared it was almost dark and the traffic had thinned around the square as the sunday drivers had grown bored with the sight of soldiers guarding their courthouse after twelve hours of suffocating heat and foglike humidity in downtown clanton the troops were weary and homesick they sat under trees and on folding canvas chairs and cursed the governor as it grew darker they strung wires from inside the courthouse and hung floodlights around the pavilions by the post office a carload of blacks arrived with lawn chairs and candles to start the nightly vigil they began pacing the sidewalk along jackson street under the suddenly aroused stares of two hundred heavily armed guardsmen the lead walker was miss rosia alfie gatewood a twohundredpound widow who had raised eleven children and sent nine to college she was the first black known to have sipped cold water from the public fountain on the square and live to tell about it she glared at the soldiers they did not speak ellen returned with two boston college beer mugs filled with a pale green liquid she sat them on the table and pulled up a chair whats that drink it itll help you relax ill drink it but id like to know what it is margaritas jake studied the top of his mug wheres the salt i dont like salt on mine well i dont either then why margaritas why not jake closed his eyes and took a long drink and then another row ark you are a talented woman gofer he took another long drink i havent had a margarita in eight years im very sorry her twentyounce mug was half empty what kind of rum i would call you a dumbass if you werent my boss thank you its not rum its tequila with lime juice and cointreau i thought every law student knew that how can you ever forgive me im sure i knew it when i was a law student she gazed around the square this is incredible it looks like a war zone jake drained his glassand licked his lips under the pavilions they played cards and laughed others soughtrefuge from the mosquitoes in the courthouse the candles turned the corner and made a pass down washington street yes jake said with a smile its beautiful isnt it think of our fair and impartial jurors as they arrive in the morning and are confronted with that ill renew my motion for a change of venue itll be denied ill ask for a mistrial and noose will say no and then ill make sure the court reporter records the fact that this trial is being conducted in the middle of a threering circus why are they here the sheriff and the mayor called the governor and convinced him the national guard was needed to preserve peace in ford county they told him our hospital is not large enough for this trial where are they from booneville and columbus i counted two hundred and twenty around lunch theyve been here all day they woke me at five this morning ive followed their movements all day they were pinned down a couple of times but reinforcements arrived a few minutes ago they met the enemy when miss gatewood and her friends arrived with their candles she stared them down so now theyre playing cards ellen finished her drink and left for more jake picked up

desk what about lucien no im tired of lucien harry rex brought a fifth of tequila he found somewhere deep in his liquor cabinet he and the law clerk argued violently over the proper ingredients of a good margarita jake voted with his clerk they sat on the balcony calling names from index cards drinking the tangy concoction yelling at the soldiers and singing jimmy buffet songs at midnight nesbit loaded ellen in his patrol car and took her to luciens harry rex walked home jake slept on the couch monday july not long after the last margarita jake bolted from the couch and stared at the clock on his desk he had slept for three hours a swarm of wild butterflies fought violently in his stomach a nervous pain shot through his groin he had no time for a hangover nesbit slept like an infant behind the wheel jake roused him and jumped in the back seat he waved at the sentries who watched curiously from across the street nesbit drove two blocks to adams released his passenger and waited in the driveway as instructed he showered and shaved quickly he chose a charcoal worsted wool suit a white pinpoint buttondown and a very neutral noncontroversial expressionless burgundy silk tie with a few narrow navy stripes for good measure the pleated pants hung perfectly from his trim waist he looked great much more stylish than the enemy nesbit was asleep again when jake released the dog and jumped in the back seat everything okay in there nesbit asked wiping the saliva from his chin i didnt find any dynamite if thats what you mean nesbit laughed at this with the same irritating laughing response he made to almost everything they circled the square and jake got out in front of his office thirty minutes after he left he turned on the front lights and made the coffee he took four aspirin and drank a quart of grapefruit juice his eyes burned and his head ached from abuse and fatigue and the tiring part had not yet begun on the conference table he spread out his file on carl lee hailey it had been organized and indexed by his law clerk but he wanted to break it down and put it back together if a document or case cant be found in thirty seconds its no good he smiled at jier talent for organization she had files and subfiles on everything all ten seconds away at a fingertip in a oneinch threering notebook she had a summary of dr basss qualifi cations and the outline of his testimony she had made notes on anticipated objections from buckley and provided case authority to fight his objections jake took great pride in his trial preparation but it was humbling to learn from a thirdyear law student he repacked the file in his trial briefcase the heavy black leather one with his initials in gold on the side nature called and he sat on the toilet flipping through the index cards he knew them all he was ready a few minutes after five harry rex knocked on the door it was dark and he looked like a burglar whatta you doing up so early jake asked i couldnt sleep im kinda nervous he thrust forward a loaded paper sack with grease spots dell sent these over theyre fresh and hot sausage biscuits bacon and cheese biscuits chicken and cheese biscuits you name it shes

lawyer could represent a nigger such as hailey and that he hoped the klan got ahold of you and if they didnt he hoped the bar association looked into it and took away your license for helping niggers

yelled im on the potty hes got the runs harry rex told the reporter at sixseven in wilmingtonjake called carla she was awake reading the paper drinking coffee he told her about bud twitty and mickey mouse and the promise of more violence no he wasnt afraid of that it did not bother him he was afraid of the jury of the twelve who would be chosen and their reaction to him and his client his only fear at the moment was of what the jury might do to his client everything else was irrelevant for the first time she did not mention coming home he promised to call that night when he hung up he heard a commotion downstairs ellen had arrived and harry rex was talking loudly shes wearing a seethrough blouse with a miniskirt thought jake as he walked downstairs she was not harry rex was congratulating her on dressing like a southern woman with all the accessories she was wearing a gray glen plaid suit with a vnecked jacket and short slim skirt the silk blouse was black and apparently the necessary garment was underneath her hair was pulled back and braided in some fashion incredibly traces of mascara eyeliner and lipstick were visible in the words of harry rex she looked as much like a lawyer as a woman could look thanks harry rex she said i wish i had your taste in clothes you look nice row ark jake said so do you she said she looked at harry rex but said nothing please

the sack what happens first today after the sun comes up we start the trial at nine noose will say a few words to the jurors and we start the selection process how long will it take asked ellen two or

recess said harry rex i want you to stand behind the clerks table just loiter about like you always do and take notes on the jury try to match them with the notecards therell probably be a hundred and twenty whatever you say daybreak brought the army out in force the barricades were reinstalled and on each corner of the square soldiers clustered around the orange and white barrels blocking the street they were poised and anxious watching every car intently waiting for the enemy to attack wanting some excitement things stirred a little when a few of the vultures in their compact wagons and minivans with fancy logos on the doors appeared at seventhirty the troops surrounded the vehicles and informed everyone there would be no parking around the courthouse during the trial the vultures disappeared down the side streets then moments later reappeared on foot with their bulky cameras and equipment some set up camp on the front steps of the courthouse others by the back door and another group in the rotunda outside the main door of the courtroom on the second floor murphy the janitor and only real eyewitness to the killings of cobb and willard informed the press as best he could that the courtroom would be opened at eight and not a minute before a line formed and soon circled the rotunda the church buses parked somewhere off the square and the marchers were led slowly down jackson street by the ministers they carried free carl lee signs and sang we shall overcome in a perfect chorus as they neared the square the soldiers heard them and the radios began squawking ozzie and the colonel conferred quickly and the soldiers relaxed the marchers were led by ozzie to a section of the front lawn where they milled about and waited under the watchful eyes of the mississippi national guard at eight a metal detector was moved to the front doors of the courtroom and a trio of heavily armed deputies began slowly searching and admitting the crowd of spectators that now filled the rotunda and trailed off into the halls inside the courtroom prather directed traffic seating people on the long pews on one side of the aisle while reserving the other side for the jurors the front pew was reserved for the family and the second row was filled with courtroom artists who immediately began sketching the bench and the bar and the portraits of confederate heroes the klan felt obligated to make its presence known on opening day especially to the prospective jurors as they arrived two dozen kluxers in full parade dress walked quietly onto washington street they were immediately stopped and surrounded by soldiers the potbellied colonel swaggered across the street and for the first time in his life came face to face with a whiterobed and whitehooded ku klux klansman who happened to be a foot taller he then noticed the cameras which had gravitated to this confrontation and the bully in him vanished his usual bark and growl was instantly replaced by a highpitched nervous trembling stutter that was incomprehensible even to himself ozzie arrived and saved him good mornin fellas he said coolly as he stepped beside the faltering colonel weve got you surrounded and weve got you outnumbered we also know we cant keep you from being here thats right said the leader if youll just follow me and do as i say we wont have any trouble they followed ozzie and the colonel to a small area on the front lawn where it was explained that this was their turf for the trial stay there and stay quiet and the colonel would personally keep the troops off them they agreed as expected the sight of the white robes aroused the blacks who were some two hundred feet away they began shouting free carl lee free carl lee free carl lee the klansmen shook their fists and shouted back fry carl lee fry carl lee fry carl lee two rows of troops lined the main sidewalk that divided the lawn and led to the front steps another row stood between the sidewalk and the klansmen and one between the sidewalk and the blacks as the jurors began arriving they walked briskly through the rows of soldiers they clutched their summonses and listened in disbelief as the two groups screamed at each other the honorable rufus buckley arrived in clanton and politely informed the guardsmen of who he was and what that meant and he was allowed to park in his spot marked reserved for da next to the courthouse the reporters went wild this must be important someone had broken through the barricade buckley sat in his wellused cadillac for a moment to allow the reporters to catch him they surrounded him as he slammed the door he smiled and smiled and made his way ever so slowly to the front door of the courthouse the rapid fire of questions proved irresistible and buckley violated the gag order at least eight times each time smiling and explaining that he could not answer the question he had just answered musgrove trailed behind carrying the great mans briefcase jake paced nervously in his office the door was locked ellen was downstairs working on another brief harry rex was at the coffee shop eating another breakfast and gossiping the notecards were scattered on his desk and he was tired of them he flipped through a brief then walked to the french doors the shouting echoed through the open windows he returned to the desk and studied the outline of his opening comments to the prospective jurors the first impression was critical he lay on the couch closed his eyes and thought of a thousand things hed rather be doing for the most part he enjoyed his work but there were moments frightening moments like this one when he wished hed become an insurance agent or a stockbroker or maybe even a tax lawyer surely those guys didnt regularly suffer from nausea and diarrhea at critical moments in their careers lucien had taught him that fear was good fear was an ally that every lawyer was afraid when he stood before a new jury and presented his case it was okay to be afraid just dont show it jurors would not follow the lawyer with the quickest tongue or prettiest words they would not follow the sharpest dresser they would not follow a clown or court jester they would not follow the lawyer who preached the loudest or fought the hardest lucien had convinced him that jurors followed the lawyer who told the truth regardless of his looks words or superficial abilities a lawyer had to be himself in the courtroom and if he was afraid so be it the jurors were afraid too make friends with fear lucien always said because it will not go away and it will destroy you if left uncontrolled the fear hit deep in his bowels and he walked carefully downstairs to the rest room how are you boss ellen asked whenhe checked on her ready i guess well leave in a minute there are some reporters waiting outside i told them you had withdrawn from the case and left town at this moment i wish i had have you heard of wendall solomon not right off hand hes with the southern prisoner defense fund i worked under him last summer hes tried over a hundred capital cases all over the south he gets so nervous before a trial he can neither eat nor sleep his doctor gives him seda tives but hes still so jumpy no one speaks to him on opening day and thats after a hundred of these trials how does your father handle it he has a couple of martinis with a valium then he lies on his desk with the door locked and the lights off until its time for court his nerves are ragged and hes illtempered of course a lot of that is natural so you know the feeling i know it well do i look nervous you look tired but youll do jake checked his watch lets go the reporters on the sidewalk pounced on their prey no comment he insisted as he moved slowly across the street toward the courthouse the barrage continued is it true you plan to ask for a mistrial i cant do that until the trial starts is it true the klan has threatened you no comment is it true you sent your family out of town until after the trial jake hesitated and glanced at the reporter no comment what do you think of the national guard im proud of them can your client get a fair trial in ford county jake shook his head then added no comment a deputy stood guard a few feet from where the bodies had come to rest he pointed at ellen whos she jake shes harmless shes with me they ran up the rear stairs carl lee sat alone at the defense table his back to the packed courtroom jean gillespie was busy checking in jurors while deputies roamed the aisles looking for anything suspicious jake greeted his client warmly taking special care to shake his hand smile broadly at him and put his hand on his shoulder ellen unpacked the briefcases and neatly arranged the files on the table jake whispered to his client and looked around the courtroom all eyes were on him the hailey clan sat handsomely in the front row jake smiled at them and nodded at lester tbnya and the boys were decked out in their sunday clothes and they sat between lester and gwen like perfect little statues the jurors sat across the aisle and they were carefully studying haileys lawyer jake thought this would be a good time for the jurors to see the family so he walked through the swinging gate in the railing and went to speak to the haileys he patted gwen on the shoulder shook hands with lester pinched each of the boys and finally hugged tonya the little hailey girl the one who had been raped by the two rednecks who got what they deserved the jurors watched every move of this production and paid special attention to the little girl noose wants us in chambers musgrove whispered to jake as he returned to the defense table ichabod buckley and the court reporter were chatting when jake and ellen entered chambers jake introduced his clerk to his honor and buckley and musgrove and to norma gallo the court reporter he explained that ellen roark was a thirdyear law student at ole miss who was clerking in his office and requested that she be allowed to sit near counsel table and participate in the proceedings in chambers buckley had no objections it was common practice noose explained and he welcomed her preliminary matters gentlemen noose asked none said the da several said jake as he opened a file i want this on the record norma gallo started writing first of all i want to renew my motion for a change of venue we object interrupted buckley shut up governor jake yelled im not through and dont interrupt me again buckley and the others were startled by this loss of composure its all those margaritas thought ellen i apologize mr brigance buckley said calmly please dont refer to me as governor let me say something at this point noose started this trial will be a long and arduous ordeal i can appreciate the pressure youre both under ive been in your shoes many times myself and i know what youre going through youre both excellent lawyers and im thankful that i have two fine lawyers for a trial of this magnitude i can also detect a certain amount of ill will between you thats certainly not uncommon and i will not ask you to shake hands and be good friends but i will insist that when youre in my courtroom or in these chambers that you refrain from interrupting each other and that the shouting be held to a bare minimum you will refer to each other as mr brigance and mr buckley and mr musgrove now do each of you understand what im saying yes sir yes sir good then continue mr brigance thank you your honor i appreciate that as i was saying the defendant renews his motion for a change of venue i want the record to reflect that as we sit here now in chambers at ninefifteen july twentysecond as we are about to select a jury the ford county courthouse is surrounded by the mississippi national guard on the front lawn a group of ku klux klansmen in white robes is at this very moment yelling at a group of black demonstrators who are of course yelling back the two groups are separated by heavily armed national guardsmen as the jurors arrived for court this morning they witnessed this circus on the courthouse lawn it will be impossible to select a fair and impartial jury buckley watched with a cocky grin on his huge face and when jake finished he said may i respond your honor no noose said bluntly motion is overruled what else do you have the defense moves to strike this entire panel on what grounds on the grounds that there has been an overt effort by the klan to intimidate this panel we know of at least twenty cross burnings i intend to excuse those twenty assuming they all showed up said noose fine jake replied sarcastically what about the threats we dont know about what about the jurors whove heard of the cross burnings noose wiped his eyes and said nothing buckley had a speech but didnt want to interrupt ive got a list here jake said reaching into a file of the twenty jurors who received visits ive also got copies of the police reports and an affidavit from sheriff walls in which he details the acts of intimidation i am submitting these to the court in support of my motion to strike this panel i want this made a part of the record so the supreme court can see it in black and white expecting an appeal mr brigance asked mr buckley ellen had just met rufus buckley and now seconds later she understood exactly why jake and harry rex hated him no governor im not expecting an appeal im trying to insure that my man gets a fair trial from a fair jury you should understand that im not going to strike this panel that would cost us a week noose said whats time when a mans life is at stake were talking about justice the right to a fair trial remember a most basic constitutional right its a travesty not to strike this panel when you know for a fact that some of these people have been intimidated by a bunch of goons in white robes who want to see my client hanged your motion is overruled noose said flatly what else do you have nothing really i request that when you do excuse the twenty you so do in such a way that the other jurors dont know the reason i can handle that mr brigance mr pate was sent to find jean gillespie noose handed her a list of the twenty names she returned to the courtroom and read the list they were not needed for jury duty and were free to go she returned to chambers how many jurors do we have noose asked her ninetyfour thats enough im sure we can find twelve who are fit to serve you couldnt find two jake mumbled to ellen loud enough for noose to hear and norma gallo to record his honor excused them and they took their places in the courtroom ninetyfour names were written on small strips of paper that were placed in a short wooden cylinder jean gillespie spun the cylinder stopped it and picked a name at random she handed it to noose who sat above her and everyone else on his throne or bench as it was called the courtroom watched in dead silence as he squinted down that nose and looked at the first name carlene malone juror number one he shrieked in his loudest voice the front row had been cleared and mrs malone took her seat next to the aisle each pew would seat ten and there were ten pews all to be filled with jurors the ten pews on the other side of the aisle were packed with family friends spectators but mainly reporters who scribbled down the name of carlene malone jake wrote her name too she was white fat divorced lower income she was a two on the brigance scale zero for one he thought jean spun again marcia dickens juror number two yelled noose white fat over sixty with a rather unforgiving look zero for two jo beth mills number three jake sank a little in his seat she was white about fifty and worked for minimum wage at a shirt factory in karaway thanks to affirmative action she had a black boss who was ignorant and abusive she had a zero by her name on the brigance notecard zero for three jake stared desperately at jean as she spun again reba betts number four he sunk lower and began pinching his forehead zero for four this is incredible he mumbled in the direction of ellen harry rex shook his head gerald ault number five jake smiled as his numberone juror took a seat next to reba betts buckley placed a nasty black mark by his name alex summers number six carl lee managed a weak smile as the first black emerged from the rear and took a seat next to gerald ault buckley smiled too as he neatly circled the name of the first black the next four were white women none of whom rated above three on the scale jake was worried as the first pew filled by law he had twelve peremptory challenges free strikes with no reason required the luck of the draw would force him to use at least half of his peremptories on the first pew walter godsey number eleven announced noose his voice declining steadily in volume godsey was a middleaged sharecropper with no compassion and no potential when noose finished the second row it contained seven white women two black men and godsey jake sensed a disaster relief didnt come until the fourth row when jean hit a hot streak and pulled the names of seven men four of whom were black it took almost an hour to seat the entire panel noose recessed for fifteen minutes to allow jean time to type a numerical list of names jake and ellen used the break to review their notes and place the names with the faces harry rex had sat at the counter behind the red docket books and feverishly taken notes while noose called the names he huddled with jake and agreed things were not going well at eleven noose reassumed the bench and the courtroom was silenced someone suggested he should use the mike and he placed it within inches of his nose he spoke loudly and his fragile obnoxious voice rattled violently around the courtroom as he asked a lengthy series of statutorily required questions he introduced carl lee and asked if any juror was kin to him or knew him they all knew of him and noose assumed that but only two of the panel admitted knowing him prior to may noose introduced the lawyers then explained briefly the nature of the charges not a single juror confessed to being ignorant of the hailey case noose rambled on and on and mercifully finished at twelvethirty he recessed until two dell delivered hot sandwiches and iced tea to the conference room jake hugged and thanked her and told her to send him the bill he ignored his food and laid the notecards on the table in the order the jurors had been seated harry rex attacked a roast beef and cheddar sandwich we got a terrible draw he kept repeating with both cheeks stretched to the limit we got a terrible draw when the ninetyfourth card was in place jake stood back and studied them ellen stood beside him and nibbled on a french fry she studied the cards we got a terrible draw harry rex said washing it all down with a pint of tea would you shut up jake snapped of the first fifty we have eight black men three black women and thirty white women that leaves nine white men and most are unattractive looks like a white female jury ellen said white females white females harry rex said the worst possible jurors in the world white females ellen stared at him i think fat white men are the worst jurors dont get me wrong row ark i love white females ive married four of them remember i just hate white female jurors i wouldnt vote to convict him row ark youre an aclu communist you wouldnt vote to convict anybody of anything in your little demented mind you think child pornographers and plo terrorists are really swell people whove been abused by the system and should be given a break and in your rational civilized and compassionate mind what do you think we should do with them hang them by their toes castrate them and let them bleed to death without a trial and the way you understand the law that would be constitutional maybe not but itd stop a lot of child pornography and terrorism jake are you gonna eat this sandwich no harry rex unwrapped a ham and cheese stay away from number one carlene malone shes one of those malones from lake village white trash and mean as hell id like to stay away from this entire panel jake said still staring at the table we got a terrible draw whatta you think row ark jake asked harry rex swallowed quickly i think we oughtta plead him guilty and get the hell outta there run like a scalded dog ellen stared at the cards it could be worse harry rex forced a loud laugh worse the only way it could be worse would be if the first thirty were sitting there wearing white robes with pointed hats and little masks harry rex would you shut up jake said just trying to help do you want your french fries no why dont you put all of them in your mouth and chew on them for a long time i think youre wrong about some of these women ellen said im inclined to agree with lucien women as a very general rule will have more sympathy were the ones who get raped remember i have no response to that harry rex said thanks replied jake which one of these girls is your former client wholl supposedly do anything for you if youll simply wink at her ellen snickered must be number twentynine shes five feet tall and weighs four hundred pounds harry rex wiped his mouth with a sheet of paper very funny number seventyfour shes too far back forget her noose rapped his gavel at two and the courtroom came to order the state may examine the panel he said the magnificent district attorney rose slowly and walked importantly to the bar where he stood and gazed pensively at the spectators and jurors he realized the artists were sketching him and he seemed to pose for just a moment he smiled sincerely at the jurors then introduced himself he explained that he was the peoples lawyer his client the state of mississippi he had served as their prosecutor for nine years now and it was an honor for which he would always be grateful to the fine folks of ford county he pointed at them and told them that they the very ones sitting there were the folks who had elected him to represent them he thanked them and hoped he did not let them down yes he was nervous and frightened he had prosecuted thousands of criminals but he was always scared with each trial yes he was scared and not ashamed to admit it scared because of the awesome responsibility the people had bestowed upon him as the man responsible for sending criminals to jail and protecting the people scared because he might fail to adequately represent his client the people of this great state jake had heard all this crap many times before he had it memorized buckley the good guy the states lawyer united with the people to seek justice to save society he was a smooth gifted orator who one moment could chat softly with a jury much like a grandfather giving advice to his grandchildren the next moment he would launch into a tirade and deliver a sermon that any black preacher would envy a split second later in a fluid burst of eloquence he could convince a jury that the stability of our society yes even the future of the human race depended upon a guilty verdict he was at his best in big trials and this was his biggest he spoke without notes and held the courtroom captivated as he portrayed himself as the underdog the friend and partner of the jury who together with him would find the truth and punish this man for his monstrous deed after ten minutes jake had enough he stood with a frustrated look your honor i object to this mr buckley is not selecting a jury im not sure what hes doing but hes not interrogating the panel sustained noose yelled into the mike if you dont have any questions for the panel mr buckley then please sit down i apologize your honor buckley said awkwardly pretending to be hurt jake had drawn first blood buckley picked up a legal pad and launched into a list of a thousand questions he asked if anyone on the panel had ever served on a jury before several hands went up civil or criminal did you vote to acquit or convict how long ago was the defendant black or white victim black or white had anyone been the victim of a violent crime two hands when where was the assailant caught convicted black or white jake harry rex and ellen took pages of notes any member of your family been the victim of a violent crime several more hands when where what happened to the criminal any member of your family ever been charged with a crime indicted put on trial convicted any friends or family members employed in law enforcement who where for three nonstop hours buckley probed and picked like a surgeon he was masterful the preparation was obvious he asked questions that jake had not considered and he asked virtually every question jake had written in his outline he delicately pried details of personal feelings and opinions and when the time was right he would say something funny so everyone could laugh and relieve the tension he held the courtroom in his palm and when noose stopped him at five oclock he was in full stride he would finish in the morning his honor adjourned until nine the next morning jake talked to his client for a few moments while the crowd moved toward the rear ozzie stood nearby with the handcuffs when jake finished carl lee knelt before his family on the front row and hugged them all he would see them tomorrow he said ozzie led him into the holding room and down the stairs where a swarm of deputies waited to take him to jail for day two the sun rose quickly in the east and in seconds burned the dew off the thick green bermuda around the ford county courthouse a sticky invisible fog smoldered from the grass and clung to the heavy boots and bulky pants of the soldiers the sun baked them as they nonchalantly paced the sidewalks of downtown clanton they loitered under shade trees and the canopies of small shops by the time breakfast was served under the pavilions the soldiers had stripped to their pale green undershirts and were drenched in sweat the black preachers and their followers went directly to their spot and set up camp they unfolded lawn chairs under oak trees and placed coolers of ice water on card tables blue and white free carl lee placards were tacked on tomato stakes and stuck in the ground like neat fencerows agee had printed some new posters with an enlarged black and white photo of carl lee in the center and a red white and blue border they were slick and professional the klansmen went obediently to their section of the front lawn they brought their own placardswhite backgrounds with bold red letters screaming fry carl lee fry carl lee they waved them at the blacks across the lawn and the two groups started shouting the soldiers formed neat lines along the sidewalk and stood armed but casual as obscenities and chants flew over their heads it was am of day two the reporters were giddy with all the newsworthiness they rushed to the front lawn when the yelling started ozzie and the colonel walked around and around the courthouse pointing here and there and yelling into their radios at nine ichabod said good morning to the standingroomonly crowd buckley stood slowly and with great animation informed his honor that he had no further questions for the panel lawyer brigance rose from his seat with rubber knees and turbulence in his stomach he walked to the railing and gazed into the anxious eyes of ninetyfour prospective jurors the crowd listened intently to this young cocky mouthpiece who had once boasted of never having lost a murder case he appeared relaxed and confident his voice was loud yet warm his words were educated yet colloquial he introduced himself again and his client then his clients family saving the little girl for last he complimented the da for such an exhaustive interrogation yesterday afternoon and confessed that most of his questions had already been asked he glanced at his notes his first question was a bombshell ladies and gentlemen do any of you believe that the insanity defense should not be used under any circumstances they squirmed a little but no hands he caught them offguard right off the bat insanity insanity the seed had been planted if we prove carl lee hailey was legally insane when he shot billy ray cobb and pete willard is there a person on this panel who cannot find him not guilty the question was hard to followintentionally so there were no hands a few wanted to respond but they were not certain of the appropriate response jake eyed them carefully knowing most of them were confused but also knowing that for this moment every member of the panel was thinking about his client being insane thats where he would leave them thank you he said with all the charm he had ever mustered in his life i have nothing further your honor buckley looked confused he stared at the judge who was equally bewildered is that all noose asked incredulously is that all mr brigance yes sir your honor the panel looks fine to me jake said with an air of trust as opposed to buckley who had grilled them for three hours the panel was anything but acceptable to jake but there was no sense repeating the same questions buckley had asked very well let me see the attorneys in chambers buckley musgrove jake ellen and mr pate followed icnadod through the door behind the bench and sat around the desk in chambers noose spoke i assume gentlemen that you want each juror questioned individually on the death penalty yes sir said jake thats correct your honor said buckley very well mr bailiff would you bring in juror number one carlene malone mr pate left walked to the courtroom and yelled for carlene malone moments later she followed him into chambers she was terrified the attorneys smiled but said nothing nooses instructions please have a seat noose offered as he removed his robe this will only take a minute mrs malone do you have any strong feelings one way or the other about the death penalty asked noose she shook her head nervously and stared at ichabod uh no sir you realize that if youre selected for this jury and mr hailey is convicted you will be called upon to sentence him to death yes sir if the state proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the killings were premeditated and if you believe mr hailey was not legally insane at the time of the killings could you consider imposing the death penalty certainly i think it should be used all the time might stop some of this meanness im all for it jake continued smiling and nodding politely at juror number one buckley smiled too and winked at musgrove thank you mrs malone you may return to your seat in the courtroom noose said bring in number two noose ordered mr pate marcia dickens an elderly white woman with a hard frown was led to chambers yes sir she said she was very much in favor of the death penalty would have no problems voting for it jake sat there and smiled buckley winked again noose thanked her and called for number three three and four were equally unforgiving ready to kill if the proof was there then number five gerald ault jakes secret weapon was seated in chambers thank you mr ault this will only take a minute noose repeated first of all do you have strong feelings for or against the death penalty oh yes sir ault answered eagerly his voice and face radiating compassion im very much against it its cruel and unusual im ashamed i live in a society which permits the legal killing of a human being i see could you under any circumstances if you were a juror vote to impose the death penalty oh no sir under no circumstances regardless of the crime no sir buckley cleared his throat and somberly announced your honor the state would challenge mr ault for cause and move to excuse him under the authority of state vs witherspoon motion sustained mr ault you are excused from jury duty noose said you may leave the courtroom if you wish if you choose to remain in the courtroom i ask that you not sit with the other jurors ault was puzzled and looked helplessly at his friend jake who at the moment was staring at the floor with a tight mouth may i ask why gerald asked noose removed his glasses and became the professor under the law mr ault the court is required to excuse any potential juror who admits he or she cannot consider and the key word is consider the death penalty you see whether you like it or not the death penalty is a legal method of punishment in mississippi and in most states therefore it is unfair to select jurors who cannot follow the law the curiosity of the crowd was piqued when gerald ault emerged from behind the bench walked through the small gate in the railing and left the courtroom the bailiff fetched number six alex summers and led him to chambers he returned moments later and took his seat on the first row he lied about the death penalty he opposed it as did most blacks but he told noose he had no objections to it no problem later during a recess he quietly met with other black jurors and explained how the questions in chambers should be answered the slow process continued until midafternoon when the last juror left chambers eleven had been excused due to reservations about capital punishment noose recessed at threethirty and gave the lawyers until four to review their notes in the library on the third floor jake and his team stared at the jury lists and notecards it was time to decide he had dreamed about names written in blue and red and black with numbers beside them he had watched them in the courtroom for two full days now he knew them ellen wanted women harry rex wanted men noose stared at his master list with the jurors renumbered to reflect the dismissals for cause and looked at his lawyers gentlemen are you ready good as you know this is a capital case so each of you have twelve peremptory challenges mr buckley you are required to submit a list of twelve jurors to the defense please start with juror number one and

to you may we have a moment to confer your honor five minutes noose replied jake and his clerk stepped next door to the coffee room where harry rex was waiting look at this jake said as he laid the list on a table and the three huddled around it were down to twentynine ive got four challenges left and so does buckley hes struck every black and every male its an allwhite female jury right now the next two are white females thirtyone is clyde sisco and thirtytwo is barry acker then four of the next six are black ellen said yeah but buckley wont take it that far in fact im surprised hes let us get this close to the fourth row i know you want acker what about sisco asked harry rex im afraid of him lucien said hes a crook who could be bought great lets get him then go buy him very funny how

alternates mr buckley thirtythree and thirtyfour juror thirtythree was a black male thirtyfour was a white female jake wanted the next two were black males well strike thirtythree accept thirtyfour and thirtyfive the defense will accept both jake said mr pate brought the courtroom to order as noose and the lawyers took their places his honor called the names of the twelve and they slowly nervously made their way to the jury box where they were seated in order by jean gillespie ten women two men all white the blacks in the courtroom mumbled and eyed each other in disbelief did you pick that jury carl lee whispered to jake ill explain later jake said the two alternates were called and seated next to the jury box whats the black dude for carl lee whispered nodding at the alternate ill explain later jake said noose cleared his throat and looked down at his new jury ladies and gentlemen you have been carefully selected to serve as jurors in this case you have been sworn to fairly try all issues presented before you and to follow the law as i instruct now according to mississippi law you will be sequestered until this trial is over this means you will be housed in a motel and will not be allowed to return home until its over i realize this is an extreme hardship but its one the law requires in just a few moments we will recess until in the morning and you will be given the chance to call home and order your clothes toiletries and whatever else you need each night you will stay in a motel at an undisclosed location outside of clanton any questions the twelve appeared dazed bewildered by the thought of not going home for several days they thought of families kids jobs laundry why them out of all those people in the courtroom why them with no response noose banged his gavel and the courtroom began to empty juror to the judges chambers where she called home and ordered clothes and a toothbrush where are we going she asked jean its confidential jean said its confidential she repeated over the phone to her husband by seven the families had responded with a wild assortment of luggage and boxes the chosen ones loaded a chartered greyhound bus outside the rear door preceded by two patrol cars and an army jeep and followed by three state troopers the bus circled the square and left clanton stump sisson died tuesday night at the burn hospital in memphis his short fat body had been neglected over the years and proved itself deficient in resisting the complications bred by the serious burns his death brought to four the number of fatalities related to the rape of tonya hailey cobb willard bud twitty and now sisson immediately word of his death reached the cabin deep in the woods where the patriots met ate and drank each night after the trial revenge they vowed an eye for an eye and so on there were new recruits from ford countyfive in allmaking a total of eleven local boys they were eager and hungry and wanted some action the trial had been too quiet so far it was time for excitement jake paced in front of the couch and delivered his opening statement for the hundredth time ellen listened intently she had listened interrupted objected criticized and argued for two hours she was tired now he had it perfect the margaritas had calmed him and plated his tongue silver the words flowed smoothly he was gifted especially after a drink or two when he finished they sat on the balcony and watched the candles inch slowly in the darkness around the square the laughter from the poker games under the pavilions echoed softly through the night there was no moon ellen left for the final round of drinks she returned with her same beer mugs filled with ice and margaritas she sat them on the table and stood behind her boss she placed her hands on his shoulders and began rubbing the lower part of his neck with her thumbs he relaxed and moved his head from side to side she massaged his shoulders and upper back and pressed her body against his ellen its tenthirty and im sleepy where are you staying tonight where do you think i should stay i think you should stay at your apartment at ole miss im too drunk to drive nesbit will drive you where may i ask are you staying at the house my wife and i own on adams street she stopped rubbing and grabbed her drink jake stood and leaned over the rail and yelled at nesbit nesbit wake up youre driving to oxford carla found the story on the second page of the front section all white jury chosen for hailey read the headline jake had not called tuesday night she read the story and ignored her coffee the beach house sat by itself in a semisecluded area of the beach the nearest neighbor was two hundred yards away her father owned the land in between and had no plans to sell it he had built the house ten years earlier when he sold his company in knoxville and retired wealthy carla was the only child and now hanna would be the only grandchild the housewith four bedrooms and four bathrooms scattered over three levelshad room for a dozen grandchildren she finished the article and walked to the bay windows in the breakfast room overlooking the beach and then the ocean the brilliant orange mass of the sun had just cleared the horizon she preferred the warmth of the bed until well after daybreak but life with jake had brought new adventure to the first seven hours of each day her body was conditioned to at least wake up at fivethirty he once told her his goal was to go to work in the dark and return from work in the dark he usually achieved this goal he took great pride in working more hours each day than any lawyer in ford county he was different but she loved him fortyeight miles northeast of clanton the milburn county seat of temple lay peacefully beside the tippah river it had three thousand people and two motels the temple inn was deserted there being no moral reason to be there this time of year at the end of one secluded wing eight rooms were occupied and guarded by soldiers and a couple of state troopers the ten women had paired off nicely as had barry acker and clyde sisco the black alternate ben lester newton was awarded a room to himself as was the other alternate francie pitts the televisions had been disconnected and no newspapers were allowed supper tuesday night had been delivered to the rooms and wednesdays breakfast arrived promptly at seventhirty while the greyhound warmed and blew diesel fumes all over the parking lot thirty minutes later the fourteen loaded aboard and the entourage set out for clanton they talked on the bus about their families and jobs two or three had known each other prior to monday most were strangers they awkwardly avoided any mention of why they were all together and the task before them judge noose had been very plain on this point no discussions about the case they wanted to talk about many things the rape the rapists carl lee jake buckley noose the klan lots of things everyone knew of the burning crosses but they werent discussed at least they werent discussed on the bus there had been many discussions back in the motel rooms the greyhound arrived at the courthouse five minutes before nine and the jurors stared through dark windows to see how many blacks and how many klansmen and how many others were being separated by the guardsmen it eased past the barricades and parked at the rear of the courthouse where the deputies were waiting to escort them upstairs as soon as possible they went up the back stairs to the jury room where coffee and doughnuts were waiting the bailiff informed them it was nine and his honor was ready to start he led them into the crowded courtroom and into the jury box where they sat in their designated seats all rise for the court mr pate yelled please be seated noose said as he fell into the tall leather chair behind the bench good morning ladies and gentlemen he said warmly to the jurors i trust youre all feeling well this morning and ready to go they all nodded good im going to ask you this question every morning did anybody attempt to contact you talk to you or influence you in any way last night they all shook their heads good did you discuss this case among yourselves they all lied and shook their heads good if anyone attempts to contact you and discuss me as soon as possible do you understand they nodded now at this time we are ready to start the trial the first order of business is to allow the attorneys to make opening statements i want to caution you that nothing the attorneys say is testimony and is not to be taken as evidence mr buckley do you wish to make an opening statement buckley rose and buttoned his shiny polyester coat yes your honor i thought so you may proceed buckley lifted the small wooden podium and moved it squarely in front of the jury box where he stood behind it and breathed deeply and slowly flipped through some notes on a legal pad he enjoyed the brief period of quietness with all eyes on him and all ears anxious for his words he started by thanking the jurors for being there for their sacrifices for their citizenship as if they had a choice thought jake he was proud of them and honored to be associated with them in this most important case again he was their lawyer his client the state of mississippi he expressed fear at this awesome responsibility that they the people had given to him rufus buckley a simple country lawyer from smithfield he rambled on about himself and his thoughts on the trial and his hopes and prayers that he would do a good job for the people of this state he gave pretty much the same spiel in all of his opening statements but this was a better performance it was refined and polished garbage and objectionable jake wanted to burn him but from experience he knew ichabod would not sustain an objection during an opening statement unless the offense was flagrant and buckleys rhetoric did not qualify yet all this fake sincerity and gushiness irritated jake to no end primarily because the jury listened to it and more often than not fell for it the prosecutor was always the good guy seeking to right an injustice and punish a criminal for some heinous crime to lock him away forever so he could sin no more buckley was master at convincing a jury right off the mark during the opening statement that it was up to them he and the twelve chosen ones to search diligently for the truth together as a team united against evil it was the truth they were after nothing but the truth find the truth and justice would win follow him rufus buckley the peoples lawyer and they would find the truth the rape was a terrible deed he was a father in fact had a daughter the same age of tonya hailey and when he first heard of the rape he was sick at his stomach he grieved for carl lee and his wife yes he thought of his own little girls and had thoughts of retribution jake smiled quickly at ellen this was interesting buckley had chosen to confront the rape instead of keeping it from the jury jake was expecting a critical confrontation with him on the admissibility of any testimony regarding the rape ellens research found the law to be clear that the lurid details were inadmissible but it wasnt so clear as to whether it could be mentioned or referred to evidently buckley felt it was better to acknowledge the rape than try to hide it good move thought jake since all twelve and the rest of the world knew the details anyway ellen smiled too the rape of tonya hailey was about to be tried for the first time buckley explained it would be natural for any parent to want revenge he would too he admitted but he continued with his voice growing heavier there is a mighty distinction between wanting revenge and getting revenge he was warming up now as he paced deliberately back and forth ignoring the podium getting his rhythm he launched himself into a twentyminute discourse on the criminal justice system and how it was practiced in mississippi and how many rapists that he rufus buckley had personally sent to parchman for life most of them the system worked because mississippians had enough good common sense to make it work and it would collapse if people like carl lee hailey were allowed to shortcircuit the system and dispense justice according to their own terms imagine that a lawless society where vigilantes roamed at will no police no jails no courts no trials no juries every man for himself it was sort of ironic he said winding down for a moment carl lee hailey now sat before them asking for due process and a fair trial yet he did not believe in such things ask the mothers ot billy ray cobb and pete willard ask them what kind of fair trials their sons received he paused to allow the jury and the courtroom to absorb and ponder that last thought it sunk in heavy and every person in the jury box looked at carl lee hailey they were not looks of compassion jake cleaned his fingernails with a small knife and looked thoroughly bored buckley pretended to review his notes at the podium then checked his watch he started again this time in a most confident businesslike tone of voice the state would prove that carl lee hailey carefully planned the killings he waited for almost an hour in a small room next to the stairs where he knew the boys would eventually be led as they were taken back to jail he somehow managed to sneak an m into the courthouse buckley walked to a small table by the court reporter and hoisted the m this is the m he announced to the jury waving it wildly about with one hand he sat it on the podium and talked about how it was carefully selected by carl lee hailey because he had used one before in close combat and he knew how to kill with it he had been trained with an m its an illegal weapon you cant buy one down at the western auto he had to go find it he planned it the proof would be clear premeditated carefully planned coldblooded murder and then there was deputy dewayne looney a fourteenyear veteran of the sheriffs department a family man one of the finest law enforcement officers he had ever known gunned down in the line of duty by carl lee hailey his leg was partially amputated what was his sin perhaps the defense would say it was accidental that it shouldnt count thats no defense in mississippi theres no excuse ladies and gentlemen for any of this violence the verdict must be guilty they each had an hour for their openings and the lure of that much time proved irresistible for the da whose remarks were becoming repetitive he lost himself twice during his condemnation of the insanity ruse the jurors began to look bored and searched for other points of interest around the courtroom the artists quit sketching the reporters quit writing and noose cleaned his glasses seven or eight times it was a known fact that noose cleaned the glasses to stay awake and fight boredom and he usually deaned them throughout the trial jake had seen him rub them with a handkerchief or tie or shirttail while witnesses broke down and cried and lawyers screamed and flailed their arms at each other he didnt miss a word or objection or trick he was just bored with it all even a case of this magnitude he never slept on the bench although he was sorely tempted at times instead he removed his glasses held them upward in the light blew on them rubbed them as though they were caked with grease then remounted them just north of the wart no more than five minutes later they would be dirty again the longer buckley droned on the more they were cleaned finally after an hour and a half buckley shut up and the courtroom sighed tenminute recess noose announced and lunged off the bench through the door past chambers to the mens room jake had planned a brief opening and after buckleys marathon he decided to make it even shorter most people dont like lawyers to begin with especially longwinded talltalking wordy lawyers who feel that every insignificant point must be repeated at least three times and the major ones have to be hammered and drilled by constant repetition into whoever happened to be listening jurors especially dislike lawyers who waste time for two very good reasons first they cant tell the lawyers to shut up theyre captives outside the courtroom a person can curse a lawyer and shut him up but in the jury box they become trapped and forbidden to speak thus they must resort to sleeping snoring glaring squirming checking their watches or any one of a dozen signals which boring lawyers never recognize second jurors dont like long trials cut the crap and get it over with give us the facts and well give you a verdict he explained this to his client during the recess i agree keep it short said carl lee he did fourteen minutes worth of opening statement and the jury appreciated every word he began by talking about daughters and how special they are how they are different from little boys and need special protection he told them of his own daughter and trie special oonu mat exists between father and daughter a bond that could not be explained and should not be tampered with he admitted admiration for mr buckley and his alleged ability to be so forgiving and compassionate to any drunken pervert who might rape his daughter he was a big man indeed but in reality could they as jurors as parents be so tender and trusting and indulging if their daughter had been rapedby two drunk stoned brutal animals who tied her to a tree and objection shouted buckley sustained noose shouted back he ignored the shouting and continued softly he asked them to try to imagine throughout the trial how they would feel had it been their daughter he asked them not to convict carl lee but to send him home to his family he didnt mention insanity they knew it was coming he finished shortly after he started and left the jury with a marked contrast in the two styles is that all noose asked in amazement jake nodded as he sat by his client very well mr buckley you may call your first witness the state calls cora cobb the bailiff went to the witness room and fetched mrs cobb he led her through the door by the jury box into the courtroom where she was sworn by jean gillespie and then he seated her in the witness chair speak into the microphone he instructed you are cora cobb buckley asked with full volume as he situated the podium near the railing yes sir where do you live route lake village ford county you are the mother of billy ray cobb deceased yes sir she said as her eyes watered she was a rural woman whose husband had left when the boys were small they had raised themselves while she worked two shifts at a cheap furniture factory between karaway and lake village she lost control over them at an early age she was about fifty tried to look forty with hair dye and makeup but could easily pass for early sixties how old was your son at the time of his death twentythree when did you last see him alive just a few seconds before he was kilt where did you see him here in this courtroom where was he killed downstairs did you hear the shots that killed your son she began to cry yes sir where did you last see him at the funeral home and what was his condition he was dead nothing further buckley announced crossexamination mr brigance she was a harmless witness called to establish that the victim was indeed dead and to evoke a little sympathy nothing could be gained by crossexamination and normally she would have been left alone but jake saw an opportunity he couldnt pass he saw a chance to set the tone for the trial to wake noose and buckley and the jury to just get everyone aroused she was not really that pitiful she was faking some buckley had probably instructed her to cry if possible just a few questions jake said as he walked behind buckley and musgrove to the podium the da was immediately suspicious mrs cobb is it true that your son was convicted of selling marijuana objection buckley roared springing to his feet the criminal record of the victim is inadmissible sustained thank you your honor jake said properly as if noose had done him a favor she wiped her eyes and cried harder you say your son was twentythree when he died yes in his twentythree years how many other children am he rape objection objection yelled buckley waving his arms and looking desperately at noose who was yelling sustained sustained youre out of order mr brigance youre out of order mrs cobb burst into tears and bawled uncontrollably as the shouting erupted she managed to keep the microphone in her face and her wailing and carrying on resounded through the stunned courtroom he should be admonished your honor buckley demanded his face and eyes glowing with violent anger and his neck a deep purple ill withdraw the question jake replied loudly as he returned to his seat cheap shot brigance musgrove mumbled please admonish him buckley begged and instruct the jury to disregard any redirect asked noose no answered buckley as he dashed to the witness stand with a handkerchief to rescue mrs cobb who had buried her head in her hands and was sobbing and shaking violently you are excused mrs cobb noose said bailiff please assist the witness the bailiff lifted her by the arm with buckleys assistance and led her down from the witness stand in front of the jury box through the railing down the center aisle she shrieked and whined every step of the way and her noises increased as she neared the back door until she was roaring at full throttle when she made her exit noose glared at jake until she was gone and the courtroom was quiet again then he turned to the jury and said please disregard the last question by mr brigance whatd you do that for carl lee whispered to his lawyer ill explain later the state calls earnestine willard buckley announced in a quieter tone and with much more hesitation mrs willard was brought from the witness room above the courtroom she was sworn and seated you are earnestine willard asked buckley yes sir she said in a fragile voice life had been rough on her too but she had a certain dignity that made her more pitiful and believable than mrs cobb the clothes were inexpensive but clean and neatly pressed the hair was minus the cheap black dye that mrs cobb relied on so heavily the face was minus the layers of makeup when she began crying she cried to herself and where do you live out from lake village pete willard was your son yes sir when did you last see him alive right here in this room just before he was killed did you hear the gunfire that killed him yes sir where did you last see him at the funeral home and what was his condition he was dead she said wiping tears with a kleenex im very sorry buckley offered no further questions he added eyeing jake carefully any crossexamination noose asked also eyeing jake suspiciously just a couple jake said mrs willard im jake brigance he stood behind the podium and looked at her without compassion she nodded how old was your son when he died twentyseven buckley pushed his chair from the table and sat on its edge ready to spring noose removed his glasses and leaned forward carl lee lowered his head during his twentyseven years how many other children did he rape buckley bolted upright objection objection objection sustained sustained sustained the yelling frightened mrs willard and she cried louder admonish him judge he must be admonished ill withdraw the question jake said on his way back to his seat buckley pleaded with his hands but thats not good enough judge he must be admonished lets go into chambers noose ordered he excused the witness and recessed until one harry rex was waiting on the balcony of jakes office with sandwiches and a pitcher of margaritas jake declined and drank grapefruit juice ellen wanted just one a small one she said to calm her nerves for the third day lunch had been prepared by dell and personally delivered to jakes office compliments of the coffee shop they ate and relaxed on the balcony and watched the carnival around the courthouse what happened in chambers harry rex demanded jake nibbled on a reuben he said he wanted to talk about something other than the trial what happened in chambers dammit cardinals are three games out did you know that row ark i thought it was four what happened in chambers do you really want to know yes yes okay ive got to go use the rest room ill tell you when i get back jake left row ark what happened in chambers not much noose rode jake pretty good but no permanent damage buckley wanted blood and jake said he was sure some was forthcoming if buckleys face got any redder buckley ranted and screamed and condemned jake for intentionally inflaming the jury as he called it jake just smiled at him and said he was sorry governor every time he would say governor buckley would scream at noose hes calling me governor judge do something and noose would say please gentlemen i expect you to act like professionals and jake would say thank you your honor then he would wait a few minutes and call him governor again why did he make those two old ladies cry it was a brilliant move harry rex he showed the jury noose buckley everybody that its his courtroom and hes not afraid of a damned person in it he drew first blood hes got buckley so jumpy right now hell never relax noose respects him because hes not intimidated by his honor the jurors were shocked but he woke them up and told them in a not so subtle way that this is war a brilliant move yeah i thought so myself it didnt hurt us those women were asking for sympathy but jake reminded the jury of what their sweet little boys did before they died the scumbags if theres any resentment by the jury theyll forget by the time the last witness testifies jakes pretty smooth aint he hes good very good hes the best ive seen for his age wait till his closing argument ive heard a couple he could get sympathy out of a drill sergeant jake returned and poured a small margarita just a very small one for his nerves harry rex drank like a sailor ozzie was the first state witness after lunch buckley produced large multicolored plats of the first and second floors of the courthouse and together they traced the precise last movements of cobb and willard then buckley produced a set of ten x color photographs of cobb and willard lying freshly dead on the stairs they were gruesome jake had seen lots of pictures of dead bodies and although none were particularly pleasant given their nature some werent so bad in one of his cases the victim had been shot in the heart with a and simply fell over dead on his porch he was a large muscular old man and the bullet never found its way out of the body so there was no blood just a small hole in his overalls and then a small sealed hole in his chest he looked as though he could have fallen asleep and slumped over or passed out drunk on the porch like lucien it was not a spectacular scene and buckley had not been proud of those photo graphs they had not been enlarged he had just handed the small polaroids to the jury and looked disgusted because they were so clean but most murder pictures were grisly and sickening with blood splashed on walls and ceilings and parts of bodies blown free and scattered everywhere those were always enlarged by the da and entered into evidence with great fanfare then waved around the courtroom by buckley as he and the witness described the scenes in the pictures finally with the jurors fidgeting with curiosity buckley would politely ask the judge for permission to show the photographs to the jury and the judge would always consent then buckley and everybody else would watch their faces intently as they were shocked horrified and occasionally nauseated jake had actually seen two jurors vomit when handed photos of a badly slashed corpse such pictures were highly prejudicial and highly inflammatory and also highly admissible probative was the word used by the supreme court such pictures could aid the jury according to ninety years of decisions from the court it was well settled in mississippi that murder pictures regardless of their impact on the jury were always admissible jake had seen the cobb and willard photographs weeks earlier and had filed the standard objection and received the standard denial these were mounted professionally on heavy posterboard something the da had not done before he handed the first one into the jury box to reba betts it was the one of willards head and brains taken at close range my god she gasped and shoved it to the next juror who gawked in horror and passed it on they handed it to one another then to the alternates buckley took it and gave reba another one the ritual continued for thirty minutes until all the pictures were returned to the da then he grabbed the m and thrust it at ozzie can you identify this yes its the weapon found at the scene who picked it up at the scene i did and what did you do with it wrapped in a plastic bag and placed in a vault at the jail kept it locked up until i handed it to mr laird with the crime lab in jackson your honor the state would offer the weapon exhibit s into evidence buckley said waving it wildly no objections jake said we have nothing further of this witness buckley announced crossexamination jake flipped through his notes as he walked slowly to the podium he had just a few questions for his friend sheriff did you arrest billy ray cobb and pete willard buckley pushed his chair back and perched his ample frame on the edge poised to leap and scream if necessary yes i did answered the sheriff for what reason for the rape of tonya hailey he answered perfectly and how old was she at the time she was raped by cobb and willard she was ten is it true sheriff that pete willard signed a written confession in objection objection your honor thats inadmissible and mr brigance knows it ozzie nodded affirmatively during the objection sustained buckley was shaking i ask that the question be stricken from the record and the jury be instructed to disregard it ill withdraw the question jake said to buckley with a smile please disregard the last question from mr brigance noose instructed the jury no further questions said jake any redirect examination mr buckley no sir very well sheriff you may step down buckleys next witness was a fingerprint man from washington who spent an hour telling the jurors what they had known for weeks his dramatic final conclusion unmis takably linked the prints on m to those of carl lee hailey then came the ballistics expert from the state crime lab whose testimony was as boring and uninformative as his predecessor on the stand yes without a doubt the fragments recovered from the crime scene were fired from the m lying there on the table that was his final opinion and with the charts and diagrams it took buckley an hour to get it to the jury prosecutorial overkill as jake called it a debility suffered by all prosecutors the defense had no questions for either expert and at fivefifteen noose said goodbye to the jurors with strict instructions against discussing the case they nodded politely as they filed from the courtroom then he banged his gavel and adjourned until nine in the morning the great civic duty of jury service had grown old rapidly the second night in the temple inn had seen the telephones removedjudges orders some old magazines donated by the clanton library were circulated and quickly discarded there being little interest among the group in the new yorker the smithsonian and architectural digest got any penthousest clyde sisco had whispered to the bailiff as he made the rounds he said no but hed see what he could do confined to their rooms with no television newspapers or phones they did little but play cards and talk about the trial a trip to the end of the hall for ice and a soft drink became a special occasion something the roommates planned and rotated the boredom descended heavily at each end of the hall two soldiers guarded the darkness and solitude the stillness interrupted only by the systematic emergence of the jurors with change for the drink machine sleep came early and when the sentries knocked on the doors at am all the jurors were awake some even dressed they devoured thursdays breakfast of pancakes and sausage and eagerly boarded the greyhound at eight for the trip back home for the fourth straight day the rotunda was crowded by eight oclock the spectators had learned that all seats were taken by eightthirty prather opened the door and the crowd filed slowly through the metal detector past the careful eyes of the deputies and finally into the courtroom where the blacks filled the left side and the whites the right the front row was again reserved by hastings for gwen lester the kids and other relatives agee and other council members sat in the second row with the kinfolks who couldnt fit up front agee was in charge of alternating courtroom duty and outside demonstration duty for the ministers personally he preferred the courtroom duty wnere ne ieu miss the cameras and reporters which were so abundant on the front lawn to his right across the aisle sat the families and friends of the victims they had behaved so far a few minutes before nine carl lee was escorted from the small holding room the handcuffs were removed by one of the many officers surrounding him he flashed a big smile at his family and sat in his chair the lawyers took their places and the courtroom grew quiet the bailiff poked his head through the door beside the jury box and satisfied with whatever he saw opened the door and released the jurors to their assigned seats mr pate was watching all this from the door leading to chambers and when all was perfect he stepped forward and yelled all rise for the court ichabod draped in his favorite wrinkled and faded black robe loped to the bench and instructed everyone to have a seat he greeted the jury and questioned them about what happened or didnt happen since yesterdays adjournment he looked at the lawyers wheres mr musgrove hes running a bit late your honor we are ready to proceed buckley announced call your next witness noose ordered buckley the pathologist from the state crime lab was located in the rotunda and entered the courtroom normally he would have been much too busy for a simple trial and would have sent one of his underlings to explain to the jury precisely what killed cobb and willard but this was the hailey case and he felt compelled to do the job himself it was actually the simplest case he had seen in a while the bodies were found as they were dying the weapon was with the bodies and there were enough holes in the boys to kill them a dozen times everybody in the world knew how those boys died but the da had insisted on the most thorough pathological workup so the doctor took the stand thursday morning laden with photos of the autopsies and multicolored anatomy charts earlier in chambers jake had offered to stipulate to the causes of death but buckley would have no part of it no sir he wanted the jury to hear and know how they died we will admit that they died by multiple wounds from bullets fired from the m jake had stated precisely no sir i have a right to prove it buckley said stubbornly but hes offering to stipulate to the causes of death noose said incredulously i have the right to prove it buckley hung on so he proved it in a classic case of prosecutorial overkill buckley proved it for three hours the pathologist talked about how many bullets hit cobb and how many hit willard and what each bullet did upon penetration and the ghastly damage thereafter the anatomy charts were placed on easels before the jury and the expert took a plastic numbered pellet that represented a bullet and moved it ever so slowly through the body fourteen pellets for cobb and eleven for willard buckley would ask a question elicit a response then interrupt to belabor a point your honor we would be glad to stipulate as to the causes of death jake announced with great frustration every thirty minutes we wont buckley replied tersely and moved to the next pellet jake fell into his chair shook his head and looked at the jurors those who were awake the doctor finished at noon and noose tired and numb with boredom awarded a twohour lunch break the jurors were awakened by the bailiff and led to the jury room where they dined on barbeque specials on plastic plates then struck up card games they were forbidden to leave the courthouse in every small southern town theres a kid who was born looking for the quick buck he was the kid who at the age of five set up the first lemonade stand on his street and charged twentyfive cents a cup for four ounces of artificially flavored water he knew it tasted awful but he knew the adults thought he was adorable he was the first kid on the street to purchase a lawn mower on credit at the western auto and knock on doors in february to line upyard work for the summer he was the first kid to pay for his own bike which he used for morning and afternoon paper routes he sent christmas cards to old ladies in august he sold fruitcakes door to door in november on saturday mornings when his friends were watching cartoons he was at the flea markets at the courthouse selling roasted peanuts and corn dogs at the age of twelve he bought his first certificate of deposit he had his own banker at fifteen he paid cash for his new pickup the same day he passed his drivers license exam he bought a trailer to follow the truck and filled it with lawn equipment he sold tshirts at high school football games he was a hustler a millionaire to be in clanton his name was hinky myrick age sixteen he waited nervously in the rotunda until noose broke for lunch then moved past the deputies and entered the courtroom seating was so precious that almost none of the spectators left for lunch some would stand glare at their neighbors point at their seats and make sure everybody knew it was theirs for the day then leave for the rest room but most of them sat in their highly treasured spaces on the pews and suffered through lunch hinky could smell opportunity he could sense people in need on thursday just as he had on wednesday he rolled a shopping cart down the aisle to the front of the courtroom it was filled with a wide assortment of sandwiches and plate lunches in plastic containers he began yelling toward the far end of the rows then passing food down to his customers he worked his way slowly toward the rear of the courtroom he was a vicious scalper a tuna salad on white bread went for two dollars his cost eighty cents a plate lunch of cold chicken with a few peas went for three dollars his cost a buck twentyfive a canned soft drink was onefifty but they gladly paid his prices and kept their seats he sold out before he reached the fourth row from the front and began taking orders from the rest of the courtroom hinky was the man of the hour with a fistful of orders he raced from the courthouse across the lawn through the crowd of blacks across caffey street and into claudes he ran to the kitchen shoved a twentydollar bill at the cook and handed him the orders he waited and watched his watch the cook moved slowly hinky gave him another twenty the trial ushered a wave of prosperity claude naa never dreamed of breakfast and lunch in his small cafe became happenings as demand greatly exceeded the number of chairs and the hungry lined the sidewalk waiting in the heat and haze for a table after the lunch recess on monday he had dashed around clanton buying every folding card table and matching chair set he could find at lunch the aisles disappeared forcing his waitresses to maneuver nimbly among and between the rows of people virtually all of whom were black the trial was the only topic of conversation on wednesday the composition of the jury had been hotly condemned by thursday the talk centered on the growing dislike for the prosecutor i hear tell he wants to run for governor he democrat or republican democrat he cant win without the black vote not in this state yeah and he aint likely to get much after this trial i hope he tries he acts more like a republican in pretrial clanton the noon hour began ten minutes before twelve when the young tanned pretty coolly dressed secretaries from the banks law offices insurance agencies and courthouse left their desks and took to the sidewalks during lunch they ran errands around the square they went to the post office they did their banking they shopped most of them bought their food at the chinese deli and ate on the park benches under the shade trees around the courthouse they met friends and gossiped at noon the gazebo in front of the courthouse attracted more beautiful women than the miss mississippi pageant it was an unwritten rule in clanton that an office girl on the square got a headstart on lunch and did not have to return until one the men followed at twelve and watched the girls but the trial changed things the shade trees around the courthouse were in a combat zone the cafes were full from eleven to one with soldiers and strangers who couldnt get seats in the courtroom the chinese deli was packed with foreigners the office girls ran their errands and ate at their desks at the tea shoppe the bankers and other white collars discussed the trial more in terms of its publicity and how the town was being perceived of particular concern was the klan not a single customer knew anyone connected with the klan and it had long been forgotten in north mississippi but the vultures loved the white robes and as far as the outside world knew clanton mississippi was the home of the ku klux klan they hated the klan for being there they cussed the press for keeping them there for lunch thursday the coffee shop offered the daily special of countryfried pork chops turnip greens and either candied yams creamed corn or fried okra dell served the specials to a packed house that was evenly divided among locals foreigners and soldiers the unwritten but firmly established rule of not speaking to anyone with a beard or funny accent was strictly enforced and for a friendly people it was awkward not to smile and carry on with those from the outside a tightlipped arrogance had long since replaced the warm reception given to the visitors in the first few days after the shootings too many of the press hounds had betrayed their hosts and printed unkind unflattering and unfair words about the county and its people it was amazing how they could arrive in packs from all over and within twentyfour hours become experts on a place they had never heard of and a people they had never met the locals had watched them as they scrambled like idiots around the square chasing the sheriff the prosecutor the defense lawyer or anybody who might know anything they watched them wait at the rear of the courthouse like hungry wolves to pounce on the defendant who was invariably surrounded by cops and who invariably ignored them as they yelled the same ridiculous questions at him the locals watched with distaste as they kept their cameras on the kluxers and the rowdier blacks always searching for the most radical elements and then making those elements appear to be the norm they watched them and they hated them whats that orange crap all over her face tim nunley asked looking at a reporter sitting in a booth by the window jack jones crunched on his okra and studied the orange face i think its something they use for the cameras makes her face look white on tv but its already white i know but it dont look white on tv unless its painted orange nunley was not convinced then what do the niggers use on tv he asked no one could answer did you see her on tv last night asked jack jones nope wheres she from channel four memphis last night she interviewed cobbs mother and of course she kept on pushing till the old woman broke down all they showed on tv was the cryin it was sickenin night before she had some klansmen from ohio talkin about what we need here in mississippi shes the worst the state finished its case against carl lee thursday afternoon after lunch buckley put murphy on the stand it was gutwrenching nervewracking testimony as the poor little man stuttered uncontrollably for an hour calm down mr murphy buckley said a hundred times he would nod and take a drink of water he nodded affirmatively and shook negatively as much as possible but the court reporter had an awful time picking up the nods and shakes i didnt get that she would say her back to the witness stand so he would try to answer and get hung usually on a hard consonant like a p or t he would blurt out something then stutter and spit incoherently i didnt get that she would say helplessly when he finished buckley would sigh the jurors rocked furiously half the spectators chewed their fingernails could you repeat that buckley would say with as much patience as he could find im sssssssssorry he would say frequently he was pitiful through it all it was determined that he had been drinking a coke on the rear stairs facing the stairs where the boys were killed he had noticed a black man peeking out of a small closet some forty feet away but he didnt think much about it then when the boys came down the black man just stepped out and opened fire screaming and laughing when he stopped shooting he threw down the gun and took off yes that was him sitting right there the black one noose rubbed holes in his glasses listening to murphy when buckley sat down his honor looked desperately at jake any crossexamination he asked painfully jake stood with a legal pad the court reporter glared at him harry rex hissed at him ellen closed her eyes the jurors wrung their hands and watched him carefully dont do it carl lee whispered firmly no your honor we have no questions thank you mr brigance noose said breathing again the next witness was officer rady the investigator for the sheriffs department he informed the jury that he found a royal crown cola can in the closet next to the stairs and the prints on the can matched those of carl lee hailey was it empty or full buckley asked dramatically it was completely empty big deal thought jake so he was thirsty oswald had a chicken dinner waiting on kennedy no he had no questions for this witness we have one final witness your honor buckley said with great finality at pm officer dewayne looney looney limped with a cane into the courtroom and to the witness stand he removed his gun and handed it to mr pate buckley watched him proudly would you state your name please sir dewayne looney and your address fourteen sixtyeight bennington street clanton mississippi how old are you thirtynine where are you employed ford county sheriffs department and what do you do there im a dispatcher where did you work on monday may i was a deputy were you on duty yes i was assigned to transport two subjects from the jail to court and back who were those two subjects billy ray cobb and pete willard what time did you leave court with them around onethirty i guess who was on duty with you marshall prather he and i were in charge of the two subjects there were some other deputies in the courtroom helpin us and we had two or three men outside waitin on us but me and marshall were in charge what happened when the hearing was over we immediately handcuffed cobb and willard and got them outta here we took them to that little room over there and waited a second or two and prather walked on down the stairs then what happened we started down the back stairs cobb first then willard then me like i said prather had already gone on down he was out the door yes sir then what happened when cobb was near bout to the foot of the stairs the shootin started i was on the landing fixin to go on down i didnt see anybody at first for a second then i seen mr hailey with the machine gun firin away cobb was blown backward into willard and they both screamed and fell in a heap tryin to get back up where i was yes sir describe what you saw you could hear the bullets bouncin off the walls and hittin everywhere it was the loudest gun i ever heard and seemed like he kept shootin forever the boys just twisted and thrashed about screamin and squealin they were handcuffed you know yes sir what happened to you like i said i never made it past the landing i think one of the bullets ricocheted off the wall and caught me in the leg i was tryin to get back up the steps when i felt my leg burn and what happened to your leg they cut it off looney answered matteroffactly as if an amputation happened monthly just below the knee did you get a good look at the man with the gun yes sir can you identify him for the jury yes sir its mr hailey the man sittin over there that answer would have been a logical place to end looneys testimony he was brief to the point sympathetic and positive of the identification the jury had listened to every word so far but buckley and musgrove retrieved the large diagrams of the courthouse and arranged them before the jury so that looney could limp around for a while under buckleys direction he retraced everybodys exact movements just before the killings jake rubbed his forehead and pinched the bridge of his nose noose cleaned and recleaned his glasses the jurors fidgeted any crossexamination mr brigance noose asked at last just a few questions jake said as musgrove cleared the debris from the courtroom officer looney who was carl lee looking at when he was shooting them boys as far as i could tell did he ever look at you well now i didnt spend a lotta time tryin to make eye contact with him in fact i was movin in the other direction so he didnt aim at you oh no sir he just aimed at those boys hit them too what did he do when he was shooting he just screamed and laughed like he was crazy it was the weirdest thing i ever heard like he was some kinda madman or something and you know what ill always remember is that with all the noise the gun firin the bullets whistlin the boys screamin as they got hit over all the noise i could hear him laughin that crazy laugh the answer was so perfect jake had to fight off a smile he and looney had worked on it a hundred times and it was a thing of beauty every word was perfect jake busily flipped through his legal pad and glanced at the jurors they all stared at looney enthralled by his answer jake scribbled something anything nothing just to kill a few more seconds before the most important questions of the trial now deputy looney carl lee hailey shot you in the leg yes sir he did do you think it was intentional oh no sir it was an accident do you want to see him punished for shooting you no sir i have no ill will toward the man he did what i wouldve done buckley dropped his pen and slumped in his chair he looked sadly at his star witness what do you mean by that i mean i dont blame him for what he did those boys raped his little girl i gotta little girl somebody rapes her and hes a dead dog ill blow him away just like carl lee did we oughtta give him a trophy do you want the jury to convict carl lee buckley jumped and roared objection objection improper question no looney yelled i dont want him convicted hes a hero he dont answer mr looney noose said loudly dont answer objection objection buckley continued on his tiptoes hes a hero turn him loose looney yelled at buckley order order noose banged his gavel buckley was silent looney was silent jake walked to his chair and said ill withdraw the question please disregard noose instructed the jury looney smiled at the jury and limped from the courtroom call your next witness noose said removing nis glasses buckley rose slowly and with a great effort at drama said your honor the state rests good noose replied looking at jake i assume you have a motion or two mr brigance yes your honor very well well take those up in chambers noose excused his jury with the same parting instructions and adjourned until nine friday jake awoke in the darkness with a slight hangover a headache due to fatigue and coors and the distant but unmistakable sound of his doorbell ringing continually as if held firmly in place by a large and determined thumb he opened the front door in his nightshirt and tried to focus on the two figures standing on the porch ozzie and nesbit it was finally determined can i help you he asked as he opened the door they followed him into the den theyre gonna kill you today ozzie said jake sat on the couch and massaged his temples maybe theyll succeed jake this is serious they plan to kill you who the klan mickey mouse yeah he called yesterday and said something was up he called back two hours ago and said youre the lucky man today is the big day time for some excitement they bury stump sisson this morning in loydsville and its time for the eyeforaneye toothforatooth routine why me why dont they kill buckley or noose or someone more deserving we didnt get a chance to talk about that what method of execution jake asked suddenly feeling awkward sitting there in his nightshirt he didnt say does he know he aint much on details he just said theyd try to do it sometime today so what am i supposed to do surrender what time you goin to the office what time is it almost five as soon as i can shower and dress well wait at fivethirty they rushed him into his office and locked the door at eight a platoon of soldiers gathered on the sidewalk under the balcony and waited for the target harry rex and ellen watched from the second floor of the courthouse jake squeezed between ozzie and nesbit and the three of them crouched in the center tight formation off they went across washington street in the direction of the courthouse the vultures sniffed something and surrounded the entourage the abandoned feed mill sat near the abandoned railroad tracks halfway down the tallest hill in clanton two blocks north and east of the square beside it was a neglected asphalt and gravel street that ran downhill and intersected cedar street after which it became much smoother and wider and continued downward until finally it terminated and merged into quincy street the eastern boundary of the clanton square from his position inside an abandoned silo the marksman had a clear but distant view of the rear of the courthouse he crouched in the darkness and aimed through a small opening confident no one in the world could see him the whiskey helped the confidence and the aim which he practiced a thousand times from seventhirty until eight when he noticed activity around the niggers lawyers office a comrade waited in a pickup hidden in a rundown warehouse next to the silo the engine was running and the driver chainsmoked lucky strikes waiting anxiously to hear the clapping sounds from the deer rifle as the armored mass stepped its way across washington the marksman panicked through the scope he could barely see the head of the niggers lawyer as it bobbed and weaved awkwardly among the sea of green which was surrounded and chased by a dozen reporters go ahead the whiskey said create some excitement he timed the bobbing and weaving as best he could and pulled the trigger as the target approached the rear door of the courthouse the rifle shot was clear and unmistakable half the soldiers hit the ground rolling and the other half grabbed jake and threw him violently under the verandaa guardsman screamed in anguish the reporters and tv people crouched and stumbled to the ground but valiantly kept the cameras rolling to record the carnage the soldier clutched his throat and screamed again another shot then another hes hit someone yelled the soldiers scrambled on all fours across the driveway to the fallen one jake escaped through the doors to the safety of the courthouse he fell onto the floor of the rear entrance and buried his head in his hands ozzie stood next to him watching the soldiers through the door the gunman dropped from the silo threw his gun behind the back seat and disappeared with his comrade into the countryside they had a funeral to attend in south mississippi hes hit in the throat someone screamed as his buddies waded around the reporters they lifted him and dragged him to a jeep who got hit jake asked without removing his palms from his eyes one of the guardsmen ozzie said you okay i guess he answered as he clasped his hands behind his head and stared at the floor wheres my briefcase its out there on the driveway well get it in a min ute ozzie removed his radio from his belt and barked orders to the dispatcher something about all men to the courthouse when it was apparent the shooting was over ozzie joined the mass of soldiers outside nesbit stood next to jake you okay he asked the colonel rounded the corner yelling and swearing what the hell happened he demanded i heard some shots mackenvale got hit where is he the colonel said off to the hospital a sergeant replied pointing at a jeep flying away in the distance how bad is he looked pretty bad got him in the throat throat why did they move him no one answered did anybody see anything the colonel demanded sounded like it came from up ozzie said the looking up past cedar street why dont you send a jeep up there to look around good idea the colonel addressed his eager men with a string of terse commands punctuated liberally with obscenities the soldiers scattered in all directions guns drawn and ready for combat in search of an assassin they could not identify who was in fact in the next county when the foot patrol began exploring the abandoned feed mill ozzie laid the briefcase on the floor next to jake is jake okay he whispered to nesbit harry rex and ellen stood on the stairs where cobb and willard had fallen i dont know he aint moved in ten minutes nesbit said jake are you all right the sheriff asked yes he said slowly without opening his eyes the soldier had been on jakes left shoulder this is kinda silly aint it he had just said to jake when a bullet ripped through his throat he fell into jake grabbing at his neck gurgling blood and screaming jake fell and was tossed to safety hes dead isnt he jake asked softly we dont know yet replied ozzie hes at the hospital hes dead i know hes dead i heard his neck pop ozzie looked at nesbit then at harry rex four or five coinsized drops of blood were splattered on jakes light gray suit he hadnt noticed them yet but they were apparent to everyone else jake youve got blood on your suit ozzie finally said lets go back to your office so you can change clothes why is that important jake mumbled to the floor they stared at each other dell and the others from the coffee shop stood on the sidewalk and watched as they led jake from the courthouse across the street and into his office ignoring the absurdities thrown by the reporters harry rex locked the front door leaving the bodyguards on the sidewalk jake went upstairs and removed his coat row ark why dont you make some margaritas harry rex said ill go upstairs and stay with him judge weve had some excitement ozzie explained as noose unpacked his briefcase and removed his coat what is it buckley asked they tried to kill jake this mornin what when asked buckley bout an hour ago somebody shot at jake as he was comin into the courthouse it was a rifle at long range we have no idea who did it they missed jake and hit a guardsman hes in surgery now wheres jake asked his honor over in his office hes pretty shook up i would be too noose said sympathetically he wanted you to call him when you got here sure ozzie dialed the number and handed the phone to the judge its noose harry rex said handing the phone to jake hello are

with feeling you ever been shot at judge no jake you ever seen a man get shot hear him scream no jake you ever had somebody elses blood splashed on your suit no jake i wont be there noose paused and thought for a moment come on over jake and lets talk about it no im not leaving my office its dangerous out there suppose we stand in recess until one will you feel better then ill be drunk by then what i said ill be drunk by then harry rex covered his eyes ellen left for the kitchen when do you think you might be sober noose asked sternly ozzie and buckley looked at each other monday what about

theyre sitting in the jury room waiting on us the courtroom is packed your client is sitting out there by himself waiting on you what do i tell these people youll think of something judge ive got faith in you jake hung up noose listened to the unbelievable until it was evident that he had in fact been hung up on he handed the phone to ozzie his honor looked out the window and removed his glasses he says he aint comin today uncharacteristically buckley remained silent ozzie was defensive it really got to him judge has he been drinking naw not jake ozzie replied hes just tore up over that boy gettin shot like he did he was right next to jake and caught the bullet that was aimed for him it would upset anybody judge he wants us to remain in recess until tomorrow morning noose said to buckley who shrugged and again said nothing as word spread a regular carnival developed on the sidewalk outside jakes office the press set up camp and pawed at the front window in hopes of seeing someone or something newsworthy inside friends stopped by to check on jake but were informed by various of the reporters that he was locked away inside and would not come out yes he was unhurt dr bass had been scheduled to testify friday morning he and lucien entered the office through the rear door a few minutes after ten and harry rex left for the liquor store with all the crying the conversation with carla had been difficult he called after three drinks and things did not go well he talked to her father told him he was safe unhurt and that half of the mississippi national guard had been assigned to protect him settle her down he said and he would call back later lucien was furious he had fought with bass to keep him sober thursday night so he could testify friday now that he would testify saturday there was no way to keep him sober two days in a row he thought of all the drinking they had missed thursday and was furious harry rex returned with a gallon of liquor he and ellen mixed drinks and argued over the ingredients she rinsed the coffeepot filled it with bloody mary mix and a disproportionate helping of swedish vodka harry rex added a lavish dose of tabasco he made the rounds in the conference room and refilled each cup with the delightful mixture dr bass gulped frantically and ordered more lucien and harry rex debated the likely identity of the gunman ellen silently watched jake who sat in the corner and stared at the bookshelves the phone rang harry rex grabbed it and listened intently he hung up and said that was ozzie the soldiers outta surgery bullets lodged in the spine they think hell be paralyzed they all sipped in unison and said nothing they made great efforts to ignore jake as he rubbed his forehead with one hand and sloshed his drink with the other the faint sound of someone knocking at me rear door interrupted brief memorial go see who it is lucien ordered ellen who left to see who was knocking its lester hailey she reported to the conference room let him in jake mumbled almost incoherently lester was introduced to the parry and offered a bloody mary he declined and asked for something with whiskey in it good idea said lucien im tired of light stuff lets get some jack daniels sounds good to me added bass as he gulped the remnants in his cup jake managed a weak smile at lester then returned to the study of the bookshelves lucien threw a hundreddollar bill on the table and harry rex left for the liquor store when she awoke hours later ellen was on the couch in jakes office the room was dark and deserted with an acrid intoxicating smell to it she moved cautiously she found her boss peacefully snoring away in the war room on the floor partially under the war desk there were no lights to extinguish so she carefully walked down the stairs the conference room was littered with empty liquor bottles beer cans plastic cups and chicken dinner boxes it was pm she had slept five hours she could stay at luciens but needed to change clothes her friend nesbit would drive her to oxford but she was sober plus jake needed all the protection he could get she locked the front door and walked to her car ellen almost made it to oxford when she saw the blue lights behind her as usual she was driving seventyfive she parked on the shoulder and walked to her taillights where she searched her purse and waited on the trooper two plainsclothesmen approached from the blue lights you drunk maam one of them asked spewing tobacco juice no sir im trying to find my license she crouched before the taillights and fished for the license suddenly she was knocked to the ground a heavy quilt was thrown over her and both men held her down a rope was wrapped around her chest and waist she kicked and cursed but could offer little resistance the quilt covered her head and trapped her arms underneath they pulled the rope tightly be still bitch be still one of them removed her keys from the ignition and opened the trunk they threw her inside and slammed it shut the blue lights were unplugged in the old lincoln and it roared away trailed by the bmw they found a gravel road and followed it deep into the woods it turned into a dirt road that led to a small pasture where a large cross was being burned by a handful of kluxers the two assailants quickly donned their robes and masks and removed her from the trunk she was thrown to the ground and the quilt removed they bound and gagged her and dragged her to a large pole a few feet from the cross where she was tied her back to the kluxers her face to the pole she saw the white robes and pointed hats and tried desperately to spit out the oily cotton rag crammed in her mouth she managed only to gag and cough the flaming cross illuminated the small pasture discharging a glowing wave of heat that began to roast her as she wrestled with the pole and emitted strange guttural noises a hooded figure left the others and approached her she could hear him walking and breathing you niggerloving bitch he said in a crisp midwestern voice he grabbed the rear of her collar and ripped the white silk blouse until it hung in shreds around her neck and shoulders her hands were tied firmly around the pole he removed a bowie knife from under the robe and began cutting the remainder of the blouse from her body you niggerloving bitch you niggerloving bitch ellen cursed him but her words were muffled groans he unzipped the navy linen skirt on the right side she tried to kick but the heavy rope around her ankles held her feet to the pole he placed the tip of the knife at the bottom of the zipper and cut downward through the hem he grabbed around the waist and pulled it off like a magician the kluxers stepped forward he slapped her on the butt and said nice very nice he stepped back to admire his handiwork she grunted and twisted but could not resist the slip fell to midthigh with great ceremony he cut the straps then sliced it neatly down the back he yanked it off and threw it at the foot of the burning cross he cut the bra straps and removed it she jerked and the moans became louder the silent semicircle inched forward and stopped ten feet away the fire was hot now her bare back and legs were covered with sweat the light red hair was drenched around her neck and shoulders he reached under his robe again and brought out a bullwhip he popped it loudly near her and she flinched he marched backward carefully measur ing the distance to the pole he cocked the bullwhip and aimed at the bare back the tallest one stepped forward with his back to her he shook his head nothing was said but the whip disappeared he walked to her and grabbed her head with his knife he cut her hair he grabbed handfuls and hacked away until her scalp was gapped and ugly it piled gently around her feet she moaned and did not move they headed for their cars a gallon of gasoline was splashed inside the bmw with massachusetts tags and somebody threw a match when he was certain they were gone mickey mouse slid from the bushes he untied her and carried her to a small clearing away from the pasture he gathered the remains of her clothing and tried to cover her when her car finished burning beside the dirt road he left her he drove to oxford to a pay phone and called the lafayette county sheriff saturday court was unusual but not unheard of especially in capital cases where the jury was locked up the participants didnt mind because saturday brought the end one day nearer the locals didnt mind either it was their day off and for most ford countians it was their only chance to watch the trial or if they couldnt get a seat at least hang around the square and see it all firsthand who knows there may even be some more shooting by seven the cafes downtown were at full capacity serving nonregulars for every customer who was awarded a seat two were turned away and left to loiter around the square and the courthouse and wait for a seat in the courtroom most of them paused for a moment in front of the lawyers office hoping to catch a glimpse of the one they tried to kill the braggarts told of being clients of this famous man upward a few feet the target sat at his desk and sipped a bloody concoction left from yesterdays party he smoked a roitan ate headache powders and rubbed the cobwebs from his brain forget about the soldier he had told himself for the past three hours forget about the klan the threats forget everything but the trial and specifically dr wt bass he uttered a short prayer something about bass being sober on the witness stand the expert and lucieh had stayed through the afternoon drinking and arguing accusing each other of being a drunk and receiving a dishonorable discharge from their respective professions violence flared briefly at ethels desk when they were leaving nesbit intervened and escorted them to the patrol car for the ride home the reporters burned with curiosity as the two blind drunks were led from jakes office by the deputy and put in the car where they continued to rage and cuss at each other lucien in the back seat bass in the front he reviewed ellens masterpiece on the insanity defense her outline of questions for bass needed only minor changes he studied his experts resume and though unim pressive it would suffice for ford county the nearest psychiatrist was eighty miles away judge noose glanced at the da and looked sympathetically at jake who sat next to the door and watched the faded portrait of some dead judge hanging over buckleys shoulder how do you feel this morning jake noose asked warmly im fine hows the soldier asked buckley paralyzed noose buckley musgrove and mr pate looked at the same spot on the carpet and grimly shook their heads in a quiet moment of respect wheres your law clerk noose asked looking at the clock on the wall jake looked at his watch i dont know i expected her by now are you ready sure is the courtroom ready mr pate yes sir very well lets proceed noose seated the courtroom and for ten minutes offered a rambling apology to the jurors for yesterdays delay they were the only fourteen in the county who did not know what happened friday morning and it might be prejudicial to tell them noose droned on about emergencies and how sometimes during trials things conspire to cause delays when he finally finished the jurors were completely bewildered and praying that somebody would call a witness you may call your first witness noose said in jakes direction dr wt bass jake announced as he moved to the podium buckley and musgrove exchanged winks and silly grins bass was seated next to lucien on the second row in the middle of the family he stood noisily and made his way to the center aisle stepping on feet and assaulting people with his heavy leather empty briefcase jake heard the commotion behind him and continued smiling at the jury i do i do bass said rapidly at jean gillespie during his swearing in mr pate led him to the witness stand and delivered the standard orders to speak up and use the microphone though mortified and hung over the expert looked remarkably arrogant and sober he wore his most expensive dark gray handsewn wool suit a perfectly starched white buttondown and a cute little red paisley bow tie that made him appear rather cerebral he looked like an expert in something he also wore over jakes objections a pair of light gray ostrich skin cowboy boots that he had paid over a thousand for and worn less than a dozen times lucien had insisted on the boots eleven years earlier in the first insanity case bass wore them and the very sane defendant went to parchman he wore them in the second insanity trial again at luciens behest again parchman lucien referred to them as basss good luck charm jake wanted no part of the damned boots but the jury could relate to them lucien had argued not expensive ostrich skin jake countered theyre too dumb to know the difference replied lucien jake could not be swayed the rednecks will trust someone with boots lucien had explained fine said jake let him wear a pair of those camouflage squirrelhunting boots with a little mud on the heels and soles some boots they could really identify with those wouldnt complement his suit bass had inserted he crossed his legs laying the right boot on his left knee flaunting it he grinned at it then grinned at the jury the ostrich would have been proud jake looked from his notes on the podium and saw the boot which was plainly visible above the rail of the witness stand bass was admiring it the jurors pondering it he choked and returned to his notes state your name please dr wt bass he replied his attention suddenly diverted from the boot he looked grimly importantly at jake what is your address nineoheight west canterbury jackson mississippi what is your profession i am a physician are you licensed to practice in mississippi yes when were you licensed february are you licensed to practice medicine in any other state yes where texas when did you obtain that license november where did you go to college i received my bachelors degree from millsaps college in and received my md or

american medical association the recognized accrediting agency of our profession and by the educational authority of the state of texas bass relaxed a bit uncrossed and recrossed his legs and displayed his left boot he rocked gently and turned the comfortable swivel chair partially toward the jury where did you intern and for how long after graduation from medical school i spent twelve months as an intern at the rocky mountain medical center in denver what is your medical specialty psychiatry explain to us what that means psychiatry is that branch of medicine concerned with the treatment of disorders of the mind it usually but not always deals with mental malfunction the organic basis of which is unknown jake breathed for the first time since bass took the stand his man was sounding good now doctor he said as he casually walked to within a foot of the jury box describe to the jury the specialized training you received in the field of psychiatry my specialized training in psychiatry consisted of two years as a resident in psychiatry at the texas state mental hospital an approved training center i engaged in clinical work with psychoneurotic and psychotic patients i studied psychology psychopathology psychotherapy and the physiological therapies this training supervised by competent psychiatric teachers included instruction in the psychiatric aspects of general medicine the behavior aspects of children adolescents and adults it was doubtful if a single person in the courtroom comprehended any of what bass had just said but it came from the mouth of a man who suddenly appeared to be a genius an expert for he had to be a man of great wisdom and intelligence to pronounce those words with the bow tie and vocabulary and in spite of the boots bass was gaining credibility with each answer are you a diplomate of the american board of psychiatry of course he answered confidently in which branch are you certified i am certified in psychiatry and when were you certified april of what does it take to become certified by the american board of psychiatry a candidate must pass oral and practical exams as well as a written test at the direction of the board jake glanced at his notes and noticed musgrove winking at buckley doctor do you belong to any professional groups yes name them please i am a member of the american medical association american psychiatric association and the mississippi medical association how long have you been engaged in the practice of psychiatry twentytwo years jake walked three steps in the direction ot me oencn and eyed noose who was watching intently your honor the defense offers dr bass as an expert in the field of psychiatry very well replied noose do you wish to examine this witness mr buckley the da stood with his legal pad yes your honor just a few questions surprised but not worried jake took his seat next to carl lee ellen was still not in the courtroom dr bass in your opinion are you an expert in the field of psychiatry asked buckley yes have you ever taught psychiatry no have you ever published any articles on psychiatry no have you ever published any books on psychiatry no now i believe you testified that you are a member of the ama mma and the american psychiatric association yes have you ever served as an officer in any of these organizations no what hospital positions do you currently hold as of today none has your experience in psychiatry included any work under the auspices of the federal government or any state government no the arrogance was beginning to fade from his face and the confidence from his voice he shot a glance at jake who was digging through a file dr bass are you now engaged in the practice of psychiatry fulltime the expert hesitated and looked briefly at lucien on the second row i see patients on a regular basis how many patients and how regular buckley retorted with an enormous air of confidence i see from five to ten patients per week one or two a day something like that and you consider that a fulltime practice im as busy as i want to be buckley threw his legal pad on the table and looked at noose your honor the state objects to this man testifying as an expert in the field of psychiatry its obvious hes not qualified jake was on his feet with his mouth open overruled mr buckley you may proceed mr brigance jake gathered his legal pads and returned to the podium well aware of the suspicion the da had just artfully thrown over his star witness bass shifted boots now dr bass have you examined the defendant carl leehailey yes how many times three when was your first examination june what was the purpose of this examination i examined him to determine his current mental condition as well as his condition on may when he allegedly shot mr cobb and mr willard where did this examination take place ford county jail did you conduct this examination alone yes just mr hailey and myself how long did the examination last three hours did you review his medical history in a roundabout way you could say we talked at great length about his past what did you learn nothing remarkable except for vietnam what about vietnam bass folded his hands over his slightly overweight stom ach and frowned intelligently at the defense attorney well mr brigance like many vietnam vets ive worked with mr hailey had some rather horrible experiences over there war is hell thought carl lee he listened intently now vietnam was bad hed been shot hed lost friends hed killed people many people hed killed children vietnamese children carrying guns and grenades it was bad he wished hed never seen the place he dreamed about it had flashbacks and nightmares occasionally but he didnt feel warped or insane because of it he didnt feel warped or insane because of cobb and willard in fact he felt quite satisfied because they were dead just like those in vietnam he had explained all this to bass once at the jail and bass had seemed unimpressed by it and they had talked only twice and never more than an hour carl lee eyed the jury and listened suspiciously to the expert who talked at length of carl lees dreadful experiences in the war basss vocabulary jumped several octaves as he explained to the laymen in nonlaymen terms the ef fects of vietnam on carl lee it sounded good there had been nightmares over the years dreams carl lee had never worried much about but to hear bass explain it were extremely significant events did he talk freely of vietnam not really replied bass then explaining in great detail the tremendous task he confronted in dragging out the war from this complex burdened probably unstable mind carl lee didnt remember it that way but he dutifully listened with a pained expression wondering for the first time in his life if perhaps he could be a little off after an hour the war had been refought and its effects flogged thoroughly jake decided to move on now dr bass jake said scratching his head other than vietnam what other significant events did you note regarding his mental history none except the rape of his daughter did you discuss the rape with carl lee at great length during each of the three examinations explain to the jury what the rape did to carl lee hailey bass stroked his chin and looked perplexed quite frankly mr brigance it would take a great deal of time to explain what the rape did to mr hailey jake thought a moment and seemed to thoroughly analyze this last statement well could you summarize it for the jury bass nodded gravely ill try lucien grew weary of listening to bass and began watching the jury in hopes of eyeing clyde sisco who had also lost interest but appeared to be admiring the boots lucien watched intently from the corner of his eye waiting for sisco to gaze around the courtroom finally as bass rambled on sisco left the testimony and looked at carl lee then buckley then one of the reporters on the front row then his line of vision locked solidly into a wildeyed bearded old man who had once handed him eighty thousand cash for performing his civic duty and returning a just verdict they focused unmistakably on each other and both managed a slight grin how much was the look in luciens eyes sisco returned to the testimony but seconds later he was staring at lucien how much lucien said his lips actually moving but with no sound sisco looked away and watched bass thinking of a fair price he looked in luciens direction scratched his beard then suddenly while staring at bass flashed five fingers across his face and coughed he coughed again and studied the expert five hundred or five thousand lucien asked himself knowing sisco it was five thousand maybe fifty thousand it made no difference lucien would pay it he was worth a ton by tenthirty noose had cleaned his glasses a hundred times and consumed a dozen cups of coffee his bladder pressed forward toward the spillway time for the morning recess well adjourn until eleven he rapped the gavel and disappeared howm i doing bass asked nervously he followed jake and lucien to the law library on the third floor youre doing fine jake said just keep those boots outta sight the boots are critical lucien protested i need a drink bass said desperately forget it jake said so do i lucien added lets run over to your office for a quick one great idea bass said forget it jake repeated youre sober and youre doing great we got thirty minutes bass said as he and lucien were leaving the library and heading for the stairs no dont do it lucien jake demanded just one lucien replied pointing a finger at jake just one youve never had just one come with us jake itll settle your nerves just one bass yelled as he disappeared down the steps at eleven bass sat himself in the witness chair and looked through glazed eyes at the jury he smiled and almost giggled he was aware of the artists on the front row so he looked as expert as possible his nerves were indeed settled dr bass are you familiar with the criminal responsibility test relative to the mnaghten rule jake asked i certainly am bass replied with a sudden air of superiority would you explain this rule to the jury of course the mnaghten rule is the standard for criminal responsibility in mississippi as in fifteen other states it goes back to england in the year when a man by the name of daniel mnaghten attempted to assassinate the prime minister sir robert peel he mistakenly shot and killed the prime ministers secretary edward drummond during his trial the evidence plainly showed mnaghten was suffering from what we would call paranoid schizophrenia the jury returned a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity from this the mnaghten rule was established it is still followed in england and sixteen states what does the mnaghten rule mean the mnaghten rule is fairly simple every man is presumed to be sane and to establish a defense on the ground of insanity it must be clearly proven that when the defendant did what he did he was laboring under such a defect of reason from a mental disease that he did not know the nature and quality of the act he was doing or if he did know what he was doing he did not know it was wrong could you simplify that yes if a defendant cannot distinguish right from wrong he is legally insane define insanity please it has no significance medically it is strictly a legal standard for a persons mental state or condition jake breathed deeply and plowed forward now doctor based upon your examination of the defendant do you have an opinion as to the mental condition of carl lee hailey on may of this year at the time of the shooting yes i do and what is that opinion it is my opinion bass said slowly that the defendant had a total break with reality when his daughter was raped when he saw her immediately after the rape he didnt recognize her and when someone told him shed been gangraped and beaten and almost hanged something just snapped in carl lees mind thats a very elementary way of putting it but thats what happened something snapped he broke with reality they had to be killed he told me once that when he first saw them in court he could not understand why the deputies were protecting them he kept waiting for one of the cops to pull a gun and blow their heads off a few days went by and nobody killed them so he figured it was up to him i mean he felt as though someone in the system would execute the two for raping his little girl what im saying mr brigance is that mentally he left us he was in another world he was suffering from delusions he broke bass knew he was sounding good he was talking to the jury now not the lawyer the day after the rape he spoke with his daughter in the hospital she could barely talk with the broken jaws and all but she said she saw him in the woods running to save her and she asked him why he disappeared now can you imagine what that would do to a father she later told him she begged for her daddy and the two men laughed at her and told her she didnt have a daddy jake let those words sink in he studied ellens outline and saw only two more questions now dr bass based upon your observations of carl lee hailey and your diagnosis of his mental condition at the time of the shooting do you have an opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty as to whether carl lee hailey was capable of knowing the difference between right and wrong when he shot these men i have and what is that opinion that due to his mental condition he was totally incapable of distinguishing right from wrong do you have an opinion based upon the same factors as to whether carl lee hailey was able to understand and appreciate the nature and quality of his actions i do and what is that opinion in my opinion as an expert in the field of psychiatry mr hailey was totally incapable of understanding and appreciating the nature and quality of what he was doing thank you doctor i tender the witness jake gathered his legal pad and strolled confidently back to his seat he glanced at lucien who was smiling and nodding he glanced at the jury they were watching bass and thinking about his testimony wanda womack a young woman with a sympathetic glow about her looked at jake and smiled ever so slightly it was the first positive signal he received from the jury since the trial started so far so good carl lee whispered jake smiled at his client youre a real psycho big man any crossexamination noose asked buckley just a few questions buckley said as he grabbed the podium jake could not imagine buckley arguing psychiatry with an expert even if it was wt bass but buckley had no plans to argue psychiatry dr bass what is your full name jake froze the question had an ominous hint to it buckley asked it with a great deal of suspicion william tyler bass what do you go by wt bass have you ever been known as tyler bass the expert hesitated no he said meekly an immense feeling of anxiety hit jake and felt like a hot spear tearing into his stomach the question could only mean trouble are you positive buckley asked with raised eyebrows and an enormous amount of distrust in his voice bass shrugged maybe when i was younger i see now i believe you testified that you studied medicine at the university of texas health science center thats correct and where is that dallas and when were you a student there from to and under what name were you registered william t bass jake was numb with fear buckley had something a dark secret from the past known only to bass and himself did you ever use the name tyler bass while you were a medical student no are you positive i certainly am what is your social security number buckley made a check mark beside something on his legal pad and what is your date of birth he asked carefully september and what was your mothers name jonnie elizabeth bass and her maiden name skidmore another check mark bass looked nervously at jake and your place of birth carbondale illinois another check mark an objection to the relevance of these questions was in order and sustainable but jakes knees were like jello and his bowels were suddenly fluid he feared he would embarrass himself if he stood and tried to speak buckley studied his check marks and waited a few seconds every ear in the courtroom waited for the next question knowing it would be brutal bass watched the da like a prisoner watching the firing squad hoping and praying the guns would somehow misfire finally buckley smiled at the expert dr bass have you ever been convicted of a felony the question echoed throughout the silence and landed from all directions on the trembling shoulders of tyler bass even a cursory look at his face revealed the answer carl lee squinted and looked at his lawyer of course not bass answered loudly desperately buckley just nodded and walked slowly to the table where musgrove with much ceremony handed him some importantlooking papers are you certain buckley thundered of course im certain bass protested as he eyed the importantlooking papers jake knew he needed to rise and say something or do something to stop the carnage that was seconds away but his mind was paralyzed youre certain buckley asked yes bass answered through clenched teeth youve never been convicted of a felony of course not are you as certain of that as you are the rest of your testimony before this jury that was the trap the killer the deadliest question of all one jake had used many times and when he heard it he knew bass was finished and so was carl lee of course bass answered with feigned arrogance buckley moved in for the kill youre telling this jury that on october in dallas texas you were not convicted of a felony under the name of tyler bass buckley asked the question while looking at the jury and reading from the importantlooking documents thats a lie bass said quietly and unconvincingly are you sure its a lie buckley asked a baldfaced lie do you know a lie from the truth dr bass damn right i do noose placed his glasses on his nose and leaned forward the jurors quit rocking the reporters quit scribbling the deputies along the back wall stood still and listened buckley picked out one of the importantlooking documents and studied it youre telling this jury that on october you were not convicted of statutory rape jake knew it was important in the midst of any great courtroom crisis even this one to maintain a straight poker face it was important for the jurors who missed nothing to see the defendants lawyer with a positive look about him jake had practiced this positive everythingswonderful imincontrol look through many trials and many surprises but with the statutory rape the positive and confident and certain look was immediately replaced by a sickly pale pained expression that was being scrutinized by at least half of those in the jury box the other half scowled at the witness on the stand were you convicted of statutory rape doctor buckley asked again after a lengthy silence no answer noose uncoiled and leaned downward in the direction of the witness please answer the question dr bass bass ignored his honor and stared at the da then said youve got the wrong man buckley snorted and walked to musgrove who was holding some more importantlooking papers he opened a large white envelope and removed something that resembled an x photograph well dr bass ive got some photographs of you taken by the dallas police department on september would you like to see them no answer buckley held them out to the witness would you like to see these dr bass perhaps they could refresh your memory bass slowly shook his head then lowered it and stared blankly at his boots your honor the state would introduce into evidence these copies certified under the acts of congress of the final judgment and sentencing order in the case styled state of texas versus tyler bass said records being obtained by the state from the proper officials in dallas texas and showing that on october a one tyler bass pled guilty to the charge of statutory rape a felony under the laws of the state of texas we can prove that tyler bass and this witness dr wt bass are one and the same musgrove politely handed jake a copy of everything buckley was waving any objections to this introduction into evidence noose asked in jakes direction a speech was needed a brilliant emotional explanation that would touch the hearts of the jurors and make them weep with pity for bass and his patient but the rules of procedure did not permit one at this point of course the evidence was admissible unable to stand jake waved in the negative no objections we have no further questions buckley announced any redirect mr brigance noose asked in the split second available jake could not think of a single thing he could ask bass to improve the situation the jury had heard enough from the defense expert no jake said quietly very well dr bass you are excused bass made a quick exit through the small gate in the railing down the center aisle and out of the courtroom jake watched his departure intently conveying as much hatred as possible it was important for the jury to see how shocked the defendant and his lawyer were the jury had to believe a convicted felon was not knowingly put on the stand when the door closed and bass was gone jake scanned the courtroom in hopes of finding an encouraging face there were none lucien stroked his beard and stared at the floor lester sat with his arms folded and a disgusted look on his face gwen was crying call your next witness noose said jake continued searching in the third row between reverend ollie agee and reverend luther roosevelt sat norman reinfeld when his eyes met jakes he frowned and shook his head as if to say i told you so on the other side of the courtroom most of the whites looked relaxed and a few even grinned at jake mr brigance you may call your next witness against his better judgment jake attempted to stand his knees buckled and he leaned forward with his palms flat against the table your honor he said in a highpitched shrill defeated voice could we recess till one but mr brigance its only eleventhirty a lie seemed appropriate yes your honor but our next witness is not here and will not arrive until one very well well stand in recess until one i need to see the attorneys in chambers next to chambers was a coffee room where the lawyers loitered and gossiped by the hour and next to it was a small rest room jake closed and locked the rest room door and removed his coat throwing it to the floor he knelt beside the toilet waited momentarily then vomited ozzie stood before the judge and attempted small talk while musgrove and the da smiled at each other they waited on jake finally he entered chambers and apologized jake i have some bad news ozzie said let me sit down i got a call an hour ago from the sheriff of lafayette county your law clerk ellen roark is in the hospital what happened the klan got her last night somewhere between here and oxford they tied her to a tree and beat her how is she jake asked stable but serious what happened buckley asked we aint sure they stopped her car somehow and took her out in the woods cut her clothes off her and cut her hair shes got a concussion and cuts on the head so they figure she was beat jake needed to vomit again he couldnt speak he massaged his temples and thought how nice it would be to tie bass to a tree and beat him noose studied the defense attorney with compassion mr brigance are you okay no response lets recess until two i think we could all use the break noose said jake walked slowly up the front steps with an empty coors bottle and for a moment gave serious thought to smashing it against luciens head he realized the injury would not be felt lucien rattled his ice cubes and stared off in the distance in the direction of the square which had long been deserted except for the soldiers and the regular crowd of teenagers flocking to the theater for the saturday night double feature they said nothing lucien stared away jake glared at him with the empty bottle bass was hundreds of miles away after a minute or so jake asked wheres bass gone gone where gone home wheres his home why do you wanna know id like to see his home id like to see him in his home id like to beat him to death with a baseball bat in his home lucien rattled some more i dont blame you did you know know what about the conviction hell no no one knew the record was expunged i dont understand bass told me the record of the conviction in texas was expunged three years after it was entered jake placed the beer bottle on the porch beside his chair he grabbed a dirty glass blew into it then filled it with ice cubes and jack daniels do you mind explaining lucien according to bass the girl was seventeen and the daughter of a prominent judge in dallas they fell in heat and the judge caught them screwing on the couch he pressed charges and bass didnt have a chance he pled guilty to the statutory rape but the girl was in love they kept seeing each other and she comes up pregnant bass married her and gives the judge a perfect baby boy for his first grandchild the old man has a change of heart and the record is expunged lucien drank and watched the lights from the square what happened to the girl according to bass a week before he finished medical school his wife whos pregnant again and the little boy were killed in a train wreck in fort worth thats when he started drinking and quit living and hes never told you this before dont interrogate me i told you i knew nothing about it i put him on the witness stand twice myself remember if i had known it he would never have testified why didnt he ever tell you i guess because he thought the record was erased i dont know technically hes right there is no record after the expungement but he was convicted jake took a long bitter drink of whiskey it was nasty they sat in silence for ten minutes it was dark and the crickets were in full chorus sallie walked to the screen door and asked jake if he wanted supper he said no thanks what happened this afternoon lucien asked carl lee testified and we adjourned at four buckley didnt have his psychiatrist ready hell testify monday howd he do fair he followed bass and you could feel the hatred from the jurors he was stiff and sounded rehearsed i dont think he scored too many points whatd buckley do went wild screamed at carl lee for an hour carl lee kept getting smart with him and they sniped back and forth i think they both got hurt on redirect i propped him up some and he came across pitiful and sympathetic almost cried at the end thats nice yeah real nice but theyll convict him wont they i would imagine after we adjourned he tried to fire me said id lost his case and he wanted a new lawyer lucien walked to the edge of the porch and unzipped his pants he leaned on a column and sprayed the shrubs he was barefoot and looked like a flood victim sallie brought him a fresh drink hows row ark he asked stable they say i called her room and a nurse said she couldnt talk ill go over tomorrow i hope shes okay shes a fine girl shes a radical bitch but a very smart one i feel like its my fault lucien its not your fault its a crazy world jake full of crazy people right now i think half of them are in ford county two weeks ago they planted dynamite outside my bedroom window they beat to death my secretarys husband yesterday they shot at me and hit a guardsman now they grab my law clerk tie her to a pole rip her clothes off cut her hair and shes in the hospital with a concussion i wonder whats next i think you should surrender i would i would march down to the courthouse right now and surrender my briefcase lay down my arms give up but to whom the enemy is invisible you cant quit jake your client needs you to hell with my client he tried to fire me today he needs you this thing aint over till its over nesbits head hung halfway out the window and the saliva dripped down the left side of his chin down the door forming a small puddle over the o in the ford of the sheriffs department insignia on the side of the car an empty beer can moistened his crotch after two weeks of bodyguard duty he had grown accustomed to sleeping with the mosquitoes in his patrol car while protecting the niggers lawyer moments after saturday turned into sunday the radio violated his rest he grabbed the mike while wiping his chin on his left sleeve so he responded whats your same place it was two hours ago the wilbanks house is brigance still there get him and take him to his house on adams its an emergency nesbit walked past the empty bottles on the porch through the unlocked door where he found jake sprawled on the couch in the front room get up jake you gotta go home its an emergency jake jumped to his feet and followed nesbit they stopped on the front steps and looked past the dome of the courthouse in the distance a boiling funnel of black smoke rose above an orange glow and drifted peacefully toward the half moon adams street was blocked with an assortment of volunteer vehicles mostly pickups each had a variety of red and yellow emergency lights at least a thousand in all they spun and flashed and streaked through the darkness in a silent chorus illuminating the street the fire engines were parked haphazardly in front of the house the firemen and volunteers worked frantically laying lines and getting organized responding occasionally to the commands of the chief ozzie prather and hastings stood near an engine some guardsmen lingered benignly near a jeep the fire was brilliant flames roared from every window across the front of the house upstairs and down the carport was completely engulfed carlas cutlass burned inside and outthe four tires emitting a darker glow of their own curiously another smaller car not the saab burned next to the cutlass the thundering crackling noise of the fire plus the rumbling of the fire engines plus the loud voices attracted neighbors from several blocks they crowded together in the lawns across the street and watched jake and nesbit ran down the street the chief spotted them and came running jake is anybody in the house no good i didnt think so just a dog a dog jake nodded and watched the house im sorry said the chief they gathered at ozzies car in front of mrs pickles house jake answered questions thats not your volkswagen under there is it jake jake stared in stunned silence at carlas landmark he shook his head i didnt think so looks like thats where it started i dont understand said jake if it aint your car then somebody parked it there right notice how the floor of the carport is burnin concrete dont normally burn its gasoline somebody loaded the vw with gasoline parked it and ran away probably had some kinda device which set the thing off prather and two volunteers agreed how longs it been burning jake asked we got here ten minutes ago the chief said and it was well involved id say thirty minutes its a good fire somebody knew what theys doin i dont suppose we could get anything out of there could we jake asked in general knowing the answer no way jake its too involved my men couldnt go in there if people were trapped its a good fire why do you say that well look at it its burnin evenly through the house you can see flames in every window downstairs and up thats very unusual in just a minute itll burn through the roof two squads inched forward with the lines shooting water in the direction of the windows by the front porch a smaller line was aimed at a window upstairs after watching for a minute or two as the water disappeared into the flames with no noticeable effect the chief spat and said itll burn to the ground with that he disappeared around an engine and began shouting jake looked at nesbit will you do me a favor sure jake drive over to harry rexs and bring him back id hate for him to miss this sure for two hours jake ozzie harry rex and nesbit sat on the patrol car and watched the fire fulfill the chiefs prediction from time to time a neighbor would stop by and extend sympathies and ask about the family mrs pickle the sweet old woman next door cried loudly when informed by jake that max had been consumed by three the deputies and other curious had disappeared and by four the quaint little victorian had been reduced to smoldering rubble the last of the firemen smothered any sign of smoke from the ruins only the chimney and burnt frames of two cars stood above the remains as the heavy rubber boots kicked and plowed through the waste looking for sparks or hidden flames that might somehow leap from the dead and burn the rest of the wreckage they rolled up the last of the lines as the sun began to appear jake thanked them when they left he and harry rex walked through the backyard and surveyed the damage oh well harry rex said its just a house would you call carla and tell her that no i think you should i think ill wait harry rex looked at his watch its about breakfast time isnt it its sunday morning harry rex nothings open ah jake youre an amateur and im a professional i can find hot food at any time of any day the truck stop the truck stop okay and when we finish well go to oxford to check on row ark great i cant wait to see her with a butch haircut sallie grabbed the phone and threw it at lucien who rumbled with it until it was arranged properly next to his head yeah who is it he asked squinting through the window into the darkness is this lucien wilbanks yeah whos this do you know clyde sisco yeah its fifty thousand call me back in the morning sheldon roark sat in the window with his feet on the back of a chair reading the memphis sunday papers version of the hailey trial on the bottom of the front page was a picture of his daughter and the story about her encounter with the klan she rested comfortably in the bed a few feet away the left side of her head was shaved and covered with a thick bandage the left ear was sewn with twentyeight stitches the severe concussion had been downgraded to a mild concussion and the doctors had promised she could leave by wednesday she had not been raped or whipped when the doctors called him in boston they were short on details he had flown for seven hours not knowing what they had done to her but expecting the worst late saturday night the doctors ran more x rays and told him to relax the scars would fade and the hair would grow back she had been frightened and roughed up but it could have been much worse he heard a commotion in the hall someone was arguing with a nurse he laid the paper on her bed and opened the door a nurse had caught jake and harry rex sneaking down the hall she explained that visiting hours started at pm and that happened to be six hours away that only family members were allowed and that she would call security if they didnt leave harry rex explained that he didnt give a damn about visiting hours or any other silly rules of the hospital that it was his fiancee and that he would see her one last time before she died and that if the nurse didnt shut up he would sue her for harassment because he was a lawyer and hadnt sued anybody in a week and was getting anxious whats going on here sheldon said jake looked at the small man with the red hair and green eyes and said you must be sheldon roark i am im jake brigance the one yes ive been reading about you its okay nurse theyre with me yeah harry rex said its okay were with him now would you please leave us alone before i garnishee your check she vowed to call security and stormed down the hall im harry rex vonner he said shaking hands with sheldon roark step inside he said they followed him into the small room and stared at ellen she was still asleep how bad is she jake asked mild concussion twentyeight stitches in her ear and eleven in her head shell be fine doctor said she might leave by wednesday she was awake last night and we talked for a long time her hair looks awful harry rex observed they yanked it and cut it with a dull knife she said they also cut her clothes off and at one time threatened to bullwhip her the head injuries are selfinflicted she thought they would either kill her or rape her or both so she banged her brains out against the pole she was tied to must have scared them you mean they didnt beat her no they didnt hurt her just scared the hell out of her what did she see not much burning cross white robes about a dozen men sheriff said it was a pasture eleven miles east of here owned by some paper company who found her harry rex asked the sheriff received an anonymous phone call from a fella by the name of mickey mouse ah yes my old friend ellen moaned softly and stretched lets step outside sheldon said does this place have a cafeteria harry rex asked i get hungry when i get near a hospital sure lets have coffee the cafeteria on the first floor was empty jake and mr roark drank black coffee harry rex started with three sweet rolls and a pint of milk according to the paper things arent going too well sheldon said the paper is very kind harry rex said with a mouthful jake here is gettin his ass kicked all over the courtroom and life aint so great outside the courtroom either when theyre not shooting at him or kidnapping his law clerk theyre burning his house they burned your house jake nodded last night its still smoldering i thought i detected the smell of smoke we watched it burn to the ground it took four hours im sorry to hear that theyve threatened me with that before but the worst ive had was slashed tires ive never been shot at either ive been shot at a couple of times do yall have the klan in boston asked harry rex notthat i know of its a shame those folks add a real dimension to your law practice sounds like it we saw the television reports of the riot around the courthouse last week ive watched it pretty close since ellen became involved its a famous case even up there i wish i had it its all yours said jake i think my client is looking for a new lawyer how many shrinks will the state call just one hell testify in the morning and well have closing arguments the jury should get it by late tomorrow afternoon i hate that ellen will miss it she called me every day and talked about the case where did jake go wrong harry rex asked dont talk with your mouth full jake said i think jake has done a good job its a lousy set of facts to begin with hailey committed the murders planned them carefully and is relying on a rather weak plea of insanity juries in boston would not be too sympathetic nor in ford county added harry rex i hope you have a soulstirring final summation up your sleeve sheldon said he doesnt have any sleeves said harry rex theyve all been burned along with his pants and underwear why dont you come over tomorrow and watch jake asked ill introduce you to the judge and ask that you have privileges of chambers he wouldnt do that for me harry rex said i can understand why sheldon said with a smile i might just do that i had planned to stay until tuesday anyway is it safe over there not really woody mackenvales wife sat on a plastic bench in the hall next to his room and cried quietly while trying to be brave for her two small sons seated next to her each boy squeezed a wellused wad of kleenexes occasionally wiping their cheeks and blowing their noses jake knelt before her and listened intently as she described what the doctors had said the bullet had lodged in the spinethe paralysis was severe and permanent he was a foreman at a plant in booneville good job good life she didnt work at least until now they would make it somehow but she wasnt sure how he coached his sons little league team he was very active she cried louder and the boys wiped their cheeks he saved my life jake said to her and looked at the boys she closed her eyes and nodded he was doing his jotx well make it jake took a kleenex from the box on the bench and wiped his eyes a group of relatives stood nearby and watched harry rex paced nervously at the end of the hall jake hugged her and patted the boys on the head he gave her his phone numberofficeand told her to call if he could do anything he promised to visit woody when the trial was over the beer stores opened at noon on sunday as if the church folks needed it then and would stop on the way home from the lords house to pick up a couple of sixpacks then on to grandmothers for sunday dinner and an afternoon of hell raising oddly they would close again at six in the afternoon as if the same folks should then be denied beer as they returned to church for the sunday night services on the other six days beer was sold from six in the morning until midnight but on sunday the selling was curtailed in honor of the almighty jake bought a sixpack at bates grocery and directed his chauffeur toward the lake harry rexs antique bronco carried three inches of dried mud across the doors and fenders the tires were imperceptible the windshield was cracked and dangerous with thousands of splattered insects caked around the edges the inspection sticker was four years old and unseen from the outside dozens of empty beer cans and broken bottles littered the floorboard the air conditioner had not worked in six years jake had suggested use of the saab harry rex had cursed him for his stupidity the red saab was an easy target for snipers no one would suspect the bronco they drove slowly in the general direction of the lake to no place in particular willie nelson wailed from the cassette harry rex tapped the steering wheel and sang along his normal speaking voice was coarse and unrefined with song it was heinous jake sipped his beer and searched for daylight through the windshield the heat wave was about to be broken dark clouds loomed to the southwest and when they passed hueys lounge the rains fell and showered the parched earth it cleansed and removed the dust from the kudzu that lined the roadbeds and hung like spanish moss from the trees it cooled the scorched pavement and created a sticky fog that rose three feet above the highway the red baked gullies absorbed the water and when full began to carry tiny streams downward to the larger field drains and road ditches the rains drenched the cotton and soybeans and pounded the crop rows until small puddles formed between the stalks remarkably the windshield wipers worked they slapped back and forth furiously and removed the mud and insect collection the storm grew harry rex increased the volume of the stereo the blacks with their cane poles and straw hats camped under the bridges and waited for the storm to blow over below them the still creeks came to life muddy water from the fields and gullies rushed downward and stirred the small streams and brooks the water rose and moved forward the blacks ate bologna and crackers and told fishing stories harry rex was hungry he stopped at treadways grocery near the lake and bought more beer two catfish dinners and a large bag of cajiinspiced redhot barbecue pork skins he threw them at jake they crossed the dam in a blinding downpour harry rex parked next to a small pavilion over a picnic area they sat on the concrete table and watched the rain batter lake chatulla jake drank beer while harry rex ate the catfish dinners when you gonna tell carla he asked slurping beer the tin roof roared above about what the house

handle it the mnaghten rule im the sleazy divorce lawyer remember how could i forget jake poured hot beer from his neglected bottle and opened another the rain slackened and the clouds lightened a cool wind blew up from the lake theyll convict him wont they harry rex he asked staring at the lake in the distance he quit chomping and wiped his mouth he laid the paper plate on the table and took a long drink of beer the wind blew light drops of water onto his face he wiped it with a sleeve yeah jake your man is about to be sent away i can see it in their eyes the insanity crap just didnt work they didnt want to believe bass to begin with and after buckley yanked his pants down it was all over carl lee didnt help himself any he seemed rehearsed and too sincere like he was begging for sympathy he was a lousy witness i watched the jury while he testified i saw no support for him theyll convict jake and quickly thanks for being so blunt im your friend and i think you should start preparing for a conviction and a long appeal you know harry rex i wish id never heard of carl lee hailey i think its too late jake sallie answered the door and told jake she was sorry about the house lucien was upstairs in his study working and sober he pointed to a chair and instructed jake to sit down legal pads littered his desk ive spent all afternoon working on a closing argument he said waving at the mess before him your only hope of saving hailey is with a spellbinding performance on final summation i mean were talking about the greatest closing argument in the history of jurisprudence thats what itll take and i assume youve created such a masterpiece as a matter of fact i have its much better than anything you could come up with and i assumedcorrectly that you would spend your sunday afternoon mourning the loss of your home and drowning your sorrows with coors i knew you would have nothing prepared so ive done it for you i wish i could stay as sober as you lucien i was a better lawyer drunk than you are sober at least im a lawyer lucien tossed a legal pad at jake there it is a compilation of my greatest closing arguments lucien wilbanks at his best all rolled into one for you and your client i suggest you memorize it and use it word for word its that good dont try to modify it or improvise youll just screw it up ill think about it ive done this before remember youd never know it dammit lucien get off my back take it easy jake lets have a drink sallie sallie jake threw the masterpiece on the couch and walked to the window overlooking the backyard sallie ran up the stairs lucien ordered whiskey and beer were you up all night lucien asked no i slept from eleven to twelve you look terrible you need a good nights rest i feel terrible and sleep will not help nothing will help except the end of this trial i dont understand lucien i dont understand how everything has gone so wrong surely to god were entitled to a little good luck the case should not even be tried in clanton we were dealt the worst possible jurya jury thats been tampered with but i cant prove it our star witness was completely destroyed the defendant made a lousy witness and the jury does not trust me i dont know what else could go wrong you can still win the case jake itll take a miracle but those things happen sometimes ive snatched victory from the jaws of defeat many times with an effective closing argument zero in on one or two jurors play to them talk to them remember it just takes one to hang the jury should i make them cry if you can its not that easy but i believe in tears in the jury box its very effective sallie brought the drinks and they followed her downstairs to the porch after dark she fed them sandwiches and fried potatoes at ten jake excused himself and went to his room he called carla and talked for an hour there was no mention of the house his stomach cramped when he heard her voice and realized that one day very soon he would be forced to tell her that the house her house no longer existed he hung up and prayed she didnt read about it in the newspaper clanton returned to normal monday morning as the barricades were put in place around the square and the ranks of the soldiers swelled to preserve the public peace they loitered about in loose formation watching as the kluxers returned to their appointed ground on one side and the black protestors on the other the day of rest brought renewed energy to both groups and by eightthirty they were in full chorus the collapse of dr bass had been big news and the kluxers smelled victory plus they had scored a direct hit on adams street they appeared to be louder than normal at nine noose summoned the attorneys to chambers just wanted to make sure you were all alive and well he grinned at jake why dont you kiss my ass judge jake said under his breath but loud enough to be heard the prosecutors froze mr pate cleared his throat noose cocked his head sideways as if hard of hearing what did you say mr brigance i said why dont we get started judge yes thats what i thought you said hows your clerk ms roark shell be fine was it the klan yes judge the same klan that tried to kill me same klan that lit up the county with crosses and who knows what else for our jury panel same klan thats probably intimidated most of those jurors sitting out there yes sir its the same klan noose ripped off his glasses can you substantiate that you mean do i have written signed notarized confessions from the klansmen no sir theyre most uncooperative if you cant prove it mr brigance then leave it alone yes your honor jake left chambers and slammed the door seconds later mr pate called the place to order and everyone rose noose welcomed his jury back and promised the ordeal was almost over no one smiled at him it had been a lonely weekend at the temple inn does the state have any rebuttal he asked buckley one witness your honor dr rodeheaver was fetched from the witness room he carefully situated himself in the witness chair and nodded warmly at the jury he looked like a psychiatrist dark suit no boots buckley assumed the podium and smiled at the jury you are dr wilbert rodeheaver he thundered looking at the jury as if to say now youll meet a real psychiatrist yes sir buckley asked questions a million questions about his educational and professional background rodeheaver was confident relaxed prepared and accustomed to the witness chair he talked at great length about his broad educational training his vast experience as a practicing physician and more recently the enormous magnitude of his job as head of staff at the state mental hospital buckley asked him if he had written any articles in his field he said yes and for thirty minutes they discussed the writings of this very learned man he had received research grants from the federal government and from various states he was a member of all the organizations bass belonged to and a few more he had been certified by every association remotely touching the study of the human mind he was polished and sober buckley tendered him as an expert and jake had no questions buckley continued dr rodeheaver when did you first examine carl lee hailey the expert checked his notes june where did the examination take place in my office at whitfield how long did you examine him couple of hours what was the purpose of this examination to try and determine his mental condition at that time and also at the time he killed mr cobb and mr willard did you obtain his medical history most of the information was taken by an associate at the hospital i reviewed it with mr hailey what did the history reveal nothing remarkable he talked a lot about vietnam but nothing remarkable did he talk freely about vietnam oh yes he wanted to talk about it it was almost like he had been told to discuss it as much as possible what else did you discuss at the first examination we covered a wide variety of topics his childhood family education various jobs just about everything did he discuss the rape of his daughter yes in great detail it was painful for him to talk about it the sam as it would have been for me had it been my daughter did he discuss with you the events leading up to the shootings of cobb and willard yes we talked about that for quite a while i tried to ascertain the degree of knowledge and understanding he had about those events what did he tell you initially not much but with time he opened up and explained how he inspected the courthouse three days before the shooting and picked a good place to attack what about the shootings he never told me much about the actual killings said he didnt remember much but i suspect otherwise jake sprang to his feet objection the witness can only testify as to what he actually knows he cannot speculate sustained please continue mr buckley what else did you observe concerning his mood attitude and manner of speech rodeheaver crossed his legs and rocked gently he lowered his eyebrows in deep thought initially he was distrustful of me and had difficulty looking me in the eye he gave short answers to my questions he was very resentful of the fact that he was guarded and sometimes handcuffed while at our facility he questioned the padded walls but after a while he opened up and talked freely about most everything he flatly refused to answer a few questions but other than that i would say he was fairly cooperative when and where did you examine him again the next day same place what was his mood and attitude about the same as the day before cool at first but he opened up eventually he discussed basically the same topics as the day before how long did this examination last approximately four hours buckley reviewed something on a legal pad then whispered to musgrove now dr rodeheaver as a result of your examinations of mr hailey on june and were you able to arrive at a medical diagnosis of the defendants psychiatric condition on those dates yes sir and what is that diagnosis on june and mr hailey appeared to be of sound mind perfectly normal i would say thank you based on your examinations were you able to arrive at a diagnosis of mr haileys mental condition on the day he shot billy ray cobb and pete willard yes and what is that diagnosis at that time his mental condition was sound no defects of any nature upon what factors do you base this rodeheaver turned to the jury and became a professor you must look at the level of premeditation involved in this crime motive is an element of premeditation he certainly had a motive for doing what he did and his mental condition at that time did not prevent him from entertaining the requisite premeditation frankly mr hailey carefully planned what he did doctor you are familiar with the mnaghten rule as a test for criminal responsibility certainly and you are aware that another psychiatrist a dr wt bass has told this jury that mr hailey was incapable of knowing the difference between right and wrong and further that he was unable to understand and appreciate the nature and quality of his actions yes i am aware of that do you agree with that testimony no i find it preposterous and i am personally offended by it mr hailey himself has testified he planned the murders hes admitted in effect that his mental condition at the time did not prevent him from possessing the ability to plan thats called premeditation in every legal and medical book ive never heard of someone planning a murder admitting he planned it then claiming he did not know what he was doing its absurd at that moment jake felt it was absurd too and as it echoed around the courtroom it sounded mighty absurd rodeheaver sounded good and infinitely credible jake thought of bass and cursed to himself lucien sat with the blacks and agreed with every word of rodeheavers testimony when compared to bass the states doctor was terribly believable lucien ignored the jury box from time to time he would cut his eyes without moving his head and catch clyde sisco blatantly and openly staring directly at him but lucien would not allow their eyes to meet the messenger had not called monday morning as instructed an affirmative nod or wink from lucien would consummate the deal with payment to be arranged later after the verdict sisco knew the rules and he watched for an answer there was none lucien wanted to discuss it with jake now doctor based upon these factors and your diagnosis of his mental condition as of may do you have an opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty as to whether mr hailey was capable of knowing the difference between right and wrong when he shot billy ray cobb pete willard and deputy dewayne looney i have and what is that opinion his mental condition was sound and he was very capable of distinguishing right from wrong and do you have an opinion based upon the same factors as to whether mr hailey was able to understand and appreciate the nature and quality of his actions i have and what is that opinion that he fully appreciated what he was doing buckley snatched his legal pad and bowed politely thank you doctor i have no further questions any crossexamination mr brigance noose asked just a few questions i thought so lets take a fifteenminute recess jake ignored carl lee and moved quickly out of the courtroom up the stairs and into the law library on the third floor harry rex was waiting and smiling relax jake ive called every newspaper in north carolina and theres no story about the house theres nothing about row ark the raleigh morning paper ran a story about the trial but it was in real general terms nothing else carla doesnt know about it jake as far as she knows her pretty little landmark is still standing isnt that great wonderful just wonderful thanks harry rex dont mention it look jake i sorta hate to bring this up i cant wait you know i hate buckley hate him worse than you do but me and musgrove get along okay i can talk to musgrove i was thinking last night that it might be a good idea to approach themme through musgroveand explore the possibilities of a plea bargain no listen jake what harm will it do none if you can plead him guilty to murder with no gas chamber then you know you have saved his life no look jake your man is about fortyeight hours away from a death penalty conviction if you dont believe that then youre blind jake my blind friend why should buckley cut a deal hes got us on the ropes maybe he wont but let me at least find out no harry rex forget it rodeheaver returned to his seat after the recess and jake looked at him from behind the podium in his brief legal career he had never won an argument in court or out with an expert witness and the way his luck was running he decided not to argue with this one dr rodeheaver psychiatry is the study of the human mind is it not it is and it is an inexact science at best is it not that is correct you might examine a person and reach a diagnosis and the next psychiatrist might reach a completely different diagnosis thats possible yes in fact you could have ten psychiatrists examine a mental patient and arrive at ten different opinions about whats wrong with the patient thats unlikely but it could happen couldnt it doctor yes it could just like legal opinions i guess but were not dealing with legal opinions in this case are we doctor no the truth is doctor in many cases psychiatry cannot tell us what is wrong with a persons mind that is true and psychiatrists disagree all the time dont they doctor of course now who do you work for doctor the state of mississippi and for how long eleven years and who is prosecuting mr hadey the state of mississippi during your elevenyear career with the state how many times have you testified in trials where the insanity defense was used rodeheaver thought for a moment i think this is my fortythird trial jake checked something in a file and eyed the doctor with a nasty little smile are you sure its not your fortysixth it could be yes im not certain the courtroom became still buckley and musgrove hovered over their legal pads but watched their witness carefully fortysix times youve testified for the state in insanity trials if you say so and fortysix times youve testified that the defendant was not legally insane correct doctor im not sure well let me make it simple youve testified fortysix times and fortysix times it has been your opinion the defendant was not legally insane correct rodeheaver squirmed just a little and a hint of discomfort broke around his eyes im not sure youve never seen a legally insane criminal defendant have you doctor of course i have good would you then please sir tell us the name of the defendant and where he was tried buckley rose and buttoned his coat your honor the state objects to these questions dr rodeheaver cannot be required to remember the names and places of the trials he has testified in overruled sit down answer the question doctor rodeheaver breathed deeply and studied the ceiling jake glanced at the jurors they were awake and waiting on an answer i cant remember he finally said jake lifted a thick stack of papers and waved it at the witness could it be doctor that the reason you cant remember is that in eleven years fortysix trials you have never testified in favor of the defendant i honestly cant remember can you honestly name us one trial in which you found the defendant to be legally insane im sure there are some yes or no doctor one trial the expert looked briefly at the da no my memory fails me i cannot at this time jake walked slowly to the defense table and picked up a thick file dr rodeheaver do you recall testifying in the trial of a man by the name of danny booker in mcmurphy county in december of a rather gruesome double homicide yes i recall that trial and you testified to the effect that he was not legally insane did you not that is correct do you recall how many psychiatrists testified in his behalf not exactly there were several do the names noel mcclacky md og mcguire md and lou watson md ring a bell yes theyre all psychiatrists arent they yes theyre all qualified arent they yes and they all examined mr booker and testified at trial that in their opinions the poor man was legally insane thats correct and you testified he was not legally insane thats correct how many other doctors supported your position none that i recall so it was three against one yes but im still convinced i was right i see what did the jury do doctor he uh was found not guilty by reason of insanity thank you now dr rodeheaver youre the head doctor at whitfield arent you yes so to speak are you directly or indirectly responsible for the treatment of every patient at whitfield im directly responsible mr brigance i may not personally see every patient but their doctors are under my supervision thank you doctor where is danny booker today rodeheaver shot a desperate look at buckley and immediately covered it with a warm relaxed grin for the jury he hesitated for a few seconds then hesitated one second too long hes at whitfield isnt he jake asked in a tone of voice that informed everyone that the answer was yes i believe so rodeheaver said so hes directly under your care then doctor i suppose and what is his diagnosis doctor i really dont know i have a lot of patients and paranoid schizophrenic its possible yes jake walked backward and sat on the railing he turned up the volume now doctor i want to make this clear for the jury in you testified that danny booker was legally sane and understood exactly what he was doing when he committed his crime and the jury disagreed with you and found him not guilty and since that time he has been a patient in your hospital under your supervision and treated by you as a paranoid schizophrenic is that correct the smirk on rodeheavers face informed the jury that it was indeed correct jake picked up another piece of paper and seemed to review it do you recall testifying in the trial of a man by the name of adam couch in dupree county in may of i remember that case it was a rape case wasnt it yes and you testified on behalf of the state against mr couch thats correct and you told the jury that he was not legally insane that was my testimony do you recall how many doctors testified on his behalf and told the jury he was a very sick man that he was legally insane there were several have you ever heard of the following doctors felix perry gene shumate and hobny wicker yes are they all qualified psychiatrists they are and they all testified on behalf of mr couch didnt they yes and they all said he was legally insane didnt they they did and you were the only doctor in the trial who said he was not legally insane as i recall yes and what did the jury do doctor he was found not guilty by reason of insanity yes and where is mr couch today doctor i think hes at whitfield and how long has he been there since the trial i believe i see do you normally admit patients and keep them for several years if they are of perfectly sound mind rodeheaver shifted his weight and began a slow burn he looked at his lawyer the peoples lawyer as if to say he was tired of this do something to stop it jake picked up more papers doctor do you recall the trial of a man by the name of buddy wooddall in cleburne county may of yes i certainly do murder wasnt it yes and you testified as an expert in the field of psychiatry and told the jury that mr wooddall was not insane i did do you recall how many psychiatrists testified on his behalf and told the jury the poor man was legally insane i believe there were five mr brigance thats correct doctor five against one do you recall what the jury did the anger and frustration was building in the witness stand the wise old grandfatherprofessor with all the right answers was becoming rattled yes i recall he was found not guilty by reason of insanity how do you explain that dr rodeheaver five against one and the jury finds against you you just cant trust juries he blurted then caught himself he fidgeted and grinned awkwardly at the jurors jake stared at him with a wicked smile then looked at the jury in disbelief he folded his arms and allowed the last words to sink in he waited staring and grinning at the witness you may proceed mr brigance noose finally said moving slowly and with great animation jake gathered his files and notes while staring at rodeheaver i think weve heard enough from this witness your honor any redirect mr buckley no sir the state rests noose addressed the jury ladies and gentlemen this trial is almost over there will be no more witnesses i will now meet with the attorneys to cover some technical areas then they will be allowed to make their final arguments to you that will begin at two oclock and take a couple of hours you will finally get the case around four and i will allow you to deliberate until six if you do not reach a verdict today you will be taken back to your rooms until tomorrow it is now almost eleven and well recess until two i need to see the attorneys in chambers carl lee leaned over and spoke to his lawyer for the first time since saturdays adjournment you tore him up pretty good jake wait till you hear the closing argument jake avoided harry rex and drove to karaway his childhood home was an old country house in downtown surrounded by ancient oaks and maples and elms that kept it cool in spite of the summer heat in the back past the trees was a long open field which ran for an eighth of a mile and disappeared over a small hill a chickenwire backstop stood over the weeds in one corner here jake had taken his first steps rode his first bike thrown his first football and base ball under an oak beside the field he had buried three dogs a raccoon a rabbit and some ducks a tire from a buick swung not far from the small cemetery the house had been locked and deserted for two months a neighborhood kid cut the grass and tended the lawn jake checked the house once a week his parents were somewhere in canada in a camperthe summer ritual he wished he were with them he unlocked the door and walked upstairs to his room it would never change the walls were covered with team pictures trophies baseball caps posters of pete rose archie manning and hank aaron a row of baseball gloves hung above the closet door a cap and gown picture sat on the dresser his mother still cleaned it weekly she once told him she often went to his room and expected to find him doing homework or sorting baseball cards she would flip through his scrapbooks and get all teary eyed he thought of hannas room with the stuffed animals and mother goose wallpaper a thick knot formed in his throat he looked out the window past the trees and saw himself swinging in the tire near the three white crosses where he buried his dogs he remembered each funeral and his fathers promises to get another dog he thought of hanna and her dog and his eyes watered the bed was much smaller now he removed his shoes and lay down a football helmet hung from the ceiling eighth grade karaway mustangs he scored seven touchdowns in five games it was all on film downstairs under the bookshelves the butterflies floated wildly through his stomach he carefully placed his noteshis notes not luciens on the dresser he studied himself in the mirror he addressed the jury he began by facing his biggest problem dr wt bass he apologized a lawyer walks into a courtroom faces a strange jury and has nothing to offer but his credibility and if he does anything to hurt his credibility he has hurt his cause his client he asked them tb believe that he would never put a convicted felon on the stand as an expert witness in any trial he did not know of the conviction he raised his hand and swore to this the world is full of psychiatrists and he could easily have found another if he had known bass had a problem but he simply did not know and he was sorry but what about basss testimony thirty years ago he had sex with a girl under eighteen in texas does that mean he is lying now in this trial does that mean you cannot trust his professional opinion please be fair to bass the psychiatrist forget bass the person please be fair to his patient carl lee hailey he knew nothing of the doctors past there was something about bass they might like to know something that was not mentioned by mr buckley when he was ripping the doctor to pieces the girl he had sex with was seventeen she later became his wife bore him a son and was pregnant when she and the boy were killed in a train objection buckley shouted objection your honor that evidence is not in the record sustained mr brigance you are not to refer to facts not in evidence the jury will disregard the last statements by mr brigance jake ignored noose and buckley and stared painfully at the jury when the shouting died he continued what about rodeheaver he wondered if the states doctor had ever engaged in sex with a girl under eighteen seemed silly to think about such things didnt it bass and rodeheaver in their younger daysit seemed so unimportant now in this courtroom almost thirty years later the states doctor is a man with an obvious bias a highly trained specialist who treats thousands for all sorts of mental illnesses yet when crimes are involved he cannot recognize insanity his testimony should be carefully weighed they watched him listened to every word he was not a courtroom preacher like his opponent he was quiet sincere he looked tired almost hurt lucien was sober and he sat with folded arms and watched the jurors all except sisco it was not his closing but it was good it was coming from the heart jake apologized for his inexperience he had not been in many trials not nearly as many as mr buckley and if he seemed a little green or if he made mistakes please dont hold it against carl lee it wasnt his fault he was just a rookie trying his best against a seasoned adversary who tried murder cases every month he made a mistake with bass and he made other mistakes and he asked the jury to forgive him he had a daughter the only one he would ever have she was four almost five and his world revolved around her she was special she was a little girl and it was up to him to protect her there was a bond there something he could not explain he talked about little girls carl lee had a daughter her name was tonya he pointed to her on the front row next to her mother and brothers shes a beautiful little girl ten years old and she can never have children she can never have a daughter because objection buckley said without shouting sustained noose said jake ignored the commotion he talked about rape for a while and explained how rape is much worse than murder with murder the victim is gone and not forced to deal with what happened to her the family must deal with it but not the victim but rape is much worse the victim has a lifetime of coping of trying to understand of asking questions and the worst part of knowing the rapist is still alive and may someday escape or be released every hour of every day the victim thinks of the rape and asks herself a thousand questions she relives it step by step minute by minute and it hurts just as bad perhaps the most horrible crime of all is the violent rape of a child a woman who is raped has a pretty good idea why it happened some animal was filled with hatred anger and violence but a child a tenyearold child suppose youre a parent imagine yourself trying to explain to your child why she was raped imagine yourself trying to explain why she cannot bear children objection sustained please disregard that last statement ladies and gentlemen jake never missed a beat suppose he said your tenyearold daughter is raped and youre a vietnam vet very familiar with an m and you get your hands on one while your daughter is lying in the hospital fighting for her life suppose the rapist is caught and six days later you manage to maneuver to within five feet of him as he leaves court and youve got the m what do you do mr buckley has told you what he would do he would mourn for his daughter turn the other cheek and hope the judicial system worked he would hope the rapist would receive justice be sent to parchman and hopefully never paroled thats what he would do and they should admire him for being such a kind compassionate and forgiving soul but what would a reasonable father do what would jake do if he had the m blow the bastards head off it was simple it was justice jake paused for a drink of water then shifted gears the pained and humble look was replaced with an air of indignation lets talk about cobb and willard they started this mess it was their lives the state was attempting to justify who would miss them except their mothers child rapists drug pushers would society miss such productive citizens wasnt ford county safer without them were not the other children in the county better off now that two rapists and pushers had been removed all parents should feel safer carl lee deserves a medal or at least a round of applause he was a hero thats what looney said give the man a trophy send him home to his family he talked about looney he had a daughter he also had one leg thanks to carl lee hailey if anyone had a right to be bitter to want blood it was dewayne looney and he said carl lee should be sent home to his family he urged them to forgive as looney had forgiven he asked them to follow looneys wishes he became much quieter and said he was almost through he wanted to leave them with one thought picture this if they could when she was lying there beaten bloodied legs spread and tied to trees she looked into the woods around her semiconscious and hallucinating she saw some one running toward her it was her daddy running desperately to save her in her dreams she saw him when she needed him the most she cried out for him and he disappeared he was taken away she needs him now as much as she needed him then please dont take him away she waits on the front row for her daddy let him go home to his family the courtroom was silent as jake sat next to his client he glanced at the jury and saw wanda womack brush away a tear with her finger for the first time in two days he felt a flicker of hope at four noose bid farewell to his jury he told them to elect a foreman get organized and get busy he told them they could deliberate until six maybe seven and if no verdict was reached he would recess until nine tuesday morning they stood and filed slowly from the courtroom once out of sight noose recessed until six and instructed the attorneys to remain close to the courtroom or leave a number with the clerk the spectators held their seats and chatted quietly carl lee was allowed to sit on the front row with his family buckley and musgrove waited in chambers with noose harry rex lucien and jake left for the office and a liquid supper no one expected a quick verdict the bailiff locked them in the jury room and instructed the two alternates to take a seat in the narrow hallway inside barry acker was elected foreman by acclamation he laid the jury instructions and exhibits on a small table in a corner they sat anxiously around two folding tables placed end to end i suggest we take an informal vote he said just to see where we are any objections to that there were none he had a list of twelve names vote guilty not guilty or undecided or you can pass for now reba betts undecided bernice toole guilty carol corman guilty donna lou peck undecided sue williams pass jo ann gates guilty rita mae plunk guilty frances mcgowan guilty wanda womack undecided eula dell yates undecided for now i wanna talk about it we will clyde sisco undecided thats eleven im barry acker and i vote

photographs fingerprints and ballistics reports at six they informed the judge they had not reached a verdict they were hungry and wanted to go he recessed until tuesday morning they sat for hours on the porch saying little watching as darkness surrounded the town below and ushered in the mosquitoes the heat wave had returned the soggy air clung to their skin and moistened their shirts the sounds of a hot summer night echoed softly across the front lawn sallie had offered to cook lucien declined and ordered whiskey jake had no appetite for food but the coors filled his system and satisfied any hunger pangs stirring within when things were good and dark nesbit emerged from his car walked across the porch through the front screen door and into the house a moment later he slammed the door walked past them with a cold beer and disappeared down the driveway in the direction of his car he never said a word sallie stuck her head through the door and made one last offer of food both declined jake i got a call this afternoon clyde sisco wants twentyfive thousand to hang the jury fifty thousand for an acquittal jake began shaking his head before you say no listen to me he knows he cant guarantee an acquittal but he can guarantee a hung jury it just takes one thats twentyfive thousand i know its a lot of money but you know ive got it ill pay it and you can repay me over the years whenever i dont care if you never repay it i dont care ive got a bankful of cds you know money means nothing to me if i were you id do it in a minute youre crazy lucien sure im crazy you havent

golden chance to beat him at his own game id do it jake forget it lucien please just forget it an hour passed with no words the lights of the town below slowly disappeared nesbits snoring was audible in the darkness sallie brought one last drink and said good night this is the hardest part lucien said waiting on twelve average everyday people to make sense of all this its a crazy system isnt it yes it is but it usually works juries are right ninety percent of the time i just dont feel lucky im waiting on the miracle jake my boy the miracle happens tomorrow tomorrow yes early tomorrow morning would you care to elaborate by noon tomorrow jake there will be ten thousand angry blacks swarming like ants around the ford county courthouse maybe more ten thousand why to scream and shout and chant free carl lee free carl lee to raise hell to scare everybody to intimidate the jury to just disrupt the hell out of everything therell be so many blacks white folks will run for cover the governor will send in more troops and how do you know all this because i planned it jake you listen jake when i was in my prime i knew every black preacher in fifteen counties ive been in their churches prayed with them marched with them sang with them they sent me clients and i sent them money i was the only white radical naacp lawyer in north mississippi i filed more race discrimination lawsuits than any ten firms in washington these were my people ive just made a few phone calls theyll start arriving in the morning and by noon you wont be able to stir niggers with a stick in downtown clanton where will they come from everywhere you know how tracks love to march and protest this will be great for them theyre looking forward to it youre crazy lucien my crazy friend i win bubba in room barry acker and clyde sisco finished their last game of gin rummy and made preparations for bed acker gathered some coins and announced he wanted a soft drink sisco said he was not thirsty acker tiptoed past a guardsman asleep in the hall the machine informed him it was out of order so he quietly opened the exit dqpr and walked up the stairs to the second floor where he found another machine next to an ice maker he inserted his coins the machine responded with a diet coke he bent over to pick it up out of the darkness two figures charged they knocked him to the floor kicked him and pinned him in a dark corner beside the ice maker next to a door with a chain and padlock the large one grabbed ackers collar and threw him against the cinder block wall the smaller one stood by the coke machine and watched the dark hall youre barry acker said the large one through clenched teeth yeah let go of me acker attempted to shake free but his assailant lifted him by the throat and held him to the wall with one hand he used the other hand to unsheathe a shiny hunting knife which he placed next to ackers nose the wiggling stopped listen to me he demanded in a loud whisper and listen good we know youre married and you live at forrest drive we know you got three kids and we know where they play and go to school your wife works at the bank acker went limp if that nigger walks free youll be sorry your family will be sorry it may take years but youll be awfully sorry he dropped him to the floor and grabbed his hair you breathe one word of this to anyone and youll lose a kid understand they vanished acker breathed deeply almost gasping for breath he rubbed his throat and the back of his head he sat in the darkness too scared to move at hundreds of small black churches across north mississippi the faithful gathered before dawn and loaded picnic baskets coolers lawn chairs and water jugs into converted school buses and church vans they greeted friends and chatted nervously about the trial for weeks they had read and talked about carl lee hailey now they were about to go help many were old and retired but there were entire families with children and playpens when the buses were full they piled into cars and followed their preachers they sang and prayed the preachers met other preachers in small towns and county seats and they set out in force down the dark highways when daylight materialized the highways and roads leading to ford county were filled with caravans of pilgrims they jammed the side streets for blocks around the square they parked where they stopped and unloaded the fat colonel had just finished breakfast and stood in the gazebo watching intently buses and cars many with horns honking were coming from all directions to the square the barricades held firm he barked commands and the soldiers jumped into high gear more excitement at seventhirty he called ozzie and told him of the invasion ozzie arrived immediately and found agee who assured him it was a peaceful march sort of like a sitin how many were coming ozzie asked thousands said agee thousands they set up camp under the stately oaks and milled around the lawn inspecting things they arranged tables and chairs and playpens they were indeed peaceful until a group began the familiar cry of free carl lee they cleared their throats and joined in it was not yet eight oclock a black radio station in memphis flooded the airwaves early tuesday with a call for help black bodies were needed to march and demonstrate in clanton mississippi an hour away hundreds of cars met at a mall and headed south every civil rights activist and black politician in the city made the trip agee was a man possessed he used a bullhorn to shout orders here and there he herded new arrivals into their places he organized the black preachers he assured ozzie and the colonel everything was okay everything was okay until a handful of klansmen made their routine appearance the sight of the white robes was new to many of the blacks and they reacted loudly they inched forward screaming and jeering the troops surrounded the robes and protected them the kluxers were stunned and scared and did not yell back by eightthirty the streets of clanton were gridlocked deserted cars vans and buses were scattered haphazardly through parking lots and along the quiet residential streets a steady stream of blacks walked toward the square from all directions traffic did not move driveways were blocked merchants parked blocks away from their shops the mayor stood in the center of the gazebo wringing his hands and begging ozzie to do something around him thousands of blacks swarmed and yelled in perfect unison ozzie asked the mayor if he wanted him to start arresting everybody on the courthouse lawn noose parked at a service station a half mile south of the jail and walked with a group of blacks to the courthouse they watched him curiously but said nothing no one would suspect he was a person of authority buckley and musgrove parked in a driveway on adams street they cursed and walked toward the square they noticed the pile of rubble that had been jakes house but said nothing they were too busy cursing with state troopers leading the way the greyhound from temple reached the square at twenty minutes after nine through the dark windows the fourteen passengers stared in disbelief at the carnival around the courthouse mr pate called the packed courtroom to order and noose welcomed his jury he apologized for the trouble outside but there was nothing he could do if there were no problems to report they could continue deliberations very well you may retire to the jury room and get to work we will meet again just before lunch the jurors filed out and went to the jury room the hailey children sat with their father at the defense table the spectators now predominantly black remained seated and struck up conversations jake returned to his office foreman acker sat at the end of the long dusty table and thought of the hundreds perhaps thousands of ford countians who had served in this room and sat around this table and argued about justice over the past century any pride he may have felt for serving on the jury of the most famous case was greatly overshadowed by what happened last night he wondered how many of his predecessors had been threatened with death probably a few he decided the others fixed their coffee and slowly found seats around the tables the room brought back fond memories for clyde sisco prior jury duty had proved lucrative for him and he relished the thought of another handsome payoff for another just and true verdict his messenger had not contacted him how would yall like to proceed the foreman asked rita mae plunk had an especially hard and unforgiving look about her she was a rough woman with a house trailer no husband and two outlaws for sons both of whom had expressed hatred for carl lee hailey she had a few things she wanted to get off her large chest i got a few things i wanna say she informed acker fine why dont we start with you miss plunk and go around the table i voted guilty yesterday in the first vote and ill vote guilty next time i dont see how anybody could vote not guilty and i want just one of you to explain to me how you could vote in favor of this nigger dont say that word again yelled wanda womack ill say nigger if i wanna say nigger and there aint a damned thing you can do replied rita mae please dont use that word said frances mcgowan i find it personally offensive said wanda womack nigger nigger nigger nigger nigger nigger rita mae yelled across the table come on said clyde sisco oh boy said the foreman look miss plunk lets be honest okay most of us use that word from time to time im sure some of us use it more than others but its offensive to many people and i think itd be a good idea not to use it during our deliberations weve got enough to worry about as it is can we all agree not to use that word everyone nodded but rita mae sue williams decided to answer she was well dressed attractive about forty she worked for the county welfare department i didnt vote yesterday i passed but i tend to sympathize with mr hailey i have a daughter and if she was raped it would greatly affect my mental stability i can understand how a parent might crack in that situation and i think its unfair for us to judge mr hailey as if he was supposed to act completely rational you think he was legally insane asked reba betts an undecided im not sure but i know he wasnt stable he couldnt have been so you believe that nut of a doctor who testified for him asked rita mae yes he was as believable as the states doctor i liked his boots said clyde sisco no one laughed but hes a convict said rita mae he lied and tried to cover ft up you cant believe a word he said he had sex with a girl under eighteen clyde said if thats a crime then a bunch of us shouldve been indicted again no one appreciated the attempt at humor clyde decided to stay quiet for a while he later married the girl said donna lou peck an undecided they went around the table one at a time expressing opinions and answering questions the n word was carefully avoided by those wanting a conviction the battle lines became clearer most of the undecideds leaned toward guilty it seemed the careful planning by carl lee knowing the exact movements of the boys the mit all seemed so premeditated if he had caught them in the act and killed them on the spot he would not be held accountable but to plan it so carefully for six days did not indicate an insane mind wanda womack sue williams and clyde sisco leaned toward acquittalthe rest toward conviction barry acker was noticeably noncommittal agee unfurled a long blue and white free carl lee banner the ministers gathered fifteen abreast behind it and waited for the parade to form behind them they stood in the center of jackson street in front of the courthouse while agee screamed instructions to the masses thousands of blacks packed tightly behind them and off they went they inched down jackson and turned left on caffey up the west side of the square agee led the marchers in their now familiar battle cry of free carl lee free carl lee they screamed it in an endless repetitive numbing chorus as the crowd moved around the square it grew in number and volume smelling trouble the merchants locked up and headed for home and safety they checked their policies to see if they were insured for riot damage the green soldiers were lost in a sea of black the colonel sweating and nervous ordered his troops to circle the courthouse and stand firm while agee and the marchers were turning onto washington street ozzie met with the handful of kluxers in a sincere and diplomatic way he convinced them things could get out of hand and he could no longer guarantee their safety he acknowledged their right to assemble said they had made their point and asked them to get away from the square before there was trouble they huddled quickly and disappeared when the banner passed under the jury room all twelve gaped from the window the incessant chanting rattled the glass panes the bullhorn sounded like a loudspeaker hanging from the ceiling the jurors stared in disbelief at the mob the black mob which filled the street and trailed around the corner onto caffey a varied assortment of homemade signs bobbed above the masses and demanded that the man be freed i didnt know there were this many niggers in ford county rita mae plunk said at that moment the other eleven held the same thought buckley was furious he and musgrove watched from a thirdfloor window in the library the roar below had disrupted their quiet conversation i didnt know there were this many niggers in ford county musgrove said there aint somebody shipped these niggers in here i wonder who put them up to it probably brigance yeah probably so its mighty convenient that they start all this hellraising when the jury is deliberating there must be five thousand niggers down there at least noose and mr pate watched and listened from a secondfloor window in chambers his honor was not happy he worried about his jury i dont see how they can concentrate on much with all this going on pretty good timing aint it judge mr pate said it certainly is i didnt know we had that many blacks in the whole county it took twenty minutes for mr pate and jean gillespie to find the attorneys and bring the courtroom to order when it was quiet the jurors filed into their seats there were no smiles noose cleared his throat ladies and gentlemen it is time for lunch i dont suppose you have anything to report barry acker shook his head thats what i figured lets break for lunch until onethirty i realize you cannot leave the courthouse but i want you to eat for a while without working on the case i apologize for the disturbance outside but frankly i cant do anything about it well be in recess until onethirty in chambers buckley went wild this is crazy judge theres no way the jury can concentrate on this case with all that noise out there this is a deliberate effort to intimidate the jury i dont like it noose said it was planned judge its intentional buckley yelled it looks bad noose added im almost ready for a mistrial i wont grant one what do you say jake jake grinned for a moment and said free carl lee very funny buckley growled you probably planned all this no if you will recall mr buckley i tried to prevent it i have repeatedly asked for a change of venue i have repeatedly said the trial should not be held in this courthouse you wanted it here mr buckley and you kept it here judge noose you both now look foolish complaining jake was impressed with his arrogance buckley growled and stared out the window look at them wild niggers must be ten thousand out there during lunch the ten thousand grew to fifteen thousand cars from a hundred miles awaysome with tennessee platesparked on the shoulders of the highways outside the city limits the people hiked for two and three miles under a blistering sun to join the festivities around the courthouse agee broke for lunch and the square quieted the blacks were peaceful they opened their coolers and picnic baskets and shared with each other they congregated in the shade but there were not enough trees to go around they filled the courthouse in search of cold water and rest rooms they walked the sidewalks and gazed in the windows of the closed shops and stores fearing trouble from the horde the coffee shop and the tea shoppe closed during lunch outside of claudes they lined the sidewalk for a block and a half jake harry rex and lucien relaxed on the balcony and enjoyed the circus below a pitcher of fresh slushy margaritas sat on the table and slowly disappeared at times they participated in the rally yelling free carl lee or humming along with we shall overcome no one knew the words but lucien he had learned them during the glorious civil rights days of the sixties and still claimed to be the only white in ford county who knew all the words to every stanza he had even joined a black church back then he explained between drinks after his church voted to exclude black members he dropped out after a threehour sermon ruptured a disc he had decided white people were not cut out for that kind of worship he still contributed however occasionally a crew of tv people would stray near jakes office and serve up a question jake would pretend not to hear then finally yell free carl lee precisely at onethirty agee found his bullhorn unfurled his banner lined up the ministers and gathered his marchers he started with the hymn sung directly into the bullhorn and the parade crawled down jackson then onto caffey and around and around the square each lap attracted more people and made more noise the jury room was silent for fifteen minutes after reba betts was converted from an undecided to a not guilty if a man raped her she just might blow his head off if she got the chance it wasnow five to five with two undecideds and a compromise looked hopeless the foreman continued to straddle the fence poor old eula dell yates had cried one way then cried the other and everyone knew she would eventually go with the majority she had burst into tears at the window and was led to her seat by clyde sisco she wanted to go home said she felt like a prisoner the shouting and marching had taken its toll when the bullhorn passed nearby the anxiety level in the small room reached a frenzied peak acker would ask for quiet and they would wait impatiently until the racket faded to the front of the courthouse it never disappeared completely carol corman was the first to inquire about their safety for the first time in a week the quiet motel was awfully attractive three hours of nonstop chanting had unraveled whatever nerves were left the foreman suggested they talk about their families and wait until noose sent for them at five bernice toole a soft guilty suggested something they had all thought about but no one had mentioned why dont we just tell the judge we are hopelessly deadlocked hed declare a mistrial wouldnt he asked jo ann gates yes answered the foreman and he would be re tried in a few months why dont we call it a day and try again tomorrow they agreed they were not ready to quit eula dell cried softly at four carl lee and the kids walked to one of the tall windows lining each side of the courtroom he noticed a small knob he turned it and the windows swung open to a tiny platform hanging over the west lawn he nodded at a deputy and stepped outside he held tonya and watched the crowd they saw him they yelled his name and rushed to the building under him agee led the marchers off the street and across the lawn a wave of black humanity gathered under the small porch and pressed forward for a closer look at their champion free carl lee free carl lee free carl lee he waved at his fans below him he kissed his daughter and hugged his sons he waved and told the kids to wave jake and his small band of hombres used the diversion to stagger across the street to the courthouse jean gillespie had called noose wanted to see the lawyers in chambers he was disturbed buckley was raging i demand a mistrial i demand a mistrial he yelled at noose the second jake walked in you move for a mistrial governor you dont demand jake sard through glassy eyes you go to hell brigance you planned all this you plotted this insurrection those are your niggers out there wheres the court reporter jake asked i want this on the record gentlemen gentlemen noose said lets be professionals judge the state moves for a mistrial buckley said somewhat professionally overruled all right then the state moves to allow the jury to deliberate at someplace other than the courthouse now thats an interesting idea noose said i see no reason why they cant deliberate at the motel its quiet and few people know where it is buckley said confidently jake noose said nope it wont work there is no statutory provision giving you the authority to allow deliberations outside the courthouse jake reached in his pocket and found several folded papers he threw them on the desk state versus dubose case from linwood county the air conditioning in the linwood county courthouse quit during a heat wave the circuit judge allowed the jury to deliberate in a local library the defense objected jury convicted on appeal the supreme court ruled the judges decision was improper and an abuse of discretion the court went on to hold that the jury deliberations must take place in the jury room in the courthouse where the defendant is being tried you cant move them noose studied the case and handed it to musgrove get the courtroom ready he said to mr pate with the exception of the reporters the courtroom was solid black the jurors looked haggard and strained i take it you do not have a verdict noose said no sir replied the foreman let me ask you this without indicating any numerical division have you reached a point where you can go no further weve talked about that your honor and wed like to leave get a good nights rest and try again tomorrow were not ready to quit thats good to hear i apologize for the distractions but again theres nothing i can do im sorry youll just have to do your best anything further no sir very well well stand adjourned until nine am tomorrow carl lee pulled jakes shoulder what does all this mean it means theyre deadlocked it could be six to six or eleven to one against you or eleven to one for acquittal so dont get excited barry acker cornered the bailiff and handed him a folded sheet of paper it read luann pack the kids and go to your mothers dont tell anyone stay there until this thing is over just do as i say things are dangerous barry can you get this to my wife today our number is sure said the bailiff tim nunley mechanic down at the chevrolet place former client of jake brigance and coffee shop regular sat on a couch in the cabin deep in the woods and drank a beer he listened to his klan brothers as they got drunk and cursed niggers occasionally he cursed them too he had noticed whispering for the past two nights now and felt something was up he listened carefully he stood to get another beer suddenly they jumped him three of his comrades pinned him against the wall and pounded him with fists and feet he was beaten badly then gagged bound and dragged outside across the gravel road and into the field where he had been inducted as a member a cross was lit as he was tied to a pole and stripped a bullwhip lashed him until his shoulders back and legs were solid crimson two dozen of his exbrethren watched in mute horror as the pole and limp body were soaked with kerosene the leader the one with the bullwhip stood next to him for an eternity he pronounced the death sentence then threw a match mickey mouse had been silenced they packed their robes and belongings and left for home most would never return to ford county wednesday for the first time in weeks jake slept more than eight hours he had fallen asleep on the couch in his office and he awoke at five to the sounds of the military preparing for the worst he was rested but the nervous throbbing returned with the thought that this day would probably be the big day he showered and shaved downstairs and ripped open a new pack of fruit of the loom he had purchased at the drug store he dressed himself in stan atcavages finest navy allseason suit which was an inch too short and a bit loose but not a bad fit under the circumstances he thought of the rubble on adams street then carla and the knot in his stomach began to churn he ran for the newspapers on the front pages of the memphis jackson and tupelo papers were identical photos of carl lee standing on the small porch over the mob holding his daughter and waving to his people there was nothing about jakes house he was relieved and suddenly hungry dell hugged him like a lost child she removed her apron and sat next to him in a corner booth as the regulars arrived and saw him they stopped by and patted him on the back it was good to see him again they had missed him and they were for him he looked gaunt she said so he ordered most of the menu say jake are all those blacks gonna be back today asked bert west probably he said as he stabbed a chunk of pancakes i heard theys plannin to bring more folks this mornin said andy rennick ever nigger radio station in north mississippi is tellin folks to come to clanton great thought jake he added tabasco to his scrambled eggs can the jury hear all that yellin asked bert sure they can jake answered thats why theyre doing it theyre not deaf thats gotta scare them jake certainly hoped so hows the family dell asked quietly fine i guess i talked to carla every night she scared terrified what have they done to you lately nothing since sunday morning does carla know jake chewed and shook his head i didnt think so you poor thing ill be okay whats the talk in here we closed at lunch yesterday there were so many blacks outside and we were afraid of a riot well watch it close this morning and we may close again jake what if theres a conviction it could get hairy he stayed for an hour and answered their questions strangers arrived and jake excused himself there was nothing to do but wait he sat on the balcony drank coffee smoked a cigar and watched the guardsmen he thought of the clients he once had of a quiet little southern law office with a secretary and clients waiting to see him of docket calls and interviews at the jail of normal things like a family a home and church on sunday mornings he was not meant for the big time the first church bus arrived at seventhirty and was halted by the soldiers the doors flew open and an endless stream of blacks with lawn chairs and food baskets headed for the front lawn for an hour jake blew smoke into the heavy air and watched with great satisfaction as the square filled beyond capacity with noisy yet peaceful protestors the reverends were out in full force directing their people and assuring ozzie and the colonel they were nonviolent folk ozzie was convinced the colonel was nervous by nine the streets were crammed with demonstrators someone spotted the greyhound here they come agee screamed into the loudspeaker the mob pushed to the corner of jackson and quincy where the soldiers troopers and deputies formed a mobile barricade around the bus and walked it through the crowd to the rear of the courthouse eula dell yates cried openly clyde sisco sat next to the window and held her hand the others stared in fear as the bus inched around the square a heavily armed passageway was cleared from the bus to the courthouse and ozzie came aboard the situation was under control he assured them over the roar just follow him and walk as fast as possible the bailiff locked the door as they gathered around the coffeepot eula dell sat by herself in the corner crying softly and flinching as each free carl lee boomed from below i dont care what we do she said i really dont care but i just cant take any more of this i havent seen my family in eight days and now this madness i didnt sleep any last night she cried louder i think im close to a nervous breakdown lets just get outta here clyde handed her a kleenex and rubbed her shoulder jo ann gates was a soft guilty who was ready to crack i didnt sleep either last night i cant take another day like yesterday i wanna go home to my kids barry acker stood by the window and thought of the riot that would follow a guilty verdict there wouldnt be a building left downtown including the courthouse he doubted if anybody would protect the jurors in the aftermath of a wrong verdict they probably wouldnt make it back to the bus thankfully his wife and kids had fled to safety in arkansas i feel like a hostage said bernice toole a firm guilty that mob would storm the courthouse in a split second if we convict him i feel intimidated clyde handed her a box of kleenexes i dont care what we do eula dell whined in desperation lets just get outta here i honestly dont care if we convict him or cut him loose lets just do something my nerves cant take it wanda womack stood at the end of the table and nervously cleared her throat she asked for attention i have a proposal she said slowly that just might settle this thing the crying stopped and barry acker returned to his seat she had their complete attention i thought of something last night when i couldnt sleep and i want you to consider it it may be painful it may cause you to search your heart and take a long look at your soul but ill ask you to do it anyway and if each of you will be honest with yourself i think we can wrap this up before noon the only sounds came from the street below right now we are evenly divided give or take a vote we could tell judge noose that we are hopelessly deadlocked he would declare a mistrial and we would go home then in a few months this entire spectacle would be repeated mr hailey would be tried again in this same courtroom with the same judge but with a different jury a jury drawn from this county a jury of our friends husbands wives and parents the same kind of people who are now in this room that jury will be confronted with the same issues before us now and those people will not be any smarter than we are the time to decide this case is now it would be morally wrong to shirk our responsibilities and pass the buck to the next jury can we all agree on that they silently agreed good this is what i want you to do i want you to pretend with me for a moment i want you to use your imaginations i want you to close your eyes and listen to nothing but my voice they obediently closed their eyes anything was worth a try jake lay on the couch in his office and listened to lucien tell stories about his prestigious father and grandfather and their prestigious law firm and all the people they screwed out of money and land my inheritance was built by my promiscuous ancestors he yelled they screwed everybody they could harry rex laughed uncontrollably jake had heard the stories before but they were always funny and different what about ethels retarded son jake asked dont talk that way about my brother lucien protested hes the brightest one in the family sure hes my brother dad hired her when she was seventeen and believe it or not she looked good back then ethel twitry was the hottest thing in ford county my dad couldnt keep his hands off her sickening to think about now but its true its disgusting jake said she had a houseful of kids and two of them looked just like me especially the dunce it was very embarrassing back then what about your mother asked harry rex she was one of those dignified old southern ladies whose main concern was who had blue blood and who didnt theres not much blue blood around here so she spent most of her time in memphis trying to impress and be accepted by the cotton families i spent a good part of my childhood at the peabody hotel all starched out with a little red bow tie trying to act polished around the rich kids from memphis i hated it and i didnt care much for my mother either she knew about ethel but she accepted it she told the old man to be discreet and not embarrass the family he was discreet and i wound up with a retarded halfbrother when did she die six months before my father was killed in the plane crash howd she die asked harry rex gonorrhea caught it from the yard boy lucien seriously cancer carried it for three years but she was dignified to the very end whered you go wrong jake asked i think it started in the first grade my uncle owned the big plantation south of town and he owned several black families this was in the depression right i spent most of my childhood there because my father was too busy right here in this office and my mother was too busy with her hotteadrinkers clubs all of my playmates were black id been raised by black servants my best friend was willie ray wilbanks no kidding my greatgrandfather purchased his greatgrandfather and when the slaves were freed most of them just kept the family name what were they supposed to do thats why youve got so many black wilbankses around here we owned all the slaves in ford county and most of them became wilbankses youre probably kin to some jake said given the proclivities of my forefathers im probably kin to all of them the phone rang they froze and stared at it jake sat up and held his breath harry rex picked up the receiver then hung up wrong number he said they studied each other then smiled anyway back to the first grade jake said okay when it came time to start school willie ray and the rest of my little buddies got on the bus headed for the black school i jumped on the bus too and the driver very carefully took my hand and made me get off i cried and screamed and my uncle took me home and told my mother lucien got on the nigger school bus she was horrified and beat my little ass the old man beat me too but years later admitted it was funny so i went to the white school where i was always the little rich kid everybody hated the little rich kid especially in a poor town like clanton not that i was lovable to begin with but everyone got a kick out of hating me just because we had money thats why ive never thought much of money thats where the nonconformity started in the first grade i decided not to be like my mother because she frowned all the time and looked down on the world and my old man was always too busy to enjoy himself i said piss on it im gonna have some fun jake stretched and closed his eyes nervous lucien asked i just want it to be over the phone rang again and lucien grabbed it he listened then hung up what is it harry rex demanded jake sat up and glared at lucien the moment had arrived jean gillespie the jury is ready oh my god jake said as he rubbed his temples listen to me jake lucien lectured millions of people will see what is about to happen keep your cool be careful what you say what about me harry rex moaned i need to go vomit thats strange advice coming from you lucien jake said as he buttoned stans coat ive learned a lot show your class if you win watch what you say to the press be sure and thank the jury if you lose if you lose harry rex said run like hell because those niggers will storm the courthouse i feel weak jake admitted agee took the platform on the front steps and announced the jury was ready he asked for quiet and instantly the mob grew still they moved toward the front columns agee asked them to fall to their knees and pray they knelt obediently and prayed earnestly every man woman and child on the front lawn bowed before god and begged him to let their man go the soldiers stood bunched together and also prayed for an acquittal ozzie and moss junior seated the courtroom and lined deputies and reserves around the walls and down the aisle jake entered from the holding room and stared at carl lee at the defense table he glanced at the spectators many were praying many were biting their fingers gwen was wiping tears lester looked fearfully at jake the children were confused and scared noose assumed the bench and an electrified silence engulfed the courtroom there was no sound from the outside twenty thousand blacks knelt on the ground like muslims perfect stillness inside the courtroom and out i have been advised that the jury has reached a verdict is that correct mr bailiff very well we will soon seat the jury but before we do so i have some instructions i will not tolerate any outbursts or displays of emotion i will direct the sheriff to remove any person who creates a disturbance if need be i will clear the courtroom mr bailiff will you seat the jury the door opened and it seemed like an hour before eula dell yates appeared first with tears in her eyes jake dropped his head carl lee stared gamely at the portrait of robert e lee above noose they awkwardly filled the jury box they seemed jittery tense scared most had been crying jake felt sick barry acker held a piece of paper that attracted the attention of everyone ladies and gentlemen have you reached a verdict yes sir we have answered the foreman in a highpitched nervous voice hand it to the clerk please jean gillespie took it and handed it to his honor who studied it forever it is technically in order he finally said eula dell was flooding and her sniffles were the only sounds in the courtroom jo ann gates and bernice toole padded their eyes with handkerchiefs the crying could mean only one thing jake had vowed to ignore the jury before the verdict was read but it was impossible in his first criminal trial the jurors had smiled as they took their seats at that moment jake had become confident of an acquittal seconds later he learned that the smiles were because a criminal was about to be removed from the streets since that trial he had vowed never to look at the jurors but he always did it would be nice to see a wink or a thumbs up but that never happened noose looked at carl lee will the defendant please rise jake knew there were probably more terrifying requests known to the english tongue but to a criminal lawyer that request at that particular moment had horrible implications his client stood awkwardly pitifully jake closed his eyes and held his breath his hands shook and his stomach ached noose handed the verdict back to jean gillespie please read it madam clerk she unfolded it and faced the defendant as to each count of the indictment we the jury find the defendant not guilty by reason of insanity carl lee turned and bolted for the railing tonya and the boys sprang from the front pew and grabbed him the courtroom exploded in pandemonium gwen screamed and burst into tears she buried her head in lesters arms the reverends stood looked upward and shouted hallelujah and praise jesus and lord lord lord nooses admonition meant nothing he rapped the gavel halfheartedly and said order order order in the seemed content to allow a little celebration jake was numb lifeless paralyzed his only movement was a weak smile in the direction of the jury box his eyes watered and his lip quivered and he decided not to make a spectacle of himself he nodded at jean gillespie who was crying and just sat at the defense table nodding and trying to smile unable to do anything else from the corner of his eye he could see musgrove and buckley removing files legal pads and importantlooking papers and throwing it all into their briefcases be gracious he told himself a teenager darted between two deputies through the door and ran through the rotunda screaming not guilty not guilty he ran to a small balcony over the front steps and screamed to the masses below not guilty not guilty bedlam erupted order order in the court noose was saying when the delayed reaction from the outside came thundering through the windows order order in the courtroom he tolerated the excitement for another minute then asked the sheriff to restore order ozzie raised his hands and spoke the clapping hugging and praising died quickly carl lee released his children and returned to the defense table he sat close to his attorney and put his arm around him grinning and crying at the same time noose smiled at the defendant mr hailey you have been tried by a jury of your peers and found not guilty i do not recall any expert testimony that you are now dangerous or in need of further psychiatric treatment you are a free man his honor looked at the attorneys if there is nothing further this court will stand adjourned until august carl lee was smothered by his family and friends they hugged him hugged each other hugged jake they wept unashamedly and praised the lord they told jake they loved him the reporters pressed against the railing and began firing questions at jake he held up his hands and said he would have no comment but there would be a fullblown press conference in his office at pm buckley and musgrove left through a side door the jurors were locked in the jury room to await the last bus ride to the motel barry acker asked to speak to the sheriff ozzie met him in the hallway listened intently and promised to escort him home and provide protection around the clock the reporters assaulted carl lee i just wanna go home he said over and over i just wanna go home the celebration kicked into high gear on the front lawn there was singing dancing crying backslapping hugging thanksgiving congratulating outright laughing cheering chanting high fives low fives and soul brother shakes the heavens were praised in one glorious tumultuous irreverent jubilee they packed closer together in front of the courthouse and waited impatiently for their hero to emerge and bask in his much deserved adulation their patience grew thin after thirty minutes of screaming we want carl lee we want carl lee their man appeared at the door an earsplitting earthshaking roar greeted him he inched forward through the mass with his lawyer and family and stopped on the top step under the pillars where the plywood platform held a thousand microphones the whooping and yelling of twenty thousand voices was deafening he hugged his lawyer and they waved to the sea of screaming faces the shouting from the army of reporters was completely inaudible occasionally jake would stop waving and yell something about a press conference in his office at two carl lee hugged his wife and children and they waved the crowd roared its approval jake slid away and into the courthouse where he found lucien and harry rex waiting in a corner away from the mad rush of spectators lets get out of here jake yelled they pushed through the mob down the hall and out the rear door jake spotted a swarm of reporters on the sidewalk outside his office where are you parked he asked lucien he pointed to a side street and they disappeared behind the coffee shop sallie fried pork chops and green tomatoes and served them on the porch lucien produced a bottle of expensive cham rex ate with his fingers gnawing on the bones as if he hadnt seen food in a month jake played with his food and worked on the icecold champagne after two glasses he smiled into the distance he savored the moment you look silly as hell harry rex said with a mouthful of pork shut up harry rex lucien said let him enjoy his finest hour hes enjoying it look at that smirk what should i tell the press jake asked tell them you need some clients harry rex said clients will be no problem lucien said theyll line the sidewalks waiting for appointments why didnt you talk to the reporters in the courthouse they had their cameras running and everything i started to say something for them harry rex said im sure it wouldve been a gem lucien said ive got them at my fingertips jake said theyre not going anywhere we could sell tickets to the press conference and make a fortune can i sit and watch please jake please harry rex said they argued over whether they should take the antique bronco or the nasty little porsche jake said he was not driving harry rex cursed the loudest and they loaded into the bronco lucien found a spot in the rear seat jake rode shotgun and gave instructions they hit the back streets and missed most of the traffic from the square the highway was crowded and jake directed his driver through a myriad of gravel roads they found blacktop and harry rex raced away in the direction of the lake i have one question lucien jake said what and i want a straight answer what did you cut a deal with sisco no my boy you won it on your own do you swear i swear to god on a stack of bibles jake wanted to believe him so he dropped it they rode in silence in the sweltering heat and listened as harry rex sang along with the stereo suddenly jake pointed and yelled harry rex slammed on the brakes made a wild left turn and sped down another gravel road where are we going lucien demanded just hang on jake said as he looked at a row of houses approaching on the right he pointed to the second one and harry rex pulled into the driveway and parked under a shade tree jake got out looked around the front yard and walked onto the porch he knocked on the screen door a man appeared a stranger yeah whatta you want im jake brigance and the door flew open and the man rushed onto the porch and grabbed jakes hand nice to meet you jake im mack loyd crowell i was on the grand jury that almost didnt indict you done a

her right foot to a tree and her left foot to a fence post that they raped her repeatedly and cussed her because she was white she told them to picture the little girl layin there beggin for her daddy while they kicked her in the mouth and knocked out her teeth broke both jaws broke her nose she said to imagine two drunk blacks pouring beer on her and pissing in her face and laughing like idiots and then she told them to imagine that the little girl belonged to them their daughter she told them to be honest with themselves and to write on a piece of paper whether or not they would kill those black bastards if they got the chance and they voted by secret ballot all twelve said they would do the killing the foreman counted the votes twelve to zero wanda said shed sit in that jury room until

her so bad she finally caved in it was rough in there jake jake listened to every word without breathing he heard a noise wanda womack walked to the screen door she smiled at him and began crying he stared at her through the screen but could not talk he bit his lip and nodded thanks he managed weakly she wiped her eyes and nodded on craft road a hundred cars lined both shoulders east and west of the hailey driveway the long front yard was packed with vehicles children playing and parents sitting under shade trees and on car hoods harry rex parked in a ditch by the mailbox a crowd rushed to greet carl lees lawyer lester grabbed him and said you done it again you done it again they shook hands and slapped backs across the yard and up to the porch agee hugged him and praised god carl lee left the swing and walked down the steps followed by his family and admirers they gathered around jake as the two great men came face to face they clutched hands and smiled at each other both searching for words they embraced the crowd clapped and shouted thank you jake carl lee said softly the lawyer and client sat in the swing and answered questions about the trial lucien and harry rex joined lester and some of his friends under a shade tree for a little drink tonya ran and jumped around the yard with a hundred other kids at twothirty jake sat at his desk and talked to carla harry rex and lucien drank the last of the margaritas and quickly got drunk jake drank coffee and told his wife he would leave memphis in three hours and be in north carolina by ten yes he was fine he said
