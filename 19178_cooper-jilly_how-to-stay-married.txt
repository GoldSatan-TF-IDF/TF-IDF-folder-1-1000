jilly cooper how to stay married to leo introduction to revised edition more than forty years ago i dined next to godfrey smith the gloriously convivial editor of the sunday times colour magazine and regaled him with tales about the screaming domestic chaos of my first months of marriage i explained that because we made love all night and i spent all day except for a scurrying shopping lunch at the office then rushed home to wash iron clean the flat cook and eat supper make love all night go to the office a pattern that was repeated until one died of exhaustion and our flat was so dirty i found a fungus growing under the sink on one occasion i told godfrey my red silk scarf strayed into the washing machine at the launderette so my husband leos shirts came out streaked like the dawn and he claimed he was the only member of the rugger fifteen with a rosepink jockstrap our attempts at diy were just as disastrous as we stripped off the damp course in the drawing room then found wed papered our cat to the wall like the canterville ghost godfrey laughed a lot and commissioned a piece called a young wifes tale which appeared in the sunday times colour mag my poor mother was subsequently besieged by telephone calls from her friends darling whats a jockstrap shortly after i had the miraculous break of a column in the sunday times which lasted thirteen and a half years at the same time a publishing friend asked me to write a little book called how to stay married i was so unbelievably flattered that even though id only been married seven years i said yes and was soon merrily laying down the law on everything from sex on the honeymoon to setting up house from inlaws to infidelity with a deadline of three months however as well as my new weekly column to write a sixmonthold baby to look after and a newish house in fulham to try to run my poor neglected leo got very short shrift and grumbled the book should be called how to get divorced he was in fact a huge help with the writing and as can be seen by his photograph on the jacket was the handsome hero of the book which amazingly was published on time in october and even received some kind reviews fortytwo years later when i blithely suggested reprinting how to stay married to coincide with our approaching golden wedding my gallant publishers to whom i have been happily hitched for almost as long suggested i write a new foreword or backward from a fiftyyear perspective this entailed rereading how to stay married for the first time since it was published whereupon i nearly died of horror what a smug opinionated proselytising little knowall i was then for a start i announced sternly that men detested seeing women slaving in the house so their wives must arrange to work from am to pm so they could rush home and clean iron and cook before their husband returned if you amuse a man in bed i went on hes not likely to bother about the mountain of dust underneath it or even more hubristically be unlikely to stray how could i have insisted that a woman should be grateful her husband wants her and suggested that if a wife refuses her husband sex then she has only herself to blame if hes unfaithful ouch ouch amending this bit is one of the only changes i have made to the text more shamingly i have never practised what i preached advocating total honesty about money being essential in marriage and that couples should always know what the other is spending and that from a wife who regularly smuggled new clothes into her wardrobe ripping off the price tag lying this old thing no wife has the right to go to seed i thundered when i myself become a positive hayfield when im trying to finish a book not washing my hair for days hairy ankles sprouting out from ragged tracksuit bottoms yet not a word did i add urging husbands to exert selfcontrol to avoid a beer belly back in of course men were expected to be masterful if a man is married to a slut i pronounced fiercely he must remonstrate with her adding that women like a firm hand theyd probably prefer a farm hand observed leo when he read that bit my recommendations were all so dogmatic one moment i was warning wives at the pain of divorce not to run out of toothpaste or loo paper the next telling them how to detect if their husband was having an affair if you both come home from work and the cat isnt hungry there was hardly anything about wives pursuing a career if she needed a little money i suggested why not make paper flowers or frame pictures oh dear oh dear in mitigation i suppose i was writing in a different age when womens lib had hardly been heard of no one had dreamed up new men or paternity leave and twocareer marriages were a rarity particularly if the couple had children my own youthful ambition had been to marry a man id fallen madly in love with whod whisk me away from the squalor of the typing pool my role model was my beautiful mother who looked after my father and us children so well because she never went out to work my father the breadwinner because he called the shots was surreptitiously nicknamed monsieur bossy by my brother and me and yet despite the arrogance and the bossiness i think there is good sense in much of how to stay married what i wonder is the secret of a good marriage separate towns if you both snore goes the old joke separate razors certainly today probably separate remote controls my secret was to marry a really sweet man who as i said back in had been married before thus after a cataclysmic row when i was tearfully packing my bags he would reassure me that such tempests were normal in marriage and would blow over then he would make me laugh by saying we mustnt let michael our black cat be the victim of a broken home throughout our marriage hes constantly been funny what does jilly wear in bed asked one journalist to which leo replied dogs mostly and that when he reached over in the night for something furry he would often get bitten marriage ive always believed is kept alive by bedsprings creaking as much from helpless laughter as from sex on our honeymoon we passed a large sign saying bear left for norwich and had this vision of some purposeful grizzly setting out on his travels soon the bear had spawned a whole family of other imaginary bears about whom we made up silly private jokes and talked through them as we always talk through our animals you love that dog more than me leo will say i dont i dont hes just nicer to me sometimes when we had been married forty years in although reeling from the hammer blow of leo being diagnosed with parkinsons disease we celebrated our ruby wedding with a very jolly party in a speech displaying far more humility than i ever did in how to stay married i compared marriage to two people rowing across a vast ocean in a tiny boat sometimes revelling in blue skies and lovely sunsets sometimes rocked by storms so violent wed nearly capsized but somehow wed battled on so many people gave us red or crimson roses that we made a special ruby wedding flower bed in our garden ten years later as our golden wedding draws near the roses are blooming if a little battered and the bed is invaded by wild flowers happily including speedwell we have now reached a stage in our marriage when we worry much less about screwing than unscrewing the top on the sancerre bottle or the glucosamine pills we are utterly defeated by technology but one of the plusses of six gorgeous grandchildren is they can turn on the dvd use google send emails change channels on wireless and television and record programmes for us several hours a day are spent searching for credit cards paper knives and spectacles or a glass of wine left in an alcove in another room the other day we spent an acrimonious halfhour missing downton abbey as we searched frantically for the remote control only to find leo was sitting on it having never mastered the metric system i am utterly defeated by grams in cookery last week as his red pair of cords plummeted to the floor leo announced hed lost ten kilometres in weight invitations and letters disappear in chuckedaway newspapers so people roll up unexpectedly for drinks or even dinner you never told me they were coming i did i did but you never listen but though domestic chaos is come again i still believe that a happy marriage is the best thing life has to offer cemented as much by the moments of irritation as of tenderness for everyone particularly children claimed cecil king in the essential basis for security and happiness is a loving home to counteract this hideous recently released statistics reveal that per cent of children today can expect their parents to split up by the time they are sixteen more tellingly a vast per cent of these splits happen to unmarried couples marriage for all its limitations makes people try harder children above all long for their parents to stay together when a teacher asked one little girl to define love she wistfully replied daddy and mummy getting married so i hope despite some arrogance and smugness that by charting the very real joys as well as the pitfalls and panic stations of our early years together i may reassure and encourage more couples married unmarried gay and straight to stay together more happily god speed and good luck jilly cooper introduction it is extremely easy to get married it costs s and takes two days to get a licence it is much harder to stay married my only qualifications for writing a book on the subject are that i have had the example of parents who have lived in harmony for nearly forty years and i myself am still married extremely happily after eight years in eight years of course weve had marvellous patches and patches so bad that they rocked our marriage to its foundations but ive come to realise that if you can cling on like a barnacle during the bad patches your marriage will survive and in all probability be strengthened anyone elses marriage is a dark unexplored continent and although i have observed far too many of my friends going swiftly in and out of wedlock i can only guess at what it was that broke the marriage up since the word got around that i was writing this book my task has been made doubly difficult by the fact that married couples either sidled away or started behaving ostentatiously well whenever i came into the room one of the great comforts of my own marriage however has been that my husband was married before knew the ropes and during any really black period when i was all for opting out and packing my bags would reassure me that such black periods were to be expected in marriage and it had been far worse for him the first time round similarly i hope that by pointing out some of the disasters and problems that beset us and how we weathered them it may reassure other people either married or contemplating marriage here comes the bride the wedding this is blast off the day you or rather your mother have been waiting for all your life itll pass in a dream and afterwards you wont remember a thing about it it helps however if you both turn up dope yourself with tranquillisers by all means but watch the champagne later drugs mixed with drink often put you out like a light and dont forget to take the price tags off your new shoes theyll show when you kneel down in church brides dont be disappointed if you dont look your best far more likely youll be scarlet in the face and piggyeyed from lack of sleep bride not looking her best bridegrooms remember to look round and smile as your bride comes up the aisle shell be too busy coping with her bouquet and veil to notice but it will impress those armies of guests lined up on either side of the church groom smiling at bride coming down the aisles more tricky you never know where to look that radiant smile can easily set into a rictus grin and theres bound to be one guest you know too well whose eye you want to avoid like tallulah bankheads remark about one couple coming down the aisle ive had them both and they were lousy if you look solemn people will think youre having second thoughts best policy is to settle for a cool smirk with your eyes on the door of the church be careful what hymns you choose people like a good bellow at a wedding so dont choose anything obscure equally be careful of hymns with double meanings like jesu the very thought of thee which will make everyone giggle and spoil the dignity and repose of the occasion the reception first theres the lineup and youll get so tired of shaking hands trying to remember faces and gushing like an oil well youll begin to have a real sympathy with the royal family dont worry when you circulate among the guests afterwards if none of them will speak to you theyll all feel youre far too important to waste time talking to them and youll wander round like a couple of wraiths if you must make speeches keep them short thank everyone in sight and tell one stunning joke to convince your inlaws you do have a sense of humour after all never let the best man either speak or read the telegrams unless hes very funny dont flirt with exes one girl i know whose husband spent the reception playing do you remember with an old girlfriend refused to go on the honeymoon try not to get drunk you may feel like it but it will cause recriminations later the honeymoon originally the honeymoon was intended for husbands to initiate their innocent young brides into the delights and mysteries of sex today when most couples have slept together anyway and are already bankrupted by the cost of setting up a house the whole thing seems a bit of a farce and a needless expense you probably both need a holiday however when you arrive at your destination youre likely to feel a sense of anticlimax youre exhausted and suffering from postchampagne depression a real killer for months youve been coping with squabbles with the caterers bridesmaids tantrums over their headdresses parcels arriving every day the hall littered with packing straw writers cramp from answering letters traumas with the dressmakers every moments been occupied youre wound up like a clock and suddenly its all over and youve nothing to do for a fortnight except each other for the wife in particular everythings suddenly new and unfamiliar her spongebag and flannel new pigskin luggage a whole trousseau of new clothes dazzling white underwear instead of the usual dirty grey even her name is new the thing to remember is that your wifehusband is probably as nervous and in need of reassurance as you are like the wild beast surprised in the jungle whos always supposed to be more frightened than oneself saboteurs the first thing to do on arrival at your honeymoon hotel is to search the bedroom for signs of sabotage jokey wedding guests may well have instructed the hotel staff to make you an apple pie bed or wire up the springs of the bed to the hotel fire alarm one couple i know reached their hotel to be confronted by the manager waving a telegram from one such joker saying my wife has just run off with my best friend i believe they are booked into your hotel under the assumed name of mr and mrs so and so could you refuse to let them have the booked room until i arrive whether youre heading for the bahamas or billericay the best way to scotch honeymoon saboteurs is not to be coy about your destination simply tell everyone youre staying at the grand and then book rooms at the majestic then theres the problem of getting used to living together here again the wife in particular will be worried about keeping up appearances before marriage shes relied on mud packs and rollers and skinfood at night but now her husbands going to be with her every moment of the day and the mysterys going to be ruined whens she going to find time to shave her legs and shes always told her husband shes a natural blonde and suddenly hes going to find the homebleacher in her suitcase shell soon get used to it all just as shell get used to sitting on the loo and gossiping to her husband while hes having a bath or to wandering around with nothing on instead of discreetly changing in the bathroom if shes ashamed of her small breasts and mottled thighs hes probably equally selfconscious about his narrow shoulders and hairless chest if shes ashamed first thing in the morning if youre worried you look like a road accident in the mornings sleep with the curtains drawn and if youre scared your mouth will taste like a parrots cage when he bends over to kiss you pretend youre going to the loo and nip out and clean your teeth dont panic if you get bored or have a row or feel claustrophobic or homesick these are all part of growingtogether pains they wont establish a behaviour pattern for the next fifty years a vital honeymoon ploy is to go somewhere where there is plenty to do its not sacrilege to go to the cinema or watch a soccer match or even look up friends in the district take lots of books and sleeping pills dont panic if you get on each others nerves my mother whos been happily married to my father for over thirty years nearly left him on honeymoon because he got a line of doggerel on his mind and repeated it over and over again as they motored through the cornfields of france we drove round norfolk on our honeymoon and i nearly sent my husband insane by exclaiming how lovely every time we passed a village church sex im not going into the intricacies of sexual initiation there are numerous books on the subject i would just plead for both parties to be patient tolerant appreciative and understanding temporary frigidity and impotence are not infrequent occurrences on honeymoon and not to be taken too seriously take things slowly youve probably got a lifetime in front of you all that matters at this stage is to get across strongly that you love each other and youre not sorry you are married dont worry if unlike the girl in the carpetbaggers who wanted to see nothing but ceilings on her honeymoon you dont feel like leaping on each other all the time as ive already pointed out youre probably exhausted and in no condition for a sexual marathon do take a red towel if youre a virgin or likely to have the curse it saves embarrassment over the sheets even if youve been sleeping together for ages beforehand and sex was stunning dont worry if it goes off for a bit or feel convinced that it can only work in a clandestine setting you havent been married before and may just be having initial panic because the stable door is well and truly bolted one friend told me he was woken up in the middle of most nights of his honeymoon by his wife staggering groggily out of bed groping for her clothes and muttering she must get home before her parents woke up eases tensions its a good idea to borrow someones cottage in the country for a honeymoon its cheaper than a hotel and you wont be worried by the imagined chortlings of chambermaids and hallporters and you can cook if you get bored dont worry if heshe doesnt gaze into your eyes all the time and quote poetry most people dont know enough poetry to last more than a quarter of an hour a certain amount of alcohol is an excellent idea it eases tension breaks down inhibitions take the case of the girl in our office who on her arrival with her new husband at the hotel was presented with a bottle of champagne it was wonderful she told us we shared a glass each night and made the bottle last the whole fortnight wedding presents get your thankyou letters written before the wedding once the prewedding momentum has been lost youll never get down to them dont beef too much about the presents your partners family or friends have given you even if they are ghastly no one likes to be reminded that they are related to or acquainted with people of execrable taste try and keep a list of who gave you what so you can bring those cake forks out of hiding when aunt agatha comes to tea and you wont as we did give a particularly hideous vase back to the woman who gave it to us when later she got married setting up house moving in at best a nightmare as dorothy parker said the one dependable law of life is that everything is always worse than you thought it was going to be when my parents moved into their first house they arrived to find the electricians had all the floor boards up the paint was wet in the kitchen and there was an enormous pile of rubble in the garage surmounted by a onehorned oneeyed stag try therefore to get all major structural alterations done beforehand nothing is more depressing than trying to get a place straight with builders trooping in and out with muddy feet and demands for endless cups of tea even the smallest job will seem as though theyre building the pyramids try to get shelves up beforehand removal men unpack at a fantastic rate and youll soon find every inch of floor space covered and nowhere to put anything dont forget to get the gas and electricity connected buy plenty of light bulbs make a plan where everything is going or youll end up with the grand piano in the lavatory the fridge in the bedroom and two little removal men buckling under the sideboard while you have a ferocious argument where to put it get some food in youll be so busy you wont realise its past and the shops are shut and youll be so bankrupted tipping the removal men and rushing out to buy picture wire screws and plugs you wont have any money left to go out to dinner a bottle of whisky is an excellent soother of nerves but dont let the removal men get their hands on it or youll have all your furniture chipped a friend who had two particularly surly removal men made them a cup of tea and slipped two amphetamines into each mug after that she had one of the jolliest moves imaginable how much to tip about s a head if youre feeling affluent do measure the height of the rooms before you go out and buy furniture in a sale we had a tallboy standing in the street for weeks because we couldnt get it through any of the doors if possible one of you should take a week off work even if it is unpaid to get things straight nothing is more demoralising than coming home late for the next month to face the chaos try to get the kitchen and one other room habitable then you can shut yourselves away from the debris when it becomes too much for you doityourself one of the great myths of marriage heavily fostered by television commercials of smiling young couples up ladders is that home decorating is fun when you do it together it isnt its paralysingly boring and caused more rows in our marriage than anything else just remember that like having a brace on your teeth as a child its worth it later on invariably one partner is more hamfisted than the other and the trouble starts when the more dexterous one becomes irritated and starts bossing poor hamfisted about hamfisted gets more and more sulky until a row breaks out my husband is a great deal more adept than i am at decorating but even so it was always a case of wreckityourself our first attempts at wallpapering outcrazied the crazy gang we lost our tempers the measure and the scissors i had bought enough paper to do two rooms wildly expensive at eight guineas a roll but we had to scrap so much we only managed three quarters of one room finally when we stood back to admire our wrinkled uneven labours we found we had papered the cat to the wall like the canterville ghost our wrinkled uneven labour a few points to remember buy cheap wallpaper for your first attempts when you strip wallpaper and come to a layer of silver paper leave it alone or youll find youve stripped off the damp course and any paper subsequently put on the wall will turn green painting do remember to put dust sheets down when youre painting or youll get shortsighted aunts commenting on the attractive speckled border round the walls if youre doing the landing and the hall dont as we did start painting the landing scarlet and the hall indigo it never entered our heads that the colours would have to meet somewhere in this case halfway up the stairs the result is horrible go to a showroom where you can see the paint you choose in large quantities that colour that looks so subtle on the shade card can spread to vast deserts of ghastliness once it gets up on the wall dont mix paints unless youre an expert they always come out sickly icecream shades never get friends to help even your own pathetic attempts will be better than theirs we let a girlfriend who claimed she found painting therapeutic loose on one of the spare rooms when we looked in a quarter of an hour later there were terracotta flames of paint licking a foot high over the virgin white ceiling i had painted the day before none of our cries of steady on or i say could halt her the whole room had to be painted again tell your wife before you paint a shelf or shell bustle in five minutes later and replace everything you removed you are bound to have a row about who didnt wash the brushes last time if you run out of paint do remember the name and brand before you chuck the tin away we had to buy five different shades of orange before we hit on the right one again lots of praise is essential say well done even if it isnt people get inordinately proud of the four square foot of wall theyve just painted miscellaneous curtains were another disaster zone in an attempt to make them not too short i made them miles too long so they trailed on the floor like a child dressing up in its mothers clothes and of course there wasnt enough material left over for the pelmets dont be fooled by doityourself tiling kits theyre easy enough until you have to round a corner or meet a natural hazard like a light switch traditional role of husband and wife traditionally the husband is the more practical and mechanically minded member of the partnership but if hes the kind who hits the electricity main every time he knocks a nail in and puts up shelves at and his wife is the practical type who got a distinction for carpentry at school she shouldnt hesitate to take over as my husband remarked here was one sphere in which he wouldnt have minded having his masculinity undermined running the house housekeeping a major problem for the newly married wife particularly if she is holding down a ninetofive job before she was married she blued her wages on clothes and took her washing home to mother every weekend now suddenly she must be housekeeper cook hostess laundress seamstress beguiling companion glamour girl assistant breadwinner and willing bedfellow all in one what she must remember when she gets home exhausted from the office to be faced with a mountain of washing up in the sink the dinner to be cooked the bed to be made the flat to be cleaned a pile of shirts to be ironed and her husband in a playful mood is that where marriage is concerned cheerfulness sexual enthusiasm and good cooking are far nearer to godliness than cleanliness about the house as long as the flat is kept tidy men hate living in a muddle meals are regular and their wives are in good spirits husbands wont notice a few cobwebs if you amuse a man in bed hes not likely to bother about the mountain of dust underneath it resentment if a wife feels resentful that she is slaving away while her husband comes home and flops down in front of the television until dinner is ready she must remember that it isnt all roses for him either he has given up his much prized bachelor status for marriage and he probably expects like his father before him to come home every night to a gleaming home a happy wife and a delicious dinner instead he finds a tearful fractious shrew and he forgets that his mother looked after his father so well because she didnt have to go out to work tolerance tolerance is essential on both sides if the wife is working the husband must be prepared to give her a hand equally its up to the wife to ask when she needs help and not scurry round with set face like someone out of foxes book of martyrs as men hate seeing their wives slaving one of the solutions is for the wife to get her housework done when her husband isnt around that housekeeping whizzkid mrs beeton suggests getting up early and i managed to persuade most of my employers to let me work from eightthirty to fourthirty eightthirty sounds horrendous but once youre used to it its much the same as ninethirty you miss the rushhour traffic both ways you have a nice quiet hour in the office before anyone else gets in to ring your mother or make a shopping list no one knows whether you got in exactly at eightthirty anyway and you get home at least an hour before your husband so you have time to get the dinner on tidy up and welcome him home another solution is to encourage your husband to have at least one night out a week with the boys then you have a few hours to catch up daily women or you can employ a daily woman if you get a good one hang on to her shes worth her weight in bullion generally alas dailies start off marvellously and then after a few weeks the standard goes down and so does the level of the gin my husband came home once and found ours asleep in our bed with the electric blanket and the wireless on asleep in our bed if i have a good daily i find i spend far more time than before tidying up before she comes and if i get a bad one i spend hours tidying up after her so my husband wont grumble about throwing money away and force me to sack her dailies also have an irritating habit of not turning up the day your motherinlaw is coming to stay or the time youre relying on them to tidy up before a large dinner party but to return to housework remember that the dust you flick away today will have drifted back into place tomorrow once when i was rabbitting on about the dirtiness of my house a girlfriend whose house is none too clean either told me i was suffering from the bourgeois syndrome namely obsessive worrying over spit and polish it worked like a charm i didnt do any housework for at least a fortnight a few quick pointers have lots of cushions to hide things under when guests arrive and plump them a great deal the woman who has the tidiest house in london has huge arm muscles from plumping huge arm muscles closing untidy desks straightening papers putting books back vertically instead of horizontally and records back in their sleeves picking things off the floor all make a room look better quicker than dusting or hoovering empty ashtrays clear dirty glasses into the kitchen open windows at night or the place will smell like a bar parlour in the morning get a decent hoover or youll be like a girlfriend who grumbled to her husband that she was quite exhausted from hoovering all day he looked around and said i wish youd do some hoovering in our house instead then dont hoover under his feet its grounds for divorce if your kitchen is a pigsty dont have a glass door or a hatch through which inquisitive guests can peer dont use all the dusters for polishing silver or shoes of youll have to hare round before dinner parties dusting furniture with the front of your dress like i do laundry if you can possibly afford it during the first six months send your husbands shirts to the laundry one of the things that nearly broke my back when i was first married was washing and ironing seven shirts a week do encourage your husband to buy dark shirts for the office so he can wear them for at least two days if you wash at home dont as i always do put in far too much soap powder and spend the next two hours rinsing if you wash at the launderette remember to put your halfcrown into the machine or youll come back forty minutes later to find your clothes still unwashed be careful not to put anything that runs into the machine when we were first married i left in a red silk handkerchief my husbands shirts came out streaked like the dawn he wore cyclamen underpants for weeks and claimed he was the only member of his rugger fifteen with a rose pink jockstrap if you have a spin dryer remember to put a bowl under the waste pipe or youll have the kitchen awash every time drying is a problem in a small flat one of the most useful presents we had was a hawkins hidri cost about which will dry all your washing in about six hours and can be folded away afterwards husbands are not amused by singe marks they can be removed with peroxide and in an emergency use talcum powder always put ironing away when youve finished either the cat is bound to come and sit on it or it looks so badly ironed it gets mistaken for dirty laundry and washed again the ideal of course is to send everything to the laundry unfortunately our laundry is notorious for not getting things back on time weve got very used to the rough male kiss of blankets and for losing things cleaning try to keep all cleaning tickets in one place we always lose them and at this moment half our wardrobe is sitting in various cleaners all over london soon no doubt to be sold secondhand food i got the sack from my first job after i was married because i spent all morning on the telephone apologising to my husband for the row wed had on the bus and all afternoon reading recipe books cooking well and cooking cheaply is a major problem for the young wife before she was married she probably invited her fiancé to dinner from time to time and blued half her wages on double cream and brandy to go with the fillet steak and the shellfish so that he is under the illusion that she is a marvellous cook now she is married she will find cooking exciting meals every evening and not overtaxing her imagination and the family budget extremely difficult dont however be seduced into buying things that are cheap if they repel you i once bought a black pudding because i was told it was inexpensive and nourishing it lay like a long black slug in the fridge for three weeks finally turned green died and was committed to the dustbin ring the changes however much he raves over your fish pie he wont want it twice a week for the next fifty years buy in bulk if you and your husband have selfcontrol we find bulk buying never does anything but increase our bulk the joint that is bought on saturday never graduates into cold meat and later shepherds pie it is always wolfed in one sitting once we made a big casserole to last a week it took eight hours to cook stank the whole block of flats out and went bad the following day buy in bulk leave longcooking dishes to the weekend nothing irks a man more than having to wait until midnight to eat do take the stew off the gas before you start making love never hide things you wont remember where you put them i hid some potted shrimps once and discovered them a month later after wed had the floor boards up husbands if you find a half bottle of wine in the kitchen check before you drink it your wife may be saving it for cooking some exotic dish dont be bossy in the kitchen nothing irritates a woman more than to be told to add some more paprika or that your mother always made it with real mashed potato money honesty about money is absolutely essential in marriage if you are to avoid major rows you must know how much money youve got in the bank and how much each of you is spending in theory all bills should be kept together and paid at the end of each month weekly accounts should be kept and the financial situation should be reviewed every month in practice we never did any of these things we both got married with overdrafts well into three figures having lived at home i had no idea of the cost of living and between us we were earning far less than a year we ricocheted from one financial crisis to another economising is particularly hard when youre first married for there are so many things to do to the house and if the wife is determined to impress the husband with her cooking its cream and wine in everything we used to have absurd economy campaigns drinking tea instead of coffee for breakfast driving miles to find a garage which sold cheaper petrol turning out the lights and creeping round in the dark to save electricity smoking less which meant we ate more eating less which meant we smoked more we did evolve a splendid billpaying evasion technique we never paid a thing until we got a solicitors letter then we would send the creditor a cheque unsigned so they would spend another week returning it whereupon it would be returned in successive weeks with the date left off the wrong year or the numbers and letters differing another ruse was to ring up when the final reminder turned up and say in aggrieved tones but ive already paid it and theyll spend at least a month trying to trace it with electricity gas and telephone you can always write and query the amount saying youve been away for the last month and you cant think why the bill is so high perhaps the best method is to keep sending the bill back with not known here written across it i tried once to keep accounts and in the third week when i was making great efforts to economise i saw to my horror that the expenditure had doubled i went sobbing to my husband who pointed out quite kindly that id added the date in try to pay the rates by the month and why not investigate a household budget account with your bank manager it considerably simplifies billpaying another minor money problem is that one always assumes that ones partner will have some money on him and he never has so you find you have to jump off buses because neither of you can pay the fare or walk home five miles from parties in the middle of the night because you cant afford a taxi remember that each partner is bound to think the other one is extravagant and that everyone always thinks he is broke however rich he is as one friend said the other day were just as poor as when we were first married but on a grander scale shopping shop early in the morning when theres more choice and midweek when things are cheaper always make a list or youll have the absurd situation of trailing miles to soho market in your lunch hour then buying all the things youve forgotten on the way home at fortnums dont let men go near the shops theyll blue the weeks housekeeping on salmon and rump steak and come home very smug because theyve shopped so much more quickly than you would have done take things out of your shopping bag and put them away at once or youll have frozen raspberries melting on to the drawing room carpet and liver blood permanently on your cheque book despite the maxim if you can get it on tick its free if you can pay by cheque its almost free but if you have to pay cash its bloody expensive pay cash if you can our biggest shopping bill is always drink because we can chalk it up at the offlicence round the corner be tolerant of each others extravagances everyone lapses from time to time one of the nicest things about my husband is that he never grumbles about my buying a new dress unless he thinks it is ugly tidiness and untidiness if the husband is married to a real slut who constantly keeps the house in a mess and serves up vile food he has every right to complain theres a happy medium between being a doormat and a bully rather than work yourself into a frenzy of resentment first try to tease your wife out of her sloppiness and if that doesnt work risk a scene by telling her it just isnt good enough a firm hand women on the whole quite like a firm hand and one of the saddest things a wife ever said to me was it was only on the day he left me that he told me for the first time that i was a lousy cook i turned the place into a pigsty i never ironed his shirts and left mustard under the plates men like a place they can relax in and if the wife is the tidy one she shouldnt nag and fuss her husband the moment he gets home i cant stand it any longer said one newly married husband shes taken all my books and put them in drawers like my shirts among some of the best marriages my tame psychiatrist told me are those in which although the husband and wife started at relatively distant poles of neatness and sloppiness they moved towards a common middle ground through love understanding and willingness to understand each others needs if theres one thing i cant stand changing people you shouldnt go into marriage expecting to change people once a bumbler always a bumbler once a rake always a rake a gay eye isnt likely to be doused by marriage once a slut although she may make heroic and semisuccessful attempts to improve always a slut when we were first married my husband used to dream of the day i stopped work like the three sisters yearning for moscow the house will be tidy we shall make love every morning and at last i shall be given breakfast well i stopped work and chaos reigned very much as usual its a case of plus ça change im afraid your only hope is that by making people happier and more secure they may realise the potential inside them and develop into brilliant businessmen marvellous lovers superb cooks or alas even bores and remember the wife who nags her husband on to making a fortune wont see nearly so much of him hell be in the office from morn until night she cant have it both ways differing tastes certain things are bound to grate he may have a passion for flying ducks and peter scott and she may go a bundle on coloured plastic bulrushes and a chiming doorbell the wife may also use certain expressions like pleased to meet you which irritate her husband to death or he may say what a generous portion every time she puts his food in front of him now is the time to strike if you say you cant stand something in the first flush of love your partner probably wont mind and will do something about it if after ten years you suddenly tell your husband it drives you mad every time he says sit ye down when guests arrive hell be deeply offended and ask you why you didnt complain before irritating habits everyone has some irritating habits the only thing to do when your partner draws your attention to them is to swallow your pride and be grateful because they may well have been irritating everyone else as well i have given up smoking and eating apples in bed or cooking in my fur coat and i try not to drench the butter dish with marmalade my husband no longer spends a quarter of an hour each morning clearing the frog out of his throat and if he still picks his nose he does it behind a newspaper there are bound to be areas in your marriage where you are diametrically opposed compromise is the only answer im cold blooded my husband is hot blooded i sleep with six blankets he sleeps half out of the bed i like arriving late for parties so i can make an entrance he likes arriving on the dot because he hates missing valuable drinking time i cant count the number of quiet cigarettes weve had in the car waiting for a decent time to arrive dont worry too much that habits which irritate you now will get more and more on your nerves my tame psychiatrist again told me those quirks in ones marriage partner which annoy one in early days often become in later years the most lovable traits rows my husband and i quarrel very seldom we both loathe rows and hate being shouted at i was very worried when i first married because i read that quarrelling was one of the most common methods of relieving tensions in marriage and was confronted with the awful possibility that our marriage had no proper tensions it is very hard to generalise about rows some of the happiest married people i know have the most blazing rows and then make it up very quickly like mps who argue heatedly in the house all night and then meet on terms of utter amicability in the bar five minutes later however much a row clears the air one is bound during its course to say something vicious and hurtful which may well be absorbed and brooded upon later try therefore to cut rowing down to the minimum it will upset children when they come along and if you row in public its boring and embarrassing for other people and you wont get asked out any more we found the occasions when rows were most likely to break out were friday night both partners are tired at the end of the week going away for weekends one person is always ready and anxious to avoid the rushhour the other is frantically packing all the wrong things so the first five miles of the journey will be punctuated with cries of oh god and uturns against the everincreasing traffic to collect something forgotten weddings the vicars peptalk in church on christian behaviour in marriage always sets us off on the wrong foot then afterwards well be suffering from postchampagne gloom and wondering if were as happy as the couple whove just got married television husband always wants to watch boxing and the wife the play desks the tidy one will be irritated because the untidy one is always rifling the desk and pinching all the stamps and envelopes clothes men not having a clean shirt or clean underpants to wear in the morning space in the bedroom the wife will appropriate five and threequarters out of six of the drawers and three out of four of the coat hangers and leave her clothes all over the only chair minor irritations all likely to cause rows the wife should avoid using her husbands razor on her legs and not washing it out or cleaning the bath with his flannel or using a chisel as a screwdriver or pinching the husbands sweaters there are also the eighteen odd socks in her husbands top drawer the rings of lipstick on his best handkerchief running out of toothpaste loo paper soap forgetting to turn out lights fires the oven forgetting to give her husband his letters or telephone messages making up never be too proud to apologise but do it properly none of that ive said im sorry havent i followed by a stream of abuse dont worry about letting the sun go down on your wrath its no good worrying a row to its logical conclusion when youre both tired and then lying awake the rest of the night take a sleeping pill get a good nights sleep and youll probably have forgotten you ever had a row by morning try not to harbour grudges never send someone to coventry a sense of humour is allimportant for ending rows my husband once in a rare midrow put both feet into one leg of his underpants and fell over i went into peals of laughter and the row was at an end once when i was threatening to leave him he looked reproachfully at the cat and said but we cant let poor michael be the victim of a broken home poor michael a note on feminine problems black glooms suffered particularly by wives in the first six months after marriage they usually stem from exhaustion feeling totally unable to cope and reaction after the wedding they are extremely tedious for the husband but nothing really to worry about unless they linger on longer than a week nothing will be achieved by telling her sharply to snap out of it patience a lot of loving and encouragement are the only answer the curse should be renamed the blessing every row two weeks before it arrives and a week after its finished can be blamed on it anniversaries husbands are notorious for forgetting birthdays and anniversaries dont expect a heartshaped box of chocolates on valentines day but avoid a row on the birthdayanniversary by saying loudly about three days before what shall we do on my birthdayour anniversary on friday darling christmas the row usually starts about september and continues through to february wife where shall we go for christmas darling husband anywhere you like darling wife well i thought we might spend a few days with mother husband appalled with your mother no drink and frost because we dont go to church three times a day if you think im staying with that old cow wife interrupting with some asperity what did you have in mind husband well i rather thought we might go to scotland wife to stay with your parents no central heating and those damned dogs thats charming and the row follows its normal course many people like to go to their families for christmas and they cant understand why their partners find it such a strain if you cant stand going to either set of parents get a large dog and say you cant leave it christmas presents these can be an awful bore particularly if you come from large families weve evolved a system whereby my husband buys all the mens presents and i look after the women and children relations and friends inlaws the ideal is to marry an orphan however hard you try youll probably have some trouble with your inlaws mine have always been angelic to me but as my motherinlaw pointed out to me in a moment of candour nobody is ever good enough to marry ones children be kind to your inlaws remember that many parents are so involved with their children that its an act of infidelity almost tantamount to divorce when they suddenly meet someone and marry them for years a mother has considered herself her daughters or her sons best friend and suddenly she isnt she sees them confiding in someone else and as they draw further and further away from her she becomes more and more unpleasant by trying to hang on to them tact is essential be particularly nice to your husband wife when inlaws are around but dont neck and dont exclude them with private jokes from the wife a bit of sucking up doesnt come amiss ask your motherinlaws advice about cooking and washing say your husband is always raving about her apple pie how does she make it one thing that particularly upsets mothersinlaw is heavy eye makeup and long untidy hair so if you want to take the business of getting on with her seriously tie your hair back and soft pedal the makeup when you see her the husbands best tack is to flirt with his motherinlaw even if shes an old boot few women can resist flattery wives can flirt with their fathersinlaw but dont overdo it or youll have your motherinlaw branding you a fast piece however much you dislike having your inlaws to stay be philosophical about it at least it will make you clean the place up my motherinlaw once slept peacefully and unknowingly on a pillowcase full of wet washing dont give them too lush food or theyll think youre being extravagant herrings and cider will impress them far more than lobster and caviar and hide those battalions of empties before they arrive my husband always takes his parents on a tour of the house pointing out things that need repairing in anticipation of a fat cheque your own parents however fond you are of your own parents remember that when a man marries he shall leave his father and mother and cleave unto his wife loyalty to your husband or wife must always come first dont chatter to your mother too long or too often on the telephone it will irritate your husband and possibly make him jealous if you have a row with your husband or wife and pack your bags go to a discreet friend never never go home to your parents you will say a lot of adverse things about your partner in the heat of the moment which you will forget afterwards but your parents will remember them and it will be extremely difficult afterwards for your parents and partner to pick up the threads again friends a friend married is a friend lost goes the proverb and certainly one of the sad facts of marriage is that its almost impossible to keep up with friends ones other half doesnt like you can relegate them to lunch dates and evenings when your partner is out but invariably they get the message and sweep off in lowgear dudgeon much of the first year of marriage is spent weeding out the sheep from the goats both parties should try not to be jealous of the other halfs close friends my husband certainly made short work of any friends he considered a boring b unstable influences if you find your husbands friends a bore establish a reputation for delicacy early on in the marriage then when they lurch in drunkenly from the pub you can plead exhaustion and disappear upstairs to read a book droppersin ought to be abolished people should telephone first and see if you want to see them no one will bother you the first month or so they used to apologise to us for telephoning after seven oclock assuming wed be in bed after that theyll descend in droves looking curiously for signs of strain in your faces avid to see what kind of mess youve made of your flat one method of getting rid of them is to dispatch your husband to the bedroom rip off all your clothes ruffle your hair and clad only in a face towel answer the door brandishing the kama sutra the droppersin will be so embarrassed that theyll apologise and make themselves scarce answering the door entertaining notions entertaining always check with your partner before you issue or accept an invitation or youll get ghastly instances of double dating time and again recently weve been making tracks for bed when the telephone goes and an irate voice says arent you coming were all waiting to go in to dinner or well be just leaving the house to go out when a rosycheeked couple arrive on the doorstep having driven fifty miles up from the country for dinner keep a book by the telephone and write everything down dinner parties unless youre a cordon bleu cook and totally unflappable your first dinner parties are bound to be packed with incident overcooked meat undercooked potato salad soufflés that dont rise guests that dont rise to the occasion if youre a beginner cook as much as possible the day before cods roe pâté liver pâté soup casseroles and most puddings can all be made beforehand then all you have to do the following day is to make the toast and mix a salad dressing if possible get the table ready the night before as well polishing glasses ironing napkins getting out plates and coffee cups all take longer than one would imagine get plenty of cheese in case you havent given people enough i once fell up the stairs with the pudding and eight plates and there was no cheese in the house guests dont spend hours away from your guests nothing is less calculated to put them at their ease than a hostess who turns up red in the face after threequarters of an hour grabs a quick drink and disappears again one couple we went to dinner with both disappeared for an hour to peel grapes for the sole véronique and the whole meal was served to an accompaniment of piped cream be careful who you ask with whom the day our vicars wife came to dinner we invited a young man who regaled us for half the evening with details of the mating habits of the rhinoceros dont become a slave to social pingpong entertaining is wildly expensive and just because you had caviar and three kinds of wine at the thrustpointers dont feel you have to give them oysters and liqueurs when they come back to you if youre broke warn people beforehand that it will only be spaghetti and spanish burgundy then they can either refuse bring a bottle or have a number of stiff drinks beforehand if youre worried about the food drink for at least an hour and half before you eat and theyll be so tight they wont know what theyre eating equally if youre supremely confident about your food dont let them drink too much dont play loud background music before dinner it kills conversation people can go to a concert if they want that sort of thing never never show slides if they wont go the husband should make the first move by saying his wife is tired and sending her to bed if that doesnt work turn the central heating off if you dont like certain people dont feel you have to ask them back theyll get the message eventually life is too short to bother with people you really dont care for youll work up too much angst beforehand about having to see them and too much spleen afterwards about how bored you were parties make a list and stick to it we always ask indiscriminately and have far too many people both of us trying to smuggle in people the other doesnt like dont send out invitations you cant ask everyone and people get very sour if they see your invitations on other peoples mantelpieces also if you invite by telephone you get a yes or no immediately and people are notoriously bad at answering letters we once gave a drears sherry party with fatal consequences all our undreary friends found out and were furious they hadnt been invited and the drears discovered why theyd been asked and were deeply offended we were a bit short of friends that year one of the secrets of a good party is a few abrasive elements recently we went to an outstandingly successful bringanenemy party dont expect to enjoy your own parties except in retrospect all your guests will be too busy getting drunk and trying to make other guests to bother about you your function is to act as unpaid waiter and waitress effecting introductions rescuing people whose eyes are beginning to glaze whether theyre bored or drunk and watching peoples drinks do mix a cocktail that can be poured or give them wine otherwise youll get in a terrible muddle remembering what everyone wants and start giving them whisky and tonic and gin and soda going to parties dont stand together all evening it will upset your hostess check every twenty minutes to ensure your partner isnt standing alone doesnt need rescuing from the local bore isnt pinned to the wall by the local sex maniac if you want to dance cheek to cheek with the most attractive manwoman in the room wait until your husbandwife is securely trapped on the sofa in another room if you catch your partner making a pass at someone smile broadly as though it was an everyday occurrence say drink always takes himher this way heshe wont remember a thing about it next morning and whisk himher away smartly how to leave there is bound to be a moment when you want to go home and your husband doesnt because hes having too good a time or vice versa one of you will just have to grin and bear it dont get into the habit of leaving independently it looks bad and is very expensive on taxis overcome with lust if youre both bored intimate to your hostess that youve been overcome by lust and must leave she will think her party has been a contributing factor and be delighted particularly if you leave murmuring about the seductive atmosphere the office office parties if husbands and wives arent invited be extremely careful this is the moment when mr chalcott in accounts who has been eyeing mrs pointer in personnel all the year suddenly gets too much drink in him makes a pass at her and the whole thing erupts into an affaire try not to get home too late be careful to wipe lipstick off your cheek if youre a man and replace your makeup carefully if youre a woman the fact that mr prideau in packaging saw fit to pounce on you may be just christmas high spirits but it will worry your husband wholl think it is normal procedure for the rest of the year if you go to your wifes or husbands office party be as nice as possible to everyone these people may seem draggy to you but your partners got to put up with them all the year round and will get tremendous kudos if youre a success be prepared for anything my mother went to my fathers office party once when he was in a very senior position she was hotly pursued by a man from the boiler division in a mickey mouse mask who kept tracking her down in the paul jones tossing her up in the air and crying i am your demon lover hotly pursued be careful what you wear look pretty but not outrageous when i was newly married i went to the authors ball at the hilton in a party of my husbands grandest business colleagues very brown from the south of france i wore a white strapless dress which was so tight i didnt need a bra the fivecourse dinner was too much for it as i stood up to dance with one of the directors it split leaving me naked to the waist office relationships a husband spends far more of his waking life with his secretary and the people he works with than with his wife it is the same for his wife if she goes out to work it is very easy to get crushes on people you work with theres natural proximity theres the charm of the clandestine we mustnt let anyone in the office know of working together for a common purpose and finally because men basically like to boss and women to be bossed there is the fatal charm of the bossfemale employee relationship for if you are used to obeying a man when he says take a letter or make me a cup of coffee you may find it difficult to say no when he says come to bed with me bear in mind before you either pounce or accept the pounce across the desk that people arent nearly so easy to live with as to work with and youd probably be bored to death with your boss or secretary if you had to spend twentyfour hours a day with them it will also make things very awkward later if you go off them while they still fancy you or vice versa you may be forced to leave a job you like be very careful too not to let your husband or wife think that you are keen on someone in the office or they will go through agonies of jealousy during the day and raise hell every time you are kept late even if you are working having your husbands boss to dinner the wife should pull out all the culinary stops and look as beautiful as possible but dont flirt with your husbands boss too much or youll have him sending your husband abroad and coming round on his own invite another amusing but socially reliable couple to meet him then when you and your husband have to leave the room to dish up or pour drinks he wont be left alone to examine the damp patches or the peeling wallpaper give him plenty to drink but not too much or he may become indiscreet about company politics regret it the next day and take against your husband general marital problems communication one of the beauties of marriage is that you always have someone to look after and to look after you to share your problems and to tell without boasting when something good happens to you it is vital that couples should get into the habit of talking to each other and be interested in each others activities be it a game of cricket an afternoon at the wi or a day at the office if you are able to communicate on a daily level you will find it much easier to discuss things when a major crisis blows up like a husband losing his job a sudden sexual impasse or the television breaking down nothing is more depressing than seeing married couples on holiday or dining together gazing drearily into space with nothing to say to one another at best its a shocking example to unmarried people i feel strongly that married women should try to set a good example to newlyweds or people about to get married nothing is more moralelowering for the engaged girl than to be taken aside by a couple of bored and cynical married women and told how dreary marriage is the only solution being infidelity or burying oneself in ones children rather in the same way that women who have children often terrorise women who are pregnant for the first time with hairraising stories of childbirth separation in long separations from your husband or wife there are all the problems of loneliness and fidelity even short separations a week or a weekend have their own difficulties when her husband goes away a wife steels herself not to mind and although she misses him unconsciously she builds up other resources she finds it is rather fun to read a novel until three oclock in the morning have time to get the house straight watch what programmes she wants on television not have to cook and wash and be able to see all the people she is not allowed to see when her husband is at home gradually as the time for her husbands return approaches she gets more and more excited she plans a special homecoming dinner she buys a new dress and goes on a twentyfour hour diet so she will look beautiful in her mind she has a marvellously idealised picture of his homecoming and then he arrives hungover grubby exhausted and if hes been to america or anywhere else where the time is different from ours hell be absolutely knackered he wont want to do anything else but fall into bed and then only to sleep the wife is inevitably disappointed this is no god returning merely a husband grumbling about the rings round the bath bringing not passion and tenderness but a suitcase of dirty shirts similarly a husband returning to his wife after some time away will find that an ecstatic welcome is often followed by a good deal of sniping and bad temper the wife will have stored up so much unconscious resentment at being deprived of his presence that she will take it out on him for a few days the only way to cope with aprèsseparation situations is not to get panicky if your wife or husband acts strangely it doesnt mean theyve met someone else they are just taking a bit of time to adjust to your presence again in a small way its like starting ones marriage over again jealousy once your life is centred round one person it is very easy to become obsessively jealous try and keep your jealousy in check it will only cause you suffering and make things very difficult for your partner if you marry a very pretty girl or a very attractive man the fact has to be faced that people will still go on finding them attractive give your wife a certain amount of rope let her go out to lunch with other men but start kicking up if it becomes a weekly occurrence with the same man never let her have drinks in the evening unless its business or an old friend and draw the line at breakfast if you are married to the sort of man whos always humiliating you by running after women at parties youll have to grin and bear it hes probably just testing his sex appeal like gorillas beat their chests before i was married a girlfriend and i used to divide men into open gazers or secret doers youve probably got an open gazer so thank your lucky stars youre not married to a secret doer if you have an exwife or an exlover destroy all evidence before you get married again nothing is more distressing for a second wife than coming upon wedding photographs of you and your first wife looking idyllically happy however much you may want to reminisce about your exes keep it to a minimum and if you ever have to meet any of your wifes or husbands exes be as nice to them as possible no one looks attractive when sulking boredom it was not my intention in this book to deal with marriage in relation to children but i would like to say a brief word about cabbageitis which is my name for the slough of despond a wife goes through when she has two or more very young children to look after invariably shes stuck in the country or a part of town where she has few friends her husband is going out to work every day and meeting interesting people and she isnt and she feels dull inadequate and so bored she could scream the family budget wont stretch to any new clothes for her so she feels it is impossible for her to look attractive on the occasions when friends bring children over for the day it seems to be all chaos and clamour she spends days planning a trip to london which invariably ends in disappointment her clothes are all wrong shes worn out after two hours shopping the girlfriend she meets for lunch cant talk about anything except people she doesnt know and if she attempts to take the children shes exhausted before shes begun she and her husband cant afford to entertain much but when they are asked out she finds she is so used to saying no and dont to children all day she is unable to contribute to the conversation if you are going through this stage and i think it is one of the real danger zones of marriage remember that it isnt going to go on for ever the children will grow up go to school and you will have acres of free time to go back to work to take up hobbies to make new friends whatever you do dont neglect your appearance looking pretty isnt new clothes its clean hair a bit of makeup and a welcoming hug when your husband comes home in the evening remember that your husband must always come first even before the children in your obsession with your domestic problems dont forget that he probably isnt having a very easy time either desperately pushed for money harassed at work buffeted back and forth in a train every day coming home to a drab fractious wife every night so dont catalogue your woes when he arrives in the evening concentrate on giving him a good time try and go out at least once a week if its only to the pictures try and read a newspaper or at least listen to the headlines while youre doing the housework so you wont feel too much out of touch if possible find something remunerative to do even if its only making paper flowers typing or framing pictures nothing is more depressing than poverty and if you can make the smallest contribution to the family budget it will be a boost to your morale clothes clothes and appearance the reason why so few marriages are happy said misogynist swift is because young ladies spend their time in making nets not cages no wife has any right to let herself go to seed after shes married she bothered enough to look pretty while she was trying to hook her husband so its a poor compliment to him if she slackens up immediately after hes hooked remember that the world is full of pretty girls who are not averse to amorous dalliance and if you want to keep your husband youll have to work hard to go on attracting him its a case of course of shackingup ô son goût some men prefer their wives au naturel others are like the husband who said to me the marvellous thing about old sue is that she always looks as neat as a new pin ive never seen her without makeup or slopping around in jeans exotic clothes remember that no man ever went off his wife because he saw a crowd of men round her so always pull out the stops when you go to parties or out in the evening or pick your husband up from the office it is important to him that other people think youre attractive and even if your husband does prefer you without makeup put some on when you go to a party youll have to compete with all those dollies with their false pieces and their three pairs of false eyelashes your husband wont be amused if he has to keep leaving the pretty girl hes chatting up to look after you because youve been abandoned if a wife wants to jazz up her husbands wardrobe her best method is to start giving him exotic clothes for his birthday hell never go and buy them of his own accord it is also up to husbands and wives to take an interest in each others appearance tell your husband when he looks handsome and even if you are the sort of man who cant tell a discarded false eyelash from a centipede compliment your wife on her appearance when she buys a new outfit or is dressed up to go out in the evening sewing great row potential here shirt buttons always fly off when the man is getting dressed in the morning or last thing at night when youre both going to bed so they never get sewn on your wife will also plump for terylene socks and say they are healthier and cheaper and can be thrown away when they go into holes to be told by her husband that his mother always darned his woollen ones if the wife really cant sew she should just content herself with sewing on buttons and send all major repairs to the cleaners where they can be done for a few shillings holidays much of the chapter on honeymoons applies here people are so grimly determined to enjoy every moment of their holidays that they feel dismayed and cheated if anything goes wrong youre probably both exhausted particularly if youve only been married a short time and have had all the strain of getting adjusted youve been planning and looking forward to your holiday for ages then you arrive at your destination and find youre so unused to doing nothing that it takes you at least a fortnight to unwind then its time to go home again there is also the sex problem before you were married holidays were always treated as safaris the moment you boarded the train at victoria the sap started rising the eye started roving on the lookout for a holiday playmate after youre married the hunting instinct dies very hard as a friend of mine said taking a married man to the south of france is rather like taking a foxhound to a meet on a lead and not letting him join in the chase im not a believer in retaliation but if your husband does get a crush on another girl on holiday carrying her beachbag always ready with a large towel when she comes up from the sea your best answer rather than sulking is to take to the nearest gigolo and if there isnt a gigolo to take comfort yourself with the thought that holiday romances seldom last beyond the holiday going on holiday with friends of course is one of the quickest ways of losing them the most amiable people turn into absolute monsters when theyve got too much spare time on their hands everyone will either want to do different things lying in the sun sightseeing diving pony trekking or merely getting drunk or else no one will admit what they want to do and go round looking martyred what would you like to do today my darling anything you like darling oh dont be awkward particularly avoid going with people who are much richer than you youll worry the whole time about spending too much or poorer than you or youll spend your time grumbling about their meanness we went to france once in a party of twelve all great friends it was a catastrophe meals were exactly like being back at school hands up for salade niçoise all the people who could speak french pulled rank on the people who couldnt or didnt dare all the wives sulked because all the husbands had got crushes on the one single girl who was sulking because she couldnt hook the one single man bad will was absolutely rampant i am painting a gloomy picture of holidays because i think people often feel that if theyve had a disastrous holiday their marriage must be on the rocks if we cant get on when were on holiday they say there must be something radically wrong forget it cheerful pessimism is the best approach to a holiday and console yourself that the most disastrous holidays are always the funniest in retrospect how to behave on holiday there is invariably one who does the planning booking rooms tickets etc and one who resists being planned if youre the resister cut down on the beefing whether its about the lack of soap coathangers hot water drawer space bed space or amount of garlic in the food remember when in rome and shut up about it dont overdo the sun holidays are meant for lots of sex and you wont feel like it if you wince every time you touch each other and its depressing to start peeling like a tickertape welcome as soon as you turn brown travel is inclined to broaden the hips as well as the mind take a few shifts and larger sized trousers take lots of books and sleeping pills one often cant sleep in hot countries and nothing is more depressing than to feel that all of the good of your holiday is being wasted because of insomnia take something to settle your stomach so you wont spend all night thundering to the lavatory like the gadarene swine remember you wont be able to buy the pill or whatever you use in a catholic country one couple were staying in a villa in spain and a particularly greedy guest came down one morning found their contraceptive paste in the fridge thought it was some exotic pâté and spread it on his toast for breakfast go somewhere where theres something to do a casino the odd night club boats to sail etc money should be shared and kept an eye on nothing wrecks a holiday more than the constant fear that you may run out husbands and wives should do their own packing to avoid endless recriminations about spongebags razors and cameras left behind its horrible coming home to a dirty untidy house if you havent got a daily pay a chum a couple of quid to come in the day before you get home to give the house a going over dont show slides dont bore everyone when you get back with stories of your holiday my husband refuses to talk about it and hangs a notice on his office door saying yes sex bed bedsexintercoursemaking love call it what you like is the cornerstone of marriage if the sex side of a marriage is really good you seldom hear of it breaking up if you keep your partner happy in bed hes unlikely to stray and if he does he nearly always comes back few people are born geniuses in bed it is something you learn step by step like a child learns to talk the first essential is to be honest with one another dont pretend to be going into ecstasies of excitement if you are not or your partner will automatically assume he is doing the right things to please you and keep on doing them a wife if she can possibly help it shouldnt pretend to be having an orgasm if she is not although her husband will flop down satisfied beside her afterwards she will unconsciously build up a resentment both against him for not seeing through the cheat and against herself for cheating of course its not vital to have an orgasm every time you go to bed with a man but the fact remains that its much nicer if you do it draws you together it gives you a marvellous feeling and its the best sleeping pill in the world another myth that must be shattered is that men are lustful beasts whose appetites must be slaked and women have to endure it your father was very good to me and never bothered me much victorian mothers used to tell daughters who were about to get married just shut your eyes and think of england recent research however has discovered that women can be just as highly sexed as men need intercourse just as often but in most instances are too inhibited to ask for it nothing that two people do in their own home a wife should therefore not be ashamed to take a wholehearted enjoyment in sex ask for it often and if her husband isnt forthcoming to seduce him by making herself pretty wearing sexy underwear or simply by wandering round in the nude dont be too fastidious nothing that two people who love each other do for their mutual enjoyment in the privacy of their own home can be wrong if hes on a lolita kick pander to his whims and dress up in a gym tunic if shes got a slave girl complex tie her up before you make love to her sex books are quite helpful but they always made us howl with laughter they kept talking about the upright male member which made us think of an incorruptible mp read as much erotic literature as you can get your hands on not only to excite you but to give you ideas marriage needs every novelty to keep it going a man i know said his wife was absolutely sensational in bed for at least a month after shed read fanny hill for beginners see the chapter on the honeymoon the thing to remember is to take things slowly it may be six months or a year before you manage to establish a sexual rapport its only in books that the man goes on drilling all night and suddenly the rock splits and the oil comes gushing out enthusiasm is ninetenths of the battle and perseverance kindness and gratitude are also essential tell your husband what doesnt work for you but make pretty sure you tell him when it is good if having the inside of your thighs stroked excites you say so dont let him wait thirty years to find out on a lolita kick once a year how often this is entirely up to you everyone lies about it if you ask them i read in one book that the average man of thirty has sexual intercourse times a week when i told my husband a rather smug gleam came into his eye but he was curious to know what they did on the occasion on the other hand one indian sex manual says that during the first year of marriage couples should have intercourse three times a night for the first three months twice a night for the next three months and every night for the rest of the year after which i suppose you die of exhaustion theres no rule sometimes you may get a jag and have each other a dozen times in a weekend sometimes if youre both tired you may not feel like touching each other for a week or so how not to look in bed curlers and great blobs of face cream are grounds for divorce no woman need wear them if you want curly hair get a set of heated rollers if you want a soft skin put on face cream in the bath people should wash and clean their teeth before they go to bed and have at least one bath a day this may sound elementary but its amazing how many people dont and sweat fetishists apart most people would rather make love to someone who smells and tastes good have separate beds if you must but not separate rooms once you get on to the separate rooms kick its so easy to shut yourself in every night and grow further and further away from your partner if one of you snores or is a bad sleeper and wants to read have a bed made up in the spare room so you can slip into it if you get really desperate about three oclock in the morning dont however get out of the habit of making love quite often if youve been snapping at each other you will find that once you sleep together everything will be all right again i met a girl the other day who boasted she only gives herself to her husband once a year on his birthday a woman should be grateful that her husband wants her and any woman who keeps on saying i dont feel like it tonight unless shes ill pregnant or recovering from a baby deserves to have an unfaithful husband equally no man should deny his wife if she obviously wants it theres no excuse for the sort of career man an american as it happens who will only sleep with his wife on friday and saturday so hell be fresh for work on the weekdays another of the great myths about sex is that for the first year you glut yourselves like someone working in a sweet shop and after that the glamour wears off and you settle down to pastimes like bringing up children and gardening in any good marriage sex should get better and better as the years go by even if you indulge in it marginally less often affaires another great fallacy is that marriage stops you falling in love with people it doesnt one of the most happily married men i know says he was riddled with guilt because he developed a violent crush on a blonde staying in the same hotel while he was on honeymoon if you were the sort of person who was always falling in love before marriage youll probably go on doing it afterwards dont panic nip it in the bud early refuse to see the person concerned it will tear your guts out for a few weeks but youll find you get over it just as you got over the crushes you had before you were married if you fancy someone and you know they fancy you dont try and rely on mutual selfcontrol these things if allowed to develop invariably get out of hand and can escalate into nasty things like divorce the most shortsighted remark ever made at the beginning of an affaire is youre happily married and im happily married and if we have an affaire were both adult enough not to let it get out of hand or anyone get hurt this is rubbish someone always gets hurt and itll probably be you and remember once your husband or wife finds out you are having an affaire with someone else it will cause them appalling unhappiness and your marriage will never be the glad confident morning it was mutual infidelity husbands are such a bore said a friend of mine they always want to know who youre dating some couples manage to go their own way making a pledge of mutual infidelity but i cannot help feeling that one of the partners must be enjoying it more than the other if you must have affaires be discreet the cardinal sin is to be found out and when its all over and youre feeling a louse and you want to clear your conscience dont indulge in tearful confessions to your husband and feel youve cleaned the slate it will upset him quite unnecessarily discovery if you do discover your husband is having an affaire with someone and he doesnt know you know play it cool it may blow over remember the robbd that smiles steals something from the thief if you find out and your partner knows you know the only solution is to raise hell and insist that it stops immediately once you start condoning something like this youre lost usually the jolt of your finding out and minding so much is enough to make him give up the other person in which case welcome him home like the prodigal son and never never reproach him again people often have affaires as a bid for more attention from their partners and purposely leave clues so that their partners will find out and be jolted into loving them more so if you discover your husband is having an affaire with someone have a look at your own behaviour before you blame him to see if its you whos at fault a few practical suggestions if your wife seems like a bolter put her on the same passport then you wont waste a fortune in air tickets getting her back if you suspect your partner is having an affaire with a particular person go into howls of immoderate laughter every time that persons name is mentioned when they ask why youre laughing laugh some more and say no one takes that idiot seriously nothing douses passion quicker than ridicule i really fancied a man once until someone pointed out he looked like dracula detection there are a number of indications that your partner is having an affaire with someone if your husband insists hes been lunching at the local with the boys and comes home reeking of garlic gets out a packet of matches with the mirabelle printed on it and lights a kingsize cigarette when he normally smokes woodbines if he starts a pointless row at breakfast so he can storm out of the house and neednt come back until late if he suddenly starts working late consistently and comes home smelling of scent if he looks happy on a monday morning and miserable on a friday night if he suddenly starts having a bath in the morning if the distance between the ends of his tie is different in the morning from the evening if he keeps making ridiculous excuses to buy more cigarettes during the weekend when there are plenty of packets in the house if theres a spate of wrong numbers it may not be burglars if your wife after always dressing scruffily for the office suddenly starts smartening herself up shaving her legs buying new underwear and getting home late if she doesnt look dismayed when you say youre going to america for three weeks if she is home all day and the loo seat is up when you get home if she suddenly gets sexually revved up women are like machines the more theyre used the better they work if she starts suggesting you make love to her standing on your head she may have been reading the kama sutra if she starts leaving intellectual books by the bed or tidying the house frantically in the morning if you have a man friend to stay and he knows where to put things away when hes doing the drying up if youre both out to work and you come home and find the towels all tidy in the bathroom instead of scrumpled up as usual or if the cat isnt hungry if the cat isnt hungry coming unstuck everyone can make a mistake and theres no point in a couple sticking together if theyre utterly miserable even for the sake of the children who would be much happier with one contented parent than two continually at war do try and distinguish however between a temporary bad patch which all marriages go through and a permanent rift divorce is very unpleasant and very expensive a great deal of mudslinging and bitterness will inevitably occur and theres the nasty business of dividing friends and property so before you run off whether its with someone or not make absolutely sure you want to go your partner may or may not take you back afterwards and the longer you stay away the more difficult it will be to start again another thing to remember is that its very cold outside the matrimonial cage one beautiful woman i know recently left her husband because she was bored and unhappy she was back within six months when she was safely married she had a wonderful time having numerous affaires being hotly pursued by hordes of men for nothing is more attractive to a man than a bored beautiful but safely married woman all fun and no fear once she had left her husband the men who had been swarming round her werent nearly so anxious to declare themselves and she soon found it was back to single girl status with all the nagging worries of who was going to take her out the next night sometimes an affaire can ventilate a marriage and make a couple appreciate each other more another friend of mine became so infatuated with her lover that she left her husband next morning she and her lover went along to the lovers solicitor who asked her if there was anything detrimental they could use against her husband in the divorce was he cruel did he neglect her did he have affaires with other women or beat her up she thought for a minute and then burst into tears saying she couldnt think of anything wrong with him she rushed out of the solicitors office and went back to her husband whom to her amazement she found absolutely devastated by her departure they have been happily married ever since breeding has tom fertilised wendy yet asked one of the small bridesmaids gazing at the bridal couple at a recent wedding premature certainly but its amazing how many brides have to carry extra large bouquets these days an extra large bouquet a girl i know who was married when she was eight months pregnant was given a years subscription to the nappy service by her office as a wedding present although there will be a few raised eyebrows if a baby turns up before nine months have elapsed particularly if it is a spanking ten pounder and cannot be fobbed off as premature the fact remains that the moment you get back from your honeymoon people will start expecting you to get pregnant every time the wife looks tired has a bilious attack or leaves a party early people will start exchanging knowing looks if after two years nothing happens the pressure will really be on hints are dropped about getting set in your ways or too used to living on two incomes people will keep suggesting you move to the country and send you estate agents lists of bijou residences with large gardens dire warnings will be given about the difficulty of having babies after the age of twentyfive after three years you will be offered names of perfectly marvellous gynaecologists and friends will say the wife is overtiring herself and ought to give up work people will take her aside and say dont you think henry ought to see a doctor as well darling parentsinlaw will display angst about not having any grandchildren to talk about at bridge parties they should all realise that its none of their business anyone who starts interfering on this subject deserves a flea in their ear if couples dont have children its either because they dont want to yet or because theyre trying and they cant not being able to have children whether its temporary or permanent is extremely distressing there is something tragic and yet ridiculous about those abortive threshings night after night outsiders should not contribute to this distress by asking stupid questions i couldnt have children and after seven traumatic years of trailing from doctor to doctor we finally in extreme trepidation adopted one it has been an unqualified success within twentyfour hours of the childs arrival we were infatuated with him and couldnt imagine life without him everyone told us we were too set in our ways you lead such a full life they said too full too empty too full perhaps of empty things children are not nearly so much work as alarmist mothers crack them up to be and they are more fun than one could believe possible one of the great revelations of my life was how immeasurably much better life was when one was married than unmarried another was how much better marriage is when one has children conclusion i am fully aware of the inadequacies of this book some aspects of marriage are covered very scantily and some not at all and because i was writing about staying married i have dwelt more on the pitfalls than on the very considerable joys of marriage for everyone and particularly for women and children cecil king wrote recently the essential basis for security and happiness is a loving home marriage is not a battlefield it is a partnership and married people should be partners not rivals and although it is important to be a reliable wage earner a splendid cook a good manager and magnificent in bed the most priceless gift one married person can give to another is a merry and a loving heart
