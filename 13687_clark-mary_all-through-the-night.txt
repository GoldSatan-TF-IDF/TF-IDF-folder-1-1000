mary higgins clark all through the night prologue there were twentytwo days to go before christmas but lenny was doing his christmas shopping early this year secure in the knowledge that no one knew he was there and standing so still and quiet that he hardly could hear himself breathe he watched from the confessional as monsignor ferris went about the rounds of securing the church for the night with a contemptuous smile lenny waited impatiently as the side doors were checked and the lights in the sanctuary extinguished he shrank back when he saw the monsignor turn to walk down the side aisle which meant that he would pass directly by the confessional he cursed silently when a floorboard in the enclosure squeaked through a slit in the curtain he could see the clergyman stop and tilt his head as if listening for another sound sondra stood in the doorway of a townhouse across the street from the church the building was under repair and the temporary scaffolding around the street level shielded her from the view of passersby she wanted to he sure that monsignor had left the church and was in the rectory before she left the baby she had been attending services at st clements for the last couple of days and had become familiar with his routine she also knew that during advent he would now be conducting a seven oclock recitation of the rosary service weak from the strain and fatigue of the birth only hours earlier her breasts swelling with the fluid that preceded her milk she leaned against the doorframe for support a faint whimper from beneath her partially buttoned coat made her arms move in the rocking motion instinctive to mothers on a plain sheet of paper that she would leave with the baby she had written everything she could safely reveal please give my little girl to a good and loving family to raise her father is of italian descent my grandparents were born in ireland neither family has any hereditary diseases that i am aware of so she should be healthy i love her but i cannot take care of her if she asks about me someday show her this note please tell her that the happiest hours of my life will always be the ones when i held her in my arms after she was born for those moments it was just the two of us alone in the world sondra felt her throat close as she spotted the tall slightly stooped figure of the monsignor emerge from the church and walk directly to the adjacent rectory it was time she had bought baby clothes and supplies including a couple of shirts a long nightgown booties and a hooded jacket bottles of formula and disposable diapers she had wrapped the baby papoosestyle in two receiving blankets and a heavy woollen robe but because the night was so cold at the last minute she had brought along a brown paper shopping bag she had read somewhere that paper was a good insulator against the cold not that the baby would be out in the frigid air for long of coursejust until sondra could get to a phone and call the rectory she unbuttoned her coat slowly shifting the baby only as needed remembering to be especially careful of her head the faint glow from the streetlight made it possible for her to see her infants face clearly i love you sondra whispered fiercely and i will always love you the baby stared up at her her eyes fully open for the first time brown eyes stared into blue eyes long darkblond hair brushed against sprigs of the blond hair curling on the little forehead tiny lips puckered and turned seeking mothers breast sondra pressed the babys head against her neck her lips lingered on the soft cheek her hand caressed the infants back and legs then in a decisive move she slipped the tiny figure into the shopping bag reached for the secondhand stroller folded next to her and tucked the handle under one arm she waited until several people had walked past her hiding place then hurried to the curb and looked up and down the street a block away traffic was stopped at the red light but she saw no pedestrians coming in either direction a solid wall of parked cars on both sides of the street helped to protect sondra from any curious eyes as she darted across the street to the rectory there she ran up the three steps to the narrow stoop and opened the stroller after engaging the brake she laid the baby snugly under the strollers hood and laid the bundle of clothes and bottles at her feet she knelt for a moment and took one last look at her child goodbye she whispered then she stood and quickly ran down the steps and headed toward columbus avenue she would make the call to the rectory from a street phone two blocks away lenny prided himself on being in and out of a church in less than three minutes you never know about silent alarms he thought as he opened his backpack and pulled out a flashlight keeping the narrow beam pointed toward the floor he quickly began to make his usual rounds he went to the poor box first donations had been down lately hed noticed but this one yielded a better than usual take somewhere between thirty and forty dollars the offering boxes below the votive candles turned out to be the most satisfactory of any of the last ten churches he had hit there were seven of them placed at intervals in front of the statues of the saints quickly he smashed the locks and grabbed the cash in the last month hed come to mass here a couple of times to study the layout he had observed that the priest consecrated the bread and wine in plain goblets so he didnt bother to break into the tabernacle since thered be nothing special there he was just as glad to avoid doing that anyway the couple of years hed spent in parochial school had had an effect on him he acknowledged making him queasy about doing certain things it definitely got in his way when it came to robbing churches on the other hand he had no qualms about leaving with the prize that had brought him here in the first place the silver chalice with the starshaped diamond at the base it had belonged to joseph santori the priest who founded st clements parish one hundred years ago and it was the one treasure this historic church contained a painting of santori hung above a mahogany cabinet in a recess to the right of the sanctuary the cabinet was ornate its grillwork designed to both protect and display the chalice after one of the masses he had attended lenny had drifted over to read the plaque beneath the cabinet at his ordination in rome father later bishop santori was given this cup by countess maria tomicelli it had been in her family since the days of early christianity at age joseph santori was consecrated as a bishop and assigned to the see of rochester upon his retirement at age he returned to st clements where he spent his remaining years working among the poor and the elderly bishop joseph santoris reputation for holiness was so widespread that after his death a petition was signed to ask the holy see to consider him for beatification a cause that remains active today the diamond definitely would bring a few bucks lenny thought as he swung his hatchet with two hard blows he smashed the hinges of the cabinet he yanked open the doors and grabbed the chalice afraid that he might have triggered a silent alarm he quickly ran to the side door of the church unlocked it and pushed it open anxious now to get out as he turned west toward columbus avenue the cold air quickly dried the perspiration that had covered his face and back once on the avenue he knew he could disappear into the crowds of shoppers but as he passed the rectory the wail of an approaching police siren shattered the calm he could see two couples down the block headed in the same direction he was going but he didnt dare to start running to catch up with them that would be a sure giveaway then he spotted the stroller on the rectory steps in an instant he was carrying it down to the sidewalk there appeared to be nothing in it but a couple of shopping bags shoving his backpack in the foot of the stroller he walked quickly to catch up with the couples ahead of him once he was near them he strolled sedately just behind the police car roared past the group and screeched to a halt in front of the church at columbus avenue lenny quickened his steps no longer worried about detection on such a chilly night all pedestrians were hurrying anxious to reach their destinations he would just blend in there was no reason for anyone to pay attention to the averagesized sharpfaced man in his early thirties who was wearing a cap and a plain dark jacket and pushing a cheap wellworn stroller the street phone sondra had planned to call from was in use wildly anxious with impatience and already heartsick about the baby she had abandoned she tried to decide whether to interrupt the caller a man wearing the uniform of a security guard she could explain that it was an emergency i cant do that she thought despairingly tomorrow if theres a story in the newspapers about the baby he might remember me and talk to the police dismayed she shoved her hands in her pockets groping for the coins she needed and the paper on which shed written the phone number of the rectory unnecessary because she knew it by heart it was december rd and already christmas lights and decorations glittered from the windows of the shops and restaurants along columbus avenue a couple walking hand in hand passed sondra their faces radiant as they smiled at each other the girl appeared to he about eighteen her own age sondra thought although she felt infinitely olderand infinitely removed from the air of careless joy this couple displayed it was getting colder was the baby wrapped warmly enough she worried for an instant she shut her eyes oh god please make this man get off the phone she prayed i need to make this call now an instant later she heard the click of the receiver being replaced sondra waited until the caller was a few paces away before she grabbed the receiver dropped in the coins and dialed st clements rectory the voice was that of an elderly man it had to be the old priest she had seen at mass please may i speak to monsignor ferris right away im father dailey perhaps i can help you monsignor is outside with the police we have an emergency quietly sondra broke the connection they had found the baby already she was safe now and monsignor ferris would see that she was placed in a good home an hour later sondra was on the bus to birmingham alabama where she was a student in the music department of the university a violin student whose astonishing talent had already marked her for future stardom on the concert stage it was not until he was in the apartment of his elderly aunt that lenny heard the faint mewling of the infant startled he looked into the stroller he saw the shopping bag begin to move and quickly tore it open he stared in shock at the tiny occupant unbelieving he unpinned the note from the blanket read it and mouthed an expletive from the bedroom at the end of the narrow hallway his aunt called is that you lenny there was no hint of a welcome in the greeting spoken with a strong accent that betrayed her italian roots yes aunt lilly there was no way he could simply hide the baby he had to figure out what to do what should he tell her lilly maldonado walked down the hall to the living room at seventyfour she both looked and moved like someone ten years younger than her age her hair pulled back in a tight bun was still generously sprinkled with black strands her brown eyes were large and lively and her short ample body moved in quick sure steps along with lennys mother her younger sister she had emigrated to the united states from italy shortly after world war ii a skilled seamstress she had married a tailor from her native village in tuscany and worked side by side with him in their tiny upper west side shop until his death five years ago now she worked out of her apartment or went to the homes of her devoted clients whom she charged far too little for dressmaking and alterations but as her customers joked among themselves in exchange for lillys low prices they were forced to lend considerable sympathetic attention to her endless stories about her troublesome nephew lenny on her knees a heap of pins beside her her alert eyes carefully measuring as she chalked hem lengths lilly would sigh then launch into her litany of complaints my nephew hes always driving me crazy trouble from the day he was born when he was in school dont ask arrested went away to a prison for kids twice did that straighten him out no never can hold a job why not my sister his mama god rest her always was too easy on him i love him of courseafter all hes my flesh and bloodbut he drives me crazy how much can i put up with him coming in at all hours whats he living on i ask you but now after earnest prayer to her beloved st francis of assisi lilly maldonado had made a decision she had tried everything and none of it had made a difference clearly nothing was going to change lenny and so she was going to wash her hands of him once and for all the light in the foyer was dim and she was so intent on delivering her speech that she did not immediately notice the stroller behind him her arms folded her voice firm lilly said lenny you asked if you could stay a few nights well that was three weeks ago and i dont want you here anymore pack your bags and get out lillys loud strident tone startled the already stirring infant and the faint mewling broke into a wail what lilly exclaimed then she saw the stroller in a quick move she shoved her nephew aside and looked down into it shocked she snapped what have you clone now where did you get that baby lenny thought fast he didnt want to leave this apartment it was a perfect place to live and staying with his aunt gave him the aura of respectability he had read the note from the babys mother so he quickly came up with a plan shes mine aunt lilly a girl i was crazy about is the mother but shes moving to california and wants to put the baby up for adoption i dont want to i want to keep her the wail was now a demanding screech tiny fists flailed the air lilly opened the bundle at the infants feet the babys hungry she announced at least your girlfriend sent some formula she plucked out one of the bottles and thrust it at lenny here warm this up her expression changed as she unwrapped the blankets from around the tiny infant picked her up and cradled her in warm and comforting arms beautiful bella how could your mama not want you she looked at lenny what do you call her lenny thought of the starshaped diamond in the chalice her name is star aunt lilly star lilly maldonado murmured as she soothed the sobbing baby in italy we would call her stellina that means little star through narrowed eyes lenny watched the bonding between the infant and the aging woman no one would be looking for the baby he thought it wasnt like he had kidnapped it and anyhow if anything ever did come up about the kid hed have the note to prove she had been abandoned he knew the word for grandmother in italian was nonna as he turned and hurried into the kitchen to warm the bottle lenny told himself with satisfaction star my little girl ive found me a homeand youve got yourself a nonna seven years later frowning willy meehan sat at the piano his wife alvirah had bought him for his sixtysecond birthday with intense concentration he attempted to read the notes in the john thompsons book for mature beginners maybe it will be easier if i sing along he thought sleep my child and peace attend thee he began willy has such a good voice alvirah thought as she came into the room all through the night is one of my favorite carols she reflected as she looked affectionately at her husband of more than forty years in profile his resemblance to the late tip oneill the legendary speaker of the house of representatives was even more startling than when viewed full on she decided with his shock of white hair his craggy features his keen blue eyes and warm smile willy was often the recipient of startled glances of recognition even though it was several years since oneills passing now to her loving eyes he looked simply splendid in the dark blue suit hed worn out of respect for bessie durkin maher whose wake they were about to attend alvirah had reluctantly switched from the size twelve navy suit shed been planning to wear to a black dress that was a size larger she and willy had just returned the previous evening from their postthanksgiving cruise in the caribbean and the sumptuous food had dealt a mortal blow to her diet guardian angels god will send thee willy sang as he played the dear lord god sure did send his angels to us alvirah thought asnot wanting to disturb willyshe tiptoed to the window to enjoy the breathtaking view of central park only a little over two years ago alvirah then a cleaning woman and willy a plumber had been living in jackson heights in queens in the apartment they had rented long ago as newlyweds she had been bone weary after a particularly hard day at mrs okeefes who always felt that she didnt get her moneys worth unless alvirah moved every stick of furniture in the house when she vacuumed still as they did every wednesday and saturday evening they had paused to watch television when the lottery numbers were announced as the balls popped into place theyd almost had a collective heart attack when one after another their numbers the ones they always played came up and then we realized wed won forty million dollars alvirah thought still incredulous at their good luck we werent just lucky though we were blessed she corrected herself as she drank in the view it was quarter of seven and central park was softly beautiful with fresh snow that had left a shimmering white coverlet on the trees and fields in the distance festive christmas lights illuminated the area surrounding the tavern on the green the headlights of cars and taxis were a moving river of brightness as they wound their way along the curving roads anywhere else they would just look like traffic she mused the horsedrawn carriages not visible to her now but no doubt present in the park always reminded her of the stories her mother told about growing up near central park in the early part of the century likewise the skaters waltzing on the wollman rink ice reminded her of evenings years ago when she had rollerskated to organ music at st raymonds in the bronx after winning the lottery with its yearly income of two million dollars minus taxes she and willy had moved to this luxurious apartment living on central park always had been one of her fantasies and besides the apartment was a good investment however they still kept their old rental apartment in jackson heights just in case new york state went broke and quit paying them truthfully though alvirah had made good use of her newfound wealth giving quite a lot to charity while managing to enjoy herself immensely plus shed had some memorable experiences she had gone to cypress point spa in pebble beach and almost got murdered there because of her nose for news the experience paid off when she became a contributing columnist for the new york globe and as one thing always leads to another with the aid of the recording device in her sunburst lapel pin she had solved a number of crimes gradually earning herself a reputation as a real sleuth though still an amateur to be sure willys skills as a plumber were now utilized exclusively by his oldest sibling sister cordelia who tended to the poor and elderly on the upper west side of manhattan she kept willy busy repairing sinks and toilets and heating units in the tenements of her charges before they left on the cruise he had worked double time fixing up the second floor of the abandoned furniture store where cordelia ran a clothing thrift shop called home base it was also an unofficial afterschool center for young children from the first to the fifth grade whose parents were working yes alvirah had decided having money was a fine thing so long as one never forgot how to live without it something she and willy intended never to do its nice that we can help out other people she thought but if we were to lose every dime of the money wed be happy as long as were together all through the night willy concluded with a decisive crescendo ready to go hon he asked as he pushed back the piano bench all set alvirah said as she turned to face him you sounded just great you play with so much feeling so many people just rush through these sweet songs willy smiled benevolently while he heartily regretted the moment he had casually mentioned to alvirah that he wished he had taken piano lessons as a child he realized that he was beginning to derive intense satisfaction whenever he managed to play through a song without a single mistake the reason i played so slowly was because i couldnt read the notes any faster he joked anyhow wed better get going the funeral home was on ninetysixth street just off riverside drive as their cab made its laborious way uptown alvirah reflected on her friends bessie and kate durkin she had known bessie and kate for many years kate had worked as a salesperson in macys and bessie had been the livein housekeeper for a retired judge and his ailing wife when the judges wife died bessie had handed in her resignation saying she could not possibly stay under the same roof with the judge without the presence of another woman a week later judge aloysius maher had requested her hand in marriage and so after sixty years of maidenhood bessie promptly accepted the offer once married she had settled in to make his large and handsome townhouse on the upper west side her own after over forty years of marriage and a blessedly happy one at that willy and alvirah had reached the point where they typically thought about the same subject even before they discussed it bessie knew just what she was doing when she quit her job willy commented his words melding seamlessly with alvirahs own unspoken thought she knew if she didnt grab the judge before other women got their hooks into him she didnt stand a chance she always treated that house as if she owned it and it would have killed her to be booted out of it true she loved it all right alvirah agreed and to be fair she kept her part of the bargain she was a marvelous housekeeper and could cook like an angel the judge couldnt get to the table fast enough you have to admit she waited on him hand and foot willy had never been a fan of bessie durkins she knew what she was doing the judge only lasted eight years then bessie got the house and a pension invited kate to move in and kates waited on her hand and foot ever since kates a saint alvirah said in agreement but of course the house will be hers now that bessies gone and shell have an income she should be able to manage just fine cheered by her own optimistic statement she glanced out the window oh willy dont you love the christmas decorations in all the windows she asked its such a shame bessie died so near the holidays she always loved them so its only the fourth of december willy pointed out she made it through thanksgiving thats true alvirah conceded im glad we were with them remember how much she enjoyed her turkey she ate every bite of it and everything else in sight willy said dryly here we are as their taxi pulled up to the curb an attendant at the reading funeral home opened the door for them and in a subdued tone told them that bessie durkin maher was reposing in the east parlor the heavy sweet smell of flowers drifted through the hushed atmosphere as they walked sedately down the corridor these places give me the creeps willy commented they always smell of dead carnations in the east parlor they joined a group of some thirty mourners including vic and linda baker the couple who had rented the top floor apartment of bessies townhouse they were standing at the head of the casket next to bessies sister kate and like family were accepting condolences with her whats that all about willy whispered to alvirah as they waited their turn to speak to kate thirteen years younger than her formidable sister kate was a wiry seventyfiveyearold with a cap of short gray hair and warm blue eyes that were now welling with tears shes been bullied all her life by bessie alvirah thought as she enveloped kate in her arms its for the best kate she said firmly if bessie had survived that stroke shed have been a total invalid and that wasnt for her no kate agreed brushing away a tear she wouldnt have wanted that i guess ive always thought of bessie as both my sister and my mother she might have been set in her ways but she had a good heart well miss her terribly alvirah said as behind her willy breathed a deep sigh as willy gave kate a brotherly hug alvirah turned to vic baker so formal was his mourning attire that alvirah immediately was reminded of one of the addams family characters baker a stocky man in his midthirties with a boyish face dark brown hair and shrewd chinablue eyes was wearing a black suit with a black tie beside him his wife linda also dressed in black was holding a handkerchief to her face trying to squeeze out a tear no doubt alvirah thought dryly she had met vic and linda for the first time on thanksgiving aware of her sisters failing health kate had invited alvirah and willy sister cordelia sister maeve marie and monsignor thomas ferris the pastor of st clements who resided in the rectory a few doors from bessies townhouse on west rd street to share the holiday dinner with them vic and linda had stopped in as they were having coffee and it seemed to alvirah that kate had pointedly not invited them to stay for dessert so what were they doing acting like the chief mourners alvirah asked herself as she dismissed lindas apparent sadness assuming it to be phony a lot of people would think shes goodlooking alvirah conceded as she took in lindas even features but id hate to get on the wrong side of her theres a coldness to her eyes that i dont trust and that spiky hairdo with all those brassy gold highlights is the pits as though she were my own mother linda was saying a quiver in her voice willy of course had heard the remark and couldnt help adding his own you rented that apartment less than a year ago didnt you he asked without waiting for an answer he took alvirahs arm and propelled her toward the kneeling bench in death as in life bessie durkin looked to be in charge of the situation attired in her best print dress wearing the narrow strand of faux pearls the judge had given her on their wedding day her hair styled and combed bessie had the satisfied expression of someone who had successfully made a lifelong habit of getting other people to do things her way later when alvirah and willy were leaving they said goodbye to kate promising to be at the funeral mass at st clements and ride in the car with her to the cemetery sister cordelia is coming too kate told them willy ive been worried about her this week that youve been away shes been under so much strain the city inspectors are giving her a terrible time about home base we expected as much willy said i called today but she was out and didnt get back to me i had expected to see her here tonight glancing across the room kate saw linda baker bearing down on them she dropped her voice i asked sister back to the house after the funeral she whispered i want you to come too and monsignor will be there they said their goodnights and because willy said he had to get some fresh air just to get the overwhelming smell of flowers off him they agreed to walk a ways before hailing a taxi did you notice how linda baker came running when she saw us talking to kate alvirah asked willy as they strolled arm in arm toward columbus avenue i sure did i have to say there was something about that woman that bothered me and now im worried about cordelia too shes no spring chicken and i think shes bitten off more than she can chew by trying to mind those kids after school willy theyre just being kept warm and safe until their mothers can pick them up from work how can anyone find fault with that the city can like it or not there are rules and regulations about minding kids hold on ive had enough of this cold air here comes a cab like it or not there are rules and regulations sister cordelia said with a sigh as she unconsciously repeated willys exact words the next day theyve given me a deadlinejanuary stand inspector pablo torres told me he was already breaking every rule in the book to stretch it that far it was one oclock and after a mass of resurrection bessie durkin had been lowered into her final resting place alongside three generations of durkins in calvary cemetery willy and alvirah sister cordelia and her assistant sister maeve marie who was a twentynineyearold former nypd policewoman and monsignor thomas ferris were at the table in bessies townhouse enjoying the virginia ham homemade potato salad and sourdough biscuits prepared by kate is there anything else i can get anyone kate asked meekly before she took her place at the table kate sit down alvirah ordered she turned to cordelia what are the specific problems that are so terrible cordelia she asked for a moment the troubled frown on the face of the seventyyearold nun disappeared cordelias eyes softened as she looked at her sisterinlaw and smiled its nothing even you can fix alvirah we have thirtysix kids ages six to eleven who come to us after school i asked pablo if hed rather have them on the streets i asked him what were doing wrong we give them a snack weve rounded up some trustworthy high school kids who help them with their homework and play games with them there are always adult volunteers in the thrift shop so theres plenty of supervision at all times the kids mothers or fathers pick them up by sixthirty we dont charge anything of course the nurses at the schools have checked any kids we take in theyve never complained about anything cordelia sighed and shook her head we know the property is in the process of being sold sister maeve explained but its at least a year before we have to get out weve freshly spackled and painted the whole second floor where the kids stay when theyre there so there isnt a peeling chip anywhere apparently its still a problem though because they say that lead paint was used years ago sister superior asked pablo if hed taken a look at some of the places where these kids live and compared the conditions there to those at home base he said he doesnt make the rules he said there have to be two exits and they cant include the fire escape the staircase is wide enough for five kids to come down together but they dont count that maeve we could go on and on sister cordelia interrupted the bottom line is that in under four weeks we have to close the doors on the home base program and if any of those kids show up we have no choice but to send them home to an empty apartment with no security and no supervision monsignor ferris reached for his empty cup as kate held up the teapot thank you yes kate and i think its time to share our good news with the others kate looked shy why dont you please monsignor gladly bessie god rest her realized the end was near and the day after thanksgiving she asked me to stop in let this news be what i think it is alvirah prayed silently the quiet composure that was a habitual expression on monsignor ferriss kindly face was brightened by the obviously happy tidings he was about to impart he smoothed his silver hair which still was somewhat disheveled from the wind at the graveside service then he smiled bessie told me that of course in her will she left this house to her sister as well as an income that would ensure kates comfort but kate had indicated to her that she would like to turn the house over to sister cordelia for the home base program saints preserve us cordelia said fervently oh kate kate would want to stay on living in the fourth floor apartment the bakers are now occupying bessie quite frankly wasnt enthusiastic about the idea but felt it was kates decision to make and she asked me to make sure nothing went wrong with all the arrangements you know bessie always treated me as if i couldnt find my own way to the store kate said fondly i told bessie that with the rectory just three doors down thered be no problem keeping an eye on everything although i also told her that kate is very much able to handle her own affairs the monsignor explained ill love having home base here kate said ive wanted to volunteer to help ever since you opened it cordelia but bessie needed me monsignor ferris stood smiling as he watched the news register on sister cordelias face ive always believed foresight should be considered a cardinal virtue he announced i happen to have a bottle of champagne cooling in the ice bucket i think a toast to the durkin sisters bessie and kate is in order this is such wonderful news so why am i so worried alvirah asked herself why am i sure that something is going to go wrong mentally she examined the possibilities in much the same way she might use her tongue to seek out the source of a toothache it only took an instant to find the source of her concern the bakers are you sure you can get the bakers out kate she asked it isnt so easy to get rid of tenants these days absolutely sure kate said firmly the lease is for one year and its up in january there is a specific clause saying that the renewal is solely at the discretion of the owner you remember how we had that young man in that apartment who was an exercise nut at least once a week hed drop a barbell and always in the middle of the night bessie was sure the house would cave in you know how she loved this place after she finally got rid of him she added the renewal clause to the lease for the new tenants looks as though youve thought of everything willy observed i do feel sorry about telling them they have to move but ill be honestill be glad when theyre gone kate said vic baker is always underfoot looking for things to fix around here youd think he owned the house when they left an hour later willy and alvirah walked monsignor ferris to the door of the rectory the already cloudy sky was now completely overcast the wind had become sharp and the raw damp cold was bone penetrating theyre predicting a long winter alvirah said can you imagine in a couple of weeks having to tell those little kids that they cant go to home base where theyre safe and warm and comfortable it was a rhetorical question of course and as she asked it even alvirah was only half listening instead her attention was directed across the street where a young woman in a sweat suit was standing staring at the rectory monsignor tom she said see that woman dont you think theres something odd about the way shes just standing there he nodded i saw her there yesterday and then she was at early mass this morning i caught up to her before she left and asked if i could help her in any way she just shook her head and almost rushed away if she has a problem she wants to discuss i think im going to have to let her come to me willy put a restraining hand on alvirahs arm dont forget were due at home base to help cordelia with the rehearsal for the christmas pageant he reminded her meaning mind my own business well i suppose youre right alvirah agreed cheerfully she glanced across the street again the young woman was walking rapidly away headed west alvirah squinted to get a good look at her classic profile even as she admired her regal carriage she looks familiar she said flatly ill have to put on my thinking cap theyre talking about me sondra thought as she hurried away the townhouse she had been standing in front of was no longer under repair as it had been before there was no scaffolding to shield her today as she tried to decide what to do but what could she do certainly she couldnt buy back that moment seven years ago when she had crossed the street opened the stroller and left her baby on the rectory stoop if only if only she thought then dear god where can i turn what happened to her who took my little girl she fought back tears a cab with its light on was stopped in traffic she raised her hand to signal the driver the wyndham on west fiftyeighth between fifth and sixth she said as she got into the backseat first visit to new york the cabbie asked no but i havent been here in seven years she thought her first visit had been when she was twelve and her grandfather brought her here from chicago to a midori concert at carnegie hall he had brought her twice again after that someday you will play on that stage he had promised her solemnly you have the gift you can be as successful as she a violinist whose hands had been limited by arthritis cutting short his career her grandfather had made his living as a music teacher and critic and supported me sondra thought sadlywhen he was sixty years old he took me in she had been only ten when her young parents had been killed in an accident granddad devoted himself to me taught me everything he knew about music she reminded herself and he used every spare penny he could find to take me to hear the great violinists her talent had earned her a full scholarship to the university of birmingham and it was there in the spring of her freshman year that she met anthony del torre a pianist visiting the campus for a concert what followed should never have happened how could i have told granddad that i got involved with a man i knew was married she asked herself now i couldnt have kept the baby there was no money to pay for help i had years of schooling ahead of me and if i had told him what had happened it would have broken his heart as the cab made its way through the slow traffic sondra thought back to that wrenching time she thought about how she had saved money to come to new york she remembered checking into a cheap hotel on november th buying the baby clothes and diapers the bottles and formula and stroller she had located the hospital closest to the hotel and had planned to go to the emergency room when she went into labor she would of course have to give a false name and address but the baby had come so quickly on december rd there had been no time to get to the hospital early in the pregnancy she had decided that new york was where she would leave the baby she loved the city from her very first visit there with her granddad she knew that someday she would live in manhattan she had instantly felt at home there on that first visit her grandfather had taken her to st clements the church he had attended throughout his boyhood whenever i wanted a special favor i would kneel in the pew nearest bishop santoris picture and his chalice he told her from them i always received comfort sondra i went there when i realized there was no hope for the stiffening fingers that was the nearest i ever came to despair in the several days before the baby was born sondra had slipped in and out of st clements each time she had knelt in that pew she had watched the clergymen there shed seen the kindness in the face of monsignor ferris and knew that she could trust him to find a good home for her baby where is my baby now sondra wondered in despair shed been in agony since yesterday as soon as she checked into the hotel she had phoned the rectory and said she was a reporter following up on the story of the baby who had been left on the stoop of the rectory on december rd seven years ago the astonishment in the secretarys voice had warned her of what was to come a baby left at st clements im afraid youre wrong ive been here twenty years and nothing like that has ever happened the cab turned onto central park south i used to daydream that maybe the people who adopted the baby were pushing her in her carriage here along the park sondra thought where the baby could see the horses and carriages late yesterday afternoon she had gone to the public library and called up the microfilm of the new york newspapers of december th seven years ago the only reference to st clements that day was an article about a theft there stating that the chalice of bishop santori the founding pastor to whom many of the devout prayed had been stolen thats probably why the police were there when i called that night thats why the monsignor was outside sondra thought her distress growing and i believed it was because theyd found the baby then who had taken the baby she had left her in a paper shopping bag for added warmth maybe some kids had come by and pushed the stroller away and abandoned it without ever realizing she was there suppose the baby had died of exposure id go to prison sondra thought what would that do to granddad he keeps telling me that all the sacrifices hes made over the years have been worthwhile because of what ive become hes so proud that ill be playing a concert at carnegie hall on december rd its what he always dreamed offirst for himself and then for me the celebritystudded charity affair would introduce her to the new york critics yoyo ma plácido domingo kathleen battle emanuel ax and the brilliant young violinist sondra lewis were the main attractions she still could hardly believe it were here miss the cabbie said an edge in his voice with a start sondra realized that his irritation was due to the fact that hed already told her that once oh sorry the fare was she fished in her wallet for a fivedollar bill thats fine she said opening the door and starting to get out i dont think you really wanted to give me a fortyfive dollar tip miss sondra looked at the fiftydollar bill the cabbie was holding out to her oh thank you she stammered thats a big mistake lady lucky for you i dont take advantage of pretty young women as sondra exchanged the fifty for a fivedollar bill she thoughttoo bad you werent around when i traded my baby for my grandfathers good opinion of me and my own chance at success when they reached the building on amsterdam avenue formerly the goldsmith and son furniture emporiumthat now housed sister cordelias clothing thrift shop alvirah and willy went directly to the second floor it was four oclock and the children who regularly came to home base to take advantage of the afterschool facilities were sitting crosslegged on the floor around sister maeve marie the large area had been transformed into a kind of bright and cheery auditorium the faded linoleum was polished to the point that even the floorboards beneath the worn spaces glistened the walls were painted sunshine yellow and decorated with drawings and cutouts the children had made oldfashioned radiators whistled and thudded but thanks to willy and his nearmagical ability to fix the unfixable there was no mistaking the warmth they provided today is very special sister maeve marie was saying were going to begin practice for our christmas pageant willy and alvirah slipped into seats near the staircase and watched affectionately a regular volunteer at home base alvirah was in charge of the party that was to follow the pageant and willy would be playing santa claus the childrens expectant and lively eyes were riveted on sister maeve marie as she explained today were going to start learning the songs about christmas and chanukah that well be performing at the pageant then well study our lines isnt it wonderful that cordelia and maeve are making sure that everybody has a speaking part alvirah whispered everybody well lets hope its a short speaking part willy replied alvirah smiled you dont mean that want to bet sshh she patted his hand as sister maeve marie read off the names of the children who would be assigned to tell the story of chanukah rachel barry sheila cordelia appeared from downstairs and with her practiced eye glanced over the children seeing mischief about she walked over to jerry the lively sevenyearold who was poking the sixyearold seated next to him she tapped him lightly keep that up and ill find a new saint joseph she warned then turned and joined alvirah and willy when i got back there was another message from pablo torres she said hed gone to bat for us and i do believe he tried his best but he says there was no way he could get an extension on keeping this place open i think he was as happy as i was to hear about bessies townhouse he knows the block and said hes sure there wont be any problem transferring our operation there we can even take in more kids one of the volunteer salespeople at the thrift shop came rushing up the stairs sister kate durkin is on the phone asking to talk to you hurry shes crying her eyes out no traces remained of the festive luncheon they had enjoyed only a few hours earlier but once again willy alvirah monsignor ferris and sister cordelia sat at the same table they had dined at earlier in the day kate was with them quietly weeping i spoke to the bakers an hour ago she said i told them that i was turning the house over to home base and that i couldnt renew their lease and you say they produced a new will willy asked incredulously yes they said bessie had changed her mind that she hadnt been a bit happy at the prospect of having the house wrecked by a bunch of kids they also told me that she said the repairs vic has made and the painting hes done showed her that theyd keep the house in pristine condition just the way she wanted it you know how much she loved this house she married the judge to get it alvirah thought wryly when did she sign it just a few days ago on november th she showed me the previous will when i stopped in to see her on november th monsignor ferris said she seemed quite happy with it then that was when she asked me to make sure that kate could stay in the apartment after she transferred the house to the home base program bessie left me an income and according to the new will im allowed to live in the apartment in the bakers home rent free as though id stay here with those people the tears now ran freely down kates face i cant believe bessie would do this to me to leave this house to perfect strangers like that she knew i didnt like the bakers and to get an apartment somewhere else is impossible you know what the prices are in manhattan kates scared and shes angry and shes hurt alvirah thought but even worse she looked across the table and thought that for the first time since shed known her cordelia looked her age catching her sisterinlaws eye she said cordelia well think of something to keep home base going i promise cordelia shook her head not in under four weeks she said not unless the age of miracles isnt over monsignor ferris had been carefully studying the copy of the new will that vic baker had presented to kate from my experience it looks absolutely legitimate he commented its on bessies stationery we know that she was a good typist and that certainly is her signature take a look alvirah alvirah skimmed the page and a half and then reread it carefully it certainly sounds like bessie she admitted listen willy a home is like a child and as one nears the end it becomes important to surrender that home to the protection of those who would care for it in the most fitting manner i cannot be comfortable knowing that the daily presence of many small children will totally change the appearance and character of the pristine house for which i have sacrificed so much does she mean being married to judge maher willy asked he wasnt a bad little guy alvirah shrugged and continued to read therefore i leave my home to victor and linda baker who will care for it in a manner suited to its genteel quality genteel quality indeed she snorted as she laid the will on the table what could he more genteel than giving a helping hand to children she turned to the monsignor who witnessed this miserable piece of paper two of the bakers friends monsignor ferris said well get a lawyer of course just to see if theres anything to be done but it certainly looks legitimate to me willy had been observing alvirah for the past several minutes your brain cells are working honey i can tell he said they sure are alvirah conceded as she reached to turn on the microphone in her sunburst pin this will may sound like bessie in most ways but kate did you ever hear her use the word pristine no i dont think so kate said slowly what kind of things did she say when she talked about the house alvirah asked persisting in her probe of the new will oh you know bessie shed brag that you could eat a sevencourse meal off the floorthat sort of thing exactly alvirah said i know it looks bad but every bone in my body says that this will is a phony and kate cordeliai promise you that if theres any way to prove it then ill find that way im on the job sister maeve marie had remained at home base and continued the rehearsal for the christmas pageant although in her mind she conjured up the worst possible scenario to explain why sister cordelia willy and alvirah had raced off to see kate durkin somethings gone wrong and kates all upset was all that cordelia had time to tell her before she left was it possible that kate had been robbed or mugged maeve marie wondered she knew that sometimes felons would look through the death notices in the paper and would burglarize the deceaseds home when they thought the bereaved were at the funeral a former new york city cop herself with four policemen brothers maeve marie thought instantly of potential criminal activity all the children at home base had been assigned their parts for the pageant and told to practice their lines at home the chanukah story would be recited at the beginning of the pageant immediately followed by the chanukah song next would come the scene in which the decree from caesar augustus was read proclaiming a census and telling everyone to go to the village of his ancestors to be registered the play had been written by cordelia and alvirah and maeve marie had complimented them on including so many speaking parts in that first scene the kids loved that plus the lines were both simple and familiar but my fathers village is so far away it is such a long journey and there is no one to care for the children we must find someone because nothing is more important than that our children are safe cordelia had confessed that she was taking a few liberties with some of the dialogue but she had invited the housing inspectors to the pageant and she wanted to be sure to get the message across to them nothing is more important than that our children are safe the only children who had not been assigned lines at random were the three wise men the shepherds the virgin mary and saint joseph the ones selected for those parts were the best singers in the group and would lead the singing in the stable scene jerry nunez the biggest cutup among the younger children was to be saint joseph and stellina centino a grave and oddly composed sevenyearold was mary stellina and jerry lived on the same block and jerrys mother picked up both children at the end of the day stellinas mama took off for california when she was a baby mrs nunez explained to the nuns and her dad is away a lot her greataunt lilly raised her but now lately lillys been sick a lot poor woman and she worries so much you wouldnt believe how she worries about stellina she says gracie im eightytwo i gotta live another ten years anyhow so i can raise her thats my prayer stellina is such a beautiful child maeve thought as she blocked out the final tableau for the pageant curly darkblond hair that was clasped at the nape of her neck by a barrette fell down her back her porcelain complexion was enhanced by wide darkbrown eyes fringed with long black lashes jerry never one to be still began to make faces at one of the shepherds before maeve marie had a chance to admonish him stellina said jerry when you are saint joseph you have to be very good okay jerry agreed instantly assuming a frozen posture of almost exaggerated decorum the chorus of angels will begin to sing the shepherds will see the angels and listen and you tommy will point to them and then what do you say sister maeve marie asked i say shark the hellish angels sing sixyearold tommy suggested sister maeve marie tried not to smile lead us not into penn station she thoughtthats what my brothers used to tell me to say tommy had a smartaleck big brother at home chances were he had been coaching his younger brother tommy you have to get it right and if you dont listen you cant be the head shepherd she said firmly the rehearsal ended at six not a bad first practice maeve marie decided as she complimented the children on their performances the nice thing was that the kids were enjoying it she had enjoyed it as well although the pleasure she took in seeing the children learn their parts was tempered by her concern and growing sense of unease where was cordelia and what had gone wrong as she helped to sort out jackets and mittens and scarves maeve noticed that as usual stellina had carefully hung up her beautifully tailored blue winter jacket which the little girl had proudly explained her nonna had made for her by sixthirty all the children except jerry and stellina were gone most having waited for an adult or older sibling to walk them home at quarter of seven sister maeve marie brought the two of them downstairs to the thrift shop which was closed now five minutes later gracie nunez hurried in my boss she said rolling her eyes we had to get out some skirts two of the girls didnt show woulda been worth my job to tell her i had kids to worry about god bless you sister you have no idea what it means to know that the kids arc safely with you jerry say good night and thank you to sister stellina did not need to be reminded good night sister she said quietly and thank you very much then with a rare smile she added nonna is so happy that im to be the blessed mother she listens to me recite my lines every night and when she does she calls me madonna maeve locked the door behind them and quickly began turning off the lights cordelia must either still be with kate durkin or she stopped in for a visit with some of the old girls maeve decided she sighed with concern over what kind of news she would hear when she got home as she was putting on her coat she heard a tapping on the front window she turned to see the face of a man who appeared to be fortyish his features illuminated by the streetlight maeve stared at him with an excops intuitive sense of unease sister is my little girl still here i mean stellina centino he called stellinas father maeve hurried to the door and opened it with professional detachment she studied the thinfaced man immediately distrusting both his vague good looks and his hangdog expression im sorry mr centino she said coolly we didnt expect you stellina went home as usual with mrs nunez oh yeah okay lenny centino said i forgot my job keeps me out of town a lot okay sister ill see you next week i plan to be picking her up some nights take her to dinner and maybe even a movie i wanna give star a treat im proud of her shes turning into some goodlooking kid you should be proud shes a beautiful child in every way maeve marie said shortly she stood in the doorway and watched him leave she sensed something disturbing and unsettling about that man still troubled by concern for sister cordelia she made a final check of the premises turned on the security system and walked home through the dusting of snow that was promising to turn into another fullblown storm she found sister cordelia sitting with sister bernadette and sister catherine two elderly retired nuns who shared their apartmentconvent maeve i confess to being weary to the soul cordelia said and then proceeded to tell her about the newfound will left by bessie durkin maher instantly suspicious maeve asked questions about the new document aside from the use of the word pristine is there anything to suggest the will is a fake cordelia smiled wanly only alvirahs instinct she said sister bernadette who would be ninety on her next birthday had been nodding in an easy chair alvirahs instinct and something the lord told us cordelia she said you all know what i mean smiling at their puzzled expressions she murmured suffer the little children to come unto me i dont think bessie would have forgotten that however house proud she was stellina kept the key to the apartment in a zippered pocket of her coat nonna had given it to her hut had made her promise that she would never tell anyone it was there now she always used it when she got home so nonna wouldnt have to get up if she was resting it used to be that when she came home from school she would find nonna sewing in the small room where daddy always slept when he was home then theyd have milk and cookies and if nonna had clothes to deliver or someone to fit for a hem or a new dress stellina would accompany her greataunt and help carry the bags and boxes to the ladies homes but nonna had been going to the clinic a lot lately and that was why mrs nunez had suggested stellina should be at home base each day after school some nights if nonna was feeling well stellina would arrive home to find her in the kitchen dinner cooking on the stove and the apartment filled with the good warm smell of pasta sauce but tonight she found nonna lying in bed with her eyes closed stellina could see though that she wasnt asleep because her lips were moving shes probably praying stellina thought nonna prayed a lot stellina bent down to kiss her nonna im home nonna opened her eyes and sighed i was so worried your papa came home he said he was going to home base he said he wanted to take you out i dont want you to go out with him if ever he shows up there asking for you say that nonna wants you to go home with mrs nunez daddys home stellina asked trying to hide her distress at the news she wouldnt tell even nonna that she was sorry he had reappeared but she was whenever daddy was home he and nonna argued a lot and stellina didnt like to go out with him either because sometimes they visited people and he would argue with them too sometimes the people gave him money and hed argue about that usually saying that something he gave them was worth a lot more than the money hed received nonna leaned on her elbow sat up then got out of bed very slowly you must be hungry cara come ill fix dinner for you stellina reached out her arm to help steady nonna as she got up such a good girl nonna murmured as she headed into the kitchen stellina was hungry and nonnas pasta was always so good but tonight it was hard for her to eat because of her concern for her greataunt nonna looked so worried and her breathing was fast as though she had been running the click of the lock in the front door told them that daddy was home immediately nonna began to frown and stellinas mouth went dry she knew that there would be an argument soon lenny came into the kitchen and ran over to stellina and picked her up he swung her around and kissed her star baby he said ive missed you stellina tried to pull away he was hurting her put her down you roughneck nonna shouted get out of here stay out of here youre not welcome go away leave us alone lenny didnt display his usual anger he just smiled aunt lilly maybe i will go for good but if i do ill take star with me neither you nor anyone else can stop me dont forget im her daddy then he turned around and went out slamming the door behind him stellina could see that nonna was trembling and there was perspiration on her forehead nonna nonna its all right she said he wont take me away nonna began to cry stellina she said if i ever get sick and cant be here with you you must never go away with your daddy i will ask mrs nunez to take care of you but promise me never go away with him he is not a good man he gets in trouble as stellina tried to comfort her she heard her greataunt whisper he is the father he is the guardian dear god dear god what am i to do she wondered why her nonna was crying as usual when she was trying to solve a possible crime alvirah did not sleep the sleep of the just from the time she and willy turned out the light following the eleven oclock news which they had watched in bed alvirah was restless she spent the next six hours dozing her light sleep filled with vague unsettling dreams then she woke with a start finally at fivethirty deciding to take pity on willy who had frequently mumbled in his sleep are you all right honey she got up put on her favorite old chenille robe fastened on her sunburst pin with its tiny concealed recording microphone got her pen and the tabbed notebook in which she kept the record of her ongoing investigations made herself a cup of tea settled down at the small dining table overlooking central park turned on the microphone in her pin and began to think out loud its not beyond bessie who was always a true stickler and pain in the neck about her house to leave it to people who she thought would keep it up a certain way i mean its not as though she was throwing her sister out after all she did make sure that kate would have the upstairs apartment which is where she had planned to live anyway when she donated the ownership of the house to home base alvirahs jaw jutted out unconsciously as she went on bessie was never one to fall all over children as i recall in fact i remember when someone asked her if she was sorry she hadnt had a family she said people with children and people without them feel sorry for each other for a moment alvirah paused thinking how much she and willy would have loved to have had a family by now her grandchildren would probably be the age of the kids shed seen yesterday at home base she shook her head well never mind it wasnt to be she reminded herself briskly so lets assume she went on that bessie really did get upset at the prospect of kids running around her precious house and getting finger marks on the walls and scratches on the woodwork and of course by knowing that the furniture shed been polishing since she went to work for the judge and his wife fifty years ago would be replaced by kids paraphernalia remembering to check the microphone alvirah pushed the stop rewind and play buttons and listened for a moment to the tape its working she told herself gratefully and i sound as if im working up a head of steam well jam she decided clearing her throat she resumed her indignant recital so the only real clue we have so far to show that this new will might be false is that bessie was never known to use the word pristine she picked up her pen and turned to the next unused section of her looseleaf notebook the one that followed the case of the death of trinky callahan at the top of the page she wrote the case of bessies will then entered the first item in her investigation use of the word pristine now alvirah began to write quickly witnesses to the will who were they what were their backgrounds time the will was signed november th did kate meet the witnesses what did she think was going on if she was there and they asked to see bessie now im using the old gray matter alvirah thought she had recently been rereading agatha christies hercule poirot books while working on the crimes she had helped to solve she had tried to follow his method of deductive reasoning as she made the last entry in her plan of action alvirah looked at the clock seventhirtytime to close the notebook and turn off the microphone she decided willy would be awake soon and she wanted to have breakfast ready for him then sometime today i have to sit down alone with kate and go over these questions with her she thought suddenly another idea came to her and she snapped the microphone on again since she had written that first article for the new york globe about visiting cypress point spa after winning the lottery she and the editor there charley evans had become fast friends he could get the lowdown on vic and linda baker for her right away the little gray cells are really waking up she announced its time to get the globe researchers to dig up the dirt on the bakers dollars to donuts this isnt the first time that pair of phonies pulled a fast one the am mass at st clements usually had an attendance of about thirty people mostly the older retired parishioners but now that it was the season of advent the number attending was at least double that in his brief homily monsignor ferris spoke about advent as the season of waiting we are in the time when we anticipate the birth of the savior he said we anticipate the moment in bethlehem when mary gazed for the first time at her infant son a faint sob from the congregation riveted his attention on the pew near the painting of bishop santori the pretty young woman whom he had noticed earlier standing across the street from the rectory sat there her face was buried in her hands and her shoulders were shaking i have got to make her talk to me he thought but then he saw her reach into her purse put on dark glasses and slip down the aisle and out the door at ninethirty kate durkin began going through everything left in her late sisters room it would be a crying shame just to leave bessies clothes hanging in the closet when so many people need something to wear she decided the fourposter bed which for eight years bessie had shared with judge aloysius maher and from which she had gone to her maker seemed somehow to stand in silent reproach as kate took dresses and jackets from the closet some of the items she recognized as being at least twenty years old bessie was always telling me that there was no point in giving them away because maybe i could use them someday kate thought what she didnt seem to realize is that id have had to grow five inches for any of them to fit its a wonder she didnt leave them to linda baker too she thought bitterly the memory of yesterdays sudden revelations and the surprise will made kates eyes fill as she impatiently brushed away a tear and glanced at bessies desk the typewriter caught her eye it seemed to her that there was something she should remember but what was it she did not have time to think about what could have triggered her subconscious however having heard a sound behind her she turned to find vic and linda standing in the doorway oh kate linda said sweetly im so glad youre clearing bessies things out of the room for us the downstairs bell rang ill get it vic baker announced youre not taking over yet kate said to herself as she quickly followed him down the stairs a moment later kate saw the welcome sight of alvirah on the front steps and heard her ask is kate durkin the lady of the house on these pristine premises lenny had gotten back to the apartment at midnight and tiptoed to his bedroommostly cleared of the clothing lilly was mendingand gone to bed when he woke up at nine the next morning he was surprised to hear the sound of voices in the other bedroom then realized it was saturday and star had no school it also meant that aunt lilly probably was still in bed if she wasnt at mass she never had been the same after a bad fall last summer she tried to tell him she was fine but he had overheard her telling a neighbor that the doctor thought a blackout had been caused by a small stroke whatever had caused it he definitely had seen a big difference in lilly since he last had been here in september he had told her that hed been in florida working for a delivery company she responded that she was happy to know he had a regular job and that he shouldnt worry about stellina sure i shouldnt worry about star he thought aunt lilly would be happy if i never showed up here again well part of what i told her was true he thought as he reached for a cigarette i did make deliveries deliveries of little packages that made people happy but it was getting too risky down there so he thought he would come back to new york pick up some smalltime action and get to know star im just a nice concerned single father living in a respectable building with an old aunt he thought and thats good because this way when lilly closes her eyes for good star and i will at least know each other real well who knows i might even be able to put her to work for me he thought over the situation as he puffed his cigarette down to the stub ground it out in a tray with sewing supplies then decided to light another one to settle his nerves before he faced aunt lilly even when star had still been an infant and he would take her for an outing in her carriage lilly had been suspicious every time lenny smiled at the memory of all the goods he had been able to deliver while people smiled and cooed at his beautiful baby but when he got home lilly always peppered him with questions where did you walk where did you take her her blankets smell of smoke ill kill you if you took her to a bar she was always after him he knew though that he would have to be careful and not get lilly all worried about the little girl all he needed was to have his aunt get some crazy idea like trying to trace stars mother his supposed girlfriend whod gone to california through some of his connections he had managed to get a forged birth certificate for star the letter pinned to her blanket had said she was of irish and italian descent which worked out fine so im italian and her mother was irish lenny had decided and told his source to fill out the mothers name as rose ogrady he had thought of the song about rosie ogrady which he liked when he was younger he remembered some irish kid in his class used to sing it lilly would have a hell of a job trying to trace a rose ogrady in california lenny thoughtits a common name and a very big statebut any kind of inquiry was potential trouble and he wasnt going to let it happen he would have to start looking more like the concerned parent if he hoped to calm lilly down after yawning stretching scratching his shoulder blade and pushing back his lank dark hair lenny got out of bed he pulled on some jeans stuffed his feet into sneakers remembered to put on a tshirt then went down the hall to his aunts bedroom the door was open and he could see that as he had expected lilly was propped up in bed the room was neat but crowded with stars narrow cot wedged between the bed and the wall as he stood in the doorway stars back was to him and lilly was listening to her recite the lines from her part in the christmas pageant lilly had not noticed him so he stood back quietly while star sitting crosslegged on the bed her back ramrodstraight her curly darkblond hair escaping from the barrette said oh joseph it does not matter that they would not accept us at the inn the stable will give us shelter and the child will wait no longer to come to us bella bella madonna lilly said the blessed mother will be very pleased that you are to portray her she sighed and grasped stellinas hands and today i will begin to sew a white tunic and a blue veil for you to wear in the pageant stellina cara lilly looks like she should be in the hospital lenny thought with a twinge of alarm her skin was gray and he could see beads of perspiration on her forehead he was about to ask her how she was feeling but stopped and frowned as he glanced at the top of the dresser it was covered with a display of religious relics and statues of the holy family and saint francis of assisi those he was used toshe always had been superreligiousbut he still regretted that years ago lilly had found the silver cup from which he had pried the diamond thered been such a stink in the papers about it at the time because the cup that had been stolen had been the chalice of a famous bishop he knew it wouldnt have been smart to try to hock it at the time it was too big a risk for the few bucks it might bring instead he had tossed it in the back of his closet figuring hed get rid of it at some point like when he was in another city then lilly had gone on one of her cleaning rampages and found it said it looked like a chalice so he had to quickly come up with some dumb story about how it had belonged to stars mother rose he told lilly that her uncle a priest left it to her when he died so of course lilly polished it so that the silver gleamed like new and put it up with her statues oh well it made her happy lenny thought and not being able to hock it at the time probably kept him from getting in trouble it was a cinch nobody was looking for it now though and he wondered how much it would bring at least lilly hadnt found the note that had been pinned to stars blanket he had held on to that just in case anybody ever questioned where she came from and he had to prove he hadnt kidnapped her he had wedged the note into a crack between the top shelf and wall of his closet lilly could never reach it even when she used a dust mop to get at the shelf with a shrug lenny turned and went into the kitchen to check the refrigerator and grocery cabinet for breakfast makings lean pickings he thought lilly obviously hadnt been shopping lately he jotted a list of things to buy grabbed his jacket and went back to her room this time he entered the room with a big good morning how are my girls solicitously he asked lilly how she felt told star to be sure to do her homework and announced that he was on his way to the store after he rattled off the list of items he intended to buy lilly looked at him suspiciously but then relented and added a couple of things outside the air was sharp and he regretted not wearing his cap he would go to the diner and get a decent breakfast first he decided while he was there he would make a phone call to let his local sources know he was available to do their errands again which he was confident theyd be glad to hear and once dear aunt lilly is out of the picture ill be able to make little star a part of my operation lenny thought shell be a great partner for mewhod ever guess yes working hand in hand star and her daddy will have a good delivery business going he promised himself sondra felt the eyes of the monsignor following her when she fled from church trying to muffle her sobs she jogged hack to the hotel once there she showered ordered coffee then pressed cold wet cloths against her swollen eyes ive got to stop crying she told herself fiercely ive got to stop crying the concert was so very important and she had to be prepared at nine oclock she was scheduled to go to her rented studio in carnegie hall and practice for five hours she had to get herself together she knew she had been off form yesterday distracted not playing nearly to her usual standard but how can i think about anything but the baby sondra kept asking herself what happened to my little girl for these past seven years she had been picturing her living with a wonderful couple who maybe hadnt had a child of their own and who loved and worshiped her but now she had no idea who had found heror even if she had been found at all she looked in the mirror what a mess she thought her face was blotchy and her eyes swollen there was nothing more she could do about her eyes she decided but her long delicate fingers moved deftly as she dabbed base makeup over her face to cover the evidence of her tears ill walk past the rectory again this afternoon she decided that thought at least was calming it was the last place where she had seen her baby and she felt near to her when she was there also when she prayed at the portrait of bishop santori something of the same peace her grandfather had described feeling when he prayed there all those years ago seemed to come to her her prayer was not to have the baby back i dont have the right to ask for that she thought just give me a way to know shes safe and loved thats all i ask she had taken a parish bulletin from st clements and now she dug it out of the pocket of her jogging jacket yes she saw there was a five oclock mass she would attend it but she would arrive a little late that way the monsignor wouldnt have a chance to try to speak to her then she would slip out again before it was over as she twisted her darkblond hair gathering it up at the back of her head she wondered if the baby had grown to look even a little bit like her over a pot of tea and a generous slice of kate durkins meltinyourmouth crumb cake alvirah began to form a plan of action aimed at saving the townhouse from the clutches of the bakers isnt it awful to think that you have to keep your voice down in your own home kate asked those two are always pussyfooting around just before you arrived my heart almost stopped when i turned around and saw the two of them watching me thats why i closed the door just now then she glanced at the copy of her sisters will and sighed i guess i cant do anything about it though they seem to have everything in their favor well see about that alvirah said firmly as she turned on the microphone in her sunburst pin ive got a whole bunch of questions for you so lets get started now monsignor came over to see you on friday the th he said that there was no question in his mind that bessie would be leaving the house to you although he did know that she was unhappy at the prospect of having kids mess it up kate nodded her soft blue eyesmagnified by large round glasseswere thoughtful you know bessie she said she was so set in her ways and she complained about how nothing would be the same here with a bunch of kids running around but i remember that then she sort of laughed and said well at least by then i wont be here to clean up after themthatll be yourjob kate that was friday the th right alvirah asked how was bessie over the weekend tired her heart was just giving out and she knew it she had me get out her blue print dress and have it pressed then she told me that when her time came i should put her pearls on her she said they really werent valuable but they were the only jewelry the judge ever gave her other than the wedding band of course and that neither one was worth leaving to anyone then she said you know kate aloysius was really a good man if id married him when i was young i probably would have had a family of my own and wouldnt have had a chance to get so fussy about scratches and finger marks that was saturday alvirah asked actually sunday then on monday she supposedly had the new will witnessed didnt you hear her banging away on the typewriter before that what did you think when the witnesses came in for the signing i never saw them kate replied shaking her head you know how i always volunteer for a couple of hours at the hospital on monday and friday afternoons bessie would never hear of me not going she seemed pretty good when i leftshe was sitting downstairs in her chair in the parlor watching television i remember she said shed be glad to be rid of me for a few hours that she was feeling all right and getting sick of me looking worried and where was she when you got home why still there watching one of her soap operas all right now the next thing i want to do is talk to those two witnesses alvirah studied the last page of the will do you have any idea who they are ive never heard of them kate replied well i intend to call on them their address is here under their signatures james and eileen gordon on west seventyninth alvirah looked up as vic baker pushed open the door to the dining room without knocking having a nice little cup of tea he asked with forced joviality we were alvirah said just wanted to let you know that were going out for a bit but when we come back well be glad to help you carry dear bessies clothing downstairs were going to take good care of bessies possessions alvirah told him you dont have to worry about a thing the cheery expression disappeared from bakers face i happened to have overheard what you just said about speaking to the witnesses mrs meehan he snapped ill be happy to give you their phone number youll find them to be perfectly responsible people he fished in his pocket as a matter of fact i have their card baker handed alvirah the card then turned and walked out pulling the door closed behind him with a bang both women turned and watched as the door slowly swung open again it wont stay closed kate said hes one of those fixit guys who talks a good game and obviously he impressed bessie the truth is he can use a paintbrush but thats about it she pointed to the door did you notice he didnt turn the knob just now he pushed the door open it used to stick so he shaved it down now it doesnt even catch same thing in the parlorthats become a swinging door she sniffed alvirah was only half listening she was studying the card vic baker had given her this is a business card she said the gordons have a real estate agency now how about that he may not be able to fix doors but he sure can get a will done alvirah told willy late that afternoon when he arrived home and found her sitting dejectedly in the living room of their apartment jim and eileen gordon seem like straight arrows to me how did they happen to become witnesses to the will according to them almost accidentally it seems that vic baker has been looking at townhouses and condos ever since he moved here nearly a year ago they say theyve taken him out a number of times to look at homes he had an appointment with them at three oclock on the th to see some place on eightyfirst street and while they were there linda apparently called him on his cell phone she told him bessie wasnt feeling well and wanted to get her new will witnessed vic asked the gordons if they would mind so the gordons went along andnow this is the part thats so upsettingthey tell me vic and linda both nearly fell over in a faint when bessie read the will to them before she signed it if the gordons have been taking baker out looking at real estate they must have checked his credit willy said did you ask about that they did believe it or not the bakers are well fixed she attempted a smile cordelia keep you busy today i never got up for air a pipe broke at the thrift shop and i couldnt fix it until i turned off all the water good thing it was saturday and there were no kids upstairs well that wont be a problem soon alvirah said with a sigh and unless my gray cells come up with something im missing there wont be a place for them anywhere she reached up and flipped on the microphone in her sunburst pin deftly she rewound the last bit of tape then pressed the play button eileen gordons pleasant voice was clear and easy to understand the last thing mrs maher said was that now she could die in peace knowing her home would remain pristine i swear that miserable word pristine is the key alvirah said as the dejected look left her face what is that expression monsignor always uses when hes suspicious about something something is rotten in the state of denmark willy replied is that what you mean thats it in this case though i think theres something rotten on the upper west side alvirah said and im going to keep dropping in on the gordons and talking to them until i find out just what it is i think theyre good people but still theres something fishy about them just happening to be witnesses maybe theyre very good actors and im falling for their baloney talking about baloney willy said lets have an early dinner im starving they were going out the door at sixthirty when monsignor ferris phoned kate was at mass he said she told me you went to see the witnesses how did it go alvirah gave him a fast rundown assuring him she wasnt giving up then before saying goodbye she added has that young woman we saw yesterday been around again she was here twice today this morning she came to mass then left during the sermon she seemed to be in great distress over something then i spotted her at the five oclock but again i didnt have a chance to talk to her alvirah you said you thought she looked familiar any idea who she is or where you might have seen her before id really like to try to help her ive been searching my mind but so far i havent come up with it alvirah replied regretfully but give me time the thing is i am sure ive seen her picture somewhere but i just cant place it two hours later as she and willy passed carnegie hall on their way home from dinner she stopped in the middle of a sentence and pointed willy look its that girl a glasscovered poster for the christmas concert included photographs of the artists who would be performing including plácido domingo kathleen battle yoyo ma emanuel ax and sondra lewis alvirah and willy went over to read the caption under sondra lewiss picture even in this photo she appeared sadeyed and unsmiling why would a girl about to make her carnegie hall debut be so unhappy willy asked clearly puzzled obviously it has something to do with st clements alvirah told him and i intend to figure out what that ones all about too when she had been very little stellina had asked nonna why she didnt have a mother like the other children nonna had said that stellinas mother left her with her daddy because when she was born her mother became very sick and had to go to california to try to get better nonna said that her mother had been very sad to leave her that she had promised if she ever got better she would come to see her but nonna also told stellina that she thought that might never happen and that she personally believed that god had called stellinas mother to heaven then just when stellina was starting kindergarten nonna had showed her the silver chalice she had found in daddys closet and explained that her mothers uncle a priest had given it to stellinas mother and that she had left it for stellina nonna explained that the cup had been used to celebrate mass and was blessed in a very special way the cup became a talisman for stellina and sometimes when she was just going off to sleep and was thinking about her mother wishing so much that she could see her she would ask nonna if she could hold it nonna teased her about it at the time babies give up their security blankets stellina now that youre a big girl and going to school you decide you need one she had said but she always smiled and never refused to let stellina hold the cup sometimes in english sometimes in italian and frequently in a mixture of both she would reassure this wonderful little girl the only real gift her otherwise worthless nephew had given her ah bambina nonna would whisper i will always take care of you stellina didnt tell nonna that when she twined her fingers around the cup it was as if she could feel her mothers hands still holding it on sunday afternoon as she watched nonna sew the blue veil she was to wear in the pageant stellina had an idea she would ask nonna if she could take the cup to the pageant and pretend that as the blessed mother she was giving it to the baby jesus nonna protested oh no stellina it might get lost and besides the blessed mother had no silver to give to the baby jesus it wouldnt be right stellina didnt argue but she knew she had to find a way to persuade nonna to let her bring the cup to the stable she knew exactly the prayer she would say when she brought it there if my mother is still sick please make her well and please please ask her to visit me just one time at manhattan s th police precinct detective joe tracy expressed keen interest in the fact that lenny centino had once again resurfaced he remembered lenny from an investigation hed been involved with a few years back he hadnt been able to tie him directly to the crime which had involved the sale of drugs to minors but he was certain that lenny was one of the guilty parties tracys partner pointed out that the rap sheet on lenny was minor leaguejust a few breaking and enterings pennyante stuffbut tracy was convinced that it was only because lenny had not been caught sure he served a little time tracy argued juvenile detention twentyfive years ago record expunged but in my opinion he only learned new tricks of his trade he was arrested a few times but never indicted we never could pin anything definite on him but i always was sure he was distributing drugs to high school kids i remember how i used to see him pushing his kid in her carriage all over the west side i heard later that the kid was just a coverupthat he stashed his stuff in the carriage right there with the baby tracy tossed his slim folder on lenny centino back on the desk well now that hes back im going to keep my eye on him if i see him with that little girl i may just bring him in hell make a mistake eventually and when he does i intend to be there on monday morning as she and willy were eating breakfast alvirah answered the phone and was delighted to hear the welcome voice of her editor charley evans announce that while they never had been convicted vic and linda baker were clearly worldclass con artists wait a minute she interrupted i want to record everything so i wont forget a word she ran to the bedroom for her sunburst pin turned on the microphone and hurried back okay charley shoot she said as she held the pin to the phone the bakers make a habit of preying on elderly people with property charley said the most recent case was in charlestown last year where they got friendly with an old man worth a couple of million bucks he apparently was mad at his daughter at the time angry about the guy she married but he never indicated that he intended to disinherit her according to witnesses these two crooks kept filling his ears with stories about his daughter and how she couldnt wait to get her hands on his money guess what they came up with a new will alvirah suggested you guessed it the old guy left his daughter a few bucks and her mothers jewelry everything else went to the bakers you see they were smart enough not to grab everything that would have been easier to contest what about witnesses to the will alvirah asked solid citizens all of them thats about what i expected she said with a sigh i found two or three other similar cases in the last ten years but you get the idea the wills have all been contested but each time the bakers won hands down they wont this time alvirah vowed i hope not for your friends sake but heres a little free advice tell her to go down to surrogates court at chambers street and file a notice of intent to contest because of undue influence otherwise the will could be probated in anywhere from a couple of days to a couple of months depending on the judge if she files the notice it will at least delay transfer of assets whos the executor vic baker they thought of everything charley commented okay alvirah let me know if i can help and dont forgeti want a column out of this you bet youll get one and ive got the headline for it alvirah said write it down exposing the skunks charley chuckled go for it alvirah my moneys on you over her third cup of tea alvirah told willy about the conversation now honey willy admonished your jaw is sticking out six feet i know youre going to do your best but youve got to promise me you wont get into any danger im getting too old to worry about your being pushed off terraces or drowned in bathtubs the bakers arent the type to do anything like that alvirah said dismissively theyre not violent just sneaky what has cordelia got lined up for you today home base willy said shaking his head you know honey i have to agree with the inspectors that place is falling apart you can do just so much in the way of repairs with bubblegum and elmers glue after that you need to call in the heavy machinery but anyhow im going to get in an hours practice on the piano too cordelia heard me banging out all through the night when i was over there to fix that leak yesterday and now shes decided to make that the closing song of the pageant and wants me to play it she has some crazy idea that having me take part will show the kids that you can learn something new at any age thats wonderful alvirah said her face beaming well i think its a lousy idea willy said but kids arent judgmental and the parents will only be looking at their own kids so maybe nobodyll even notice me anyhow what are you up to im going to stop in on kate you know how it is when someone dies everyone comes around for a couple of days then after the funeral the person whos been left behind wakes up and it sinks in that shell never see that face or hear that voice again thats when friends are really needed and doubly so in kates case because she has to put up with those crooks as well as missing bessie then after i see her im going to see monsignor tom and tell him i know who the young woman is whos been hanging around st clements with her usual efficiency alvirah tidied the kitchen made the bed showered and then dressed choosing one of the simple but elegant pantsuits her friend baroness min von schreiber had helped her to buy on mins last trip east as mm constantly pointed out left on her own alvirah gravitated to wildly inappropriate styles and colors an opinion alvirah humbly accepted as she was about to go out she paused long enough to listen to willy at the piano practicing all through the night proudly she noted that he was playing with increasing skill her lips silently formed the words as he sang the verses the line i my loving vigil keeping seemed to her almost like a prayer well im keeping a vigil for you kate she thought when she arrived at the townhouse she was shocked to find a calm but resolute kate who announced that after much thought she had decided to find some other place to live even if it was only a furnished room she said if bessie wanted the bakers to have her house then so be it bessies intentions had been clear and she had left kate the use of the apartment and an income but i cant live in the same house as these people alvirah kate said every time i think of bessie sick as she was sitting at her desk and typing that will then making sure to get witnesses in when she knew id be outwell i just get a pain like a knife through me kate you just reminded me of something i hadnt thought of the will was signed last monday november th right but it was dated november th exactly that was the day after bessie told monsignor she didnt like the idea of turning the house into a childrens center so even when she was joking with me about it over the weekend saying it was going to be my problem dealing with all those children she was sitting at that typewriter while i was out how often were you out last weekend alvirah asked just to morning mass both saturday and sunday but bessie was a fast typist you know how proud she was of that she could have typed that will in twenty minutes oh kate alvirah said her heart ached as she looked at her old friend all the fight seemed to have left kate her shoulders were slumped in defeat and the spark that gave wiry strength to her small frame seemed to have been extinguished alvirah knew it was no use arguing with hershe had made up her mind the best she could do was stall for time kate she said just do me one favor ive been making some calls about the bakers already ive found out that they are known to be con artists theyve just never been arrestedyet give me till christmas to prove that bessie didnt write that will and even though it looks like she signed it i bet if she did she never knew what she was signing kates eyes widened oh alvirah theres no way to prove that yes there is alvirah said with a hearty confidence she did not feel and i already know where to start as soon as i see monsignor tom im going to the james and eileen gordon real estate agency and tell them im hunting for a coop those two are going to see a lot of me in the next couple of weeks maybe theyre part of the bakers scheme or maybe theyve just had the wool pulled over their eyes but one way or another im going to find out which it is lenny centino had managed to stay out of prison by not being too greedy the deliveries he made of drugs were smalltime and infrequent so except for having attracted the unwanted attention of detective joe tracy he was never high on the hit list of any police officer also he never actually sold drugs he just delivered them which if he were caught carried a lighter sentence the drugs had been paid for in advance so he never handled the money either he had earned a reputation among both dealers and users of being dependable and of never dipping into the goods so he was in demand still because he liked to limit his involvement with the always dangerous drug trade lenny worked off and on for a reputable liquor store making deliveries for them he was able to scope out peoples apartments he was a gifted burglarhe always made his hit when he was sure people were out and he never bothered with anything but jewelry and money his earlier very satisfactory career of robbing poor boxes and votive candle offering boxes had ended with his theft at st clements the churchs silent alarm and his unwitting kidnapping of star had made him realize that he was getting too close to the edge now even the smaller churches were getting smart enough to put in silent alarms that was why it was with confidence in his own ability to survive that he let his contacts know that he was back in the city and once again available over a couple of beers on monday afternoon he had bragged about what hed been doing since september helping to run a scam for a fake computer company what lenny did not know was that an undercover cop had infiltrated the group he was boasting to and when the cop had filed his report at the precinct detective tracy had picked up on it and now had lenny under surveillance which included a wiretap what the police did not know was that lenny feared just such a situation and had an exit planned he had a stash of money from the last job along with a fake identity and a hideout all arranged in mexico but since his return to new york lenny had added another element to the exit scenario it was obvious that aunt lilly was dying he was genuinely fond of star and she always had been an asset to his operation she was also his goodluck charm so he had decided that if he ever had to get out of the country hed take her with him and as he often told himself i am her daddy and it wouldnt be right to abandon her unspoken but perhaps even more pertinent was lennys awareness that a man traveling with a little girl would be unlikely to appear to anyone to be a crook on the run sondra had promised herself that she wouldnt go near st clements again if granddad werent coming in for the concert id go to the police right now she thought i cant live like this any longer if someone found the baby in those few minutes and read the note and decided to keep her and shes being raised in new york then there might be a fake birth certificate it would have been easy enough for someone to claim the baby was delivered at home in that hotel no one knew that i had given birthi never had a single pain all the pain has come afterwards she reflected as she lay awake sunday night as dawn was breaking she finally drifted off after having slept for only a few hours she awoke with a blinding headache she got up and listlessly put on her jogging clothes a run might clear my head she decided ive got to be able to concentrate on practice today ive done so many things wrongi dont want to add ruining the concert for granddad to the list she had promised herself that she would stay in central park today but when she came near the northern end of the park her feet turned west minutes later she was standing across the street from st clements remembering once again the moment when she had held her baby for the last time it had warmed up a little and the street was busier so she knew she couldnt dawdle for fear of drawing attention to herself the snow that had been arctic white on thursday was now almost fully melted and the remaining dregs covered with soot it was very cold that night she remembered and the snow on the sides of the street was icy that secondhand stroller had a stain on the side i scrubbed the inside but it was so terribly shabby that i hated to lay the baby in it even for a minute someone at the hotel had thrown out the shopping bag i used as extra protection i remember it had a sloans logo on it i bought the bottles and formula at a duane reade pharmacy sondra felt a tap on her shoulder startled she turned to see the concerned face of a somewhat plump redheaded woman of about sixty you need help sondra alvirah said gently and im the one to give it to you they took a cab back to central park south once in the apartment alvirah made a pot of tea and popped bread in the toaster ill bet you havent had a bite to eat today she said once again close to tears sondra nodded in agreement she felt a kind of unreality coupled with a great sense of relief now that she was in this strange apartment with this strange woman she felt comfortable she knew she was going to tell alvirah meehan about the baby and she sensed just from alvirahs presence that alvirah would somehow find a way to help her twenty minutes later alvirah told her firmly now listen sondra the first thing youve got to do is to stop beating up on yourself that was seven years ago you were a kid you didnt have a mother you felt responsible to your grandfather you had your baby all by yourself but you planned for it and you planned well you had clothes and formula and bottles all ready and you saved every nickel so the baby would be born in new york because you knew you wanted to live here someday you dressed the baby and put her nice and warm and safe in a stroller on the stoop of the church rectory you had chosen the church that had saved your grandfather when he knew his arthritis was robbing him of the gift he had as a violinist you phoned the rectory less than five minutes later and you thought the baby had been found by someone there yes sondra said but suppose some kids just pushed the stroller away as a joke suppose the baby froze to death and when someone found her they didnt want to be blamed suppose suppose some good people found her and shes now the light of their lives alvirah said with a conviction she didnt feel good people would have called the police and then tried to adopt her she thought they wouldnt have kept quiet about it all these years i cant ask more than that sondra said i dont deserve more than that because i just dont know you deserve a lot more than you think you do give yourself credit alvirah told her briskly now youve jot to get on with your violin practice and give new york music lovers a treat you leave the detecting to me then spontaneously she added sondra do you know how beautiful you are when you smile youve got to do more of that hear me over yet another cup of tea bit by bit she drew sondra out can you imagine what it was like for my poor grandfather living alone a music critic and violin teacher to be suddenly stuck with a tenyearold child to raise sondra asked a smile playing around her lips he had a very nice fourroom apartment in a good building on lake michigan in chicago but still it was tiny and he couldnt afford more space what did he do when you moved in alvirah asked he changed his whole life for me he turned his study into a bedroom and gave me the big bedroom whenever he went out he hired someone to come in and mind me and cook for me i might add granddad loved to go out to dinner with his friends and of course he went to many concerts there were a lot of things he had loved to do that he gave up for me youre putting yourself down again alvirah said interrupting i bet he was lonely before you came i bet he took great comfort in having you with him sondras smile got wider maybe but the tradeoff in having me as company was his freedom to come and go all the little luxuries he had enjoyed the smile vanished i guess i did make it up to him in a way i am a good musician a good violinist bingo alvirah said youre finally saying something good about yourself sondra laughed you know alvirah you do have a way with words thats what my editor says alvirah agreed okay i get the picture you felt the responsibility to succeed you won the scholarship you met someone attractive and gifted youd just turned eighteen and you fell for him he probably told you how crazy he was about you and lets face it you were vulnerable you didnt have a mother and father or brothers and sisters instead you had a grandfather who by then was starting to get sick have i got it straight yes we know the rest lets skip to the present no one as pretty and talented as you are lives in a vacuum have you got a boyfriend no too quick an answer sondra which means you do have one who is he there was a long silence gary willis hes on the board of the chicago symphony sondra said reluctantly hes thirtyfour eight years older than i am very successful very handsome very nice and he wants to marry me so far so good alvirah volunteered and you dont care about him i could im just not ready for marriage right now im an emotional basket casei know that im afraid that if i do get married ill never be able to look at my newborns face without knowing that i left its sibling in a shopping bag out in the cold gary has been very patient and understanding with me youll get to meet him hes bringing my grandfather in for the concert i like the sound of him already alvirah said and dont forget ninety percent of women today juggle husbands or families and careers i know i did sondra looked around the tastefully furnished apartment and out over the spectacular view of central park what do you do alvirah right now my career is lottery winner problem solver and contributing columnist to the new york globe until three years ago i was a spectacular cleaning woman sondras chuckle indicated she wasnt sure whether to believe her or to take what she said as a joke but alvirah did not elaborate plenty of time later for the history of my life she thought they got up together i must get to practice sondra said ive got a coach coming today who has a reputation that sends chills down the spines of performers like me well you go and give it your all alvirah said im going to figure out a way to try to track down that baby of yours without anyone knowing whos doing it ill call you every day i promise alvirah granddad and gary will be coming in the week before the concert i know granddad will want to go to st clements hell be so sad to hear that bishop santoris chalice is missing but in case we should run into monsignor ferris when were there will you talk to him first and explain that you and i have talked and ask him please not to let granddad know ive been hanging around the church absolutely alvirah said promptly when they walked through the living room sondra stopped at the piano where john thompsons book for mature beginners was on the rack open to all through the night she stopped and played the melody with one hand id forgotten all about that song its lovely isnt it without waiting for an answer she played it again and softly sang sleep my child and peace attend thee all through the night guardian angels god will send thee all through the night she stopped sort of appropriate isnt it alvirah her voice broke i hope my baby found a guardian angel that night she looked suddenly as if she might cry ill call you alvirah promised as sondra rushed out are you all through with me cordelia willy asked wearily both toilets are working but i would suggest you tell the kids not to throw wads of tissue in them think of those pipes as belonging in an oldage home which is where i feel i should be right now he added with a sigh nonsense sister cordelia said briskly youre still a young man william just wait till you get to be my age there was a tenyear difference between the siblings cordelia the day youre a hundred youll still have more energy than a rockette willy told her speaking of which im supposed to watch a runthrough of the pageant come on lets get upstairs the kids will be going home soon sister cordelia said grasping willy by the arm and propelling him toward the staircase it was quarter of six and the rehearsal for the pageant was in full swing they had reached the final scene in the stable a solemnfaced stellina was kneeling across from a merryeyed jerry nunez over the folded blanket that was substituting for the crib of the christ child the wise men led by josé diaz were approaching from the left and the shepherds were gathering from the right slow down all of you sister cordelia ordered she raised then lowered her hands one step at a time and dont push jerry keep your eyes down youre supposed to be looking at the baby not at the shepherds willy play the closing song she said i left the sheet music home cordelia i didnt think id be here this long well sing it then god blessed you with a voice start to sing very low the way youll do when youre at the piano then bring up the volume the children will join in starting with stellina and jerry then the wise men and the shepherds then finally the chorus willy knew better than to argue with his sister sleep my child he began jose ill hang you out to dry if you trip denny sister cordelia said interrupting go ahead start again willy at guardian angels god will send thee stellina and jerry joined in their young voices sweet and true combined with willys tenor as they sang the next two lines together what a beautiful voice that kid has willy thought as he listened to stellina i swear she has perfect pitch he studied her solemn brown eyes a sevenyearold shouldnt look so sad he thought as the wise men and shepherds and then all the students joined in soft the drowsy hours are creeping hill and vale in slumber steeping i my loving vigil keeping all through the night at the end willy sister cordelia sister maeve marie and the assorted volunteer aides applauded vigorously just be this good two weeks from now at the actual performance and well all be happy cordelia told the children now put on your coats and hats and dont get them mixed up your folks will be here to collect you and they shouldnt be kept waiting theyve been working all day and theyre tired she turned to willy and i might add so am i she said it makes me feel good to know that even you have some limits willy said okay since ive been here this long i may as well hang around and help you clean up twenty minutes later he and the two nuns were at the door waiting for mrs nunez to pick up stellina and jerry when she arrived breathless and contrite they waved away her apologies sister cordelia pulled her aside how is stellinas greataunt doing she asked not good mrs nunez whispered shaking her head shell be in the hospital before the week is out is my guess she crossed herself quickly well at least the fathers back thats something i suppose she sniffed as if to make it clear just how little faith she put in stellinas father when mrs nunez and the children had left sister cordelia said that poor child her mother deserted her when she was an infant shes going to lose the greataunt who raised her and the father doesnt seem to be around much from what i gather he isnt worth a hill of beans hes worth less than that sister maeve marie interjected friday evening he tried to pick stellina up after she was already gone he looked a little unsavory to me so i made some inquiries about him with the boys at the precinct keeping your hand in at your old job detective willy asked it doesnt hurt from the rumors it sounds like mr centino could be headed for big trouble which means that lovely child could end up in a foster home or a series of foster homes sister cordelia said sadly and in a few weeks we wont be able even to watch out for her anymore she sighed all right enough go home willy youve been great and you can pick up your paycheck at the end of the week very funny he smiled acknowledging her customary joke as they left the building they stood together for a moment on the sidewalk have a glass of wine and relax you two willy said i would take you out to dinner but i havent spoken to alvirah since she called at noon to say she was going condo hunting so i dont know when well be eating cordelia looked astonished youre kidding i thought you loved the place youre in why alvirah always said shed have to be carried out of that apartment dont tell me shes serious about buying a different one of course not willy assured her shes just trying to get a line on that real estate couple who witnessed bessie signing the will shes hoping that if she goes out enough with one or the other of them she might find out there was something fishy about that witnessing anyhow im on my way but you girls have done a great job that pageant is going to be terrific you ought to invite the mayorlet him see what youre doing the compliment did nothing to put cheer in their worried faces and when he got home an equally troubled alvirah was waiting for him ive walked my feet off looking at condos with eileen gordon she said learn anything willy asked yes shes a lovely person and id stake my life she wouldnt take a sip of water that didnt belong to her even if she was choking so that means the bakers probably pulled the old onetwo on her and her husband willy said practically yes but i was so hoping theyd turn out to be phonies too its easier to trap crooks than to convince innocent bystanders that theyve been duped alvirah said with a sigh monsignor thomas ferriss association with st clements had begun forty years earlier when he was a newly ordained priest after seven years he had been transferred to a parish in the bronx following that he was assigned to the cardinals staff at the cathedral office ten years ago he had returned to st clements as pastor and it was there that he hoped to spend the rest of his active life he acknowledged to himself that st clements was his heart home he took great pride in the churchits history and its important position in the community the only incident that had marred his tenure and one that still bothered him seven years later was the theft of bishop santoris chalice i blame myself because it happened on my watch he would say to brother priests who knew how strongly he felt about the loss there had been warnings about a string of church breakins but we just hadnt paid sufficient heed sure wed had the windows and doors alarmed but it wasnt enough we should have installed a motion detector i talked about it but just never got around to it and while the cabinet containing the bishops chalice had been equipped with a silent alarm it had proved useless in this situation by the time the police had arrived the thief and the chalice were gone the loss always hit monsignor tom especially hard at the christmas season because it was during advent that the chalice had disappeared and while he and the parishioners constantly prayed for its return his prayers were especially fervent at this time of year some saints are born and not madetom ferris believed that he always held that they are born with an inner goodness that makes its presence felt no matter what the circumstance he had met bishop santori near the end of the bishops life after he had retired from official duties the bishop had lived at st clements until his death the man had an aura of holiness about him ferris reflected that same aura had surrounded cardinal cooke on monday evening as the monsignor began to lock up the church he passed the confessional the thief who stole the chalice had to have been hiding in there he thought if the diamond in the chalice had been what he was after i can only pray that the cup itself wasnt tossed away into a garbage dump the monsignor actually didnt believe that the chalice had been destroyed in fact recently he had been struck with the fanciful notion that the theft had taken place because the chalice was needed elsewhere that in exile from its home at st clements it was fulfilling a greater mission as he left the church and locked the door behind him he found himself automatically looking across the street to see if the mysterious young woman was there again today when he saw she wasnt he experienced a moment of regret he hoped she would be back many times he had had the experience of people hovering nearby reluctant to unburden themselves to him who then finally screwed up their courage and approached him monsignor i need help is how they usually began his housekeeper had left dinner for him in the oven his curate was out for the evening so tom ferris had the luxury of reading without interruption while he ate the simple meal and sipped a glass of wine when he had finished he dutifully rinsed the dishes and put them in the dishwasher remembering with some amusement the old days when the pastorusually known among his six or seven curates as the bossreigned as absolute monarch and when the rectory came with a housekeeper who could cook like a dream and happily provided and served delicious meals three times a day it was over coffee that the tranquil part of his evening ended with a phone call from alvirah monsignor tom she said i have a friend with a problem and while i think i may have figured out a solution i need to talk with you about it you see im writing a column about a young girl who seven years ago gave birth and left her newborn on the stoop of a rectory she paused and im telling you this because it was your rectory alvirah that never happened yes it did but you didnt know anything about it im convinced that it really did happen anyway the point is that my editor will feature the story on the first page and since weve got to protect the identity of the mother we want any calls to be directed to you because after all it wasyour rectory ill offer a big reward for information about the baby you just have to handle the calls that come in alvirah slow down i cant this is the perfect time for this kind of story to come out for one thing people pay more attention to this kind of humaninterest story at christmas and for another the child just turned seven last week im writing the piece right now and i need to know if its all right to use your name as intermediary id want to see what youve written first he said cautiously of course we really appreciate your cooperation and im sorry to have to impose this way but through the article and the reward were sure to get a lot of attention were really hoping to locate the little girl and were hoping that if we dont say who the mother is some dogooder wont try to make an example of her and have her arrested for abandonment or child abuse the point is is it better if you dont know who she is let me think about that he said its not a problem for me alvirah said i can claim journalistic privilege if i get questioned there is a way that i cant be forced to reveal her identity ferris thought but the seal of the confessional is not to be used as a convenience wait a minute alvirah you said this happened just about exactly seven years ago are you talking about the night the chalice was stolen was that when the baby was left yes apparently it was when the mother phoned the rectory an old priest answered she asked to speak with you and he told her that the police were there because of some great excitement and that you were outside with them she thought youd found the baby already he made up his mind write your story alvirah im with you monsignor ferris hung up the phone with a sense of wonderment was it possible that whoever took the baby might have seen the thief leaving the church and be able to provide at last a clue to his identity by helping this unfortunate mother the monsignor might be able to also put to rest the nagging question of what happened to the chalice whenever she went into bessies room there was no question in kate durkins mind that something was slightly out of order but just what it was still eluded her exasperated by the nagging sensation she finally prayed to saint anthony for help in finding whatever it was whose whereabouts she couldnt recall in the course of her prayer she did admit to him that usually she was asking him for help with something tangible like her glasses or pocketbook or her one piece of good jewelry the tiny solitaire diamond in a tiffany setting that had been her mothers engagement ring that time it had taken saint anthony two weeks to help her remember that she had hidden it in an empty aspirin bottle when she and bessie had gone on a senior citizens bus trip to williamsburg you see saint anthony she explained as she placed primly folded underwear in an open box on the bed i do think that alvirah just may be right and that theres a chance the bakers managed to fool bessie and cheat me out of this house of course im not sure shes right but i am worried because every time i come in this room and look at that desk with bessies old typewriter a warning bell goes off in my head kate noticed a run in a pair of folded stockings poor bessie she said aloud her eyes were going but she wouldnt let me take her for new glasses she said it was a waste of money to buy them when she probably wouldnt last until christmas well she was right kate thought with a sigh as she opened the next drawer and reached for the flannel nightgowns that had been bessies uniform sleepwear my stars she murmured poor bessie she must have put this one back without noticing shed worn it she shook her head as she brushed at the streak of powder on the neckline of a pink flowered gown with lace at the collar ill wash it before i pack it she murmured bessie would have liked that she shook her head no actually im not surprised she tried it then took it off she said to herself she never liked the lace she said it scratched her neck what surprises me is that she put it on in the first place she still had the gown in her hand when a sound made her turn once again vic baker was at the door observing her im preparing my sisters clothing to be sent to charity she said sharply unless you and your wife also claim her nightdresses without answering vic turned away that man frightens me kate thought theres something scary about him ill be glad to get out of here that evening she went to the washing machine and was surprised to see that bessies pinkflowered nightgown was missing from the small pile of laundry she had gathered and left there i must be losing my mind kate thought i could have sworn id brought it down oh well i must have packed it now ill have to go through all those darn boxes looking for it on friday december th alvirahs story about the baby left at the rectory door of st clements seven years ago appeared on the front page of the new york globe almost from the minute the paper hit the stands the phone calls began to pour into the special number at the rectory that monsignor ferris had hastily had installed his longtime secretary answered the calls announcing that she was recording every conversation and passed on to monsignor the ones that seemed most likely to warrant further consideration when he called alvirah on monday morning however the monsignor sounded glum of the more than two hundred calls weve received so far not one has any merit he said unfortunately a lot of them have been from indignant people saying that they have no sympathy for anyone who left a newborn out in the cold even if only for a few minutes have the police been around alvirah asked the administration for childrens services came by and the caseworker i talked to was none too happy believe me the one thing we can establish is that theres no record of an unknown infant girl being found dead or abandoned in new york city at that time guess thats something alvirah said with a sigh im so disappointed this hasnt led somewhere and i thought it was such a good idea so did i monsignor ferris said in agreement how is the mother doing incidentally ive already figured out that she must be that young woman who was around here so often last week but you still can answer honestly that you dont know who she is cant you alvirah asked with some concern as usual she was recording their conversation just in case monsignor said something that escaped her at first hearing you dont have to turn off your mike alvirah i dont know who she is and i dont want to know by the way what is this i hear about you hunting for a coop my feet are walked down to stumps alvirah admitted the gordons are both nice people but monsignor tom ive got to tell you that while they may he fine at selling real estate they are not the brightest things god ever put on earth i swear they can take you into a pokey little dungeon and then tell you its charming and you know the crazy part is that they believe it then they get all excited when they tell you that instead of the milliontwo the owner is asking you can pick it up for only nine hundred thousand dollars real estate people have to be enthusiastic about the places they show alvirah monsignor ferris said mildly its known in some circles as optimism in their case try tunnel vision alvirah responded anyhow im off with eileen to see a place that she says has a spectacular view of central park i can hardly wait after that im going to go visit kate and try to cheer her up i wish you would she keeps reading her copy of bessies will and finding a new way to get her feelings hurt the latest is that bessies signature was written with such force that the pen almost went through the paper its as if she couldnt wait to give her house to strangers she said after hanging up alvirah sat for twenty minutes lost in thought finally she put on her coat and hat and walked out onto the terrace the wind blew against her face and she shivered even though she was warmly dressed im a failure she told herself i thought i was doing sondra a favornow shes gotten her hopes up and for nothing shell be even more heartbroken her grandfather and boyfriend will be arriving tomorrow and she has to keep up appearances in front of them as well as practice for the concert on the rd and i also gave kate a smidgen of hope that id find some way to break this new will but after looking at just about every empty coop on the west side the only sure thing i came up with is that jim and eileen are nice people who must just luck into sales because they sure dont listen when you tell them what you want to see nothing so far she admitted sadly to kate when she stopped by the townhouse but as i always say it aint over till its over oh alvirah kate said i think its over what bothers me is that i feel as if im living on an emotional roller coaster i keep thinking of bessie on that last monday when i left her sitting there watching her showsyou know how much she enjoyed one life to live and general hospitaland going on about them talking a mile a minute telling me all about each character and how they were all the time doing these terrible things to each other and all the time she was planning to do something terrible to me that night alvirah had one of her crimesolving bouts of insomnia at one in the morning she finally gave up went out to the kitchen made tea and rewound her tape from the beginning hercule poirot she thought think like him at seven when willy came out of the bedroom rubbing his eyes he found a triumphant sleuth willy i may have a handle on this she announced with an excited smile it starts with bessies signature on the will you cant tell much from a copy this morning im going to march myself right down to probate court and get a good look at the original you never know what i might find if theres anything to find youll find it honey willy said his voice still sleepy my moneys on you he had been offered something biga bigger job than he had ever been in on before bigger even than the one he had done for the fake computer company it wasnt his usual style but lenny decided to take the riskone big payoff and hed be set for years besides he had decided it was time to take off for mexico especially now that stars mother was in town and was on the hunt for her the story in the new york globe had really rattled him it described everything about the way star was left on the rectory stoop all the details were there suppose one of the nosy neighbors in his apartment building started counting on their fingers and remembered that it had been exactly seven years ago that he had arrived with his infant daughterthat thought really bothered lenny and who knew someone might even remember the shabby blue stroller with the stain on the side there even had been a lot of talk about the case on some of the radio shows don imus in particular had zeroed in on it he had the police commissioner on his program and the commissioner had said that if the person or persons who had taken the baby were found they might be charged with kidnapping and face the possibility of a long prison term when you find any valuable object that isnt yours even if you dont know who the owner is youre supposed to turn it in the commissioner said thats the law and what could be more valuable than a human infant he and imus had talked about the note which had been quoted word for word in the article the fact that the mother wanted a good home for her child doesnt mean just any home the commissioner had said that child became a ward of the city when the mother gave it up and speaking for the city we want her back i would hope if anyone has even a suspicion of who might have that child he or she will call in immediately i guarantee no one will know who made the call and the reward will be given without publicity something else dawned on lenny that tuesday morning as he stirred sugar and hot milk into a cup of strong coffee he was taking to lilly his aunts health was worse she hardly had gotten out of bed the last few daysand he knew that if she went to the hospital and talked about star to anybody social workers probably would come to the apartment to check on her when he reached lillys bedroom her eyes were closed but she opened them when she heard his footsteps lenny i dont feel good she said but i know if i go to the doctor theyll put me in the hospital i want to be able to see stellina be the blessed mother in the pageant so i want to wait awhile to go but when i do go in the hospital i want you to let her stay with gracie nunez till i get back you promise lenny knew that the pageant was next monday afternoon the lst that was also the day of his big job he also knew that there wasnt even a chance lilly would be able to go to the pageant but if she could hold off that long before going to the hospital everything would be great for him once the job was done he would make lilly go to the hospital and when she was securely out of the way he and star would be on the road probably by midnight shes my lucky star lenny thought and ive got to keep her with me he placed the coffee cup carefully on the wobbly night table next to the bed im going to take good care of you aunt lilly he promised itll break stellinas heart if youre not there to at least see her in that nice outfit you sewed for her and i agree that when you do go to the hospital it would be a good idea if she stays with mrs nunez until you come back i have to work and i dont want her to be here all alone lilly looked pathetically grateful grazie lenny grazie she murmured patting his hand the white tunic and blue veil were on a hanger on the clothes tree next to the dresser as lenny looked over at them a gust of wind from the slightly open window sent the veil fluttering and he watched as it drifted to the right and touched the chalice on the bureau another warning lenny thought the fact that the police had been at st clements seven years ago because of the theft from the church had been prominently mentioned in the globe article the history of the chalice and even a picture of it had been a featured story on another page of the paper lenny would have liked to grab the chalice and get rid of it but he knew he couldnt risk that if it disappeared then lilly would cause a stink and star would tell all her friends no the chalice had to be put on hold too but only for now when he and star finally did take off there was one thing he knew for sure that chalice was going to end up at the bottom of the rio grande sondra could no longer bear to read a newspaper or turn on the television or listen to the radio alvirahs story about the baby had set off a media furor that made her cringe with shame on monday night she had fished in her suitcase and found the unopened bottle of sleeping pills the doctor had prescribed for when she had one of her occasional bouts of insomnia she never had taken even one of them preferring to tough it out rather than yield to the temptation to use something she considered a crutch but by monday she knew she had no choice she simply had to have some sleep when she awoke at eight on tuesday morning however her cheeks were wet with tears and she remembered that in her vague troubled dreams she had been weeping groggy and disoriented she finally managed to sit up and tentatively put her feet over the side of the bed for several seconds the hotel room seemed to spin around her the flowered draperies blending with the striped fabric on the couch in a kaleidoscope of color i would have been better off either to have stayed awake all nightor to have swallowed every pill in the bottle she thought fleetingly but then she shook her head im not that much of a coward she told herself a long hot shower with the water pelting her face and soaking her hair helped to restore some sense of focus she pulled on a terrycloth robe wrapped her hair in a towel and forced herself to order scrambled eggs and toast with the usual juice and coffee granddad and gary are arriving tonight she reminded herself if they see me like this theyll keep asking whats wrong until i break down and tell them the whole story ive got to practice well today and ive got to practice especially well tomorrow when granddad will be listening ive got to give the kind of performance that makes him feel that all the years of teaching me and sacrificing for me were worth it sondra got up and walked to the window today is tuesday the th of december she thought as she looked down at the street already bustling with midtown traffic and pedestrians rushing to work the concert is next wednesday she said aloud the day after that is christmas evethats when were supposed to go back to chicago she thought only im not going instead im going to ring the bell of st clements rectory something i should have done seven years ago instead of running two blocks to a phone im going to tell monsignor ferris that im the babys mother and then ill ask him to call the police i cant live with this guilt for one day longer at ten oclock on tuesday morning henry brown a clerk at the surrogates court on chambers street in lower manhattan looked up and said good morning to a determinedlooking woman of about sixty with red hair and a somewhat prominent jaw a keen judge of human nature henry noted the smile lines around the womans mouth and the crinkles around her eyes he knew that these hinted at a pleasant disposition and that the irritation he saw in her face probably was just of the moment he thought he had her pegged shed be a disgruntled relative who would want to examine the will of a relative who had cut her off he quickly learned he was right about the desire to see a will but the woman was not a relative my name is alvirah meehan alvirah explained its my understanding that wills filed for probate are public documents and i have the right to examine a particular one if i choose thats quite right henry said pleasantly but of course it must be in the presence of a member of the staff i dont care if the whole city government is hanging over my shoulder alvirah said brusquely but then softened after all it was not the fault of this helpful clerk that the closer she got to seeing bessies actual will the more steamed up she felt herself becoming fifteen minutes later henry brown positioned beside her she was studying the document that word again she muttered i beg your pardon its just that the word pristine sticks in my craw you see i would swear that the lady who wrote this will never used that word in her entire eightyeight years oh youd be astonished how literary some people get when they write their wills henry said helpfully of course they do come up with some lulus mistakes like irregardless or to reiterate again he paused then added i must say though that pristine is a new one ive never seen that word used before alvirah had tuned out when she heard the dismaying opinion that it might be considered customary to put some unfamiliar and perhaps highfalutin words into a will now whats this she asked i mean look at this last page the will is already signed thats known as the attestation clause henry explained by the terms of new york state law the witnesses must complete this page it attests that theyve witnessed the signing of the will and the testatrix in this case mrs bessie durkin maher must also sign it in essence its a reconfirmation of the witnessing of the will without it the witnesses would have to appear in court at the time of the probate and of course when wills have been standing for years the witnesses may have moved or died take a look at this alvirah ordered holding up two pieces of paper bessies signature on the will and then on thiswhat did you call itattestation clause see there the ink is different but they had to be signed at the same time right henry brown studied the two signatures definitely these are two different shades of blue ink he said but perhaps your friend bessie decided her signature on the will which while totally legible was written in rather light ink so she simply changed pens theres nothing illegal about that the witnesses signed with the same pen he pointed out one of bessies signatures is firm the other wavy its also possible that she signed these papers at two different times alvirah said oh that would be illegal i couldnt agree more well if youre quite finished mrs meehan henry did not complete the sentence alvirah smiled at him no im not im afraid i cant tell you how grateful i am to you for giving me all this time but i know you dont want there to be a miscarriage of justice henry smiled politely anybody who gets cut out of a will screams miscarriage of justice he thought philosophically look henry alvirah continued its all right if call you henry isnt it you should just call me alvirah without waiting to see if henry accepted this elevation of their acquaintance alvirah said bessie swears this was her last will i swear this thing is a phony besides where did bessie get the knowhow to type this attestation clause tell me that well she may have asked someone to type it for her or someone may have given her a copy of the form henry said patiently now mrs meehan i mean alvirah he began all right alvirah said interrupting him i know its not proof but these signatures look different and i say bessie didnt sign these papers at the same time briskly she gathered up her things okay henry thank you she said rushing out a woman with a mission alvirah went directly to the james and eileen gordon real estate agency she was scheduled to see yet another coop this one on central park vest and described by eileen gordon as a steal at two million in the course of pretending interest in the place and hearing eileen once again exclaim about the beautiful vieweven though the view was somewhat limited since the apartment was on the second floor and looked directly into treesalvirah managed to turn the conversation to the signing of bessies will oh yes the dear sweet old girl signed both papers eileen said her round eyes opening wide as she smiled reminiscently im sure of that but she was obviously getting very tired i think thats why the second signature was quite wavy on the line if she changed pens i didnt notice the truth is i may have been just kind of looking around the room that townhouse is in almost perfect condition i mean a few things like the living room door need fixing but thats nothing with the way prices are now i could get three million for that house easily for once i think youre right alvirah thought as thoroughly disheartened she turned off the microphone in her sunburst pin the final rehearsal for the pageant was scheduled for friday afternoon and lenny had made it a point to attend explaining to sisters cordelia and maeve marie that since he would be at work at four oclock on monday afternoon when the pageant would be performed he didnt want to miss his only chance to see his daughter as the blessed mother with his best stab at an ingratiating smile lenny explained that stellinas nonna was very very sick but that he would always be there to take care of his little girl its you and me against the world right star he asked stroking the hair that was tumbling onto her shoulders ill even have to learn how to brush that pretty mop of yours he smiled again at the nuns norma cant clip the barrette so good anymore the women nodded their expressions frosty then sister cordelia turned from him and clapped her hands okay children take your places for the final rehearsal oh there you are willy i was afraid youd forgotten us willy and alvirah were coming up the stairs willys face wreathed in a smile of resignation cordelia its a week till christmas believe it or not i had some shopping to do and i have made my last outing with the gordons alvirah said they practically threw me out today they said they sensed that i wasnt ready to make a move right now and they gave me the names of some of their competitors i could call in case i wanted to keep looking for a coop for the rest of my life then we must accept that the good lord doesnt want us to be in business after january first cordelia acknowledged and you mustnt blame yourself alvirah you havent left one stone unturned to try to prove bessies will was a fake she turned briskly away now lets get started with the rehearsal turning back to alvirah she lowered her voice and nodded her head almost imperceptibly toward lenny that fellow there is stellinas father sit next to him hes trying to make a good impression on us so i know hell talk to you see what you make of him i think hes up to no good sister cordelia was right lenny did talkstraight through the rehearsal only interrupting his tale of how he gave up a good ob in the midwest because he missed star so much but couldnt take her away from his beloved aunt to make noisy and oddly inappropriate exclamations on how cute the children were in the course of his ramblings he told alvirah about the pretty irish girl he had married who had been stars mother her name was rose ogrady we used to love to dance together id get the band to play sweet rosie ogrady when we were out and id sing it in her ear what happened to her alvirah asked its something i dont tell many people she got postpartum depression so bad we had to have her hospitalized then here lennys voice broke fading off they didnt watch her carefully enough the last words were delivered in a dramatic whisper suicide alvirah thought oh im so sorry she said sincerely nonna told star her mama was sick and had to go far away and that we probably wouldnt hear from her ever again i think we should have maybe told her straight out that her mama was dead but nonna keeps saying not yet lenny explained pleased to have gotten the scenario down so well there was one small glitch in the rehearsal when rajid the third wise man dropped the jar that supposedly held the myrrh its all right rajid sister cordelia called as she saw tears gather in his eyes and sister maeve marie swooped in to pick up the pieces it was just a little accident no real problem keep going all of you willy went to the piano it was time for the closing scene in the pageant sleep my child and peace attend thee he played and sang softly stellina and jerry looked up from their kneeling position beside the cradle which was now in place guardian angels god will send thee they sang their voices young and sweet and true thats a nice song lenny said it reminds me sshh dear god cant he shut up long enough to listen to his own child alvirah thought now so irritated that if she had had duct tape handy she surely would have pasted it across his mouth she noticed that stellinas eyes had flickered over to him when he spoke but then turned away as though in embarrassment shes savvy enough to know her fathers a creep alvirah thought that poor child she actually looks a little untidy today her hair is tangled usually its pulled back so neatly untidy but still beautiful she thought the curly darkblond hair almost waist length the fair complexion and haunting brown eyes her expression is almost adult in its sadness alvirah thought why do some kids get such a bad break in life lenny clapped loudly when the rehearsal was over great he shouted really great stuff star your daddys proud of you stellina blushed and turned away averting her eyes your daddys proud of you jerry mimicked as he got to his feet youre such a good little blessed mother ha ha ha its still not too late to get a new saint joseph sister cordelia warned the boy thumping him on the head now remember to bring your costumes to school with you monday children youll get dressed here im going to pick up star at school and take her home to put on her costume lenny told alvirah her nonna cant make it to the pageant but she wants to see her dressed up then ill have to go to work alvirah nodded absentmindedly her attention focused on cordelia as she collected the gifts the wise men were to present the foilcovered chocolates made a realistic offering of gold she thought the painted bowl cordelia had brought from the convent for the frankincense made a pretty offering ill pick up another jar to replace the one rajid dropped she thought then she noticed stellina take cordelias hand and lead the nun to the side telling secrets lenny observed a tone of alarm creeping into his voice oh i doubt that alvirah said quickly i know stellina has been asking sister cordelia and sister maeve marie to pray for her nonna oh yeah lenny said after a few moments i guess that must be what shes doing gratified with the impression he thought he had made at the rehearsal lenny left with stellina explaining to everyone in earshot that he was taking her out for dinner now that nonna cant be worrying about meals i guess i gotta get me a cookbook was his parting comment on the way to mcdonalds he asked star if she had been asking the sister to pray for nonna when she took the nun aside i ask sister that every day stellina said quietly instinctively she knew that daddy might not like what she had really asked sisterthat if nonna allowed her to bring the silver chalice that had once belonged to her mothers uncle could rajid carry it to the stable to replace the jar he broke to her delight sister had said that would be fine star was sure if she begged nonna she would give her permission to bring it and when rajid puts it down by the cradle i will pray that if my mother hasnt gone to heaven yet she will come to see me just once it was a wish and a hope that now had become almost a constant urgent need but a faith that was growing stronger and stronger seemed to promise star that if the chalice could become a gift to the christ child her prayer would be answered her mother really would come to her at last peter lewis sondras grandfather arrived on wednesday afternoon it was both a relief and a disappointment to her that gary did not accompany him hell be here for the concert her grandfather said but hes very busy and could not take the extra time besides i think he is astute enough to know that in the days before an artist is performing in a major concert she is better left alone with her music and with as few distractions as possible sondra knew what her grandfather was implying gary willis loved music with a deep passion and understood the strains inherent in an artists life im glad he waited she said but im thrilled that youre here granddad you look spectacular it was an unexpected delight to her that her grandfather looked so well even though the signs of the arthritis were always visible in his swollen wrists and fingers the triple bypass had restored color to his face and vigor to his appearancethings she had feared he had lost with age and illness when she told him how healthy he looked for his years he responded thanks sondra but seventyfive is considered to be only the dawn of aging today an unobstructed blood supply to the heart does wonders although i hope thats something you never need to find out for yourself at least sondra thought in an effort to draw some comfort from the situation granddad looks strong enough to take it when i tell him about the baby and what im going to do after the concert but just thinking about it she grew paler and you look thin and troubled he told her crisply is something wrong or is it just the usual preperformance nerves if so im disappointed i thought i had cured you of that she had turned aside the question granddad this is carnegie hall she had told him its different he had then spent thursday and friday renewing old friendships while she practiced with her new york coach on friday evening at dinner he talked about his visit to st clements and having learned of the theft of bishop santoris chalice apparently that same night a baby was abandoned there he said as he studied the menu absorbed as always in the task at hand it seems to have been the subject of a recent newspaper article he paused grilled dover sole and a salad he announced then he looked across the table at her his eyes probing when i take you to le cirque my dear at least have the courtesy to look interested in the menu the next day when he came to hear her practice she could read the disappointment in his eyes she was rehearsing a beethoven sonata and while she knew her playing was technically perfect she was also aware that there was neither passion nor fire in her music and she knew that her granddad was aware as well when she was finished he shrugged your technique is marvelous it cant be faulted but you have always withheld something of yourself from your music why i dont know now you are withholding everything he looked at her sternly sondra keep it up and you will appear and immediately disappear from the major concert stage like that he snapped his fingers what is wrong you withhold yourself from a man who loves you and whom i believe you love in return you resent me i do not know why but i have been aware of it for years does nothing touch you with a shrug of dismay and resignation he turned and began walking toward the studio exit i am the mother of the baby who was abandoned at st clements she shouted at him the words hanging in the air he stopped and turned his expression incredulous but with a look of deep concern in his eyes with little expression in either her face or her voice sondra told him everything the words rushing out of her when she was finished there was a long silence then he nodded so that is it and i see that in a way you blame me because you let her go maybe you are right and maybe you are not it is no matter we will move heaven and earth to find her we will tell gary he has enormous resources at his disposal and if he does not understand then he is not worthy of you now he picked up sondras violin and thrust it into her hands now play with all your heart to the child you are seeking sondra tucked the violin under her chin and reached for her bow in her mind she could see her child but would she have blond hair like her own or would it be like her fatherssilky dark her eyeswere they still blue or brown like hers or dark hazel like his he was a man she had known so briefly and in the end cared not a whit about but he had fathered her child she will be like me sondra decided she will look as i did at her age shes seven now music must be in her soul she reflected as she drew the bow across the strings she still eludes me but i see her in the distance i hear her footsteps i feel her presence she senses that i want her forgetting her grandfather sondra began to play i never gave her a name she thought what would i have called her what do i call her in my heart she sought the answer as she played but could not find it when the last notes faded into silence after a long pause her grandfather nodded now you are becoming a true musician you are still holding back but that was an infinite improvement you will be required to play an encore what have you chosen sondra did not know what her answer would be until she heard herself say it a simple song of christmas she told him all through the night on sunday morning alvirah and willy went to mass at st clements kate durkin was in attendance as well and at her insistence they went back to the townhouse for coffee when they arrived the bakers were just going out linda and i are on our way to pick up the morning papers vic said jovially we always take a crack at the sunday times puzzle i knew a guy who claimed to ace it every week but when somebody checked him once they found he was cheating putting down gobbledygook to fill in the blanks willy said a friend of yours maybe bakers smile froze linda shrugged and tugged at his sleeve come on hon she pleaded i see he put away his black tie willy observed as he watched them walk down the block arm in arm its a wonder she doesnt break her neck in those high heels alvirah observed there are patches of ice all over the sidewalk trust me she wont fall kate said shes a pro in those thingswears them all the time kate turned the key in the lock and pushed open the door come on in that wind goes right through you lets have our coffee in the parlor she said as they took off their coats i lit the fire in there this morning and it feels cozy bessie loved to sit in the parlor and have coffee and my freshbaked crumb cake after mass on sundays kate refused to allow alvirah to assist her in setting things out whats a few cups and plates youve been running around on my behalf all week go in and sit down i always liked this room willy observed as he settled into the deep leather chair that had been the treasured possession of judge aloysius maher whose portrait in judicial robes still looked down at them benignly from the wall over the mantel its a wonderful room alvirah agreed you dont get these high ceilings and carved mantels anymore just look at the details on the windows thats workmanship i cant stand it that poor kate isnt going to get to enjoy all this for the rest of her life she turned around then sighed well i guess bessie wont mind if i take her favorite chair i can just see her sitting here her feet on the hassock watching her showsand woe betide you if you interrupted her during one life to live or general hospital then what does she do with her nexttolast breath she sneaks upstairs when kates back is turned and just to do her out of this house why that means she missed at least one of her shows on her very last day on earth maybe they have soap opera digest in heaven and shes been able to catch up willy suggested kate came in carrying a tray which she placed on the coffee table oh willy she said would you mind closing the door hon and dearie will be back with the papers any time now and i dont want them to come in and bother us my pleasure kate willy said with a grunt as he got up at the mention of the bakers the subject of the will came up as a reflex gesture alvirah turned on the microphone in her sunburst pin bessie always wrote with the judges pen and she never used blue ink in it kate said when alvirah talked about the differing shades of blue ink on the will and the attestation clause but then again she did a lot of crazy things during those last few days what about her typewriter alvirah asked i thought she said something about it on thanksgiving im not sure kate murmured all right how bad was her eyesight alvirah queried she had bifocals you know that but the prescription for the reading lenses needed to be strengthened if she didnt hold something up close to her face she had trouble making it out she may have signed those papers thinking she was signing for a delivery of paint or varnish or tools alvirah said i was here once when baker brought her a receipt to sign for a delivery he handed her his pen all of which wont help you in court willy observed kate id walk a mile for a piece of that crumb cake kate smiled no need to do thattheres plenty right here bessie loved it too told me that even after she was gone i should fix a piece for her and set it out in this room on sunday mornings she said shed haunt me if i forgot and then along came the bakers alvirah thought from the foyer she heard the click of the outside door the heirs are back she murmured and then watched in dismay as the door to the parlor swung open and vic and linda baker smiled in on them elevensies vic said in his usual jovial tone thats what they call it in england having a morning snack break like this its always around eleven oclock he took a step into the room my that crumb cake looks spectacular kate it is alvirah said flatly didnt you adjust that door for bessie mr baker as a matter of fact i did yes is that why it swings open so easily it needs a bit more adjusting clearly uncomfortable with the conversation he turned to leave well im off to try my hand at the puzzle they waited until the sound of vics heavy footsteps and the bouncy staccato of lindas heels could no longer be heard you cant insult that guy can you willy observed its more than that kate said hes curious about what were saying thank god im almost through clearing out bessies room he always hangs around when im in there she frowned you know alvirah talking about the typewriter the space bar has needed fixing too unless you type very slowly it keeps skipping that just dawned on me ive been looking at the typewriter there in bessies room trying to remember what bessie did say on thanksgiving alvirah swallowed the last drop of coffee and regretfully declined a second piece of crumb cake let me take a look at that typewriter she said there were a few sheets of plain paper in bessies desk alvirah inserted one into the typewriter carriage and began to type the carriage skipped several spaces whenever she touched the space bar forcing her to use the back key constantly how long has it been like this at least since thanksgiving meaning either bessie typed her will before thanksgivingwhich would have meant that she was lying in her teeth to monsignor when he saw her the day after thanksgivingor she typed it over the weekend literally one word at a time whos kidding who but it doesnt add up to proof honey willy reminded her he looked at the stack of boxes against the wall in bessies room kate can i help you with those not yet theres one more thing to pack up and i cant find it i put a pinkflowered flannel gown of bessies out to wash and now its disappeared it had a streak of face powder on it and i dont want to let it go out soiled she lowered her voice and looked furtively over her shoulder you know if linda baker didnt dress like a dimeadance girl id swear vic might have taken it for her now what do you make of that that afternoon while willy watched the giants play the steelers alvirah sat at the dining room table and once again listened to all the taped conversations she had collected concerning bessies will and the townhouse as she listened she made notes her brow furrowing as certain remarks jumped out at her the score was tied and the game was in the fourth quarter when she yelled i think i figured it out willy willy listen to me would you have called bessie a dear sweet old girl willy did not take his eyes off the screen no never not on the best day of her life of course not because she wasnt a dear sweet old girl she was a tough stubborn crusty old girl but thats what its all about and after all that trooping around i did with the gordons i finally figure it out sitting right here at home even though the giants had made a first down and were on the steelers threeyard line willy gave alvirah his full attention what did you figure out honey the gordons never laid eyes on bessie alvirah said triumphantly they witnessed somebody else signing that will vic and linda sneaked in a ringer while bessie was watching her shows two hours later alvirah and willy arrived at kates townhouse with jim and eileen gordon in tow they already had alerted monsignor ferris and sisters cordelia and maeve marie to be there and they found them sitting in the parlor with an equally bewildered kate alvirah whats all this about cordelia demanded youll see the heirs are joining us arent they alvirah asked the bakers kate replied yes i told them you were coming and that you said youd have a surprise for them wonderful kate you havent met these nice people have you jim and eileen gordon witnessedor thought they witnessedbessie signing the will thought they witnessed the monsignor said exactly now eileen you tell us what happened when you came in that day alvirah said eileen gordon an earnest expression on her pleasant face said well if you remember we had been out with mr baker showing him a simply beautiful duplex on west eightyfirst right across from the museum its in one of the finest buildings in the eileen alvirah said struggling to control her irritation tell us about witnessing the will oh yes well mrs baker had called and when we arrived here with mr baker mrs baker asked us to come in quietly she said there was an elderly lady in the parlor who didnt like to be disturbed when she was watching her programs the door was shut so we tiptoed up the stairs to the bedroom where mrs maher was waiting for us elderly lady in the parlor kate exploded that was bessie then who was in the bedroom monsignor ferris asked the bakers were heard coming down the stairs why dont we ask vic alvirah suggested as the couple entered the parlor vic who was the lady you dressed up in bessies pinkflowered nightgown an actress another cheat who was in on the deal baker opened his mouth to speak but alvirah didnt give him a chance i have pictures of bessie that we took here just a few weeks ago at thanksgivingnice clear closeups she handed the photos to the gordons tell them what you told me she is definitely not the lady who was in bed and who signed that will jim gordon said looking at the photos yes there was a similarity but no way is this the lady eileen gordon agreed as she vigorously shook her head tell us the rest eileen alvirah suggested when we came downstairs the door to the parlor had swung open and we could see an old lady sitting in that chair eileen pointed to bessies chair she didnt turn her head but i could see her profileshe was definitely the lady in alvirahs thanksgiving pictures how much more do you need to hear vic old boy willy asked tomorrow morning kate files to contest the will the gordons tell their story and i give it a few days before you frauds are indicted i think its time for us to move on vic baker said pleasantly but quickly kate because of this misunderstanding well be leaving immediately come linda well pack right away good riddance to the two of you i hope you go to jail alvirah called after them you told me to bring champagne monsignor ferris said to alvirah a few minutes later as they stood in the dining room and he popped the cork on the bottle see why sister cordelia and kate were both just beginning to understand what all this meant now ill never have to leave my home kate gasped and i wont have to abandon my kids sister cordelia exulted praise be to god and to alvirah sister maeve marie said holding up her glass for a moment a shadow came across monsignor ferriss face now if only you could set things right for that missing baby and retrieve the bishops stolen chalice alvirah as alvirah always says it aint over till its over willy said proudly and as i always say my moneys on her as promised on monday afternoon lenny picked up stellina at her school star he said hurriedly nonna gust had a weak spell and the doctor came theyre sending for an ambulance she may have to be in the hospital for a while but shell be fine i promise you are you sure stellina asked looking searchingly into his eyes you bet stellina ran ahead and as she turned the corner she saw a stretcher being wheeled from their apartment house along the sidewalk to a waiting ambulance her heart pounding she raced to it nonna nonna she cried reaching for her beloved greataunt lilly maldonado tried to smile stellina my heart is not so good but theyll make it better and then ill be back now you must wash your hands and face and brush your hair and put on your blessed mother outfit you cant be late for the pageant then tonight after the pageant daddy will bring some of your clothes to mrs nunezs youll sleep at her house till i get back stellina whispered nonna rajid who is one of the wise men broke the jar that was supposed to hold the myrrh may i please please bring my mothers cup for him to carry in the pageant it was a holy cup you told me it belonged to her uncle a priest please ill take such good care of it i promise we have to go little girl the ambulance attendant said tugging at stellinas arm trying to get her away from the stretcher you can visit nonna at st lukes hospital its on th street not far from here tears came to stellinas eyes i have a prayer that i just know will come true if i bring my cup nonna please say its okay what is your prayer bambina lillys voice was heavy as the sedation the emergency crew had administered began to take effect that my mother will come back the little girl said tears starting to roll down her cheeks ah stellina bambina if only she would come before i die yes yes take the cup but dont let daddy see you he might not let it go oh nonna thank you ill come and see you tomorrow i promise moments later the ambulance its siren shrieking was gone star weve got to hurry lenny urged home base was festively decorated with a christmas tree and beribboned ropes of pine over the weekend some volunteers had built a platform at one end of the big upstairs room to give the effect of a stage another volunteer had hung ancient velvet portieres at both sides of the platform folding chairs had been set up for the audience and the parents and siblings and friends of the children in the pageant were now happily pouring into the room alvirah had arrived early to help cordelia and maeve get the children dressed for the pageant by means of dire threats sister cordelia was able to maintain reasonable order among the excited performers at ten of four just as they were all getting nervous about her stellina arrived alvirah quickly took her in hand did your nonna see you in your outfit she asked as she straightened the blue veil over stellinas waterfall of darkgold hair no they took her to the hospital in an ambulance stellina said quietly daddy promised to take me to see her will she get better mrs meehan oh i hope so dear but we will help take care of you while shes away you know how afraid we were that we would have to close home base well now because of a miracle we can keep it openand that means well see you every day after school stellinas smile was wistful oh im very glad im happy here now run over there and take your place with saint joseph can i hold that bag for you alvirah reached to take the plastic grocery bag stellina was clutching no thank you i have to give my cup to rajid to carry sister cordelia said it was all right for me to bring it thank you mrs meehan as she scurried to where the other children were gathered alvirah stared after her what is it about that child she reminds me of someonebut who she asked herself as she went to her seat the lights dimmed it was time for the christmas pageant to begin simply wonderful was the universal comment as the last notes of all through the night faded away and the applause began cameras flashed from all around the room as parents acted to preserve the moment alvirah suddenly tugged at sister maeve maries sleeve maeve i want you to get a closeup of stellina she said i mean several closeups of her sure alvirah maeve agreed she was the perfect blessed mother when she sang she brought tears to my eyes she put so much feeling into the words yes she did she has music in her soul a wild crazy thought that was becoming certainty had crept into alvirahs head but she didnt want to admit it even to herself we can try to check the birth records for a start she thought but oh dear god is it possible ive got some good ones of her maeve said a few minutes later gingerly holding out the polaroid photos she had taken theyll be clearer once they finish developing and i have a cute one of her and rajid hes handing her silver cup back to her her silver cup no her chalice alvirah thought you may be wrong she warned herself you could be just getting carried away but one thing at least can be proved immediately maeve if youve got more film get some closeups of that cup she said ask stellina to hold it up for you alvirah come on willy called youre supposed to hand me the presents to give the kids maeve get those closeups and hang on to them for me alvirah ordered dont let them out of your hands she hurried to willys side the presents were on a table behind her all right santa this is for josé she announced heartily as the young boy eagerly reached out his hands willy put an arm around him wait a minute josé sister maeve will be right over to take a picture of us alvirah was frantic to get away to be off following up on her suspicions but it was easier just to finish helping willy with the presents than to get someone else to do it meanwhile cordelia and her volunteers were busy passing out candy and soda although some people had begun to leave to alvirahs dismay she saw that grace nunez was about to depart with josé and stellina in tow when she called out to her grace bustled over where are you taking stellina alvirah asked im gonna drop her off at home for now grace explained her daddy will bring her to stay with me tonight he says he wants to have dinner with her first after he gets off work i got to stop at my sisters for a while but he told me hell be home early she knows to lock the door herself dont you stellina yes i do oh i hope hell be able to tell me how nonna is stellina said earnestly ten minutes later all the presents had been dispensed and all the pictures taken alvirah ran to sister maeve marie and picked up the polaroid shots then she grabbed her coat whats up willy asked his voice muffled through his fuzzy santa claus beard ive got to show monsignor tom some pictures she said over her shoulder meet me there the monsignor was out but was expected back soon alvirah was told willing the time to pass quickly she waited in the rectory parlor pacing back and forth willy and the monsignor arrived at the same time half an hour later the monsignor was smiling what a nice surprise alvirah he said cheerfully alvirah didnt waste words she handed him the pictures monsignor tom look at these he studied the picture of stellina taking the cup from rajid during the pageant then he looked at the closeup maeve marie had made of the cup alone alvirah he said quietly do you know what this is i think so its bishop santoris chalice and do you know who i think that little girl is he waited i think shes the infant who was left at your rectory door the night the chalice was stolen grace nunez walked stellina to the door of the apartment she shared with nonna and her daddy she watched like a mother hen while the little girl went in then listened for her to turn the double lock ill see you later honey she called from the hallway then left confident that stellina would never open the door to anyone except her father inside the apartment it was quiet and dark stellina noticed the difference immediately without nonna it seemed strange and lonely she went around the apartment turning on lights hoping to brighten the place going into nonnas room she started to take off her blessed mother costume but then stopped nonna had wanted to see her wearing it and she hoped that her daddy would take her to the hospital she took the silver cup out of the bag and sat on the edge of the bed holding the cup made her feel less alone nonna had never before been away when she came home never once at seven oclock stellina heard footsteps pounding up the stairs to the hallway it couldnt be daddy she thought he never runs but then he was banging on the door star open up open up he cried frantically as soon as he heard the click of the locks lenny turned the handle and threw himself into the apartment it had been a setup the whole thing had been a trap he should have known it he told himself snarling that lousy new guy in the crew was an undercover cop lenny had managed to get away by the skin of his teeth once he realized what was going on but they were no doubt combing fort lee for him right now and they would be checking this place in minutes he had to risk stopping here though his fake identity papers and all his cash were in the bag he had packed and left here this afternoon he raced into his room and grabbed the bag from under his bed stellina followed him and stood in the doorway watching lenny turned to glance at her and saw that she was holding the chalice well that was good he thought he wanted it out of here and the sooner the better come on star lets go he ordered were getting outta here dont try to bring anything but your cup he knew he probably was crazy to bring the kid now that the police were after him but she was his goodluck charm his lucky star will you take me to see nonna daddy later maybe tomorrow i told you come on we got to go he grabbed her hand and headed hack down the hall pulling her behind him stellina grasped her silver cup as she stumbled to keep up with his pace without locking the door behind them they raced down the stairsone flight two flights three flights as she struggled not to fall at the last landing before the lobby lenny stopped abruptly and stood listening nothing so far he thought feeling a moment of relief he only needed another minute and they would be in the car he had managed to steal and then he was home free he was halfway across the foyer when the outer door suddenly burst open yanking star in front of him lenny pretended to reach for a gun you shoot me and she gets it he shouted without conviction joe tracy was at the head of the squad he wasnt about to risk a childs life however hollow the threat everybody back he ordered cautiously let him go the car lenny had was only a few feet from the front of the building the police watched helpless as he dragged star to the vehicle opened the drivers door and threw in his bag get in and crawl over to the other side he told her urgently he knew he would never hurt her but hopefully the cops didnt star obeyed but when lenny got in and slammed his door he let go of her hand to turn on the ignition key in a lightning moment she opened the passenger door and jumped out of the car clutching the chalice her veil flying behind her she ran down the street as the police closed in on the car ten minutes later alvirah willy and monsignor ferris arrived to find lenny handcuffed and seated in a patrol car they climbed the stairs to the apartment and learned that stellina and the chalice were missing as they stood in the living room of the apartment where stellina had lived these past seven years they told joe tracy about the chalice and about their suspicion that stellina was the missing infant of st clements one of the policemen came in from lennys bedroom take a look at this joe found it wedged between the shelf and wall in the closet joe read the crumpled note then handed it to alvirah she is the missing infant mrs meehan he said this confirms it its the note the mother pinned to her blanket i have a call to make alvirah said with a sigh of relief but i dont want to make it until stellina is found were combing the city for her tracy said as his cell phone rang he listened for a moment then broke into a broad smile you can go ahead and make your call he told alvirah the little blessed mother was just picked up attempting to walk all the way to st lukes hospital to see her nonna he spoke into his phone take her over there he ordered well meet you at the hospital he turned to alvirah who had picked up the phone that sat on an end table i presume youre trying to get in touch with the childs mother yes i am let sondra be in the hotel alvirah prayed ms lewis left a message that she is having dinner in the restaurant with her grandfather the desk clerk said shall i page her when sondra came on the line alvirah said as fast as you can grab a cab and get up to st lukes hospital detective tracy took the phone from her forget the cab im sending a squad car for you maam theres a little girl im sure youll want to see forty minutes later alvirah willy monsignor ferris and joe tracy met sondra and her grandfather outside lillys room in the hospitals cardiac care unit shes in there with the woman who has raised her alvirah whispered we havent told her about anything thats for you to do white faced and trembling sondra pushed open the door stellina was standing at the foot of the bed her profile to them the soft light seemed to halo the shining gold hair that spilled from beneath the blue veil nonna im glad youre awake now and im so glad you feel better she was saying a nice policeman brought me here i wanted you to see me in my beautiful dress and see i took very good care of my mothers cup she held up the silver chalice we used it in the pageant and i made my prayerthat my mother would come back do you think that god will send her to me with a sob sondra crossed to her daughters side knelt down and folded her in her arms in the hallway alvirah pulled the door closed there are some moments that arent meant to be shared she said firmly sometimes its enough just to know that if you believe hard enough and long enough your wishes can come true epilogue two nights later on december rd a capacity audience gathered at carnegie hall for the gala concert that would feature luminaries of the musical world and would be the new york debut for the brilliant young violinist sondra lewis in a prime center box alvirah and willy were seated with stellina sondras grandfather her boyfriend gary willis monsignor ferris sister cordelia sister maeve marie and kate durkin stellina the object of countless curious glances was seated right in the front row her brown eyes sparkling with delight blissfully unaware of the stir she was causing for two days the city newspapers had featured the story of the reunited mother and child and the recovery of the beloved chalice it was a wonderful humaninterest story and especially appropriate for the christmas season stellina was standing at the foot of the bed her profile to them the soft light seemed to halo the shining gold hair that spilled from beneath the blue veil nonna im glad youre awake now and im so glad you feel better she was saying a nice policeman brought me here i wanted you to see me in my beautiful dress and see i took very good care of my mothers cup she held up the silver chalice we used it in the pageant and i made my prayerthat my mother would come back do you think that god will send her to me with a sob sondra crossed to her daughters side knelt down and folded her in her arms in the hallway alvirah pulled the door closed there are some moments that arent meant to be shared she said firmly sometimes its enough just to know that if you believe hard enough and long enough your wishes can come true the articles had featured pictures of sondra and stellina and as alvirah said even a blind man could see stellinas a clone of her mother i cant believe it didnt hit me sooner when questioned about indicting sondra for abandonment the district attorney had said it would take a bigger scrooge than even my enemies think i am to press charges against that young woman did she make an error by not ringing the bell of the rectory instead of running to a phone yes she did did she an eighteenyearold kid do her best to find a home for her baby you bet she did to which the mayor had responded if he had indicted her id have made his life miserable a wave of applause began as the conductor came onto the podium the houselights dimmed and the evening of exquisite music began alvirah splendid in a darkgreen velvet dinner gown reached for willys hand an hour later sondra appeared onstage to tumultuous applause monsignor ferris leaned over to whisper as willy would say you did it again alvirahand ill never forget that youre the reason we have the bishops chalice back too bad the diamond was lost but the important thing is the chalice i think willy deserves the credit alvirah whispered in return if his sheet music for all through the night hadnt been open on the piano sondra wouldnt have picked out the melody and sung it that started me thinking then when stellina sang it in the pageant i was sure as sondra raised her how they settled back to listen look at that child alvirah whispered to willy pointing to stellina clearly the little girl was transfixed by her mothers playing stellinas face shone with wonderment when the encore came and sondra began to play all through the night she looked up toward the box in which her daughter was seated audible only to those seated right around her stellina began to sing no one could doubt that mother and daughter were performing to and for each other for them there was no one else in the world when the last notes died away there was a hush then willy leaned over and whispered alvirah honey its too bad i didnt bring my sheet music they could have used a little piano accompaniment what do you think
