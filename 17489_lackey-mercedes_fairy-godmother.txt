waters division thomas moody joseph farrelly division timothy stackpole division martin egan jr thomas haskell jr william okeefe chapter this is not the way to spend a beautiful spring morning elena klovis thought as she peered around the pile of bandboxes in her arms they were full of hats so they werent particularly heavy unlike most of her stepmothers luggage but they were very awkward to carry there was a lark serenading the morning somewhere overhead and elena wished with all her heart she was him and not herself still if nothing went wrong in a few hours she just might be free if not as free as a bird at least better off than she was now she took a few more steps feeling her way carefully with her bare toes and caught sight of the neighbors peering over the rosecovered wall as she passed by their perch they must have been standing on boxes or a bench to do so and even at that all that could be seen of them was the tops of their caps a few little greying curls escaping from beneath the lace and two sets of eyes blue and bright with curiosity their curiosity would have to wait she didnt have time to satisfy it right now elena felt her way on towards the carriage the bandboxes swaying dangerously with each step madame blanche and madame fleur knew better than to call out to her when she was in the middle of a task and even if they hadnt been she wouldnt have answered not now elena was not in the mood to take either her stepmothers sharp tongue nor the blows of her cane and if the carriage wasnt packed soon madame klovis would be delivering up both she made a few more careful steps it would have been easier if shed been properly shod instead of barefoot but the only shoes she had were the wooden clogs shed carved herself for winter and the wooden pattens for rain the last time shed asked for shoes her stepmother had flown into a rage and beaten her so hard that her back ached now at the memory sometimes she thought about what would happen if she snatched that cane away and struck back and wondered if it would be worth what would follow it wouldnt of course the girls would run to get help and elena couldnt possibly get away before she was caught first would come the constables who would charge her before the magistrate for assault and the law was on her stepmothers side an unmarried girl was the ward and property of her parents who could do whatever they wished with her of course most parents were good and kind and would never hurt their children not even when they were the children of another marriage but when they were not well there was no recourse for the child none at all well the magistrate would certainly have his say then would come ten strokes of the lash at the hands of the town gaoler followed by a session in the stocks in the town square then things would go right back to the way they were except that stepmothers hand would be even heavier even if she was twentyone an unmarried maiden was still a child in the eyes of the law and nothing could free her from her parents but marriage when she was much younger elena had dreamed about running away now she knew better a boy could run away perhaps and become a soldier or a wandering manofallwork or perhaps a tinker or join the gypsies it was different for a girl it was a dangerous world out there for a girl oh it was dangerous for everyone true there were bandit bands rogues thieves and tricksters not to mention storms and wild beasts but there were worse fates for a girl if her luck ran out stepmother was bad being kept as the captive of bandits for their pleasure would be infinitely worse probably she got to the carriage and handed the bandboxes up to jacques the single servant that the klovis household still possessed after madame and her daughters had finished running through the family fortune or what had passed for their fortune when elenas father died the dour sour man thin as a spider balding with a nasty long fringe around his pate and eviltempered as a toad took them from her and began strapping them to the top of the carriage adding them to the luggage already there elena turned back towards the house for more she heard whispers from the other side of the sandstone wall as she hurried up the mossy cobbles of the path that led from the front gate through the formal garden to the front door she didnt have to go far there was more luggage piled up just outside the stained oak door she loaded herself up with as much as she could carry and repeated her trip she had been loading the luggage since dawn first dragging the biggest trunks and boxes to the hired cart which had left before the sun cleared the pointed rooftops then piling the rest onto the old family carriage the carriage was huge it had been built to carry a family of eight with reasonable luggage for all of them and by the time she and jacques were finished madame delphinium and daphne would hardly have room to fit it looks as if theyre taking everything they own came a slightly louder whisper as she handed jacques more boxes and calico bags a bit of breeze teased the ragged edges of her skirt and tickled her bare legs yes they are she thought sourly and quite a bit that they dont own all of her mothers property which should have come to elena for instance and never mind that the dresses were decades outofdate the fabrics of fine silks and satins velvets and lace were still good elena had no doubt at all that they would soon grace the backs of madame and her daughters here anyone who saw those dresses would know where the fabric had come from but in another town no one would know or whisper let elena go in rags with but two skirts and two blouses to her name they would if they could not find the money to pay the silkmerchants bills still have new dresses and as for theresa kloviss jewels or what was left of them once madame and her daughters were safely in a place that didnt recognize those either the necklets and bracelets would go to a pawnbroker or to ornament the horrids that was what elena called them the horrid stepsisters would that they had been ugly as well their outsides matching their insides if there were any justice in the world they would both have the faces of greedy monkeys but no they were not particularly unattractive delphinium the eldest was a little too thin her nose a little too long for beauty and her perpetual look of hauteur was going to set extremely disagreeable lines in her face one day but right now she was not so bad to look at her sister daphne was just like her except for tending to plumpness rather than bones both had beautiful raven hair like their mother and if their eyes were rather closeset they were still a fashionable deep blue never venturing outdoors without a hat or a parasol kept their skin as pale as any lady could wish and their hands which never lifted more than a needle or a spoon were white and soft they were no great beauties but they were pretty enough and if they lacked for suitors here well that was partly due to the fact that they wouldnt consider anyone without a title or a fortune and preferably both the rest of it of course was because elena came the inevitable screech from above elena coming madame she called and handed jacques the last of the bags in a rush if he dropped them she didnt care let him take the blame for once they were such shrews such harridans that any sensible man in this town would have cut off his right hand rather than wed either of them only a sizable dowry would have enticed anyone here to court either of them dowries which neither of them possessed she pushed past the pile of boxes and bags still awaiting her inside the door and ran up the dark oak staircase elena came another screech this time in daphnes unmusical voice where are you you lazy slut no there wasnt a man in the town who didnt wince at the idea of hearing that voice coming from within his house she didnt trouble to answer just pushed open the heavy door into madames room it was the largest room in the house of course a pleasant chamber with whitewashed walls and dark beams supporting the ceiling furnished with a peculiar mix of the fashionable and the ancient the canopied bed for instance was generations old and was too heavy to move two of the chairs and the little dressingtable where madame sat were spindlylegged delicate items in the latest mode painted white and gilded the wardrobe was the same age as the bed plain and dark with little carving but the bedside table was the sibling to the dressingtable ornamented with carved curlicues and flowers the remains of the breakfast elena had brought up earlier were still littering the bedside tables the windowseat the massive oak mantelpiece and the floor madame had been tugging at the laces of daphnes corset but let go as soon as elena entered daphne hung to the post of the disturbingly bare canopy bed the bed had been stripped of its linens and embroidered hangings as soon as madame rose this morning those were some of the first things on the coach yes madame was taking everything that was remotely portable and the only reason she wasnt taking the modish furniture was that she had already sent on as much of that as she could manage madame didnt have to say anything elena took her place behind her daughter and wrapped the long corsetlaces around each hand not as long as they should be daphne was putting on weight again the wider gap between the edges of the corset proved that much if she didnt leave off the cream cakes and bonbons soon no amount of corsetting would make her fit her dresses elena put her knee in the small of daphnes back and pulled with all her might daphne squealed a protest as her waist gradually became several inches smaller with each pull of the laces madame however was having none of it pull harder girl she ordered looking down her nose if she will eat two cream teas in an afternoon then shell have to suffer the consequences i was being sensible daphne objected it would only have been thrown away elena gritted her teeth at that the food wouldnt have been thrown away elena herself would have gotten it it would have been nice to have a cake or two instead of stale dry toast and the watery remains of the tea greedy pig shed stuff herself sick rather than see elena have a single treat elena obeyed by pulling on the laces until she wondered if they were about to snap this was one of the few tasks she enjoyed doing and the corset narrowed again when the edges finally met she tied the laces off leaving daphne redfaced and panting in tiny breaths while she picked up the froth of three pink silk petticoats with their trimming of ecru lace from the floor they rustled and slid softly over her workroughened hands you really are getting as fat as a pig daphne said delphinium from the windowseat still dressed in nothing more than her corset shoes stockings and drawers she looked out the window as she spoke youll have to marry a peasant farmer before youre through if you keep eating like you have been because no wellborn man will be seen with a hog in satin mother whined daphne as elena dropped the three petticoats over her head and tied them in place and when madame feigned to ignore them both went on viciously well no one would look at you twice youre getting lines around your mouth and nose from all the scowling and starving yourself like you do gives you bad breath and no breasts youre as flat as a boy a boy with the face of an old hag huh better thin than looking like a pregnant sow delphinium replied but as elena took daphnes dress from the chair on which it had been left she saw delphinium surreptitiously pick up her handmirror and examine the area around her mouth with a certain alarm enough girls both of you that order in madames coldest voice shut them both up elena dropped daphnes pinkandgreen silk dress over her head and tugged it in place over the petticoats then laced up the back while daphne stood still once daphne was gowned madame rose from her dressing table and gestured imperiously obedient for a change daphne took madames place while madame attended to her hair all three women wore their hair piled high on their heads in elaborate designs of pompadours and ringlets and as a consequence never actually took their hair down and combed it out more often than once a month they slept with their hair protected at night by huge stiff paper cylinders so that in the morning madame didnt have to do a great deal to set it to rights ever since shed learned this elena had thought they were mad to fuss so much and she still did no one else in the town wore their hair that way unless they were going to attend a ball or some other important event it couldnt be comfortable sleeping like that and she shuddered to think what could move in and set up housekeeping in those untouched hairtowers it was stupid to go about dressed and coiffed like that every day why not even the queen went to such pains over her appearance you could see that for yourself if you went to the palace about the time she took her afternoon stroll in the garden with her son the elevenyearold prince florian that was one of the chief entertainments in their town of charbourg in fact going to the palace in the afternoon to watch the royal family walk about in their gardens then take a stroll yourself when the royals had gone into the palace and the gardens were open to the public for an hour not that elena ever had the time for such a diversion not since madame had come to be her stepmother but she remembered back when her mother was alive when the baby prince was just big enough to toddle about the grass the people of charbourg loved their king and queen and in fact everyone in the kingdom loved the king and queen otraria was a good kingdom to live in the land was fertile and the climate gentle the tax collectors never took more than was reasonable and sometimes gave what they took back if someone had fallen on hard times in spring there was never a frost to blight the blossoms in summer there was always enough rain and never too much the king listened to the needs of his people and met them and the king and his queen were good kind caring stewards of the land not like some of the five hundred kingdoms or at least life was good here for anyone who didnt have madame for a stepmother with daphne dressed it was delphiniums turn to be gowned and coiffed and the elder sister slid off the windowseat with a scowl and turned her back to elena delphiniums bony shoulder blades protruded over the back of the corset like a pair of skincovered winglets elena wondered why she bothered with a corset at all perhaps only because it was fashionable to wear one perhaps because the corset gave her a place to stuff balls of lambswool to give her the illusion of breasts the corset didnt exactly need tightening just tying and delphiniums petticoats of yellow and her dress of blue and yellow were soon slipped over her head and laced on all the while that elena had been dressing the girls she had heard jacques going back and forth to the carriage carrying off the baggage that had yet to be stowed there was a single basket on the floor and a single case on the bare mattress when madame finished with delphiniums hair she turned to elena put the toilette articles into the case madame said imperiously and pick up all the china and put it in the basket then bring both down to the carriage come girls the three of them sailed out the door and as elena hurried to attend to this final task she heard the sound of their elegant highheeled shoes clacking on the staircase as they made their way down she would have liked to just throw everything in the case and basket but knew better madame would check so she fitted the brush and mirror the comb and pick the powderbox and powderpuff the cologne bottles the rouge and lippaint and the patchbox all in their proper places then stacked dainty floralfigured saucers cups teapot and silver in the basket with the soiled napkins around them to keep them from jouncing at least this was one set of dishes she wouldnt be washing with the case in one hand and the basket in the other elena hurried down the stairs and out the door they were already waiting in the carriage with jacques up on the drivers box the hired horses stamping restively she handed up case and basket to daphne who took them and stowed them away somewhere at her feet madame thrust her head out the window keep the house tidy madame ordered yes madame elena replied throttling down her joy they still might change their minds something might happen madame might get cold feet at the last minute dont let any strangers in yes madame we will write to inform you of our address send any invitations from the palace on immediately yes madame stepmother looked down at her frowning as if trying to think of something else some order she had not yet given elena held her breath there was one she prayed that madame would not think of it and she did not she moved away from the window sat back in her seat and rapped on the roof of the coach with her cane jacques cracked his whip and snapped the reins over the horses backs with a clatter of clumsy hooves they were nothing more than carthorses after all the carriage lurched into motion it wallowed down the cobbled street over the arched granite bridge then around the corner and out of sight elena waited listening for the sound of returning horses there were too many things that could go wrong they could discover that they had forgotten something they still could change their minds madame could remember that she had not ordered elena not to leave the house and grounds the rosescented morning breeze pressed her shabby brown skirt against her bare legs her bare feet began to ache from standing on the hard cobbles the larks overhead continued to sing and a pair of robins appeared and perched on the sandstone wall beside her the sun climbed a little higher and still she waited but the clock in the church tower struck the hour and though she watched with her heart in her mouth there was no sign of them no rattle of wheels on the cobbles no clatter of hooves on the stone only the song of larks overhead the honking of geese on the river that flowed under the stone bridge the whisper of the neighbors on the other side of the wall you can come out now madame blanche madame fleur elena called i think theyre really gone two thumps and the patter of footsteps and the two old women burst out of their own gate and hurried over to elena they were as alike as two peas these neighbors sisters round and pink and sturdy dressed in handsome linen gowns with a modest trimming of ribbon no lace and white linen mobcaps over their greystreaked dark curls blanche wore grey fleur wore blue fleurs gown was sprigged with tiny flowers in darker blue blanches was faintly striped greyongrey elena was very fond of them they had done their best to help her whenever they could though they had to be careful madame klovis would punish elena for taking anything from them if she discovered it and madame hated both of the sisters common she called them with distaste though they were no more common than elenas father had been and not being given to speculation had kept the money they had intact what has been going on asked blanche at the same time as fleur burst out with where are they going to letours for now and if necessary right out of the kingdom entirely elena told them and she continued sourly as soon as the creditors find out i expect them to come for the furniture both little rosebud mouths formed identical shocked os i didnt know it was that bad fleur said after a moment she kept it all very quiet what are you going to do they cant claim the house of course since it was willed in equal shares to all of us and i havent run up any debts elena continued so at least i will have a place to stay for the moment but what will you do how will you manage blanche asked at last and why did they leave asked a more bewildered fleur all they would have had to do to discharge the debts would have been to sell some jewels live more frugally then fleur stopped as both elena and blanche favored her with sardonic looks oh the old woman said and grimaced i forgot this is madame and her daughters we are speaking of blanche shrugged she still could have lived frugally the elder sister said she could have decided to lose those airs of hers and act her station instead of miles above it elena just shook her head there are a great many things she could have done none of them suited her the old women tittered and blanche took elenas elbow come dear she said in a kindly tone of voice i would guess that madame didnt leave you so much as a crumb in that house and daphne ate everything that had been saved out of the cart before they left come over to our house and well give you breakfast i always enjoy cooking for you just at that moment a clatter of wooden wheels and a rattle of hooves made all three of them look up but it wasnt the carriage returning it was monsieur rabellet his wife was the towns most fashionable dressmaker and there was still a mighty outstanding bill from madame and her daughters at that establishment he was driving a commodious cart and he had a very determined and angry expression on his face word spreads quickly elena sighed thank you madame blanche i am hungry and i gratefully accept your invitation i would rather not be there as the corpse is stripped they heard more carts arriving as they worked together in the kitchen and soon voices were raised in angry argument on the other side of the fence presumably those who had arrived were just now finding out how little had been left behind that was of any value at all the heavy oldfashioned furniture that had been in elenas family for generations was not only hard to move it wasnt worth a great deal most of the fashionable items that had been left would need repair madame and her daughters were not easy on their possessions there tended to be a lot of fighting between the sisters teacups were hurled tables upset and the delicate legs of the newfashioned furniture didnt hold up well to such mistreatment elena tried to ignore the shouting there was one thing that she was certain of there was nothing in her little garret room that was worth taking if they even bothered to go up there when her father had remarried and brought home his bride and her two daughters the first thing that delphinium had done was to claim elenas room daphne had taken the nextbest chamber and madame had made over the remaining rooms into sitting rooms for the three of them except for the one that went to her very superior ladys maid elena had taken a little garret room at the top of the stairs at least with the chimney running through the middle of it it was warm in the winter when her father had died they had actually tried to force her out of her garret claiming that it was needed for madames new assistant ladys maid and for a hideously uncomfortable several years shed been forced to sleep on the kitchen hearth giving her a permanently smudged appearance and the nickname in the town of ella cinders but the maid had eventually decided that a garret room did not suit her lofty standards and daphne had to give up her sitting room elena got her garret back and as the family fortune was burned away in a funeral pyre of gowns and fripperies the servants began to leave what would you like in your omelette my dear asked blanche breaking into elenas reverie elena flushed realizing that she had been standing there lost in memory staring at the blank garden wall across from the kitchen door oh please madame let me nonsense blanche said firmly you have been on your feet since before dawn now just sit down and let us feed you and then perhaps we can help you make some plans mushrooms then please she replied if you have them fleur laughed elena please fancy us without mushrooms and the two women set about making a handsome breakfast for all three of them there were only three servants in their household a manofallwork a housekeeper and a little maid to help the housekeeper no cook blanche liked to cook no ladys maid no coachman no great state at all certainly nothing like the small army that madame had thought needful an army that elena had eventually come to replace all by herself then again their little house was half the size of elenas madame blanche was an excellent cook her husband had been a very plump and happy man with her as his wife it was by far the best meal that elena had tasted since the last time that fleur and blanche had smuggled her over to eat with them an ugly shouting match began on the other side of the wall as they were finishing their tea oh my fleur said cocking her head to one side i believe monsieur beavrais has discovered that he has come too late i hope this doesnt put my chickens off laying and speaking of chickens blanche said firmly taking the reins of conversation into her hands if youre going to be left with nothing as good neighbors i cannot even think of allowing you to starve i think we could spare you three hens and a rooster which would give you three eggs a day i doubt that the creditors will bother to tear up your kitchen garden so once that begins to produce you will have eggs and vegetables you can probably trade the vegetables for bread fleur added helpfully and perhaps you could take in washing with no one there but you there wont be nearly as much work everyone knows what a hard worker you are and that you were the one that has done everything in that house that jacques wouldnt do perhaps elena agreed although she already had ideas of her own on that score but she let them rattle on reveling in the fact that here it was midmorning and she was actually sitting down in a cozy kitchen with a cup of tea in her hand and nothing whatsoever in front of her to do and when the last rattle and bang from next door had died away the last set of boots clumped off the last dust settled she took her leave of her kind friends and went to see what the vultures had left her chapter elena paused at the gate to take a good long look at the house she had lived in all of her life seeing it really seeing it for the first time in a very long time she tried to look at it as if she was a stranger it was a handsome place which jacques had miraculously kept in good repair but then since it was made of the same beautiful goldengrey stone as the wall around it and had a stout slate roof perhaps that hadnt been all that difficult a proposition once in a great while a slate would slip and need to be replaced or a windowpane crack but that was all the lack of cloth fluttering at them told elena that the creditors had taken all of the curtains and the urns with their little rosemary bushes that had stood on either side of the front door and the statue of venus that had held prideofplace in the center of the flowerbed in this the front garden the bills must have been very large indeed for creditors to take the garden statuary at least they hadnt taken the glass out of the windows but perhaps they couldnt the glass was part of the house and as yet they could make no claim on the house itself they would have to go before a magistrate and elena could plead her cause there and possibly even win and even if she didnt she could take her cause to the king at his weekly audience and probably win they said that the king had a notoriously soft spot for orphans having been left one himself but that might just be a bit of idle gossip she lingered for a moment steeling herself for the inevitable then walked up the path the door had been imperfectly closed and opened with a touch it creaked on its iron hinges and for a moment elena winced expecting madame to shriek a complaint but no madame was no longer here to complain she relaxed again madame had taken as much as she could but most of the downstairs rooms still had been furnished before the creditors had arrived even madame klovis could not manage to carry off an entire household of furnishings in a carriage and a hired cart most of what madame had added in the way of decoration to the public rooms of the house had been in soft goods rugs tapestries cushions those she had taken with her leaving the heavy pieces behind now the morning light shining through the open windows showed nothing but bare walls with paler patches showing where the tapestries had been and bare wood floors marred with deep scratches where the heavy furniture had been dragged out elena began wandering through the rooms taking inventory of what was lost the sitting room here there had been a fine heavy settle beneath the window a handsome cabinet made for displaying the family silver madame had taken the silver a table and chairs at the fireplace a second settle against the wall opposite the window all of the furniture had been made of dark walnut lovingly rubbed and waxed until it glowed the only thing left now was the inglenook seat built into the fireplace itself the dining room where the furniture had been made of the same oak as the beds upstairs table twelve chairs sideboard all gone her fathers office desk chair cabinet where he had kept his records now a mere memory the tiny room seemed much bigger now the library she opened the door and stepped into the room and stifled a hurt gasp at the sight of all the empty shelves it had not been a large room no bigger than the dining room but it had been her favorite in all the house this was perhaps the greatest loss for elena for not only were the stout chairs and desk gone and the huge framed map of the five hundred kingdoms that had hung over the door but so were all the books and ornaments that had stood between them the ornaments had never interested her a great deal but the books those books had been the consolation of lonely hours the things that took her away when she was unhappy madame had not taken any of the books she had no use for such things and had not seen their value but to elena who had hoped that the creditors would not see the value either the loss of each book was as if she had lost a friend she had known each of them read them all countless times knew every foxed page every scar on every binding tears sprang into her eyes her throat closed and she jammed the side of her hand into her mouth to keep from sobbing aloud blinded by her tears she turned away quickly the pantry had already been empty every bit of food loaded into the carriage and she did not pause to examine it nor would she trouble to go down to the cellar there was nothing there either and for the same reason madame never stinted herself on fine wines and what she didnt drink without a doubt jacques would the kitchen however had still been furnished madame did not intend to have to cook for herself and had no need of kitchenware only the fine china had been packed away and taken but now it too was bare stripped as completely as any other room every knife every pot and pan excepting only the dishrags she had washed and left to dry two heavy brownglazed dishes and three mugs made of the commonest clay all of them chipped and worn and two pots made of the same substance so she could cook but otherwise even the spit the crane and the pothook in the fireplace had been taken no need to took in the stillroom what madame didnt take theyll have now she went upstairs and did not bother to check the bedrooms on the second floor if the creditors had been so thorough down below she doubted that they would have left anything other than dust instead she climbed the stairs to the attic and her garret room to see if anything at all had been left there she opened the door to her own room and for a moment she felt frozen with shock her few belongings had been tossed about the room as if a mad dog had been playing with them her poor flat little pillow was gone her ragged blankets were thrown into the corner her other change of clothing wadded up and tossed into the opposite corner the box that held her few little treasures had been upended and the comb with teeth missing the bit of broken mirror the feathers bits of pretty stone and dried flowers kicked everywhere the string of beads broken and scattered her pallet of strawstuffed canvas had been torn open the straw scattered about the room the place was a shambles for a second time she fought back tears but she truly wanted to fall to her knees and weep at the thoughtless cruelty of it why why tear her poor things to bits could they possibly imagine that there had been anything of value hidden up here how could they even think that she would have been allowed to keep anything hadnt the entire town been aware of her shabby state why the town beggars went better clothed than she perhaps another girl would have been paralyzed with the grief that shook her but elena had learned to work even while her heart was breaking and her eyes overflowing a long time ago and if her hands shook as she carefully picked up and shook out her spare skirt bodice and blouse her wornout shawl and kerchief and folded them up to set them in the windowseat what was left of her bits and souvenirs in a mound atop them well there was no one to see and if she sprinkled the straw she regathered from the floor with her tears there was no one to mock her grief but it was hard hard to have the little she had saved of her past life ground into dust as those poor flowers had been at least she was wearing the locket with her mothers portrait in it around her neck on a ribbon daphne had stolen the chain long ago she sobbed quietly as she collected every bit of straw she would need something to sleep on tonight it had to be done and no one would do it for her she stuffed it all back into the empty canvas sack that had been her bed and at least there was one small blessing she always kept her needlecase in the pocket of her apron and had they found that they probably would have taken it as well so she was able to stitch the mattress back up again sitting crosslegged on the bare floor they had torn the seams open rather than ripping up the canvas and although she had to remake it a little smaller when she finished it was not in much worse shape than it had been before it had been torn apart it was a hard thing though to find that men whom she had never harmed who should realize that she had been just as illtreated as they should take out their anger on her and when she thought about how the flowers from her mothers grave had been crushed the few things she could call her own left in ruins her eyes burned and new sobs choked her ahem she squeaked and jumped and cast startled eyes on the open doorway there was a man standing there he stepped into the light and she saw that it was monsieur rabellet he carried a bundle under one arm and his face was suffused with guilt i am sorry ella he said flushing with shame when he caught sight of her tearstreaked face they were looking for valuables and they started in on your room before i could stop them it was the latecomers you see the ones who got nothing because she sniffed and wiped her cheeks with the back of her hand but said nothing she just stared at him and let the tears come weeping silently she was not going to make this easy on him if hed cared to he could have stopped them he was a big man only the blacksmith was bigger at least i kept them from tearing up your clothes he protested and flushed again at least no more than they already were he coughed and swallowed audibly as she fixed him with a look that she hoped would stab him to the heart and double his guilt the wife gave me a piece of her mind when she found out well madame rabellet had always been kind to elena who had given her the respect due to a fine craftswoman and always been ready to lend a hand at the fittings proving herself so useful that madame rabellet had never needed to bring her apprenticegirl with her anyway when she found out she sent me back here with this the man took two steps forward into the room and thrust the bundle at elena who automatically put out her hands to take it from him she said it wasnt fair said god gives blessings to the charitable said he was backing up as he babbled as if the accusations in her eyes were arrows wounding him and when he reached the door he whirled and fled leaving her alone as his hasty footsteps on the floor and the staircase echoed through the empty rooms she sat there unmoving until the slamming of the front door woke her from her shock she looked at the bundle in her hands it was fabric it was woolen dyed a goldenbrown not new but sound in good condition and so far as she could tell not stained either she unfolded it to find that it was a large plain shawl and it was only the covering for a bundle of clothing a skirt a blouse and a bodice like the shawl the fabric was not new and the skirt and bodice had been redyed the skirt was a heavy twilled linen and there was a kerchief that matched dyed a dark brown the bodice was black and the blouse a pale color that was not quite white they all looked to have been made from much larger garments cut down when the seams were too worn to hold but the fabric itself was still good they were not patched not torn not darned in fact they were stoutlysewn and well redyed these were the sorts of things that a dressmaker assigned to a new apprentice to make simple garments to teach her to sew a fine seam they were the best pieces of clothing that elena had owned since her father had died they were also exactly what she needed to carry out her plan when the rest of the town discovered as it must given that madame blanche and madame fleur were two of the most inveterate gossips in the kingdom that elena had been left behind to live as best she could in the empty house a few of the more guiltstricken arrived to leave small offerings at her doorstep most she never saw she heard footsteps on the path and by the time she got to the front door the gate was swinging shut and there was a basket or a bundle on the doorstep in fact except for monsieur rabellet she didnt get much more than a glimpse of a skirt or a pair of legs but the offerings were welcome indeed desperately needed a warm woolen shawl a kitchen knife and a very old and very small frying pan a loaf of bread a ball of cheese a blanket a pat of butter a pannikin of salt and a twist of tea so she wouldnt go hungry tonight nor cold madame blanche completed the offerings in person delivering a half dozen eggs and some bacon just as the sun began to set she found elena on her knees at the hearth in the kitchen getting the fire going again and ready to toast some bread and cheese for her supper well she said looking with approval at the food i was hoping someone would have a guilty conscience good her mouth firmed with satisfaction so now the robbers have taken care of what you need for now but have you thought about what youre going to do elena sat back on her heels and looked up at her kindly old neighbor i have actually i thought it up the day madame told me that she and the girls were going i just she shook her head i wanted to tell you but madame swore me to secrecy she told me that she was going to leave me here to look after the house and that was when i made up my mind what i was going to do when she was truly gone you did well good for you madame blanche went out into the kitchen garden and came back with some bits of herbage pinched off the new growth in the herb bed here you are dear those will go nicely in coddled eggs so what are you going to do she took a deep breath im going to leave im going to leave here and never come back madame blanche blinked as if she could not quite believe what she had just heard i dont suppose you would care to explain that tomorrow is the mop fair elena elaborated anyone who is looking for a servant is going to be there and you said yourself that everyone in the town knows that ive done every bit of cleaning mending and tending in this house for years anyway im only a plain cook but anything else i can do but but youre not a servant madame blanche said looking blank youre from a good family elena your poor mother if she knew shed be weeping at the thought its one thing for me to do my own cooking but i may not have been born a servant but thats what i am now elena said firmly im too old to become an apprentice in any decent trade even if i had the fee so that is what i am good for now she bit her lip and continued bitterly you know thats the truth that its all im good for now madame klovis saw to that i have no dowry no prospects nothing to offer a young man but myself and what young man would marry an old maid of twentyone who brings him nothing but her two hands and a few housekeeping skills unless i dispute it within days the magistrates will turn this very house over to the creditors even if i do dispute it and win what am i to do it wont be long before madame klovis returns for you surely dont think that shell have any better luck elsewhere in her fortune hunting any more than i do and i will be back to being her unpaid slave well madame blanche said blankly i suppose that all of that is true so there you are elena said trying to sound determined and not bleak this is my only chance to get away from her and if i am going to have to spend the rest of my life mending and tending and cleaning then i am by heaven going to be paid for it and at least ill have three meals a day and two suits of clothing a year as well she reminded herself every servant no matter how lowly was entitled to that and her bed and board and pay it would be more than she had ever gotten out of madame klovis madame blanche took a deep breath as if she was about to dispute elenas view of the situation then let it all out in a tremendous sigh i am afraid my dear she said sadly that you are correct and you are a very brave girl elena shook her head i am not brave at all she replied and a little of her despair crept into her voice despite her attempts to keep it out i am terrified madame blanche if i were brave i would go to the king and find some way to get everything back again if i were brave i would reclaim this house at least and sell it and use the money to set myself up in a little cottage somewhere with a cow and some chickens and geese and a little garden of my own but i am not brave i am afraid to face all of the creditors and the magistrate i am too terrified to even think seriously of going to the king i am running away madame blanche and i was not even brave enough to face my stepmother and tell her what i am going to do when she returns she will find the house has been sold and i am gone and if i am working for some family here in town i will hide until she goes again madame blanche regarded her gravely for a long moment the light from the fireplace casting strange shadows on her face you may be right elena in saying that this is the only thing you can do but i think you are wrong in saying that you are not brave she paused may i tell fleur what you have told me of course elena replied i would be happy to have now it was her turn to pause to choose the right phrase her kindly thoughts and i am sure you will have them my dear madame blanche said warmly well i will leave you to make your supper in peace and she bowed a little before she turned and left elena sighed and put a pat of butter in the skillet to melt after everything had been taken there were two things left there had been wood in the woodshed and a bucket on the pump she made and ate her dinner eggs and bread and a little tea she cleaned the dishes in the light from the fire then she banked the fire until morning washed her face and hands and for lack of anything else to do went up to bed there were no candles of course for even if her stepmother had left any the creditors would have taken them so elena climbed the stairs to her room in the dark and made up her bed with the new shawl bundled around her old clothing for a pillow and the new blanket over the old tattered ones by the light of the moon coming in her window she carefully took off her outer clothing and slid into the bed in her shift and if the pallet was a little lumpier than it had been it was also warmer beneath the new blanket and this was the earliest she had been able to go to sleep in as long as she could recall usually she was awake until after midnight with all of the tasks she had to finish later than that if the horrids had been to a ball or a party and she had to stay up to help them undress she usually didnt get to go to sleep on a full stomach either it had been a very long day nevertheless and an emotional one she was tired as tired as she ever had been and no one is going to wake me with a scream for something she realized as she felt her muscles relaxing in the unaccustomed warmth the empty house felt odd there was a hollowness to it there were no little sounds below her of people moving about or making noises in their sleep through her open window which overlooked the kitchengarden she heard voices coming from the house next door not loud enough to make out what was being said but loud enough to know that it was blanche and fleur and a third unfamiliar voice she smiled a little it was probably a client of fleurs someone like fleur usually saw a lot of clients after dark few people wanted to be seen patronizing a witch even if that witch was someone who had a heart full of only good true as a priest and honest as a magistrate everyone knew that fleur was a witch of course and had been since she was very small indeed though no one every actually said the word aloud this was why they called her madame although unlike her sister she had never had a husband you just called a witch madame it was respectful and it didnt do to treat a witch with disrespect that was why elena had chosen her words so carefully when shed asked for fleurs good wishes and why blanche had asked so carefully if she could tell fleur words took on extra weight and extra potency when there was a witch involved you were careful about words around witches not that fleur had a great deal of magic of the sort that tales were made of no fleurs power lay in healing and herbs she was a very small witch as witches went ask her to cure your child or get your dry cow to give milk again and there was no problem ask her to cast a love spell or break a curse and she would look at you helplessly and shrug as she had the day that elena weeping after having had yet another possession appropriated by one of the horrids had come running into the neighbors garden and begged fleur to make madame go away fleur had only looked at her sadly i cannot dear she said slowly i am bound to tell you the truth my pet somewhere madame obtained a very powerful love spell and your father is entrapped in it i cannot break it though i wish with all my heart that i could i could not even begin to guess how to break it in fact elena stared at the moon framed in her window as she remembered that dreadful moment it had been an epiphany of sorts until that moment she had believed that all endings were happy ones that all good adults could help children if only the children asked and that good things happened to good people if only they were brave enough in that moment she had learned that sometimes good people were helpless that terrible things happened to good people that there were sad endings as well as happy ones worst of all she had learned that no matter how brave and good you were bad people often won and that her father was lost to her forever from that moment she mourned him as if he was dead and indeed for all intents and purposes he might just as well have died he came less and less to protect her from her stepmother and stepsisters until at last he did nothing at all he scarcely seemed to realize that she existed he totally forgot that he had ever been married to anyone else and spent his every waking moment trying to find some new means of pleasing his madeleine it almost came as an anticlimax when he sickened and died within that year of wedding madame she thought looking back on it that she had known deep in her heart that this was what would happen love spells did not last forever not even powerful ones and madame was not the sort to allow her power to ebb away but this was the peculiar thing elena had spent her time since her fathers death wrapped in a growing sense of tension and frustration as if something was out there some force that would make all of this better if only she knew how to invoke it that there was a way to turn this into a happy ending and that her life was a coiled spring being wound ever tighter until it would all be released in a burst of wonder and magic that would give her back everything that had been taken and more the longer things went on the more she felt that climax rushing towards her or she towards it but it never happened not on her sixteenth birthday the primary moment of magical happenings according to every tale that she had ever read or heard nor on her eighteenth which was the other possibility no things stayed exactly as they had been no fairy godmother appeared not even madame fleur somehow empowered to take elena out of her miserable existence no handsome prince no prince of any kind appeared on the doorstep to save her there was not even a marriage proposal from the blacksmiths son or the cowherd both traditional disguises for wandering princes nothing only more and more backbreaking work and the certainty that nothing was going to change that madame had things arranged precisely as she wanted them and that elena would be ella cinders the household slave until she died and her despair grew until it matched the tension inside until it overwhelmed the tension inside and the only escape from either she ever had were a few stolen moments inside the covers of a book for years while she still had hope she had eased her sadness by telling herself stories like those she read in the books and heard old women tell their grandchildren once upon a time they always began there was a poor orphan girl who was forced to slave for her wicked stepmother and they ended with and the orphan girl married the prince or the duke or the earl or the handsome magician and lived happily ever after then gradually the stories had changed and the rescuer had not been a prince by the time she was sixteen and a day she had abandoned all thoughts of royalty and instead prayed and hoped with a clawing despair for romance just a little just an ordinary love of her own no the dreams she had told no one were no longer about the unattainable but about the barely possible if there were somewhere in the town a man willing to brave madames wrath to steal her away day in day out in the market by the river or from her garret window she had watched other girls with envious eyes as they were courted and wooed by young men they seemed so happy and as her sixteenth and then eighteenth birthdays passed her envy for their lot grew as did the stirrings in her heart and elsewhere as she spied on them from behind her curtains or while pretending to select produce in the marketplace when their sweethearts stole kisses and caresses and if only if only she dreamed of the handsome young men the jaunty apprentices the clever journeymen the stout and rugged young farmers then watched them court and marry someone else time after time never giving her as much as a glance then she dreamed of notsohandsome notsoyoung men the widower with two children the storekeeper with an aged mother the workweary bachelor farmer who did exactly the same and when she found herself contemplating with wordless longing the balding paunchy town clerk who at least had kind eyes only to weep in her pillow with despair when he married the crosseyed daughter of the miller she knew that she had reached the end of dreams at least those sorts of dreams all that had been left her was a single simple longing let me get away dearest father in heaven let me get away and finally at long last this one little prayer had been answered well now that she had a chance to get away she was going to seize it with both hands she would dream of getting a decent place then working her way up with hard work and cleverness becoming a cook or a housekeeper that was real that was attainable not some feeling that her life was a tightlycoiled spring that would shoot her into a life of ease and a path strewn with stars feelings were nothing the only thing that counted was what was in front of your eyes what you could hold in your hands tomorrow was the mop fair that was what it was called here in otraria other places called them hiring fairs she had heard but here the occasion was named for the mops that women wishing to be hired as servants carried with them into the town square in fact it wasnt just women who presented themselves to be hired it was men too the women would line up on one side of the square the men on the other each of them would have some token of his or her skills about them a maidofallwork would have a mop or a dust rag a cook would bring a pan a shepherd would have his crook of course a farmhand a twist of wheat in his hat a drover a whip in his hand or a twist of whipcord in his hat each of them would have his or her belongings bundled up at his feet and those who needed servants would come and examine them make an offer and be accepted or refused that wasnt the only thing that would happen tomorrow of course it was a fair after all and all of the booths and games the displays and amusements typical of a fair would be going on in the center of the square as well it was a very large town square with more than enough room for a lively fair with space left to spare but the hiring was the chief thing and tomorrow she would be ready for it she would wear her new clothing with the frying pan in her hand and a dust rag tucked into the band of her skirt showing that she was an allaround servant and she would take the first offer that came from anyone who looked kind that was all she wanted kindness and a good master or mistress but she still had hopes even if they were much reduced and when the moon had left her window she fell asleep thinking of them a kind old priest whose housekeeper has gone to live on the generous pension he granted her a busy scholar absentminded who needs looking after a large family with a dozen children happy and easynatured a great lord whose housekeeper is looking for maids who can be trusted and so at last her hopes became dreams and her treacherous dreams sent her down paths she had given up or thought she had into stories and the handsome son of the great lord fell ill and no one would tend him but the brave little scullery maid who nursed him back to health at the risk of her life and when he came to himself and looked into her pale grave face and knew what she had done he fell in love she awoke at dawn with fleurs roosters telling the whole world that it was more than time to be up and about and if there were tears soaking her makeshift pillow there was at least no one to see chapter fleurs roosters had the habit of crowing before the sun was actually up but elena was used to getting up that early anyway madame klovis had been a demanding mistress and her daughters took after her she had managed to keep a full staff busy when all that was left was elena and jacques there had always been too much to do and not enough time to do it in so this morning she woke as she always did immediately and alert and although she could have gone back to sleep again for the first time in years to sleep late she knew that this of all days was no time to be lazy if she wanted a choice spot at the mop fair she needed to get there soon after sunup and she wasnt going to do that by lying in bed in her belongings had been the tagend of the bar of coarse harsh laundry soap somehow it had escaped being mashed into the floor squashed into her clothing or otherwise destroyed appearances were terribly important at the mop fair and she was determined not to be ella cinders not when she was trying to make a good impression so once she had finished breakfast she brought everything she owned down into the kitchen and filled the sinks and all the pots with water from the pump she packed up everything but her new clothing a dust rag and the pan in a bundle then stood naked in the middle of the kitchen and scrubbed and rinsed herself until she was pink and her hair and skin squeaked with cleanliness only then did she put on the new clothing she bound up her hair braiding it tightly and confining it under the kerchief then she shouldered her burden and marched straight out the front door she took a deep breath on the threshold and closed the door behind her walking away without looking back because she knew that if she did she would never have the courage to go on with this she paused for a moment in the thin grey light of morning looking at the silent well silent except for the roosters house next door she had hoped that fleur or blanche would be about but there was no sign of either of them as she passed their front gate she closed her eyes made a last silent prayer and strode resolutely towards the square and she hoped her new future the town square had some movement in it a few people walking about among the stalls and along the shops the sun was just below the level of the buildings now the rooftops and ridges were gilded with sunlight though the square was still in shadow the men lined up on the cattlepen side the women along the front of the town hall the most desirable spaces were at either end for those nearest to the ends would be seen first and elena took one next to the firstcomers in a place that would be in shade during most of the afternoon she was one of the first to take her place right behind a plump woman with a suspicious eye a pair of young girls with dust rags who looked like sisters and an old lady with a nursemaids cap and a motherly look to her the stalls and booths for the fair had been set up last night but only a single hot pie stand was manned this early her mouth watered at the smell of the fresh pies but pies werent for the likes of her without even a sou to her name she had the bread and cheese made up into sandwiches in her bundle that and water would have to see her through the day more and more women and girls straggled up to join the line as the fair came to life more stalls opened and the air began to fill with the shouts of barkers hawking their wares or entertainments the scent of fried food sausages meat pies sweetstuffs eventually by the time most folk had finished breakfast and the shops were opening the fair was in full voice and the first prospective masters and mistresses were walking the line examining what was on offer there the two girls went first to a woman in a farmers smock who was looking for a pair of maidsofallwork they seemed perfectly pleased to be chosen and elena took that as a good omen every time someone paused in front of her elena looked them straight in the eyes recited her abilities and prayed someone kind someone kind but most merely looked at her and moved on for some the reason was obvious women with husbands with hungry eyes or sons old enough to begin thinking about girls no one wanted to hire a girl who could all too readily become the plaything of someone in the family it was hard enough to keep a girl away from the trouble that came from fellow servants and farmworkers at least there she could presumably be relied on to have enough common sense not to fall into a haymow and into pregnancy unless there was a wedding in the offing but a pretty girl had no defenses against a predatory master as a sheltered girl of a wealthy family elena had known nothing of such things as one of the lowly servants she had learned a great deal madames servants gossiped constantly and it hadnt been long before they were ignoring her as so unimportant that it was safe to gossip in front of her for the rest of those possible employers though she could not even begin to guess why they passed her by it wasnt that she was expecting too much in fact she could have asked far more than the wages of a maidofallwork the lowest wages all that she asked for were set by law she was a plain cook and general housemaid and she should get a shilling a week two suits of clothing or household uniform bed and board and twice a year a threeday holiday so why were so many people looking at her taking a second look then passing on to choose someone else it became harder to understand as the noontime came and the strongest brightestlooking and most competent of the other girls were chosen leaving her clearly the best of the lot available at noon a boy with a bucket came along the line with water elena took out her sandwiches and the least chipped of the mugs and got a drink the bread was dry on the outside but she had used all of the butter on the inside and it was no worse a meal than many shed had under madame by now the sun was very warm and she loosened the neck of her blouse a little fanning herself with her dust rag she would be glad when the shadows of the shopbuildings to the west would fall on her and the others still waiting now those who were examining the women and girls moved down the line more slowly examining the candidates with great care for the choices were fewer and now something peculiar was happening these people looked her in the eyes and looked away one or two stopped and asked her name after she had recited her qualifications elena klovis she said and after a moment of blankness they would say as if to themselves ah ella cinders then they would shake their heads and move on finally the explanation came after a harriedlooking woman seized on the sight of the old nursemaid with relief and a cry of oh nanny parkin i did not know you would be here the old woman quickly made an advantageous bargain for herself but then turned to elena just before leaving the line i didnt want to blight your hopes dearie nanny parkin said in the kindliest of tones but no one will hire you but elena stammered they know who you are you see the old woman continued everyone knows ella cinders now those that didnt know your tale surely do now after what happened yesterday no one wants to face madame klovis when she returns they know shell return and there wont be anything left here of value when the creditors are finished but you you see shell want you shell have some rights to you and if someone else has you there will be the devil to pay and she picked up her own bundle and followed her new employer elena stared after her in shock and dismay and when she glanced over at some of the others in the line she saw nods or else averted gazes she almost gave up but no she decided no i will not give up there are still farmers here and merchants and maybe they need someone they wont be able to make a choice until their goods are sold and their purchases made i will stay people from outside of town wouldnt be afraid of madame they would know that madame would never stir out into the countryside to find the flyaway stepdaughter there was still a chance a good chance but as the shadows stretched across the square as time passed and stalls and booths closed as the line of women thinned and finally the two lines of those who wished to be hired were combined into one men to the right women to the left her hopes thinned also still she stayed stayed as the last of the foodstalls closed and there was no one left but a dubiouslooking sausageseller hawking equally dubious sausages as even the disagreeablelooking cook was trundled away by a cross old man she stayed until the sun was setting and there was no one left except her the dispirited sausageseller and one other this was a gangly boy with no tokens of experience all elbows and knees wearing clothing that was three sizes too big for him apparently made of tentcanvas there was another person as well but he was not hoping for hire this was the father that was keeping the boy company yant t go naow the man said to the boy who shook his head stubbornly though his face bore an expression that was as desperate as elena felt the moment the last of the sun went below the horizon she would have to go the fair would be over and there would be no chance of finding a place until next year oh officially it wasnt over until midnight but no one would be here looking for someone to hire after the sun set laundry she thought despondently ican take in laundry at least as long as i can keep the creditors from taking the house i can keep those hens that blanche offered me the kitchen garden will feed them and me both at least as long as i can keep the creditors from taking the house then just as the sun sank behind the buildings to touch the horizon came an unexpected noise it came from the street leading into the square the sound of hooves and wheels rattling on the cobbles which was odd the stallholders would not come to take down their booths and stalls until tomorrow and anyone coming to stay at the inn was already there could it be was there the slightest chance she looked up peering down towards the street the vehicle rattled into the square an odd little dogcart driven by a little old lady dressed in a quite eccentric outfit of clothing it could have been gypsy clothing if gypsies were neat as a pin impeccably groomed and wore beautifully sewn and ornamented garments that looked far newer than elenas it was certainly bright enough to be gypsy clothing scarlet boots with black stitching blue skirt embroidered with red and yellow flowers and green leaves black bodice yellow blouse scarlet vest and wildly embroidered black shawl the old woman wore her hair in a fat knot at the back of her head from which little curling wisps were escaping the cart was as odd as the driver also scarlet painted all over in multicolored flowers and the horse or perhaps pony was the oddest of all it was grey with huge eyes had floppy ears a hunched back and was no bigger than a mastiff but it was wildly strong for it pulled that cart with no perceptible effort at all and looked altogether jaunty and proud of itself and it wore a straw hat both floppy ears pulled through holes and falling over the brim ah the old lady said pulling up in front of elena good you havent gone home that speaks well for your spirit im very glad to see it would you like a position ah elena said looking startled into a pair of the bluest kindest eyes she had ever seen someone kind she did not even have to think it didnt matter what was wanted ah yes yes please in with you then my dear the old lady said and elena wasted not a second she tossed her bundle into the back of the cart and scrambled up beside the old woman she didnt even stop to ask what the position was as they drove out of the square she heard the man ask his son again yant t go naow and heard the boy say stubbornly no taint tomorrow yet im stayin till midnight she looked back at them until the cart turned a corner and they were lost behind buildings wondering what would happen to the poor lad the little horse picked up speed trotting with all his might and main still showing no signs that the cart was too heavy for him acting as if in fact it was lighter than thistledown as they passed under the wall that encircled the town and through the town gates dusk descended the little horse picked up his pace until he was galloping his tiny hooves flying there was a bump and elena clutched the side of the cart the old woman was making no attempt to rein her horse in and he was going awfully fast in fact they were right out of sight of the town walls now the cart bumping and rattling along at a rate that put her heart right in her throat the cart gave a lurch a bump a wiggle and a huge jolt that sent it flying into the air and it didnt come down she gasped and clutched at both the side of the cart and the old ladys arm as they rose right up into the twilight sky heading for the stars she tried to cry out in fear instead she squeaked the old lady laughed and tied off the reins elena looked down at the ground and immediately regretted it dont look again my dear the old woman said cheerfully at least not until you get used to it elena tried to say something but nothing would come out of her throat panic was the mildest description of what she felt right now a witch she must be a witch that was the only possible explanation for this a powerful witch a very powerful witch one that made fleur look like like elena no wonder she wasnt afraid of madame the way everyone else was if she can make a cart and horsefly she could turn madame into a toad with a snap of her fingers but what did she want with elena well witches ate and presumably needed their houses cleaned maybe it was easier to hire a servant than to do it all by magic the old lady rummaged under the seat nonchalantly taking out a basket she flicked a finger and a little round ball of light appeared over their heads illuminating both of them im sure youre hungry elena she said with a cheerful smile would you help me with this she began handing elena napkins a plate of sandwiches another of little iced cakes and cups of tea that somehow emerged steaming from the hamper the cart was as steady as a house and the seat between them became their table spread with plates of food a teapot a small milkjug a bowl of sugar it was absurd impossible ridiculous and the very ordinariness of the cloth set for two in the midst of all this impossibility gave her a kind of anchor something to grasp at at this point elenas store of shock was beginning to run out she accepted a sandwich and cup in a numb daze well said the old lady in a nonchalant matteroffact tone i expect you would like to know what this is all about elena took a bite of her sandwich automatically because well because that was what you did with a sandwich it was ham and watercress very good ham in fact she hadnt had ham quite this good since she was a small child yes please she said in a small voice overhead the sky was a deep black strewn with the brightest stars she had ever seen beneath the cart was nothing but darkness which was altogether better than looking down on houses no larger than toys well where to begin the old lady sipped her tea i suppose i should begin with this elena i am your fairy godmother elena blinked and a thousand thoughts raced through her head uppermost was then where have you been all this time when my stepmother was starving and beating me the thought did not have the heat of anger in it yet but in a few moments it would actually to clarify i am the fairy godmother to this entire kingdom she continued and elena was suddenly glad that she had not blurted out what had been in her head a fairy godmother to her wasone thing a fairy godmother to all of otraria was quite another being angry now would be like being angry at a thunderstorm because it happened to rain on you you do know about the king of otraria i presume and his queen who used to be the princess who could not laugh elena nodded well that was my doing the goose and all those people stuck to the goose and each other she smiled and patted her hair with every sign of pride one of my best efforts i think so in that case you already know how tales come true for some people something about the way she said that made elena repeat it some people the old lady nodded indeed you see whenever there is a person whose life begins to resemble a tale the brave little orphan lad the lovely girl with the wicked stepmother the princess with the overly protective father something begins to happen and that something is magic she paused and ate a dainty quarter of sandwich magic begins to gather around them you see and in fact there are even certain people to whom that begins to happen from the moment they are born that magic begins to try to force their lives down the path that their circumstances most closely resemble and the longer it takes for that to happen the more magic begins to gather around them elena sat stockstill her cup clutched in both hands thinking about that tension she had been feeling for so very many years was that the magic the old lady peered at her and nodded with satisfaction so you have felt it good then you understand that magic has been trying very hard to propel you down the path of a tale to a happily ever after and youve been well overdue for that ever since you were sixteen but elena began among the many other things they do the fairy godmothers are supposed to help that sort of thing along like midwives the old lady continued right over the top of elenas but which is why we always turn up when something goes horribly wrong to counter the bad fairys curse or the invasion of an evil sorcerer but quite often im afraid in fact more often than not circumstances around that special person are just not going to allow the happy ending that the magic is pushing for take your case for instance you do realize what was supposed to happen in your life dont you well of course she did how could she not shed daydreamed it often enough on the princes birthday there would be a great ball she said automatically i would get a gown somehow my mothers spirit would weave it of flowers perhaps or she looked penetratingly at the old woman or your fairy godmother would conjure it out of the rags left from your mothers old gowns yes or brownies would sew it and leave it for you in the garden exactly and then well i would go to the ball and no one would recognize me the prince would fall in love with me and i with him and he would take me away and i would live they finished in chorus happily ever after exactly so unfortunately my dear in your case though your stepmother and stepsisters are fully wicked enough to justify that sort of happy ending prince florian is a mere boy of eleven she paused just long enough for elena to begin to feel horribly cheated somehow then continued nor are you the only girl to whom this has happened with this particular tale all over the five hundred kingdoms down through time there have been countless girls like you for whom the circumstances were not right their destined princes were greybeards infants married or terrible rakes or not even princes at all but princesses and the magic keeps gathering around them trying to make it all work oh and by the way we call that the tradition the way that magic tries to set things on a particular course you see and there are dozens and dozens of other tales that the tradition is trying to recreate all the time and perhaps one in a hundred actually becomes a tale elena nodded pushing off that feeling of being cheated with all her determination all right i do see but so all of that magic is building up around the person you in fact like a snowball rolling down a hill it just gets attracted the same way that white cat hair is attracted to a black velvet bodice you know now the old woman was watching her closely for what i see but it never goes away sometimes it just builds up to the point where a magician notices it and it gets she waved her hand vaguely siphoned off sometimes neatly with the persons consent and to the benefit of the person though the effect of that is that it leaves them quite ordinary nothing magical will ever happen again to her or him but at least their life will go on rather as everyone elses life goes on and if the persons circumstances are truly dire usually the magician who benefits by the magic gives them a helping hand to a set of better circumstances which of course breaks the tradition so that the magic stops building up around them and sometimes it is siphoned not so nicely her expression darkened if that happens elena they are generally left dead and if they arent well believe me when i tell you that they are worse off than if they were dead elena went cold all over was that why the old woman had offered her a position did she only want the magic perhaps it wouldnt be so bad to be ordinary but at that moment even though not so long ago she would have welcomed the prospect she knew that this was not the right answer anymore not now and sometimes the old lady went on if the person has attracted someone who is not only a magician but a magical guardian something else happens she smiled a warm smile that felt like a comforting arm around elenas shoulders and elena smiled back without knowing quite why i am that something else at least in your case what sort of something else elena asked cautiously her mouth felt very dry and automatically took a sip of tea it was stonecold but before she could do more than make a face the old lady wiggled her finger at it and the cup was suddenly steaming again elena felt dizzy someone has to become the fairy godmothers and the white wizards and the good witches it has to be someone who already has enough magic gathered around her or him so that she can properly learn how to use that magic and how to get more before what she has accumulated is used up as i said i am the fairy godmother for all of otraria and i am getting old and tired i need an apprentice that would be you elena had expected to hear any number of things this was not one of them me elena squeaked that is where all of those good magicians come from dear the old lady said all of those people like you whose happilyeverafters just arent going to come but who still have too much that is special about them to ever be content with being ordinary youre ready you are more than ready youre brave sensible clever and extremely magical you have a kind heart and a good mind you are certainly proper godmother material elena thought about that for a moment and thought about how she had felt just before the old woman turned up angry and full of fear and desperation excuse me but what happens if one of those same people goes bad turns ugly and nasty over what theyre having to go through where do you think evil sorcerers and wicked witches come from the old lady asked darkly and paused not bad fairies though nor good fairies those are fair folk and something else entirely theyre born that way but the wicked witches the bad wizards the dread sorceresses oh my yes elena took a deep breath and closed her eyes for a moment she didnt precisely think she simply let all that she had been told sink in fairy godmothers bad witches the tradition the magic it all fell into a pattern in a way that life never had before she opened her eyes oh i think i see and the position you offered me as my apprentice yes is for life and one day you will choose someone like you and make her the same offer the old lady nodded now you can refuse it if you like and if you like i can take all that magic from you and make you like everyone else youll still have a position ill see to that i know several kind folk who could use a plain cook or a housekeeper and actually that is something else that a godmother does there are far more people who want to be rid of the magic than want to become our apprentices it can be hard work and it can be dangerous after all we stand in the way of what they want she cocked her head to the side and waited for elenas response she did not have to say who they were where do you think the evil sorcerers and bad witches come from and some of those were very very evil indeed but elena really did not have to think about her answer for very long given a choice between an ordinary life and a magical one well it was no choice at all i would love to be your apprentice madame she said solemnly as if she was making a pledge and i do accept grand the old lady crowed now you may call me madame bella my dear and i believe we shall get along capitally oh look she pointed just in time for elena to see a shooting star streak across the heavens in front of them a good omen quickly make a wish i dont have to she said slowly feeling the deep truth of her words even as she spoke them i already have it madame bella smiled then i believe that we shall make all speed for home your home now and for as long as you care have it so home what a wonderful word that was and words were powerful for witches for a fairy godmother it should be very powerful indeed more than powerful enough to make it all real chapter quite as matteroffactly as if they were sitting on a bench in a starlit pleasuregarden instead of on a flying cart madame bella packed up the hamper with elenas help and stowed it once more under the seat madame made the little ball of light vanish when she was through leaving them sitting side by side in the darkness now in spite of the fact that they were flying through the air rather high above the ground the only real indication of this was that there was nothing but darkness below them madame bella was as calm and composed as if she did this every day and the motion of the cart well there just wasnt any perceptible motion only a bit of breeze from their passing it was surreal to tell the truth giving elena a sense of peculiar dizziness and disorientation she blinked and for the first time wondered if she really was flying through the night sky above the countryside the whole situation was very dreamlike after all dreamlike was it a dream the more she thought about it the more certain it seemed why at any moment now she would awaken and discover herself on her pallet in the deserted barren house with the depressing prospect of no position and very few options in front of her oh surely this was a dream when had anything this wonderful this fantastic ever happened to her never of course she stared out at the darkness this was like something out of a tale entirely like one of those dreams she used to have stories she used to tell herself after all how could a horse and cart be flying in the air like this when had she ever heard of a flying cart but a little voice inside her stubborn or perhaps desperate insisted that this was no stranger than things she already knew were true well how can witches fly about on broomsticks even madame fleur can do that i saw her once only once and in the company of she presumed another witch but still madame bella whats keeping us in the air she asked hesitantly the godmother gestured at the little horse who tossed his head i prevailed upon my little friend sergei she said cheerfully hes part of his own set of tales but when hes not needed there he often helps out the godmothers and wizards his mother is the mare of the east wind you know oh elena said at a bit of a loss for in fact she didnt know she hadnt even known there was such a thing as the mare of the east wind oh silly of me of course you dont know madame bella chuckled and there you see why i need an apprentice im getting so muddleheaded it is more than time that i stepped down before i try to put a magical lamp into caporushs hands sergei and his mother are from another line of the tradition another set of kingdoms and tales take it as read that sergei is a sort of magical creature rather like one of the faerie folk and with equal powers a magic horse like a she strained her memory but could not think of another such at least not one with power enough to make himself and the cart he drew fly like a wizard she hazarded no more like a dragon bella told her or a unicorn his mother is truly powerful much more so than he is but then she is more than half a spirit creature she was mated to a mortal stallion once for some reason that escapes me he has two brothers who are really remarkable to behold quite the most handsome horses i have ever seen but sad to say they have not a smidgen of magic in them he got the lot didnt you sergei the little horse tossed his head and whickered it sounded rather like a snicker yes i know you got all the brains in the family too bella laughed which is probably why you are your mothers favorite child its quite true though bella continued turning back to elena sergei is rather brilliant and terribly crafty which makes him invaluable to us for instance had your stepmother unexpectedly returned i am fairly certain that he would have found a way to get you away from her long before i did the horse whickered again and bella clapped both hands to her mouth in feigned shock sergei you would not have from the bray that came out of the little horses throat whatever it was elena was entirely certain that yes sergei would have she wished bella would tell her but the godmother just shook her head just as well that nothing happened then your town would never have gotten over it and the tradition would have been kinked for years that sort of thing can have serious consequences dear and a grave flaw in the tradition gives an evil one room to move in im not saying that would have happened this time she hurriedly added but just that you have to be very aware when you cross tradition lines or break tradition that you do it in a way that impacts the fewest people i thought that the tradition was only important for for the special people elena said hesitantly oh no the tradition rules everything in the five hundred kingdoms at least bella didnt sound at all impatient with elena for asking so many questions why for instance do you think that everyone in otraria loves king colin and queen sophia that no one would ever whisper a word of treason about them even though the only army he has never does much except march in parades and the only guards he has are old men inclined to nod off at their posts elena shook her head the tradition she hazarded exactly gooseboy colin brought a smile to the face of the princess who could not laugh and that brought joy back to otraria as well as won him her hand and kingdom now precisely because of this the tradition makes certain that everything in the kingdom runs sweetly and smoothly from the happiness of the king and queen down to the weather oh surely not elena objected surely the weather isnt affected you think not bella laughed but there was a sad sound to it then early in your training i should take you to a kingdom that is laboring under an evil ruler a despotic one youd see then that the tradition guides everything down to the least and seemingly insignificant detail otraria is happy colin is a good king who rules well and wisely and so the land is fertile the people are content the weather is perfect in every season because the tradition creates a kingdom to match the king and queen it would be very very hard for an evil witch or a dark wizard to move into otraria now in fact the only way that one could would be either by an invasion which would take a very great force of arms or by a combination of magic and treachery believe me when it comes to the latter that will not happen while i am godmother here nor as long as any apprentice i train is overseeing things there was a steely tone to bellas words that made elena sit up a little straighter and give the old woman a sideways glance not that she could see very much in the dark but she had the feeling that if she could see bellas face she would discover that the slightly dotty old woman that had offered her a position had transformed for a moment into something very like the ironspined general who commanded otrarias tiny army both of them might be old but they knew their duties and they would drive themselves and everything and anyone under their authority to see to it that those duties were performed but there thats one of the things we do you see bella continued in a more normal tone we see to it that the conditions are fulfilled to make things as pleasant as possible for everyone the main problem is that there is quite a bit of work and not very many of us there are kingdoms that dont have a godmother or resident wizard kingdoms where the assigned godmother is overworked or falls ill or dies without an apprentice in training so things can and do go wrong that is when the tradition works against us and for the evil folk of the world the tradition doesnt care you see whether the outcome of a story is a joy or a tragedy if the circumstances are there it just makes things follow down set paths and since we cant fix them directly we have to help the heroes who can but why cant you fix them directly elena asked now truly puzzled and confused if you have all this power ah the answer to that is why you will be serving as my apprentice for some time madame bella replied wisely but the quick answer is that it would take all the magic of a hundred godmothers working together to correct a single one of those problems if we had to go counter to the tradition we do not figure as heroes you see whoever heard of a dotty old lady in shining armor elena giggled at that why not she was going to wake up after all and things would not be nearly so pleasant when she did so she might as well enjoy this dream and it was such a good dream she would very much like to be a godmothers apprentice and it was somehow comforting to have an explanation for why her life had gone from bad to worse no matter what she had done to try to change things and you have to remember that the evil ones are always on the prowl looking for their opportunities to make the tradition work to their advantage and they have one thing on their side that we do not madame bella continued once one of them finds a place to work they can concentrate on that one kingdom while we are spread out over many how many elena asked sobering this might be a dream but it certainly sounded as if this godmothering business was quite hard work not that she was afraid of hard work for heavens sake but she had to wonder just how many kingdoms bella was responsible for if there were so few of the godmothers at the moment i am godmother directly to two dozen of the five hundred kingdoms and i can be called upon to help with another twelve or fourteen madame bella said and sighed and i am not getting any younger alas i have been looking for a good apprentice for some time now obscurely elena felt a surge of disappointment even though this was a dream so she had not been the only person that madame bella had considered but in the next moment bellas words made the disappointment vanish in fact i have really been looking in one way or another from the day that i became the godmother for these kingdoms i have seen too much tragedy come into the world because a godmother left looking for her apprentice until it was too late i must say though in all that time i never had a bit of hope until i found you and i was not going to even hope that you could be what i was looking for until after you passed your eighteenth birthday why then elena wanted to know because if ever you had a satisfactory end to your personal tale if for instance you had found a sweetheart who had successfully taken you out of that house it had to be by then bella sounded melancholy far too many of the young women i have watched over the years did indeed make that sort of end why it should be before the eighteenth birthday i do not know perhaps it has something to do with being willing to to settle for less to stop dreaming to give up on hope and then perhaps the magic around you arrows in on whatever you can get rather than what you hope for i dont know for certain because i have never asked those young women about what was going on in their minds elena licked her lips thoughtfully tasting the last faint hint of sweetness from an iced cake upon them yes she had recently stopped dreaming or at least daydreaming but it had not been until after that critical eighteenth birthday even then could she really say that she had given up on dreams not when she had continued to look out her window at handsome young men and make up lesser stories smaller dreams about them and in all that time had she ever really tried to do anything about those dreams oh she could argue all she wanted that her stepmother would never have given her the time to go meet a young man but in her heart of hearts she had to admit that if she had tried she probably could have stolen the time somehow to go and meet one of those young men to flirt a little as she had seen so many other girls do why had she never tried it wasnt that she was shy it wasnt that she had some withered sprig of pride left that insisted that elena klovis was above the common young men she saw in the streets perhaps if she had seen a man that her heart had really longed for perhaps she would have defied her stepmother and grasped for love with both hands she sat back in her seat and thought hard about all the men young and old she had watched and she had to admit that no it had never been the man she had longed for only the escape that marriage marriage to anyone represented well that was certainly interesting and perhaps a little disturbing why was that true was it the men or was it her was she just as cold in her way as the horrids who cared nothing for the men who courted them only the wealth or status that they represented it was a nasty thought and one that gave her pause as she considered just what all the implications of it were perhaps bella sighed perhaps for the rest of those others it was just as well every one of them discovered someone she truly loved and in the end they were happy the tradition works in small stories as well as large you know but if i had tried would i have found a true love she thought somberly it was hindsight of course i certainly had plenty of opportunity to go that route myself the old woman continued as if musing aloud it wasnt as if i had a terror of a stepmother dogging my footsteps every waking moment of the day i merely had two spoiled older sisters and it wasnt that i was their slave it was just that they were too bonelazy to take the task of housekeeper so i did i had plenty of time for myself and i was the only one who decided what i would do and when i did it my sisters had plenty of beaus haunting our house i suppose i could have had too if id been in the least interested but there wasnt one of them that i cared to exchange more than a few words with what about elena hesitated after after i became a godmother bella laughed heavens child when would i have found the time to look out for a young man i had so much work on my hands i hardly found the time to sleep ah look down there were almost home the old woman pointed down and ahead of them elena couldnt see much just a faint light that seemed to be hidden among trees but as soon as she spotted it she realized that the light was getting closer and the treetops nearer very quickly indeed she could see what was below them now instead of it being a vague darkness and all her fear came back she clutched at the side and the seat of the cart convulsively as they skimmed over the top branches tiny twigs hitting the underside and the wheels and then while her stomach lurched with fear they were above a clearing in the center of which was a cottage with lights in every window and what was surely a garden surrounding it then as her breath came short and her heart pounded they were no longer above it they were dropping down quickly too quickly she wanted to scream but nothing came out of her paralyzed throat and a moment later the little horses hooves touched the ground in front of the cottage then the wheels set down with a bump the horse halted the cart rolled to a gentle stop and there they were elena felt limp with relief madame bella patted her hand there you are my dear safe on the ground she laughed i know you dont think it now but one day you will let sergei pull you across the sky without even thinking about it oh no i wont elena thought as her heart slowly calmed madame bella climbed down off the seat and it was obvious as she moved that although she sounded as lively as a much younger woman she certainly moved like an old one whose joints pained her not excessively just enough to slow her down a bit and make life difficult for her she opened the garden gate and the little horse drew the cart inside and up the garden path without being asked but when he stopped at the front door of the cottage elena also jumped down from her perch on the seat dream or no dream she wasnt about to sit about while poor madame bella struggled with harnesses and straps where is the stable madame she asked coming to the little horses head around to the side will you lift your bundle down for me the old woman asked ill bring it myself elena said firmly and i will unharness the little horse dream or no dream she wasnt about to show so little respect for a good old woman like madame bella as to make her do work that elena was better suited to madame bella smiled bless you child i am pleased to see you wishing to take up your duties already sergei wont stay the night but the cart should be put away sergei the horse whickered and trotted off going around the side of the cottage and taking the cart skillfully with him when elena followed she discovered a neat little stable into which sergei had already backed the cart she had him unharnessed in a few moments though he insisted on keeping the hat she looked for and found a currycomb but the horse shook his head at her merrily and with a leap vanished upward yes this was surely a dream bemusedly and wondering when it would end she picked her bundle out of the back of the cart and for good measure the basket of dishes and leftovers from under the front seat and carried both of them around the corner and in at the front door and there she got yet another surprise for although the cottage looked small on the outside cozy for one but perhaps a little confining for two on the inside well although it was no palace it was certainly far larger than it appeared ah this could be nothing but a dream what she was looking at was simply not possible before her was a modest antechamber with a pair of benches flanking the door beyond that was apparently a fine sittingroom with furniture the equal of anything that the klovis household had boasted it was all of that older heavier style and had been so wellpolished that it glowed in the candlelight there were two doors beyond that within elenas vision and a bit of a staircase from all appearances this place was about the size of the klovis house on the inside on the outside it looked to be a tworoom cottage i had no idea that i had such a good imagination madame bella was talking to two peculiar little creatures they were about the height of children coming to just about elenas waist but their hair was silver and they looked like a pair of gnarled and wizened old men dressed in leather trousers immaculate linen shirts and red vests both of them wore soft pointed brown caps and both were barefoot ah elena this is hob and this is robin she said as elena paused on the threshold hob is in charge of anything to do with mending in my household and robin is in charge of anything to do with making the little old fellows turned grave dark eyes on her and bowed solemnly she curtsied in return and her mind belatedly caught up with what she was seeing these must be brownies or houseelves one of the lesser branches of the faerie folk and they were evidently serving madame bella mending and making an odd way to divide the duties still if it suited the brownies who was she to criticize is working in the garden mending or making she asked both of them what i saw of it is lovely ah thatd be tending and thatd be lily mistress said hob with a finger laid aside his nose and a nod she be gone to bed anow tis robins lily as does the tending and my lass rosie who does the cleaning and when robin lets me i have been known to do the cooking madame said with a silvery chuckle theyll be staying on to help you when you are godmother here elena noticed immediately that madame did not say serving so the brownies were not servants given what little she knew from nursery tales to call them servants or treat them as such would be a deadly insult robin evidently anticipated the question she was afraid to ask tis our honor and our duty to help the godmothers and white wizards and witches mistress he said solemnly for when the blackhearted ones move in it is our kind that are the first to suffer youll learn all about that later dear bella said as robin took her bag from her and hob the basket come along now and ill show you your room through the sitting room they went and the candles in the antechamber went out by themselves as they exited well it is a dream after all hob went through one doorway and madame bella led the way through the other to that staircase that elena had glimpsed with madame in the lead and robin following behind elena climbed up to the next floor and the candles in the sitting room also went out by themselves at the top of the stairs it was quite obvious that madame liked an oldfashioned sort of house with no hallways just one room leading into another this one was meant for display apparently but elena could not quite understand what the theme was or even if there was one shelves lined the walls floor to ceiling and there were objects carefully arranged on them but what odd objects a cap made of woven rushes a fur slipper but quite the smallest that elena had seen clearly made for an adult woman but the size of one meant for a child a knitted tunic that was made of some coarse dark plant fiber a golden ball a white feather there were hundreds of these odd objects and elena would very much like to have looked at them further but madame bella gestured to her left and robin was already carrying her bundle through the lefthand door your rooms the vacant ones are that way dear madame bella said and covered a yawn which triggered a similar yawn from elena the two suites are identical mirrorimages so i know youll be comfortable good night and with that she passed through the righthand doorway leaving elena to follow robin on her own so she did and once again as soon as she left the chamber the candles in the sconces on the wall behind her went out of their own accord ireally do have the most remarkable imagination the first room was a sittingroom and elena very nearly stopped right there for it was fitted on two sides floor to ceiling with bookshelves and they were all full she stopped dead and stared hungrily only vaguely aware that there were other furnishings here mistress came robins plaintive call from the next room im dreaming she reminded herself these books arent real and for a moment she felt her eyes burn and her throat close and the dream didnt seem quite so amusing anymore mistress robin called again and she sniffed and hastily wiped her eyes with a corner of her apron and hurried on to the next room if madame klovis could have seen this room she would have turned a rainbow of colors with envy to begin with it was carpeted with quite the most beautiful rug that elena had ever seen the sort of thing that many people would put on a wall not a floor it looked like a meadow of the deepest green dotted with flowers and was softer underfoot than kittenfur the furnishings were of that same oldfashioned style of the rest of the house but not even madame klovis would have discarded these in favor of the newer styles for they were carved so beautifully that every piece was a masterwork of art the twin wardrobes were made to look like castles covered with vines so realistic that elena half imagined that they had grown there instead of being carved the dressingtable resembled the stump of a giant tree supported by carved sinuous bare roots the chair beside it was made in the form of a little throne of vines cradling a mossgreen velvet cushion and the divan beneath the window matched it there were tapestries on the walls portraying a magical forest full of fantastic animals and birds flowers such as she had never seen the bed curtained in heavy green velvet embroidered with thousands of flowers with a counterpane to match could have slept four comfortably so perfectly was it appointed that the headboard had a candle sconce built into it at the right height for reading in bed and there was a bookshelf already full of books beneath it robin stood anxiously in the middle of the room her bundle at his feet would you like me to unpack for you mistress he asked as if he wasnt entirely certain just how one did unpack oh heavens no robin thank you she told him quickly im quite used to waiting on myself very well mistress he replied sounding relieved theres a nightdress beneath your pillow good night mistress and before she could reply he had whisked himself out so quickly he might have actually vanished a nightdress beneath my pillow this dream really was extraordinarily detailed she set her bundle aside and turned down the covers revealing three magnificent goosedown pillows encased in snowy white linen and beneath the center one there was indeed a nightdress such as she had not worn since she was a child madame klovis would have died of envy on the spot it was made of pale green silk tied at the neck and wrists with silken ribbons in a slightly deeper hue and bordered at all hems with lace three inches deep made of silk thread as fine as cobwebs when elena pulled off her coarse workaday clothing and slipped it on over her head it caressed her skin like a soft sigh and felt so light and ethereal it was as if she was wearing nothing at all she folded up her clothing and set it on the chair even if this was a dream she was not going to start being untidy then climbed into the enormous bed she sank into the feather mattress with a sigh as the candles in the rest of the room saving only the one in the sconce in the headboard went out of their own accord she reached at random for a book and got something called the natural i historie of the lives of curious beastes which sounded impossibly dull but this is my dream if i decide the book is going to be interesting it will be and so it was the first beaste in the book was the unicorn which evidently led a much more complicated life than she had ever imagined for a start it was only male unicorns who were attracted to virgin maidens females were only drawn to virgin chaste men which the author observed were more difficult to come by so it is of no usse to even attempt the capture of the femalee of the species he concluded he then went on to the courtship rituals of these shy creatures and it was at that point that elena found she was having a great deal of difficulty in keeping her eyes open she had never fallen asleep in her own dream before nevertheless although she had no real idea of what would happen she was not going to fall asleep now she was going to enjoy every moment of this until she was forced out of the experience by waking up so she fought the impulse then the need to put down the book to close her eyes fought it even though the words on the page stopped making sense though her lids drooped until she could not even see the page and until the book dropped from her numbing fingers and her last conscious thought was that the candle in the sconce above her head had just gone out of its own accord chapter good morning mistress the cheerful voice startled her awake and even if it had not the ruthless pulling aside of the curtains at the windows to let in a flood of sunshine surely would have elena sat straight up in bed a real bed the same real luxurious bed she had dreamed that she had climbed into last night and she was in the same gorgeous glorious room that she had imagined in her dream except that she was awake very much awake and she was still here those were her clothes folded up on the chair which a little brown woman who probably stood no higher than her waist whose ears she could see were rather pointed was picking up unfolding and tsking over she was dressed in a miniature muted version of madame bellas eccentric costume she must be a brownie like the two old men last night which meant that they too were real oh mistress thesell never do these garments of yours the faerie woman said firmly and with perhaps just a touch of disdain maybe for working in the garden after rain but not for every day not for an apprentice she had not been in her position a day and already she was making mistakes it seemed this wasnt a very auspicious start and last night madame bella hadnt said a word about clothing but im afraid theyre the best i have elena said weakly im terribly sorry but my stepmother ill wear whatever you like the faerie woman interrupted her with a wave of her hand she didnt seem annoyed relieved perhaps that elena had volunteered to wear what she chose oh not to worry not to worry you wont need the whole turnout for weeks and weeks yet and robin will have it all tailored up for you by then the little woman bustled about the room unpacking elenas few things and folding them away in a chest till then i expect some of madames things will do youre much of a size she opened one of the two wardrobes and began pulling clothing out remembering madames rather flamboyant style of yesterday elena wondered if she ought to say something not that madame bellas clothing wasnt good but but fortunately it seemed the little womans taste was a good bit quieter than madames out came a fine white linen shift and petticoat a white blouse liberally trimmed at the cuffs with lace a black twill skirt piped in green and a black vest embroidered in green and purple and a sash to match still far more colorful than anything elena had worn in years but by no means as eyepopping an ensemble as madames no corset so there wasnt any need for help with dressing and just as well as elena would really rather do without a corset if she could before the old woman could make a move to serve as a bodyservant elena quickly climbed out of bed and put the clothing on feeling an unaccustomed urge to giggle with nervousness it wasnt that she was shy about disrobing in front of a stranger years living among the rest of the servants had cured her of any such illusions of modesty no it was the giddy and dizzying rush of realizing that this was real it wasnt a dream it wasnt a dream she was the apprentice to a fairy godmother she was living in a house that was bigger on the inside than the outside waited on by faerie folk i am going to learn magic magic how incredible could this be here she was with faerie folk all around her and she was going to learn magic herself the old woman much less wrinkled and much more applecheeked than the old men elena noted surveyed her with hands on her hips when elena had finished dressing youll do she said brusquely those colors suit you foot excuse me elena replied now utterly bewildered your foot girl show me your foot the old woman repeated and with absolute confusion elena lifted her skirt and held up one of her feet the old woman seized it in a hand as hard as horn and looked it over muttering to herself then she let go to elenas relief and bustled over to another chest from there she took a pair of soft slippers of the sort that tightened with ribbons to fit and handed them to elena barefoot only in the garden mistress she said in a tone that warned that there would be no arguing with her shod elsewise people come here mistress you must be a credit to the godmother as her apprentice people have to respect you as they respect her meekly elena took the shoes and the stockings that the brownie woman handed to her and put them on the shoes were of a leather that was as soft as velvet and she was terribly afraid that she would have them ruined within an hour still if this was what was proper the brownies were known for strict adherence to the truth rose for surely this must be rose who did the cleaning would not tell her to do something that was not correct very well if these were the shoes that were right then she would wear them its all true right then mistress come along the little woman opened the door and stood there beckoning time to break your fast and start on your work youve a lot to learn and youre a bit late coming to it are you rose elena asked as the little woman made impatient shooing motions with both hands as if elena was a giant chicken that would be me come along then madame doesnt stand on ceremony at breakfast and luncheon unless theres guests we all eat in the kitchen and im to show you the way an odd little sniff showed elena that rose did not precisely approve of madame bellas informality with the staff poor hob she must lead him a merry dance i wonder if all brownie women are like this rose had all the hauteur of madame kloviss ohsosuperior ladys maid packed into a package half the size of the human out they went with elena glancing at all the books waiting for her in her sitting room with longing down the stairs and out towards the back of the cottage at least so far as elena could tell first they passed a little diningroom then a pantry then a milkroom with pans of milk already set out for the cream to rise and at last came to the kitchen this was a fine wellappointed room complete even to a sink with a handpump bakeovens built to either side of the fireplace and plenty of pothooks for kettles and a spit with a clockwork turner and there was a very modern stove as well which set into a much larger hearth one that could have once roasted an ox whole its presence surprised elena the cook in the klovis household had often lamented that they had no such thing and had described one in detail though elena had never actually seen one the kitchen had an immaculately scrubbed flagstone floor and whitewashed brick walls two big sunny windows with real glass in them and it smelled deliciously of baking bread there were two tables there as well a large worktable in the middle which would have been low for a human but was waisthigh to the brownie and under one of the two windows a table with benches beside it madame bella was already there dressed much as she had been yesterday except that the predominating hue in her wardrobe was red today robin was at the stove and besides baking bread elena smelled porridge eggs and frying ham he turned at her entrance nodded at rose and asked did you sleep well mistress what would you care to eat very well thank you robin she replied carefully and im not particular anything at all will suit me come sit here elena madame bella said waving at a stool beside her i trust your rooms suit you ah i see by your face that they do before elena could even get properly seated robin had bustled over with porridge for her there was already cream and sugar on the table and elena helped herself to both with a sense of giddy freedom for other than when she had eaten porridge with her neighbors all shed had for years was the scrapings from the kettle seasoned with a little salt she had not even finished pouring the cream over her breakfast when robin returned with a plate of eggs and fried ham this was a feast now today my dear i will need to prepare you for your position madame was saying as she dug into her breakfast in fact well begin now a wineglass please robin and something to take the taste away afterwards robin brought two glasses one empty the other half full of something that sparkled darkly in the sunlight ah blackberry cordial just the thing madame bella said with approval she reached for a tiny decanter that was already on the table and poured a few drops into the empty glass now you toss that right down and never mind the taste just get it all down and follow it with the cordial elena looked askance at the glass but did as she was told it wasnt as if there was anything to fear after all firstly madame bella wasa good magician and secondly why in heavens name would she bring elena here just to poison her but the liquid in it was black and oilylooking and seemed to warn that it was not going to be nice she picked up the glass took a deep breath and tossed it all back and nearly choked it was worse that she could ever have imagined horribly bitter and fiery at the same time it was so powerful and so awful that her eyes filled with tears and she had to struggle not to spit it all out she groped with one hand and madame put the other glass into it which she took and quickly downed the contents of the cordial managed to wash away the awful taste and she shook her head as she put the glass down and wiped her eyes with a napkin what was that she choked dragons blood undiluted madame said apologetically fresh or relatively so i got it yesterday before i went to fetch you now youll be able to understand the languages of the birds and beasts dragons blood real dragons blood there seemed no reason to doubt it and elena nearly choked all over again she reminded herself how often she had eaten things like blood sausage and tried not to feel too sick perhaps some porridge she took a mouthful before she asked her next question why would i want to do that she asked hoarsely feeling as if she must be missing something that should have been terribly obvious because the birds and the beasts are everywhere and often have a great deal to tell you madame replied youll see at any rate this was best taken care of first as the rest of the spells are a bit more complex but first elena do finish your breakfast its going to be a busy day and it has just begun the morning began with a tour of madame bellas cottage which was quite as large inside as elenas old home had been the difference was that very few of these rooms were devoted to show especially on the ground floor there was no formal dining room and what elena had taken for a drawing room was in fact a second library the first already being crammed so full of books that they had spilled over into this room where they were in a fair way to take over elena felt her eyes going round with astonishment at the sheer number of books the only spots on the walls that were not covered with floortoceiling bookshelves crammed with books were where the windows and doors were let into them and where the fireplace mantel and chimney were let into the wall there were hessian curtains on these windows old faded rugs on the floor and the only furniture in either room were more low bookcases surrounding a desk and a chair genealogies histories and tales also some spellbooks but most of what a godmother does is about what is appropriate to the moment is impelled and powered by the tradition and the magic that the tradition has accreted around the hero or heroine and doesnt require the same preparation as a witchs or wizards spells bella looked around the walls with what seemed to elena like weary satisfaction and elena noticed that there was a book lying open on the desk with pen and ink beside it what you do need to know is who is related to whom absolutely necessary to trace missing heirs and potential usurpers you need to know your enemies youll find them in those books like as not and potential enemies for the future as well and you should be familiar with every tale that any godmother has ever been involved with in your turn you are expected to write up every tradition line that you steer you can read and write i hope suddenly bella looked very anxious and elena was pleased to be able to reassure her ah good well that will be one of the spells that you will have to perform once you finish writing a tale there will be an identical book in the library of every other godmother and warding wizard and those white witches and wizards who are powerful enough to have libraries like ours will also have a copy she shook her head and this of course is why i no longer have a drawing room i thought about performing the spell to add a room but i never got around to it that will be your duty i expect i cant see how many more books can be added without spilling into some other room and lily would be most vexed if that happened how is it that this is nothing more than a cottage from outside and all this on the inside elena asked pleased for the opening at last to ask what she had been dying to know ah that is rather difficult to explain in fact im not entirely certain that i can except to say that it is magic and it is necessary madame bella shrugged there is nothing to show on the outside that this is not the abode of an ordinary white witch or even some peasant who has chosen to live apart in the forest i told you that we have enemies and it has happened in the past that in order to facilitate their schemes they began by eliminating the regions godmother not often but it has happened oh elena said sobered so this godmothering business was dangerous she felt a little touch of fear at that moment she wasnt used to danger life with her stepmother had been hard lonely unhappy and unpleasant but not precisely dangerous danger was something that happened to other people why hadnt she considered and discarded the idea of simply running away and taking her chances because of the danger difficult complicated and now dangerous but on the other hand i will never be bored and no one will be making a slave out of me there was a great deal to be said for that and as for the danger i will be helping to make other peoples dreams come true you will make dreams come true elena madame bella said softly in an uncanny echo of elenas own thoughts and dreams are dangerous things in and of themselves she cast another look around the library look at them dreams and nightmares hopes and fears compared to some of the trials that our heroes and heroines must face in order to earn their happy endings what we godmothers encounter is really trivial so long as we are careful to keep our true nature hidden youll see when you come to read them for not every tale has that happy ending not every hero is brave enough resourceful enough or lucky enough even with our help to triumph in the end there was a shadow on madame bellas face and she seemed to be recalling something that was very sad indeed then she shook her head read the books elena and you will see the rest of the ground floor was given over to working rooms there was a dairyroom a stillroom the kitchen of course a little office a sewingroom in short everything this establishment needed to be selfsufficient we take care of a great deal of our own needs here madame said with pride there are two villages within walking distance and we have arrangements with people in both of them for things like flour and so forth the villagers all believe that i am a white witch and often come to me for spells and cures and pay me in things that we need she smiled which of course is another reason why my home appears to be a simple cottage on the outside you will soon see that we do not squander magic on the things we can supply by the same means as anyone else we help our local people earning our way the same as any other craftsman and our local people since they do not know that i am a godmother assist in creating the illusion that i am just the local white witch they will see nothing amiss in my having taken an apprentice in fact i suspect that they will be somewhat relieved that sounds like an excellent arrangement to me elena replied feeling relieved for she could not envisage herself as a farmer and the house elves did not seem young nor strong enough to be farmworkers of course according to the tales she had heard there was no telling with elves they might look frail yet be strong as an ox in the same way we aid the local faerie folk in return for their help both in terms of the service that hob and robin and their wives give us and in magic they however know that i am a godmother and by now they have heard about you madame bella smiled broadly the faerie folk always seem to know about something within the hour of it happening outside the house which still looked and from all angles like a simple two or threeroom cottage were the gardens in the front were the flowers and ornamental plants two on either side were herbbeds the culinary herbs were to the right of the cottage the healing herbs to the left of course there were some herbs that served both purposes but as madame pointed out having them in both gardens meant only that she could be sure that there would always be enough in the rear was the kitchengarden with handsome red hens industriously scratching among the planted rows looking for insects or weedsprouts this was where they found the brownie lily working diligently among the young cabbages and as she listened to their quiet clucking she got a shock she certainly heard clucking but she also heard something else greedy greedy greedy muttered one hen jealously eyeing a choice patch of ground that a bigger hen was scratching not enough bugs grumbled another and the rest simply evidenced contentment she could indeed understand the speech of animals it took her a moment to catch her breath when she realized the truth it seemed as if for now her life was going to be one disconcerting moment after another finally she caught her breath so to speak and turned her attention back to what madame was saying about her garden if ever there was a model vegetable garden this was surely it the rows were as straight as could be the young plants healthy and flourishing and if elena was any judge the gardener had started her plants in stages so that there would be vegetables at the perfect state to harvest all summer long it was difficult to manage and took a great deal of skill as well as careful management of coldframes elena had never managed it properly and only knew two farmers at home who had done it and their produce almost always went straight to the palace ah madame bella said the brownie rising to her feet and brushing soil from her canvas apron ive some lovely sparrowgrass coming not for dinner today but definitely for tomorrow this would be mistress elena then yes elena answered for herself and you are lily these are wonderful gardens oh i do my best lily replied with a shrug its good to be where people appreciate that the last of the tour took them to the byre at the bottom of the garden with the stable beside it there was a donkey in the stable presumably unmagical since it gazed on both of them with supreme disinterest and went back to the hay in its manger it was an old beast by the grey of its muzzle in the byre were two redbrown milchcows with mild eyes who were equally disinterested in the two humans well that explained where the fresh milk and cream were coming from fortunately they didnt say anything elena wasnt at all sure she could cope with talking cows as well as talking chickens at the moment altogether this would have been exactly the sort of situation where elena would have been happy as a servant she certainly had never envisioned herself as the mistress of such a place it was a little daunting and when you added in the talking animals how am i ever going to be able to eat meat again she wondered with sudden dismay but then she remembered just how incredibly stupid the chickens had sounded she had always known that chickens werent bright and the fact that she could understand what they were saying to each other hadnt changed that all that was different really was that instead of merely intuiting the meaning of their calls she actually knew it it occurred to her as madame bella opened the garden gate and beckoned her to follow out into the woods surrounding the cottage that there was another aspect to all of this in the tales that she knew there were often animals that were well more than mere animals whether they were magic beasts or from the faerie realms they were always the equal and sometimes superior in intelligence to humans like that little humpbacked horse that had drawn madames cart last night for instance and now she would be able to speak to them as madame could which was probably madames entire reason for giving her the dragons blood to drink madame followed a path winding among the enormous trees of this forest and elena followed her though once they got under the deep shadows cast by the heavy growth she looked back at the sunlit gardens longingly elena was townbred and in fact since madame klovis had taken over the household she had never been any farther from her house than the marketgarden the trees she knew were all tame things neatly trimmed and confined to gardens surrounded by seats or planted in jardinieres these were wild trees huge taller than the clock tower so big that three girls could have stood around them stretched out their arms and barely have been able to touch their fingertips together the thick bark was green with moss and beneath their branches the woods lay in a murmurous twilight anywhere that there was a gap in the canopy the undergrowth ran wild where there was no place for the sun to penetrate mushrooms made little colonies moss carpeted the ground and the fallen tree limbs and the occasional odd pale flower bloomed every time a twig snapped or a bird called elena jumped and it didnt help that she could understand what those birds were saying either because it was mostly hey hey hey hey so what were they shouting about what was lurking out there hidden in the tangles of vines behind the fallen trees in the shadows bears wolves worse madame bella she whispered not wanting to make any noise louder than that where are we going the godmother glanced back at her i need to show you to the faerie folk their official representatives that is my brownies dont count most of them cant abide salt and cold iron so they cannot come to us we must come to them elena shivered the brownies were one thing they were small and earthy and impossible to be afraid of but there were all manner of faerie folk that she wasnt at all sure she wanted to be shown to dangerous creatures dwelled in the faerie realms and even when they were marginally friendly to mortals they were chancy to deal with unpredictable and easily offended what if she offended one of them perhaps worse what of one of them took a fancy to her no mortal could resist faerie glamour she could be lured away only to discover when her faerie lover tired of her that when she tried to return home she would turn into a withered old crone or even die once she set foot outside those charmed precincts for while weeks or months had passed for her hundreds of years would have passed in the mortal world but it was too late for misgivings now for there was a glow ahead of them that was not sunlight breaking through the heavy canopy and there were bright and dark figures moving in that glow as they neared the spot elena saw that it was a clearing in the woods ringed with palid mushrooms carpeted with deep green moss studded with tiny golden flowers in the center two stumps and a tightly entwined series of ancient vines formed a pair of thrones cushioned with leaves so dark a green they looked at first glance to be black and ornamented with huge trumpetbell flowers in of pale pink pale blue and cream two tall thin impossibly beautiful creatures sat in those thrones creatures with leafpointed ears cascades of silvergilt hair and garments of that damasked silk that only the elves could weave their skin was so pale and translucent they could have been carved from moonstone but their enormous curiously slanted blue eyes were alive enough as they watched madame and elena approach surrounding the thrones was a crowd of other creatures most of which elena could not put names upon there were unicorns silkensoft and clovenhoofed and tiny perfectly formed perfectly naked winged women no more than a foot tall there were tall shrouded creatures that seemed to bring a deeper shadow with them and elena instinctively knew that she did not want to look under their cowls there were greenskinned women clothed in leaves and flowers and men with goatlegs tiny horns halfhidden in their curly brown hair and sly knowing eyes and those were just the ones that elena could see madame led her to within twenty paces of the sylvan thrones and stopped making a deep but not servile bow majesties this is my apprentice elena the two on the thrones who evidently must have been the king and queen of the elves in this kingdom if not all of the faerie folk turned their impassive gaze on her and after a long moment of scrutiny nodded a good choice madame bella said the woman whose musical voice was as lovely and indescribable as her face she stood up and beckoned to elena who reluctantly came nearer so apprentice have you been warned do you know the dangers as well as the duties i left that to you majesty madame bella said serenely as is the custom the elven queen smiled coolly so you do remember it is well mortal woman stand before me and see these are the foes you will contend with mortal and immortal the queen extended the slender willowwand in her hand until it touched elenas forehead and in a single moment it seemed a torrent of images poured into her mind none were pleasant and many were terrifying it was one thing to be warned about the evil magicians and to remember all of the things she had read and heard it was quite another to see them at work in rapid succession and some were horrors some of the horrors were blatant entire countries laid waste the inhabitants made into hopeless slaves afraid to do anything but obey because of the cost of disobedience some of the evil ones were precisely as she might have expected gloating despots squatting on thrones they had no right to torture and exploitation the hallmarks of their reigns but some were subtle and once elena realized what she was seeing the implications were chilling often the evil one was not on the throne itself but was the power behind it whispering into the monarchs ear the effect was insidious rather than creating despair for all the dark one created factions pitting the privileged wealthy and titled against those beneath them placing the effort of exploitation one layer below the monarch this kept despair from being total for there was always the hope but when the king learns of this even though the hope was destined never to be fulfilled these spiders spun a cunning web beginning as they always did by eroding conditions gradually with rights converted to privilege then the privilege revoked on one pretense or another always for an excellent reason always on a temporary basis until the next privilege was taken and the previous grievance forgotten then as one hand took away the other the kings would give something trivial but pleasurable games perhaps or entertainments nothing controversial of course a competition that would elevate the winner into the ranks of the wealthy and prominent so that the illusion was maintained that this was possible for everyone it was as if wholesome bread was being taken and a tastier bread made with sawdust used to replace it or perhaps the one behind the throne would start a war on some trumpedup cause a little war of course against a weak but convenient enemy one that would be difficult to lose that would stir up patriotic fervor one that would of course entail sacrifices for the good of all and the security of the realm under cover of which more privileges could be temporarily taken clever and insidious and damnably difficult to counter and all the while the spider spun his web battening on the misery and depression growing fat and ever more powerful and in the darkness behind the throne indulging himself in secret cruelties against the enemies of the state these more than the others were the ones that were the most dangerous to the godmothers the white wizards the good wizards the first class were brutal but seldom thought past the moment the second planned ahead months years decades anticipated opposition and moved to counter it well in advance these were the ones who swiftly cleansed their countries of resident magicians either directly murdering them or instigating the local peasantry against them and then ensured that no one else would move in by creating intense hostility against foreigners and outsiders cleverly engineering their rhetoric so that the blame for anything that was bad would be laid to the door of outsiders since that effectively made isolationism a certainty it protected the evil ones further for anything outside the borders became suspect even hated and there would be no chance for anyone to learn that things might be better elsewhere elena saw in detail what was happening to the outsiders in several of the infected kingdomsimprisonment was the least of it in rapid succession she saw faerie folk being driven into grim encampments hedged around with cold iron and salt and spells there to wither and die or suffer torture at the hands of sadistic guards she saw a godmother dragged to the center of a town and burned alive a white wizard buried in the rubble of his own tower a coven of good witches torn to pieces by a pack of savage hounds it all played out with dreadful immediacy in front of her eyes and sent her heart into her throat but more than that it made her angry this was what her stepmother had done to her writ large on the face of the world she had been powerless to stop it then but she would not be powerless now and she would not stand idly by when there was something she could do so that when after it all was shown to her and the faerie queen took the wand from her forehead she emerged from the nightmare fueled with rage and determination it must have shown on her face for the faerie queen gave her a penetrating look then a nod of satisfaction good she said you are made of stern materials you are an iron bar lady we will give you the tools to be transformed to a sword she beckoned and an ethereal creature outwardly sexless winged like a dragonfly and garbed mostly in its own flowing hair drifted forward handing her what appeared to be a rose petal eat it the faerie queen commanded and wary of what had happened the last time she had followed a similar command but obedient to bellas nod she did so it tasted like nothing but a moment later she was seeing things ribbons and auras of intense blue surrounding and drifting between the faerie folk for the most part but also around bella more faintly running everywhere she looked and also very strongly around herself a second creature another brownie came forward with what appeared to be a small stone again she ate it and now added to the ribbons of blue were ribbons of gold a shining bird dropped what appeared to be a hot coal in her hand which gave her ribbons of fiery red and last of all a girl clothed in waterweeds with a waterlily in her hair dripped a single drop of clear water into her hand which granted her emeraldgreen ribbons and auras now you see the magic around you of air and earth fire and water the faerie queen told her what you see you can use use this gift wisely that seemed to be a dismissal for the assemblage of faerie creatures formed up around their monarchs and the king and queen descended from their thrones an arch of vines at the far side of the clearing that elena had taken for an accidental arrangement of wild plants over a natural pathway began to glow faintly with soft moonlike light and fill with mist the mist glowed too and there were hints of figures moving in it the unearthly court formed up in a rough line and began to file through it the king and queen were the last to depart the queen passed through the arch without a moment of hesitation but the king stopped for a moment and looked deeply into elenas eyes she could not have looked away if she had wanted to but she did not really want to although his narrow highcheekboned face with its winglike eyebrows strange slightly slanted enormous eyes beardless as a boys with long midnightblack hair any woman would be proud to boast of was not what she would have named as attractive before this moment she understood exactly what was meant by elven glamorie she felt powerfully drawn to him and knew that if he had cared to he could have had her by snapping his fingers but he did nothing of the sort he merely looked deeply into her eyes as if weighing and measuring her as his consort had done and then without a word he touched her brow with a delicate forefinger something passed between them though she could not have said just what it was a great shudder shook her a moment of dizziness and for a moment she heard a sound as of the rushing of great wings all about her the hair stood up on the back of her neck yet at the same time she was filled with such intoxication she might have been drunk then the moment passed the elven king smiled faintly turned and passed through the gate behind his consort the light within the gate faded the glow of the framing vines faded and elena and her mentor were standing in a perfectly ordinary clearing in the dim light filtering down through the myriad branches of the trees above them as a bird called somewhere in the middle distance bella was regarding her apprentice with a look of great thoughtfulness well she said at last he certainly never did that with me what happened between you i dont know elena said honestly i havent the faintest idea she blinked as she said that the pale glows and colors were everywhere now and she was having to get used to the sight of magic all about her interesting bella tapped her cheek with one finger thoughtfully well whatever it was its something that king huon thinks youll need and well have to let it go at that hes too subtle for the likes of mere mortals she beckoned and smiled come along apprentice we have to choose your wand but as they left the clearing elena could not resist looking back for a moment wondering curious apprentice madame called over her shoulder elena hurried to catch up she wanted to ask why the elven king had been interested in her but she heard herself asking a different question entirely why are the fair folk she groped for a word involved ah well very long ago all of the godmothers were fair folk that is the reason some folk call us fairy godmothers still some still are and there is an equivalent to wizard that you hear of very very seldom and that is the elven knight but most godmothers are human now bella told her as they walked back towards the cottage why elena asked i suspect because there are so few of the fair folk and so many mortals bella said wryly they soon discovered that if the tradition is to be served and directed properly they needed help since their very existence depends upon the tradition they did not have a great deal of choice it would seem she could not imagine at the moment why the existence of the elves would depend on the tradition but she supposed that her reading or lessons would eventually tell her so that is why the queen has to accept an apprentice she hazarded exactly bella seemed pleased that she had made the connection having been the originals they are best at judging who will be appropriate and of course their understanding is much deeper than ours they can do with a touch things that require great effort from a human that last only made her wonder the more as they continued down the path they can do with a touch so what had the elven king done to her chapter choosing a wand turned out to be nowhere near as complicated as elena had thought it would be given the complexity of nearly everything else that had happened to her from the moment madame bella entered her life it was oddly enough the houseelf lily who helped her with the task robin she had expected but not lily after all lily did the tending didnt she so what would she have to do with the business of finding a wand lily was waiting for them on the path and smiled with satisfaction when she saw them ah good you have the kings favor as well as the queens she said and looked to madame bella as elena wondered how she had known of the elven kings odd behavior then just as she wondered that she saw it more of the swirling color she now knew was magic a haze a dusting of pale silver which must have been the queens mark and pale gold surely the kings that drifted around her exactly like dust motes drifted in warm air bella didnt have that cloud about her nor did lily how peculiar i wonder if it will wear off this business of seeing magic was going to take some getting used to is she ready for her wand no reason to put it off bella replied i have some things to attend to this will take until luncheon oh at least after robin makes the wand he wants to take her measurements for her costumes and after this youre going to keep her too busy to take the time for proper measuring lily replied and turned to elena come along apprentice and dont look so wary this wont be anything like that nasty business over breakfast i certainly hope not she thought following lily with an apprehension that she hoped she veiled adequately they ended up in a little workshop where robin already was at work laying out lengths of perfectly straight wood on a workbench placing longer similar pieces of wood leaning against a wall the wand robin said with immense dignity as if he was lecturing is not a thing of magic in and of itself as most outsiders believe it is merely the extension of the magician a tool to help focus magic actually practically any old stick will do in a pinch so long as it is made from a wood that the magician feels comfortable with ah but now thats the trick lily said taking up the lecture as smoothly as if she and robin had rehearsed it and that is where i come in all of these bits of wood have been harvested over the years from trees i grew from cuttings or seeds trees i nurtured and tended and they gave me these lengths freely as a gift not one piece was cut there was no pain in the culling of these branches and as a consequence there is nothing here for the darker magics to work on no black witch or sorcerer can make a wand made from this wood turn against its godmother there it was again that warning of danger but she had accepted the risk and though she shivered she set her chin she would no go back on her given word so would i need a little wand like that one with the colors and currents of magic drifting all around her elena found that easier to accept than she might have before the elven queen bestowed the gift of magic sight to her in fact as she pointed at one of the wands she saw and felt the potential of magic building up as if the were act of pointing at something energized the magic to flow in a particular direction that will depend on your costume you will have your everyday clothing of course and probably a small wand like this robin held up a slender polished stick no bigger around than her little finger and no longer than a foot when you are in your most impressive garb the sort of thing you will wear to attend royal christenings for instance you will bear a fullsized staff like this he hefted a length of wood about a foot shorter than she was have you ever seen a man concentrate the sun with a lens to make something catch fire lily asked elena nodded when she was younger one of her playfellows used to purloin his grannys glasses to amuse his friends with just that trick well there you are the wand acts for magic as a lens does for the sun it concentrates and focuses it it wont matter a pin if one of your wands is broken well keep several made up for you in each size and you can certainly cast your spells without one but it will be easier for you to use magic if you have one now please mistress go along the ranks of these small lengths and tell me when you have found a wand that feels right in your hand robin said stepping aside so that elena could approach the bench she did so and picked up the first of the roughfinished wands and it felt like nothing a stick of wood she tried the next and the next with similar results finally about halfway through the ranks of samples she found it and that mere act surprised her because she had begun to think that she wasnt feeling whatever it was she was supposed to sense and would have to just make an arbitrary selection then the next wand she picked up came alive in her hand there was no other way to describe it the rest had been as inert as an old broomstick suddenly this one felt like a living thing in her hand ah lily said taking it from her and she found that she was incredibly inexplicably reluctant to let go of it that would be the birch in the watermeadow a good choice and as she set the wand in a vice robin cleared away all the other lengths of wood but seven ill have this finished for you in a trice robin said matteroffactly the others will take longer but this will give you something to work with in less than an hour robin fashioned a wand for her of the polished and waxed birch tapered with a simple spiral carving to it so that it looked like the horn of a unicorn it was lovely and although she had watched him make it she could not imagine how he had finished it in so short a period of time youll find a long narrow pocket in your skirt said lily and when she hunted for it she found that indeed she did the wand fit in there as perfectly as it had in her hand the other wands can wait robin said and gave her an unreadable look next we need to fit you for proper clothing so she spent an uncomfortable two hours with every inch of her being measured by the little brownie this would be for her fairy godmother costumes which bella assured her when the godmother looked in on the fittings were as vital a tool as her wand if not more so what people think of you is important bella insisted if you dont look the part they wont believe in you and if they dont believe in you you might not be able to get your job done right quite frankly elena was feeling very intimidated and it got worse as robin held up one length of fabric after another against her face she was afraid to touch the delicate fabrics with her workroughened hands and thought that she would probably look a fool in the kinds of dressmakers confections that her stepsisters had worn she was even more intimidated when hob brought in the trays of jewels the bolts of trimmings that were to adorn these putative costumes it was bad enough when they held up lace as fine as cobwebs or gorgeous heavy stuff shining as only bobbin lace made with silk thread could shine it was far worse when they brought in the trimmings made with real gold and silver threads and began selecting pearls and other gems to be added to the ornamentation i cant wear these things she finally burst out im not you are mistress hob said sternly you are every bit as important in rank as an empress and when the time comes you must wear these gowns and wear them without a second thought appearances are important mistress and the time will come when you will speak with royalty and they will know you for their superior the gracious bestower of gifts that they have humbly asked of you she shook her head unable to even picture that in her own mind but dont worry so much lily told her with a wave of her hand most of the time youll be dressed like madame does around here because most of the time you need to look like one of the common folk oh not exactly like madame robin demurred madames choice of colors is well in a fine lady of her age it is delightfully eccentric in a young woman he visibly groped for words lily did not youll look like a motely fool or a colorblind gypsy she said bluntly dont worry youll not be mistaken for a mountebank in what we give you finally the measuring and selection none of which she got any chance to make for herself was over and the brownies let her go she sought refuge in the kitchen where madame was making a cold ploughmans luncheon with her own hands slicing meat onions bread and cheese of course this was a better luncheon than elena had seen in months perhaps even years ah theyve released the prisoner come have something to eat bella said cheerfully and elena hurried to help her with the platters which they placed on the table eat well youll be working very hard this afternoon when luncheon was over with her wand in her pocket elena followed her mentor to a secluded room at the back of the house her heart was literally in her mouth but she kept her chin high and told herself that if she was not fearless she could at least look fearless bella closed the door the room was utterly empty except for a few shelves that held a book or two and some oddments but elena did notice something odd the swirls of magic around her did not drift through the walls as they did elsewhere in the house in fact they never got closer to the wails than a foot and the same held true of the floor and the ceiling elena do you see magic now that the queen has given you her power madame asked and the way she emphasized the word see made elena very careful with her answer i think its magic she said carefully its like swarms of dust motes that glow the way dust motes glow in the sunlight only in different colors its rather thick around me she added hoping that was helpful ah good bellas expression cleared that makes things easier some people dont elena hazarded it does vary most people see it but i know of godmothers and wizards who hear magic as music some who taste or smell it now bella pulled her own slender wand a bit of walnut carved with a delicate hint of vines and leaves out of the pocket of her skirt right well since you can see it now youll learn how to move it about elena spent what was possibly the most curious afternoon of her life the flying cart notwithstanding as she herded flocks of colored dust motes about first with then without her wand it was easier with the wand as she did the herding she began to notice that some of the motes would always escape drift towards her then vanish why am i losing magic she finally asked because youre using it the only power in this room is yours and mine and ive pent mine away from you bella half smiled and raised an eyebrow you are moving your own power about the power that has built up around you trying to bring your life into the traditional path you will probably use most of it up learning how to use it oh then what am i supposed to and part of that learning will be how to acquire more power bella went on before she could voice the question though if you absolutely must there is no other choice and you can convince them that it is in their best interest the elves will probably share power but you do recall how i told you that others like you often wish to lead ordinary lives that is one source of power that we often avail ourselves of and there are others that i will teach you ah and now my dear we must get back to work on the face of things these lessons would have sounded to an outsider as if they were easy and so in a way they were just as walking is easy but suppose that someone was possessed of two good healthy strong legs yet had never used them and had not in fact ever known that they could be used this was the position that elena found herself in now it was to put it fine hard work it took real physical effort and more concentration than she had ever put into anything in her life finally madame called a halt to the lessons which by that point had graduated up to containing the power she might not have been sweating but she certainly felt limp with exhaustion when madame sniffed the air declared that she could smell supper and allowed her to stop her current exercise go tidy yourself up child madame told her with no sign whatsoever that she was exhausted well hold the meal until you join us the sun was just starting to set and deep golden light poured in through the western windows a light as thick and rich as honey the walk up the stairs was as hard as it would have been after an entire day of running about tending to the household chores and multiple errands for her stepmother and stepsisters but there was water in the ewer beside the basin in her room waiting for her a luxury she hadnt enjoyed for so long with her face and hands washed she felt much more like herself and trundled back downstairs it couldnt be said that she did so in a more cheerful frame of mind because despite the hard work she was enjoying herself this was challenging she was doing things she had never even dreamed of and it was all real but now she was able to feel something besides exhausted and ready to do full justice to whatever was on the stove for dinner for some reason rose seemed a trifle more friendly over supper lily chatted away sounding very much like madame fleur and robin and hob though mostly silent made it clear even in their silence that they approved of elena so evidently the entire household was happy with her now she didnt know why but she could guess the elven kings approval had impressed lily and probably that was why the atmosphere had warmed all the way around the fair folk all bowed to the elven king and queen no matter what race they were the royal pair were the supreme authorities in their sphere apparently having the queens blessing was one thing but earning the kings was quite another level of achievement id say shes made good progress today madame bella was saying as elena brought her wandering attention back to the conversation and the meal i must say there is a great deal to be said for bringing in an older apprentice theres nothing flighty about you my dear elena was saved from having to say anything by having a mouth full of excellent rabbit pie some of the stories ive heard said rose with a disapproving tsk girls whining and complaining about being buried in the country as if they were going to have time for anything but learning the job of godmothering girls half afraid of everything around them girls carrying on with young men it suddenly struck elena bella had intimated that she had been a maiden lady all her life did this mean that godmothers were not supposed to have anything to do with men she felt a moment of mingled shock and dismay not that any man ever showed any interest in me but is it worth giving up the possibility there is nothing wrong with a young woman being interested in young men bella retorted a young woman certainly but a young godmother rose snorted madame think of the risk the tradition has no room in it for wedded godmothers and any young man falling in with a godmother is going to be forced by the tradition into some familiar path so what does that leave rose gave none of the others a chance to answer that question she counted off the options on her fingers the rogue who will leave her brokenhearted and perhaps in difficulties the betrayer who will lead her enemies to her or the enemy himself whether he is the enemy or later becomes the enemy or something new madame said firmly the tradition can be redirected witches have married wizards and made good matches of it and sorceresses joined to sorcerers and there used to be no place in the tradition for that rose snorted again only if the godmother is strong of will and if it isnt only the godmother who has the will to steer it into a new path and from what ive heard there wasnt a one of those girls that had the will to turn a goose from grass much less the tradition from its chosen path madame laughed and shook her head only rumors dear rose and really if a girl is that unsuitable shes generally run away from all the hard work before the queen gives her blessing i would not have taken elena to the queen if i had not thought that she was suitable and the queen has her own means of weighing candidates rose nodded grudgingly well you were careful madame and there have been those that just took the first girl to cross their path with a wreathing of magic about them finally she turned to elena i have to say even though i thought madame was rushing you i must admit that madame was right about you ive never heard of the queen giving a blessing to anyone on their first day of being an apprentice the talk turned then away from elena and to of all things the small doings in the nearby village elena did what she had learned to do among madame kloviss servants when she wanted to learn things she stayed quiet and listened this was how she learned that madame bella not only was thought of as one of the local white witches but that people made the long trek out through the forest to the cottage on a regular basis furthermore there was a lesspowerful witch who served as bellas agent in the sale of potions healing draughts and herbal remedies with a stall on market day in the square of the largest village finally rose seemed to realize that elena was there i dont suppose you know much of concocting she said dubiously common things yes elena replied and pulled a face my stepmother never spent a penny on anything other than herself and her daughters so i had charge of the stillroom ah good bella exclaimed then tomorrow well work there and ill see how well you follow a recipe if i am content i will leave you to work alone and once you have produced the actual potions i will show you how to infuse a little magic into them not a great deal but enough to make them work efficiently and effectively elenas look of surprise must have been very obvious for bella laughed and so did rose godmothers arent always going about lobbing magic swords in the paths of rightful heirs or giving younger sons the right answers to riddles rose exclaimed they do as much good with the little magics as they do with the great ones ill be bound its more working with the tradition the happier and healthier a kingdom is the harder it is for the evil ones to insinuate themselves into it meanwhile your day isnt done yet my dear bella said as hob cleared away the dishes and elena moved to stand up i want you to come along with me now what she thought with dismay it had been a very very long day but madame led her straight to the library and after studying the shelves for a moment selected three books and handed them to her here you are your work for tonight she said read them and ask me for more when youve finished what are they she asked turning the books over and seeing no title worked into the leather covers the earliest histories of the five hundred kingdoms bella replied priceless books in their way i dont think there is more than a handful of copies in existence that are not in a godmothers library i want you to read them see how the tradition has grown and changed over the years elena nodded but felt a thrill of greedy glee as if being told to read was some sort of work she took the books and went upstairs where the lamps were already lit she settled in with the books and paused to look about herself and marvel at how her life had changed it was literally unbelievable i had better get used to believing in the unbelievable then she told herself and turned her attention to the first of the books after the first few pages she realized that above all else madame was right she had a lot to learn but it would not be the first time and she had everything to lose and everything to win every waking moment of every day from that moment on was filled and overfilled with something having to do with being a godmothers apprentice from the lessons about magic to the work in the stillroom from the forays into the forest to collect the wild herbs that would not grow in a garden though those were few with a brownie being the one doing the tending to her long nights studying the history of the godmothers and their work in the five hundred kingdoms she had no time to spare and little opportunity to think of herself not that madame was unkind but she was an implacable taskmistress expecting no less than total dedication for that was what she herself gave to the job for virtually every waking moment of madame bellas day was given over to godmothering and elena could easily see why madame wanted to pass her position on to someone younger within the first three days madame was gone for nearly an entire afternoon and evening and only returned well after moonrise elena heard her weary footsteps on the path to the door and flew to open it for her elena had been in the stillroom this afternoon and had not seen madame leave she loved being and working in the stillroom for it was the one place where she was on firm ground she had made up dozens of items in the klovis household when the housekeeper had quit madame klovis was above dirtying her hands in the stillroom there was no one else who cared to take on the task in addition to their own and madame would not spare the money to purchase needed infusions tinctures and ointments in the market perfumes face and land lotions goodness yes but common burn ointment was a frippery so as usual it had been elena who had found herself with the task on her hands she had enjoyed it though stillroom work was anything but boring and it wasnt hard labor here in the godmothers stillroom it was even more enjoyable for she had the finest of ingredients to work with in generous measure and a recipe book that featured such delights as rosewater jessamine lotion and tincture of lavender bella had spent no more than a quarter of an hour supervising her initial labors after that time she had laughed stated that there was nothing she could teach her apprentice here but the final infusion of magic and left elena with a list of what needed to be made up it made elena very happy to know that here at least she was actually contributing to the household when she had a bit of free time she was making up scented candles and as a special surprise a pair of scented gloves for madame she busied herself until darkness fell then after a dinner with the house elves went to her books madame did not return until an hour after that elena heard her at the door and ran down the stairs to open it for her when she opened the door she saw to her astonishment that madame was garbed in what rose called the full rigout from the top of her powdered wig to the silver buckles on her satincovered highheeled shoes no ballgown could have been more resplendent the rosepink lacefestooned confection fitted her like the proverbial glove the lace alone probably cost enough to buy the nearest village the satin overskirt had been embroidered with an allover pattern of rosebuds and the underskirt was festooned with cascading tiers of more lace sparkling with tiny faceted beads of rose crystal she carried a staff rather than a wand made in the manner of one of the highly fashionable tall walkingcanes it was surmounted with a globe of rosequartz caught in a winding of silver vines madame leaned on it heavily she looked exhausted rose took charge of her the second that elena opened the door she somehow whisked madame away before elena had time to realize that bella needed help and roughly half an hour later rose summoned elena from her own rooms to cross into madame bellas it was the first time that elena had been there and she was not at all surprised to discover that the rooms were furnished in an older style than her own madame favored the medieval the walls were hung with tapestries the furniture looked too heavy to move and the overall effect was frankly sumptuous madame herself had been stripped of her festive gown and elaborate wig and was sitting before the fire wrapped in a dressinggown sipping a cup of tea ah elena she said and elena was glad to see that some of the weariness was gone from her face im sorry i did not tell you that i was leaving but you were busy and you will discover for yourself that although we may know for some time in advance that we will find ourselves with a particular task to perform we dont know exactly when that task will take place today i was needed along with six of the fair folk to guide a prince to where his captive maiden was waiting for him and to make sure he knew the secret that would defeat the one who held her captive she smiled ruefully then of course i had to remain long enough to see whether or not he was victorious but she protested why wouldnt he be because my dear no outcome is certain not even with the tradition pushing it along i brought you here however to show you how i know when i am going to be needed and where it is time for you to meet randolf she gestured at something on the wall opposite her fireplace something like a painting or perhaps a mirror but one with heavy velvet curtains hung in front of it go over there and draw the curtains with curiosity eating her alive she did so it was a mirror and there was a face staring at her from out of its inky depths it wasnt her face she gave a startled little squeak and jumped back the face in the mirror looked surprised to see her then stuck thumbs in each ear and waggled its hands at her while making a face this of course with nothing except the face and hands being visible randolf bella snapped stop that this instant the face flushed and the hands vanished i apologize madame apprentice the temptation was overwhelming randolf this is my new apprentice elena madame said next without moving from her chair elena this is randolf the slave of the mirror i got him from a dark sorceress after she was destroyed and what shed been using me for the face said rolling its eyes what a bore never allowed to look at things for myself every day it was always the same thing mirror mirror on the wall whos well you get to exercise your powers to the fullest now that you live with me randolf madame chuckled show her my afternoon a precis if you please charmed said the face and vanished it was replaced by a series of scenes that played out in the depths of the mirror as if it was no mirror at all but a window on a place far from here for not even in rumor had elena heard that there was a sleeping princess nearby immured in a castle surrounded by a thorn hedge a good twenty feet high twice that in thickness she recognized the tale of course the tradition seemed to favor the tale of the sleeping princess bella appeared to the prince as he was despairing of ever getting past the wilderness and into the castle he looked pathetically glad to see her and the six ladies of the fair folk that accompanied her he was even happier to see the magical boat drawn by swans that brought them through the marsh his face fell when he saw the thornhedge however at that point his sword and buckler probably seemed woefully inadequate but it rose again when the fairies gave him a sword and shield of glass it didnt take a lecture to tell him that these items were magical and could help him cut his way into the castle and once inside not even the sorceress in the shape of a wyrm could stop him this was the first sleeper ever in that kingdom so it was important that someone with experience be in charge no one wanted this one to go wrong and i had a certain personal interest in the outcome as well now now madame randolf chided from the mirror the whole truth now bella grimaced the sorceress and i have history together she has tried to kill me on several occasions i wanted to see her eliminated once and for all ah elena said with understanding now heres the rub over the course of this tale there have been several princes who had come close to the site but none passed the ordeals to come to the point where they were entitled to faerie aid so there was no telling the exact moment when i would have to make my appearance i had to invoke the all forests are one spell in order to get there in time bella said as the story played out the prince slaying the wyrm with his glass sword and awakening the princess by ringing the bells of the palace chapel most exhausting elena already knew about the all forests are one spell it was a very important one that enabled a godmother or the person she was supposed to guide to cross their paths no matter how far apart they really were and a good job she made of it too said randolf cheerfully invisible behind the moving picture of the prince being greeted by the awakened princess and her entire court is that enough madame quite enough thank you randolf im sure she has the idea by now randolf shows the future elena hazarded the face appeared in the mirror again and gave an exaggerated sigh alas no fair maiden i show only the present and past but i show the present as it happens with enough warning and fully in time for the godmother to arrive well that put an interesting complexion on things elena had wondered just how madame had managed to keep track of her all these years and now she knew amazing she managed the face in the mirror beamed oh madame it said dont forget the christening tomorrow you asked me to remind you yes thank you randolf elena you may give him his curtains back it seemed cruel to imprison the poor spirit behind heavy velvet drapes but it didnt seem to mind doesnt he get bored in there she asked bella laughed ah my dear unlike his former mistress i have freed him to use his powers to look anywhere he cares to he doesnt need to eat or sleep what he enjoys is watching over my charges the kingdoms for which i am responsible with some little time to view players minstrels and musicians i give him the freedom and the magic power to enjoy himself when he is not watching on my behalf and he keeps me apprised of what i need kindness elena thought with satisfaction a little kindness to randolf had won madame a powerful servant here at last she was in a place where kindness was rewarded so you are attending a christening tomorrow elena asked disappointed as she thought she was making some real progress in her magic lessons and frankly didnt want them interrupted oh yes a royal christening madame said and gave elena an opaque look ill be there and so will you chapter a carriage had appeared from nowhere at least so far as elena was concerned it had simply turned up at the door when madame bella and elena had both been gowned and coiffed to roses satisfaction there certainly wasnt a carriage nor a carriagehorse in the tiny stable and this wasnt the sort of equippage you would find in any of the nearby villages while not large it was excessively opulent a little mauveandgold jewelbox of a carriage drawn by a single handsome grey horse and driven by a curiously silent footman in mauve livery with a great deal of gold braid on it elena recalling all of the tales had to wonder if this carriage was really their little farm cart and the horse that old donkey as for the footman well he could be anything a frog a mouse a rabbit even old hob or robin transformed their coach took them into the edge of the forest where madame paused to invoke the all forests are one forest spell this was the first time that elena had seen this great magic at work and it was remarkable madame got out of the carriage walked to the road just in front of the horse and raised her staff and it was as if she was the center of a whirlwind of the green dust motes of magic but it was a very slowly moving whirlwind and a soundless one denser and denser they became and brighter and brighter until elena had to squint in order to see and just as the light became painful madame thumped the end of the staff three times on the ground the light the magicmotes all vanished and elena got the strangest sensation as if someone had dropped the carriage out from beneath her at the same time thumping her in the middle of her chest madame came back to the carriage and the footman handed her in quite as if nothing whatsoever had happened they entered the deep green depths and no more than a mile later emerged again but this time they were nowhere near the little village that should have been on that road according to a signpost they were in the royal forest of leskamidia very near the palace a mile after that and they came out of the trees and into farm fields the palace clearly visible in the middle distance within a half hour the footman was handing them out at the foot of the stairs lined with guards in handsome uniforms to join the throng of bewigged bedecked and bejeweled guests moving into the great hall and the throne room beyond and difficult as it might be to believe the godmother was outstanding even in this group once again madame bella was resplendent in her full fairy godmother glory with no sign of the eccentric old lady about her this time the color of the outfit was a pale mauve matching the carriage and the footmans livery which was probably why the majordomo who announced them kept referring to her as her grace the lilac fairy her jewels were a chain of amethysts and pearls amethyst rings and amethyst and pearl buckles on her mauve satin shoes the lace of her gown was beaded with tiny faceted amethysts and seedpearls ornamented the bodice she was even wearing a tiara of little flowers made of amethysts with emerald leaves and pearls for centers on her powdered wig elena was grateful that as the mere apprentice she didnt have to look nearly as splendid no tiara no powdered wig not even powder on her natural hair in fact all that rose had done with her hair was to make it curl though apparently even brownie magic was not sufficient to make it form into neat ringlets her gown was a more subdued version of madames with a great deal less of lace and no gemstonebeading at all her jewels were a simple rope of pearls and her shoebuckles of plain silver for the first time in her life she was wearing satin slippers and truth to tell she felt quite elegant enough she had a wand instead of a staff though it was a much longer wand than she was used to using now and for some reason robin had elected to put a gilded star on the end of it otherwise its just a stick he had insisted people will expect it how will anyone know youre madames apprentice without a wand with a star on top the gown just might give the game away she had pointed out dryly it might as well be livery seeing as we match and that wand looks well silly like something out of a book of tales hed waved his hands in frantic triumph thats the point she knew when she was beaten but she still thought it looked silly apparently no one else did however people did give her a wide and wary berth and as she moved through the gathering in madames wake they actually bowed slightly to her with deeper bows reserved for madame who graciously nodded her head in return that was gratifying since there wasnt a single one of these people who would have looked at ella cinders with anything other than pity and disdain and fretted lest she somehow dirty the hems of their garments from five feet away the throne room dazzled with color and light name a hue and someone was wearing an elegant jewelembroidered suit or gown in that color flowers garlanded the creamy marble walls and were twined about veined marble columns a thousand scented candles twinkled in sconces and chandeliers the room was full of delicate scent and light it was to the last detail the sort of celebration that elena had only read about the sort to which not even madame klovis could ever have dared aspire not one guest here was of common blood elena suspected that even the servants considered themselves to be a sort of nobility and among the dukes and counts and barons were a sprinkling of another sort of nobility altogether fair folk well some of them anyway the majordomo called them all fairies and identified them by the colors of their gowns but that was probably because he didnt know any better or perhaps hadnt been told their true identities possibly the latter better to call them all fairies for there were some folk who were unreasonably prejudiced against witches and sorcerers three of the guests were genuine fair folk indeed elves of the sort that elena had already seen gowned in rose silver and gold four were quite powerful witches if the haze of power surrounding them was anything to judge by one was a sorceress now elena only guessed at that last but there were signs for someone who had been reading as much of the history of the five hundred kingdoms and the tradition as shed been fairies were immediately identifiable of course by their eyes and ears and two of them had mischievously elected to cause tiny butterflywings to sprout from their shoulders perhaps in mockery of some of the sillier stories elena had read about them as a child the witches were all in earthy colors russet green wheatstraw and grey and their staffs and the ornaments they wore though fashioned of silver and gems were modeled on vines leaves and flowers or beasts and birds the one that elena reckoned to be a sorceress wore a very dramatic gown of brilliant blue and white and her ornaments made of silver diamonds and sapphires were not representations of natural things she looked a bit spiky truth to tell very splendid and aloof but as madame crossed her path she winked at both of them in a conspiratorial manner and there was a definite twinkle in her eye madame was met by a page as she glided serenely across the ballroom floor and conducted to the king queen and the new little princess with the crowd parting before her as if someone invisible was shoving them aside the nearer they drew to the thrones the more tiaras and coronets there were good heavens elena thought catching sight of a haughty little head with a confection of gold velvet and ermine atop its ornate powdered wig is that a crown it is and theres another there are foreign princesses here princes too it seemed as elena caught sight of another crown this time on a male head elena concentrated on madames back and remembered that she was a godmothers apprentice and that a godmothers apprentice didnt gape at the guests at someone elses party and then they entered the empty space around the dais all eyes upon them and elena had to remind herself that she belonged here and that someday it would be she who was the godmother it took a lot of reminding her initial reaction was to want to stammer an apology and run off to the kitchen madame bella said the king rising from his throne and descending the two steps to take madame bellas free hand in both of his i cannot tell you how grateful we are he lowered his voice but are you sure nothing will go wrong she did say she would be here and weve done everything you said but i just know that shell find something to be offended by elena was utterly mystified by some of the kings words but she had a good idea of the sort of things that traditionally went wrong at royal christenings there was usually an evil witch or sorceress who hadnt gotten an invitation or if she had she would find some great affront when she arrived she would wait until she thought every magician there had delivered up his or her magical gift to the baby and then descend with her own curse the young queen both the king and queen were very young elena noticed certainly no older than she herself was leaned forward on her throne one hand protectively on the edge of a canopied cradle spilling over with pink silk and lace coverlets if anything she looked more anxious than the king perhaps he was better at hiding his feelings than she was ive taken care of everything dont worry said madame soothingly but if you want to be sure it will work bertram you and linette have to look carefree as if you are expecting no trouble whatsoever well try the king replied and forced a smile onto his face kissed madames hand and let her go madame bowed and retreated with elena still following like a faithful shadow she moved off a little ways to the side of the throne and took up what seemed to be a position or at least it felt that way to elena i expect youre wondering what all that was about she said in an aside to her apprentice as she nodded and smiled to other guests who wandered by bowed to her and passed on well i know all the things that can go wrong at a christening elena replied dubiously and so do bertram and linette in fact linette is one of my princesses so shes doubly aware madame acknowledged which is why when their firstborn turned out to be a girl they sent word begging me to take care of all of the special arrangements at the christening not only did i make sure that all of the desirable magicians of the kingdom got their invitations i had randolf spend a considerably store of his free time covering every square inch of this kingdom looking for the evil sorceress i knew had to be here then i made absolutely certain that her invitation was put right into her hands but thats no guarantee elena began when suddenly she felt an inexplicable plummeting of her heart a chill wind moved across the room making the candles in the chandeliers flicker and the guests shiver frightened silence spread from a point near the entrance moving across the crowd like a ripple in a pond a shadow passed over the room people edged away from something that was moving towards the thrones and in the center of that moving point of silence elena saw her first evil sorceress no great surprise she was gowned all in black from the shoes to her own tiara she wore not a single hint of color her gown was a black velvet overdress a black satin underdress with faceted black crystals winking among the folds more black crystals made up the tiara in her elaboratelystyled ebony hair her staff was black with a black serpent carved twining around it and it was surmounted by a globe of black obsidian as she drew nearer elena realized with a touch of reluctant admiration that even the black lace adorning her gown was very different from the swags and garlands on everyone elses garb it had been made in the pattern of spiderwebs she glared about her hostility and anger radiating from her and it was then that elena realized that she was in fact no older than the king and queen or even elena herself she exchanged a glance with madame hers startled madames knowing madame nodded sometimes the ones who were supposed to have the happy endings go to the bad there was so much anger in the young womans eyes so much resentment and so much pentup pain that elena could not imagine how madame was going to stop this creature from just exploding then and there like a fermenting bottle then from out of the shadows where he had somehow been concealed behind the blueandwhite sorceress another figure stepped it was a young man he wasnt handsome and he clearly wasnt all that wealthy but he had the most interesting and intense face that elena had ever seen he too wore black a little threadbare but not illkempt clearly though he might be poor by the standards of the rest of the guests here he was proud but with the right sort of pride that will not be beaten by so small a thing as poverty and insists on what madame fleur used to call certain standards elena sensed that even if he had to mend and clean his clothing himself he would be clean and mended if he had to go without a meal he would give no hint of it he moved into the sorceresss path as if she was a lodestone and he a needle and when she paused in surprise he seized his moment and her hand and bent nearly double to kiss it madame arachnia i presume he said and his voice was so melodious that it made elena yearn to actually hear him sing rather than speak madame i would never have accepted the invitation to come here this day if it had not been that i knew that you had also been invited the sorceress was taken so completely by surprise that she could only stare at him in shock you you did she stammered completely taken aback but i had to meet you he replied staring into her eyes with hungry intensity and please could we come away from these ordinary people now his voice dripped disdain for those around him i sense that we must talk still in shock the sorceress let him lead her all unresisting out of one of the double doors that led to the garden the shadows and the chill passed from the room with them elena managed to drag her eyes away from them long enough to look at her mentor madame bella was watching with every evidence of satisfaction and when the pair had gone out the door into the garden she smiled that went well she said and winked at elena i knew i could count on miranda the celebration went on presumably without either madame arachnia that had to be an assumed name or the young man there was entertainment dancers musicians mountebanks then at last came the moment to present christening gifts and to elenas horror madame bella was the first of the magicians to grant hers i grant her the gift of a caring heart said madame and bowed over the cradle a swirl of lilac mist rose about her and settled over the baby madame smiled and retired to make way for the sorceress in blue and white what are you doing elena hissed frantically as madame resumed her place beside her apprentice that creature is still outside why didnt you go hide or something so that when she comes in and curses the baby you will be the one to turn the curse because arachnia has probably forgotten about you completely madame replied looking completely unruffled as the sorceress bestowed lips like cherries and teeth like pearls me squeaked elena but hush and watch and listen and learn as elena fidgeted and fretted the other magicians gave their gifts all to her mind singularly useless what good was hair as gold as sunlight and the voice of a lark to someone who was probably going to die on her sixteenth birthday unless an untrained apprentice could figure out a way and muster the power to turn the curse of a very powerful sorceress finally the last of the fair folk gave her gift the grace of a swan on the water and with utter predictability madame arachnia appeared the crowd drawing back from her that shadow hanging over her a cold wind coming with her except that she wasnt alone that young man was still with her and the shadow that surrounded her seemed thinner the cold wind not so much icy as merely cool and the expression on her face was one of bewilderment the king and queen clutched each others hands trying to put on a show of bravery and failing utterly arachnia stood before the cradle uncertainty in her very pose she looked down at the baby looked into the eyes of the king and queen and then then looked back at the young man who gazed at her with trust worship and tenderness on the morning of her sixteenth birthday arachnia began her voice rolling across the crowd in sepulchral tones but then she stopped her sixteenth birthday she began again but now her voice was not so threatening in fact it sounded hesitant she looked back at the young man he smiled she tried to turn towards him but something was holding her there the struggle between arachnia and this invisible force was palpable visible and it was making her angry she turned back towards the cradle and gathered herself together she drew herself up she pointed at the infant in the cradle but when she spoke instead of threat the voice was full of irritation the tone said iknow i have to do this i feel the tradition forcing me into it idont have a choice but pardon me if i just go through the motions on the morning of her sixteenth birthday the princess will awaken with her hair so knotted it will look as if birds had been nesting in it there was a halfhearted little rumble of thunder the shadow passed for a moment arachnia turned back to the young man with a look of triumph he held out both hands to her now it was she who was drawn as steel to a lodestone and they walked away from the king and queen and princess and right out the door together as if no one else existed but then the shadow gathered again the cold fell heavily on the room as the tradition gathered all of its strength to warp that ineffectual curse into something horrible elena felt the potential of the curse still hanging over everything and she knew the tradition and what it could do if the curse wasnt quickly countered it would descend in some ghastly form that no one could anticipate no matter how weak the actual curse might seem to be she grasped her wand in a sweating hand and stepped forward the youngest of them all and her mind was working frantically how to turn the curse into a blessing how to take all that power of the tradition and turn it against itself she had to be clever had to give the tradition what it wanted that was not only a curse but a reward for someone worthy the poor little princess would have to endure something and at the same time the end of the tale had to provide something for another person that she had to name what could you do with hair that was horribly knotted and keep it from tangling around someones throat to choke off her breath it had to be something that would cost some pain for the tradition demanded pain for a curse who could untangle something hopelessly snarled it came to her and as she stepped forward towards the infants cradle she was carefully phrasing her counter hoping no one noticed how her hands were shaking she gathered all of the power she could see swirling around her in a rainbow skein of magic prayed it was enough and waved her wand three times over the babys cradle shining motes of power followed the circling of the star on the tip of her wand and spiraled down into the sleeping infant the princess will awaken with her hair binding her to her bed so knotted that she cannot move there that was surely enough of a curse to satisfy the tradition scissors will be blunted knives useless and not any of her handmaidens will be able to loosen so much as a single knot all will seem lost there was the despair that was needed nor will magic avail the day no mans hand will free her that left things open for a girl a female anyway the tradition liked these little sly loopholes but a rescuer will come noble by nature not by birth gifted with patience and common sense drawn by pity and not hope of reward with her own two hands the rescuer will free the princess from the prison of her own hair and win her freedom and her friendship just like the popping of a soapbubble the dreadful potential vanished elena almost wept with relief now everyone sighed some with relief that matched elenas some not understanding what had happened laughing nervously at the apparently absurd curse only the magicians among them moved forward to congratulate the new apprentice on a clever counter for only they realized that the tradition had been poised to make the princess strangle in her own hair or be smothered by it or take some other dreadful form now it and all of its potential had been bound into a harmless yet logical form the princess would live and there would be a happily ever after for the nameless rescuer some humble girl somewhere who would have the patience to untangle the gordianhairknot when everyone else had given up the celebration went on but their work was done and elena felt as drained as if she had been running for a mile the king called for the musicians to play and madame bella quietly went to him to explain what was going to happen in sixteen years elena found a convenient pillar and put her back against it feeling limp and drained eventually madame bella returned and took her gently by the elbow and steered her into one of the little siderooms that had been set up for the convenience of a few guests who wished to converse together somehow she was not at all surprised to find the other magicians there being served with refreshments and chattering amiably among themselves miranda my dear you exceeded my wildest dreams bella said as they entered and the sorceress beamed a seat was immediately provided for elena and the witch in russet pressed a glass of wine into her hand elena drank it down at a gulp the sorceress nodded graciously it was a stroke of luck finding him do you know hes a prince as well as a poet there was a gasp and a laugh from the witch in green no oh my word that does make a great deal of sense no wonder arachnia gravitated straight for him what oh oh of course if shes like me she was supposed to have a prince and somehow didnt get one only she turned bitter and hard and wants to make everything around her hurt as much as she does but the traditional attraction is still there what sort of prince bella asked plying elena with a slice of cake it was far too sugary or at least would have been if she hadnt been so famished a frog prince the poor thing and hed been that way so long that his kingdom had passed right into the hands of a collateral line decades at least maybe more i couldnt be sure kissed by a princess all right but she was only six years old and in the habit of kissing every bird and beast that crossed her path sorceress miranda shook her head with pity for the poor mans situation elena winced bad enough to have the first part of your destiny thwarted worse to no longer have a home to return to but then to have insult piled on top of injury like that oh the poor lad exclaimed the witch in grey with sympathy warming her voice no princess no kingdom no prospects but a talent for brooding poetry well i would be broody if id gone through all of that miranda replied hes good enough to keep from starving which for a poet is a pure miracle frankly i found him just as you suggested bella by looking for slim volumes of recently published verses full of suffering and anguish and longing for death and a morbid fascination with the trappings of darkness but not the substance and you tracked the poet down bella prompted handing a plate of little sandwiches to elena who felt as if she was so starved there was a hole in the bottom of her stomach just as you said i knew i had the right sort of fellow after watching him a while he might speak longingly in excellent rhyme of wanting to be united with the powers of darkness and descend into the blackness of neverending night but in his little garret he was feeding sparrows with bread he could hardly afford to part with miranda smiled merrily i took on the semblance of a royal messenger delivered the invitation and made sure he knew that the notorious madame arachnia would also be there and when he arrived i just made sure to position him properly and you saw the rest but bella the witch in green protested how did you know this would fall out in this way how did you know that arachnia wouldnt still put a really powerful curse on the babe she didnt not exactly said an aged voice from the door they all turned and two of the witches leaped to their feet to aid the bent and withered old woman who stood there into the room and into a chair she didnt the old woman repeated with a cherubic smile and a voice creaking with age i was to be her emergency counter in case the curse was too dreadful for her clever little apprentice to work out not she added that i think it would have been once a truly dreadful curse has been laid the tradition usually makes the counter fairly easy to think of and set not death but sleep quoted miranda and no one would ever have looked for you here madame veronica i thought you never traveled anymore i do not the elderly godmother replied this is my kingdom and i told bella to be ready when i knew the queen was expecting i am one of the royal nurserymaids and that was a good touch couching the counter so that the savior is a lowborn girl young elena she added i shall have to be sure there is someone worthy of reward and gathering potential in that position when the time comes but still bella how did you know you would find a young man that would find arachnia irresistible the witch in green persisted i can see where you could turn her if you could only find someone who would see her and love her but how did you know such a fellow existed bella tilted her head to the side and a wry smile touched her lips you find them in any kingdom she said if you look hard enough young men and young women too who believe that they are in love with evil death and darkness but in fact are in love with mystery mind it wouldnt have worked if arachnia herself wasnt so young and still able to be turned if only one could find the key to her loneliness i expect shell be your charge now miranda and happy to take her on the sorceress replied id go through fire and ice to turn someone with her power and believe me i have bound that young man with so many spells im surprised he can move you didnt put a love spell on him said the witch in grey aghast great heavens no im not that stupid miranda exclaimed arachnia would have spotted that in an instant and shed have been so angry she probably would have cursed the whole kingdom no all i did was hedge him around so that he cant become the rogue the betrayer the cad or the seducer and i let his own romantic feelings do the rest we can count on that madame bella said with a decided nod of her head i think that he may be in love with an abstract now but it wont be long before hes in love with arachnia herself and she wont be able to resist him i know thanks to randolf ive had a look at her library a good half of it is slim little volumes of darkly romantic poetry and i wouldnt be at all surprised to discover that some of them are his in no time well probably by tonight theyll be haunting the battlements of her castle together as bats flutter overhead beneath a gibbous moon two of the witches heaved sighs of relief and madame veronica nodded well that seems to have it all settled and sorted then and i must say a more clever way of turning the tradition i have never seen the witch in russet said with contentment and turned to her fellows when shall we four meet again thursday next would be good said the one in grey but this time i am supplying the cards your deck likes you altogether too much penelope in the carriage on the way back to the cottage as shafts of light penetrated the forest canopy creating slashes of golden light across the green shadows elena turned to her mentor did you really arrange all of that she asked in wonder however did you even think of it it only worked because arachnia thats not her real name by the way she changed her name when she turned to the darkness is young and although she is a seething mess of anger and resentment she is also enduring a truly crushing weight of loneliness madame replied as the carriage wheels rolled over a dry stick breaking it with a sound that made elena jump she spent all of her young life much like you despised and exploited she was sent into the wilderness by her stepmother who told her to gather berries before any such thing was ripe and taken up by an evil sorceress and made into a slave then what elena wanted to know well the sorceress had many such servants all of whom hated her but none of whom dared to defy her arachnia bore it as long as she could but the moment came when she was both strong enough and had the opportunity and she managed to kill her mistress that was when she decided that she must be an evil sorceress and the tradition obliged by supplying her with some sort of tutors as well as the workroom and library of her former mistress and all the other evil magicians who had lived there originally so she studied magic and the tradition on her own elena hazarded bella nodded thats what usually happens actually the dark magicians dont have a great deal of tolerance for one another madame bella glanced over at elena perhaps to see if she needed to elaborate on this point but it was pretty obvious to the apprentice dark magicians didnt have much tolerance for any sort of rival well when randolf found her for me i began using him to watch her but to tell the truth it was easy to see that her heart wasnt in the business of evil for its own sake she had the proper trappings but it was mostly show her garden has as many roses as nightshade and henbane plants she keeps only nonvenomous spiders and snakes the bats live in their very own tower and every raven and owl that has decided to roost at her castle is so wellfed that several of them are too fat to fly but if thats true elena said her brow wrinkling why didnt you do something to help her before she killed her stepmother there was a very long moment of silence because madame said at last with such deep sorrow that elena almost regretted asking the question i did not know any of this until i had randolf go looking for the evil sorceress that i knew must be there and i was lucky in arachnia she could have been elena was not sure how to phrase it she could have been truly evil this isnt the first time that ive hoped to turn the tradition this way been disappointed and had to rectify matters in the usual way but that is why i sent randolf looking as i always have hoping that i would be lucky madame looked steadily into elenas eyes i knew that if just once i could find the combination i was looking for i could turn the tradition not just this one time but open a new possibility for the future you felt it all that potential how it just slipped aside when your counter was cast elena nodded warily she thought shed felt that at any rate the potential magic you used was just a fraction of what was available and the rest of it went into cutting a new traditional path madame said with just a touch of gloating now just you wait and see the tale of arachnia and her impoverished poet prince will become its own part of the tradition and perhaps that knowledge will help another godmother turn some other dark one in the future or maybe it will keep one from going to the dark at all elena hazarded we can only hope my dear bella replied as the carriage came within sight of the cottage its thatched roof gleaming like gold in the evening sunlight but it is a goal worth pursuing at almost any cost elena had no difficulty whatsoever in agreeing with that chapter day by day week by week elena mastered the arts and skills of magic and fine art of being a godmother midsummers day came and went and summer drowsed towards haying time in the villages near bellas cottage haying time brought a spate of women to the cottage the wives and sweethearts of farmworkers seeking charms against cutting and ointment for wounds haying was dangerous work and the men who swung the huge razorsharp scythes could be cut and bleed to death if the worst happened bella taught the making of these to elena and after the first few it was she who supplied all such things to their visitors some few of the farmers themselves came looking for help as well but what they wanted was not a charm but a prediction hay needed five hot days to dry properly after it was cut five days of no rain and no dew bella herself saw to that its easy enough she said with a chuckle weather moves from west to east i simply have randolf look west from here and find me at least a fiveday span of clear weather then give me a notion of when it will start at this time of year when we have far more sun than rain thats not so hard that struck elena as supremely clever it didnt require trying to see into the future which she had learned was very difficult and became more so the further ahead you tried to look it also didnt require changing the weather which she had been warned was something that could cause more problems than it solved sometimes it seemed the business of a witch or a godmother was not so much using magic as knowing when not to use it sometimes she felt as if she was learning so much so fast that her head was stuffed full of it all and if she had to master one more thing her skull was going to burst while witches and hedgewizards tended to control and direct magic by using things creating complicated potions and talismans the sorcerers and sorceresses controlled magic with words using a special language of words of binding and loosing that minutely described the effects a magician wanted but a full wizard or a godmother worked strictly by will and intention oh that sounded so very easy but you had to learn how to focus yourself completely so that nothing distracted you you had to learn how to chart an exact course and commit yourself completely to the course you had decided on and you had to learn to think on your feet so that you could frame something that would steer the tradition in the way you wanted it to go the moment that an opportunity presented itself this was why arachnia despite her best effort had not thwarted the tradition with her pseudocurse this was why elena shaking with fear and effort had been able to counter the curse in a way that satisfied the tradition faced with her first crisis she had been so focused on it that by the time her will had been imposed there was no room for the tradition to move except in the direction she wanted it to thanks to all her reading she had known enough of the tradition by then to be able to give it the path of least resistance in the direction she wanted it to go but the more practiced she became the more experience she had the more important the ability to focus would become she would not have that fear to narrow her concentration down to the sharpest point with familiarity came if not contempt certainly a loss of urgency she had to learn how to make up for that with internal focus wizards and fairy godmothers did more than merely counter curses they also tested and guided questers and dispensed punishments to seekers who failed the tests the little old lady in the woods who after being treated kindly dispensed the clues that a quester needed to find his goal those were godmothers the ferryman who had the answers to questions also godmothers or wizards the hag at the bridge the watcher at the door and when there was more than one quester when for instance it was a quest by several young men only one of whom would be worthy it was the job of the godmothers and wizards to test these seekers to find the one who was worthy to pass on and if they did not measure up to allot a punishment or send them in another direction that would hopefully teach them and correct their behavior many a prince who had failed the test of kindness on the way to the captive princess later became the hero of his own story or at the least became the wise and virtuous king of his own land at the death of his father that was godmother and wizardly magic wizards were fewer than godmothers and usually elected to be solitary apart from the dwellings of men living in caves or wild forests as hermits but because godmothers often acted as the local white witches they also had to learn witchery in order to help their communities and maintain their fictive disguises thus elena had not one but two sets of lessons to master of the two the witchery was the easiest in fact so far as she was concerned it was something of a doodle all you had to do was to follow the recipe to create the potion whose purpose was determined by the ingredients then you infused the potion with a touch of power witches and hedgewizards worked in subtle ways attempting to make their influence felt not at the crisis but before there was any hint of a crisis they operated at the lowest level of magic where small changes might bring larger results as a result even the most powerful of witches generally used the smallest amount of magic needed in order to bring about the desired result more often than not they did not use magic as such at all for instance being kind to the abused and exploited stepdaughter of a neighborgiving her encouragement and the odd meal helping her to cope with a cup of tea and a word of advice yes elenas neighbors had been witches both of them and among many other things they had kept a careful eye on elena guiding her keeping her spirit from being crushed had she ever truly wanted with all her heart to become ordinary they would have called on madame bella to come and take the weight of all of that traditional potential away from her and she probably would have managed to find either a kind husband or a position as a maidofallwork when madame klovis departed on her search for another wealthy victim to wed probably the latter though there was no telling for certain as it was when they knew that elena was determined to escape no matter what it took they had called madame bella to examine this potential apprentice for herself those were the voices that elena had heard that night murmuring over the wall next door for their part sorcerers and sorceresses intervened when things had gone so wrong that only enormous magical effort could save the day they accompanied heroes and heroines on the quests and when they did the odds were usually stacked against them they often watched over the children who would become heroes as they were raised in hiding they fought at the side of heroes when the armies of good and evil clashed they could go their entire lives without ever fulfilling that particular destiny however so they also served another set of functions they often assisted godmothers they frequently devised the trials and tests that lesser questers had to pass and perhaps because of their affinity for language and deep long thought they were frequently mystics being sought for their wisdom as well as their magic a sorcerers life was often spent in long years of patient study and waiting and it sometimes ended in a frenetic and perilfilled span of mere months when there was combative magic darkening the skies it was most often the sorcerers and sorceresses who were in the thick of it yet such times were few and it was just as well that this was so or the landscape would have been shattered by the scope of such conflicts most sorcerers and sorceresses never once raised a wand in anger they lived and died in their distant lofty towers seldom venturing out studying the heavens and the earth in splendid isolation unless someone happened to call upon them for some trifle or other elena decided rather quickly that she would not much enjoy being a sorceress she might have enjoyed being a witch but but could she have ever acted as her neighbors did remaining apart from the people she served staying out of their daytoday quarrels living in her town yet apart from it witches and hedgewizards could not take sides could not become involved dared to make no judgments allowing events to judge themselves she didnt think so she could not just stand apart from things and let them run their course without trying to set them right she would never for instance have been able to stand being next door to her younger self seeing how that self was mistreated by madame klovis in fact she probably would have marched right in one fine day after a beating and turned madame and her two daughters into toads it was the passion to set things right that defined the godmother and the wizard and this was also why they did not live among the people to be a godmother meant that you did become involved and you used your strong emotions to help you focus but godmothers and wizards did not remain so utterly apart from people as the sorcerers and sorceresses did they needed to have some contact with people to remain anchored in humanity and keep their own emotions alive it was a difficult balance to maintain but it wasnt boring in all of the magical work she was doing elena was constantly concerned that at some point that store of magical power that the tradition had surrounded her with would run dry and finally one day during the haying when she had made half a dozen charms against cutting a little talisman made of tiny leaden scythe with no edge at all a sprig of high john and a bit of cloth with the persons blood on it she voiced that concern to madame bella was out in the garden deciding with lilys help just which herbs would be cut that night in the light of the full moon when elena stammered out her worry madame gave her a long and considering look it is true that with nearly anyone else i would have taught you how to harvest power by now she said at last the reason i havent is that you arrived with so much you havent yet expended half of it but something could happen to me she paused at the sight of elenas stricken look and laughed no no im not anticipating anything no premonitions no predictions i assure you just the common sense that things can happen that no one foresees so since those talismans and a few other things have to go to the village anyway you might as well come along with me and ill show you how its done ill harness dobbin said lily instantly you go change your apron and get your hat bella told elena ill have rose make up the basket so by the time elena had changed her apron for a clean one tied a kerchief over her hair to keep the dust out and placed her widebrimmed flatcrowned straw hat over that and was down the stair again the donkey and cart were at the front gate and madame was already on the drivers bench although he wasnt nearly as fast as the little humpback horse the donkey could keep a surprisingly quick pace for one so old and small a pleasant hour brought them to the village of louvain and madame was hardly over the little stone bridge before the women who had commissioned those charms came running to meet them youre just in time said the first of them a cheery roundfaced woman who had three happily grubby little children trailing along behind her haying begins tomorrow i dont know what wed have done if you hadnt come today tell those dolts to be extra careful thats what wed have done said another thin and careworn with a grimace still theyre men you never can depend on them not to play the fool when theres a lot of them together the last of the women a sweetfaced girl with a furrowed brow took her talisman but whispered to madame when the others were just out of earshot madame bella its can you thats why i came today madame whispered back just let me leave my simples with brother tyne and ill see you before i leave elena had expected from the name that brother tyne was a priest but in fact he was an apothecary with a little shop on the village square the sign of his trade a large roundbottomed bottle hanging above his door when they drew up to his shop he came out and took the basket from madame handing her down afterwards as if he was a footman come along apprentice madame called over her shoulder youll be doing this eventually so you might as well see our arrangement they didnt stay long in the tiny shop brother tyne counted what theyd brought and apparently there was a set price already for madames goods for there was no haggling they emerged with a little purse of copper and silver and an empty basket and a paper with the prices that the apothecary would pay for each potion on a little slip of paper in elenas pocket and on the way out of town madame pulled the donkey up beside the gate of a tiny rosecovered cottage with the prettiest yard elena had ever seen the entire place was as cheerful as you could ask and elena was struck by the notion that not that long ago she would have been happy living in such a place rosalie madame called have you got that butter i wanted the same young woman who had whispered so urgently to madame appeared at the door of the cottage i have and please come and choose the pats for yourself she replied madame hopped down off the cart and elena tied up the donkey to the hedge at the front of the yard and followed her once inside the cottage it was clear that butter had been nothing more than an excuse to come inside away from the prying eyes of the neighbors i feel that hemmed in its like i cant breathe sometimes the young woman was saying as elena joined them in the tiny kitchen i cant imagine why its got so bad so quickly this time it was then that elena noticed what she had not before that the young woman was just beginning to show her pregnancy ah this must be something to do with that elena thought but then wondered she knew this village had a midwife and a good one why ask madame bella for help well this should be the last time its this hard my dear madame soothed now just you remember if you get a craving for anything outofseason you send straight to me that minute and ill make a special trip here or send my apprentice i dont think you will once ive done with you today but its still possible now elena watch and listen when madame said watch in that tone of voice it meant magic elena blinked and saw the whirls of magical power swirling tightly around the young woman so thick that her features were blurred as if she wore a veil rosalie do you surrender your power to me freely and of your own will madame asked slowly carefully and clearly she held her wand just over the crown of the young womans head do you renounce this power not only for yourself but for the sake of your unborn child i do rosalie replied bowing her head slightly i renounce it for the life i have chosen for the sake of my unborn child and for the love that i bear my husband with each word that the young woman spoke the power slowed and somehow relaxed until it no longer bound her like coils of wire but lay about her like loose hay then i assume it for the pledge i have made for the sake of those who will need it and my duty to those who call upon me madame said circling young rosalies head three times with the tip of her wand and the power followed it flowing around and upwards vanishing into the wand as if it was somehow sucking it up that was the only analogy that elena could make the spell was a simple enough one but she saw by the frown of concentration on madames face that the effort to make it work was intense and before all of the power had been absorbed she stopped rosalies head shot up you arent done she cried accusingly i can feel it madame held up her hand hush dear well take the burden from you no fear but i want my apprentice to take a hand and finish the job rosalie looked at elena doubtfully but did not voice those doubts perhaps because she was too polite to do so elena took madames place her wand outstretched rosalie she said carefully do you surrender your power to me freely and of your own will do you renounce this power not only for yourself but for the sake of your unborn child the power had begun to wrap rosalie in its coils again when madame had released it now as rosalie repeated what she had said to madame it relaxed again then i assume it elena said for the pledge i have made for the sake of those who will need it and my duty to those who will call upon me and as she circled rosalies head with the tip of her own wand she concentrated fiercely on doing the opposite of what she had learned to do so far not to dispense power but to take it in ft was a great deal more difficult than she would have guessed not only was she fighting against the training shed had so far but she could feel the whole weight of the tradition bearing down on her in a kind of sullen resistance the tradition wanted this young woman for something it bent its power towards making her into that something it was like an enormous blind insensate beast pushing her towards that end and it did not want to let her go down some other path but rosalie did not want to go there she was happy with her little cottage her gentle simple husband happy to be ordinary and fit in with the rest of the village as a pea fits among its neighbors in a pod the more the tradition pushed her the more she pushed back and that was what made it painless for her to give up the power that was collecting around her given the amount of it elena had a good idea of why she had seemed so distressed she knew that sort of distantstorm tenseness that the coiledup power around you made you feel the sense that there was something somewhere you urgently had to do it was not unlike feeling that a dreadful headache was poised waiting to strike you the moment you dropped your guard it wore on you until all you could think about was this weight on you the feeling of nerves stretched thin slowly reluctantly the power let go of rosalie and passed to elena where exactly it went she couldnt really tell but she could feel a sort of weight to it and felt it join her power as if she was a vessel and it was water flowing in from some outside source finally the last of the power was gone there was no more magic sparkling and glowing around rosalie than there was around any of her perfectly ordinary neighbors rosalie might not have been able to see the difference but she certainly sensed it her shoulders straightened as did her back she opened her eyes and smiled and her brow was no longer furrowed well apprentice she said her voice bright with pleasure i expect youll not be an apprentice much longer elena flushed i still have a lot to learn she murmured embarrassed as madame chuckled well be off then was all madame said now that youre sorted but remember any craving and you send to me that may not sound like much but believe me its important i will rosalie promised all right elena said once they were well out of the village what was all that about rosalie is a rare one madame replied in fact you wont find a girl like her in a hundred years shes a doubler when she was younger before she married her sweetheart the tradition was trying to make her into a fair rosalinda oh good heavens elena said her hand going to her lips in consternation the tradition was not all happy endings fair rosalinda was one of the uglier directions that the tradition could go into the beautiful peasant orphan girl who is seduced by a king set up in her own secluded bower and murdered by his queen when she discovers his philandering oh yes madame said grimly a fine romantic tragedy if it were to happen to someone else long ago and far awaynot such a fine thing if it was supposed to happen to you elena had read of several fair rosalindas already magic entered the picture only after the poor thing was dead poisoned or strangled and the body buried somewhere hidden but usually the fair rosalinda was drowned then a musician would enter the tale sometimes he would make a pipe or some other instrument of the reeds or the tree growing from her hidden grave in the most macabre and disturbing versions he would make a harp from her bones and string it with her golden hair and then he would go before the king who was grieving for his lost love and when he played the instrument would have but one song the queen hath murdered me elena murmured i will not have one of those in my kingdoms madame said fiercely i found her before the king did before her breasts began to bud she in her turn had already begun to feel the coils of the power around her and when i had explained something of what was going to happen begged me to take it from her which ive been doing and i had hoped that when she wedded the tradition would give over and let her go but it hasnt i had some suspicions as to why and i think theyve just been confirmed now that i know shes with child failing to make her a rosalinda the tradition now wants to make her child a ladderlocks oh please elena said as much in disgust as anything else what has the poor thing done to be so putupon the ladderlocks story was more fantastical and less but only a trifle less unpleasant than that of rosalinda the mother of a ladderlocks child would be overcome with a craving for some outofseason food to the point where she could eat that and only that naturally the only place her distracted husband can find this food would be in the garden of some black witch or evil sorceress he would steal it be caught and pledge to give the woman his child to save his own life on the birth of ladderlocks always a girl the witch would take her away lock her in a tower and among other things forbid her to cut her hairand the rest of that tale was familiar to any child in any kingdom that elena had any knowledge of it might end well but there was often a great deal of horror before the end came i cant even bear to think about being locked up in a tower for sixteen years elena replied i dont know why the girls dont go mad some of them do madame confirmed i know of one who hung herself with her own hair elena shuddered and looked away for a moment and then theres the dozens of poor young fellows who die at the hands of the dark one before one of them manages to get to the tower madame continued frowning fiercely a ladderlocks is nothing more than bait for a deathtrap and i wont have one of those in my kingdoms either elena nodded knowing that even when a young man managed to get to the tower climb the hair and win the maiden he still might not escape the witch unscathed they were almost always caught and sometimes the poor young man who fell in love with ladderlocks found himself blinded by the thorns around her tower or sometimes worse than that a ladderlocks tale often had more tragedy than triumph about it it was a tale best prevented i wish i knew why the tradition was so set on having her bella replied but as long as i keep draining her at least until her firstborn is actually born the magic wont attract the other half of the equation the evil witch elena nodded she knows of course ive drummed it into her head often enough bella said grimly and it will have to be her that prevents it her husband is kind sweet gentle handsome as the dawn and as dense as a bag of stones she loves him but she knows very well that he is prime material for the loving but stupid husband who climbs the wall around the witchs garden to steal her rampion and it would not matter how many times she warns him about it he wont remember the tradition can shove him about like a coin in a game of shove hapenny at that moment elena felt a surge of anger at the tradition that faceless formless thing that pushed and pulled people about with no regard for what they might want or need she met madames eyes and saw that same anger there yes bella said softly only just audible over the sound of hooves and wheels on the hardpacked road i hoped you would feel that i hoped when i took you as my apprentice that you were cut from the same cloth as me some godmothers are only willing to assist in the making of the happy endings i am of a different mind there will be no fair rosalindas in my kingdoms elena said just as softly but just as firmly madame gave a quick nod as if she and elena had just made a pledged pact and perhaps they had good was all she said then she turned her attention back to the road madame changed the topic to something innocuous nothing more was said on that subject but then again nothing more needed to be as harvest turned towards autumn the days became noticeably shorter and the air grew chill at night madame took to leaving elena in charge of the cottage for several days at a time keep randolf company was all she usually said before she went off on whatever mysterious errands were taking her away he gets lonely sometimes hell chatter at you about plays hes been watching just nod and make appreciative noises even if you cant understand half of what hes nattering on about elena was growing very fond of the slave of the mirror by this point randolf was perhaps the most artless person she had ever known despite everything he saw and everything he had lived through he maintained a kind of innocence he had no pretenses nothing about him was a sham furthermore he had beautiful manners and was perfectly pleased to give her the one set of lessons she found it difficult to accept from anyone else in the household the lessons in what he called deportment and she called fitting in madame just simply seemed to change everything about herself without thinking depending on what costume she wore from dotty old peasant woman to gracious lady of exalted breeding and impeccable pedigree lily had just laughed when elena had broached the subject and advised her to just be yourself and be damned to them as doesnt like it and the haughty rose elena thought would be so critical that the lesson would get lost in the criticism ah but randolf had not only been watching kings and queens for two hundred years or more until recently he had been the prized possession of several queens of the evil sort so when madame bella was away elena would spend several evening hours in her sitting room not merely keeping randolf company but learning from him just what does madame do off on her own of late she asked him one night after a long and complicated session on precedence randolf was not showing her anything but his own face at the moment she had gotten so used to conversing with a disembodied head that it no longer seemed at all odd oh you could ask her yourself its no secret randolf said airily but i can tell you easily enough she pays visits around to other magicians in her kingdoms shes likely to start taking you about once youve mastered enough that you can meet them as an equal rather than an apprentice and she likes to keep an eye especially on the ones shes turned well i can see why elena replied struck that the answer hadnt already occurred to her good heavens the last thing she wants is for one of them to turn back hmm that would be a nasty surprise randolf replied i do suggest to her that she could do so just as well through me but she seems to think that the personal touch is more effective using both would be a better idea it seems to me elena said judiciously after all even though you might get a better notion of something odd going on by being there yourself people are on their best behavior when visitors arrive its when theyre alone or think they are that they let things slip randolf tsked truer words were never spoken he agreed brightly like that little pair of turtledoves from the christening you went to bless their hearts theyre so like every other pair of new lovers ive ever watched they so want people to believe that everything is always perfect in their little world if there was anything wrong between them you wouldnt see it unless you had me look in on them is there anything wrong elena asked suddenly anxious she felt rather proprietary about those two she didnt want there to be anything going wrong between them randolf laughed bless you sweetheart not a bit of it in fact well look for yourself the mirror went to black and for a long moment elena thought that randolf was having her on for there didnt seem to be anything at all in the mirror but then her eyes gradually adjusted and she realized she was looking at two deeper shadows silhouetted against the night sky then the moon rose a huge and golden harvest moon flooding the top of a tower upon which the two were standing close together arachnia had changed it was a subtle change but to a godmothers apprentice quite noticeable her hair was down cascading over her shoulders and down her back she still wore black at least insofar as it was possible to tell in the moonlight but the lines of her gown were softer in fact everything about her was softer elena got the vivid impression of a fortress whose walls have not been breached but eroded and covered with vines and flowers as for her poet there were changes in him too he stood straighter and yet there was an easiness about him that had not been there before in his case elena had an image of a man who has put aside a mask he no longer feels compelled to wear as elena watched arachnia leaned her head on the poets shoulder and he snugged his arm around her waist as they watched the moon rise a moment later she turned her head a little and he turned his face to meet hers their lips met and and at that point elena couldnt tell if it was the sorceress who flung herself passionately into the embrace or the poet who crushed the sorceress to him probably both all that she knew for certain was that the two silhouettes became one and from the way the one was moving it might not stay upright for very much longer and she felt heat rushing to her cheeks a tightness in her chest and a slow tingling excitement all over but particularly centered at the cleft of her legs that thank you randolf i believe i understand you she somehow managed she wasnt sure how her throat felt very thick and her face very warm randolfs guileless face emerged from the blackness nothing wrong there he laughed unless youre fussy enough to insist on a wedding before the her flush deepened and she licked her lips now it wasnt excitement that filled her it was frustration and an emotion she was vaguely surprised to recognize as jealousy it took a lot of selfcontrol not to snap at him of course not she said immensely proud of how neutral her voice was if you insisted on that there would be a lot fewer babies born in these kingdoms i expect theyll have one eventually though randolf continued artlessly wedding that is not a baby though theyll probably have one of those too more than one if they keep on like that all the time the jealousy grew and she finally took herself in hand and mentally sat on it after all what right had she to be jealous well she replied trying to sound as light and carefree as possible if they do that it will certainly keep arachnia out of any more mischief she couldnt bring herself to say anything more but fortunately randolf who was by nature oblivious to human emotions began nattering on about something else and she was able to get herself back under control again she was even able to laugh at some of his outrageous jokes before she excused herself for the night and went off to her rooms to prepare for bed but she did not read as she usually did instead she pulled the curtains wide and sat in the windowseat of her bedroom staring out at the rising moon somewhere under that moon arachnia and her poet were locked in a passionate embrace elena knew very well what that kind of embrace led to by the time shed become ella cinders no one in the household had cared what she saw servants had little or no privacy and when coupling went on it happened wherever they could find a corner where they wouldnt be disturbed the cook and old jacques had rutted shamelessly in the kitchen the maids had done it with the footmen in the laundry no one paid any attention to ella it was up skirts and down drawers and away they went on a heap of linen against a wall a pile of hay in the stable oh she knew what went on what was going on somewhere out there under that bright moon and that was what she was jealous of because that wasnt just lust that was love only love could soften and strengthen two people the way those two had been only love could have turned rut into passion and it had been passion between them she had no doubt of that just the memory of it made her heart beat faster her knees feel weak and that flush and tingling spread all over her body she couldnt say it wasnt fair first of all what was fair arachnia had endured a horrible childhood much worse than elenas if madame was to be believed maybe shed done a deal of harm but not as much as she could have and anyway she was making up for it now so who was to say she hadnt earned her happy ending at last not the tradition and not elena and anyway it was a godmothers job to make the happy endings not take them away from someone plenty of people got happy endings that some might say they didnt deserve oh but but what asked a ruthless inner voice are you going to try to claim that what you have now is not a happy ending look at you fed housed clothed beautifully with work in front of you that means something yes but and that isnt enough for you the voice continued as her throat thickened and her eyes stung and the moon blurred a little from unshed tears of loneliness oh well arent we a selfish little bitch we want it all do we and just what have we done to earn it hmm nothing but exactly right not even to earn as much as weve gotten the inner voice was not going to go away and it wasnt going to be less truthful either think about the rosalindas before you start feeling too sorry for yourself think about the other ugly turns the tradition can take then think about how lucky you are that madame bella came along and stop being like the spoiled child who cries herself to sleep because she cant have the moon now the voice went quiet and left her alone she swallowed down the lump in her throat she wiped her eyes with the back of her hand that inner voice was right she knew it was right and just because she thought she was a little lonely that didnt stop if from being right she needed to take herself in hand and count her blessings and she would she would tomorrow but tonight tonight she would think about how much she wished it was her that was in a true lovers arms and weep for the moon just a little chapter by the time the winter snows were calfdeep on the ground the time that elena spent as an apprentice was no longer so much a matter of lessons as it was of practice elena knew the theory virtually everything that madame bella could teach she was not comfortable in it yet but she knew what to do and now unless it so happened that she would ever find herself required for some great work she was as strong in magic as she would ever be she still had the majority of her own power and the power she had gotten from rosalie twice now because things were not getting better they were getting worse the tradition definitely wanted rosalie or her child or both and it was not giving up so madame bella began taking her out to actually do the godmothering herself while madame supervised most of it was minor such as taking the power from rosalie once she played the old woman at the crossroads giving the correct directions to the one young man who was polite to her and sending the other four who were not down a long wilderness road that would leave them in the middle of nowhere another time she made a point of getting a particular pot of flowers into the hands of a young woman and once she ensured that a handsome kitten was adopted by a millowner with three sons she knew what both of those were about of course but it would be years before either story came to fruition what was more neither the black magician nor the ogre would be remotely aware of what was coming before it was too late they were too busy fending off knights at the moment to even think about what a godmother might be preparing for them and last of all madame taught her magical combat with the assistance of the fair folk elena learned all of the ways that duels could take place between magicians whether it was the duel direct where one threw powerful magical attacks at the foe the transformation duel where each magician kept changing his form until one or the other was able to devour or otherwise incapacitate the opposition or the duel by avatar where each magician transformed into a magical monster and physical and magical combat took place between them and she got as much practice in dueling as was possible under the circumstances which was not a great deal dueling took such huge stores of energy that no one really practiced it instead they did what she did they studied the great combats of the past and the fair folk were the past masters at summoning such things into blazing life i have never actually gotten into combat myself madame told her warningly quite frankly i leave that sort of thing to sorcerers its what theyre supposed to do just remember if you are ever in a position where combat cant be avoided call for help the best thing you can do is stay out of the way if you cant never forget that evil will cheat the rest of it was fairly innocuous selling potions at a market stall giving advice sending one young lady on an errand that would intersect her course with a particular shepherd boy who was eminently wellsuited to her godmothering was as much about small things as large and about the lives of ordinary people as well as those that the tradition was trying to steer and sometimes the tradition could be as implacable a foe as any twenty powerful magicians take you for instance said bella one day suppose just suppose mind you happened to encounter a prince outside of your role because you were supposed to marry a prince you would be attracted to him and if he happened to kiss you you would feel the urge to melt into his arms and you might very well fall in love with him but she added darkly you are a godmother not a deserving orphan anymore you are outside of your role where he is concerned and the tradition could very likely try to put him into another role altogether the rake for instance the cad the seducer who will have his way with you steal your heart and abandon you do you recall my discussion of just how i selected arachnias young man that is why i was so exceedingly careful if i had not been he could easily have fallen into one of those roles and made things worse in the end elena felt very uneasy and what if that happened she asked bella shrugged it is a bitter thing to have your heart broken that is how godmothers themselves sometimes go to the bad just remember dear that if you decide to step out of your role you had better do it in such a way that you thoroughly break with the tradition not just try to get around it she didnt need to be reminded of that for the tradition was in ponderous motion within a few miles of the cottage the situation with rosalie was clearly not going to improve despite all of madames attempts to prevent it the young wife when less than a month from confinement was so overcome by a craving for fresh rampion that she could stomach little else she sent word to madame immediately there was little doubt in either bella or elenas minds that if she did not get the vegetable soon she would sicken and perhaps die snow lay a foot thick in every garden only magic could produce fresh rampion at this point and rosalie knew it fortunately she was stubborn as well as intelligent and determined that as she had escaped the fate that the tradition had set for her so would her child so she hid her craving from her husband until she could convey her plight to madame bella madame called elena into her study after hours closeted with randolf rosalie must have rampion randolf has found an evil sorceress sniffing around the village we have little time she looked searchingly at elena i know what i would do but what would you do in this situation first the tradition is going to force a magician into that village to grow the rampion to be stolen she said slowly is there any reason why that magician cannot be me there was only one possible house in the village that would suit only one had a great stone wall all the way around it the tradition would demand that rosalies husband climb a wall or pass some other barrier to steal the rampion the fact that it was already occupied was a detail that needed to be taken care of the dark one could use trickery or might simply dispose of the woman and take her place not being bound by laws or decency made things a bit easier for their kind it was a trifle more difficult for the godmother and her apprentice however a godmother has many resources at her disposal elena never learned what it was that madame promised to the widow in order to get her to agree to vacate for a month or two but it was evidently enough to have her packed and gone on the instant it was only an hour or two after madame paid the woman a visit that elena could move into that isolated walled house at the end of the village a house shrouded by tall cypress and pine usually occupied only by the widow and her two servants madame whisked the widow off quietly in a closed carriage no one in the village would ever even guess that she had gone elena took her place in disguise as soon as the carriage was out of sight the disguise was made easier by elena adopting the widows mourning to most folk all black dresses look alike and the widow held herself so aloof from the rest of the village that so long as her face looked right it was doubtful that anyone would note a difference in height or weight the house was terribly silent compared to madame bellas elena hadnt really noticed it before but there was always the sound of someone moving about the place one of the houseelves at some task or other madame bustling about the place or even randolf singing to himself in madames parlor or speaking with her about something the two servants here however had very little to do and had been trained to do it all silently the house was mostly cold the only fires were in the kitchen and in the widows bedroom the contrast with madames cheerful home could not have been more dramatic and when elena went up to the widows room she got a bit of another shock she saw a stranger in the mirror an older woman statuesque aloof and nothing like her madame had arranged this part it was an illusion but a very very good one elena reached for the mirror and the stranger reached back feeling a little shaken by the encounter elena went straight to bed but she slept lightly and not well unless she was watching the house all the time not likely the sorceress would not know that a substitution had been made shortly she would make her first attempts to take the widows place herself during the night in fact elena woke up twice hearing something sniffing about under the windows and trying the doors she woke the third time as something rattled at a window it could have been the wind which had picked up but she remained wideeyed and awake until dawn as soon as there was light she went ahead and got up to dress no sooner had she finished but there was a knock at the door one of the two servants answered it and summoned elena in her guise as the mistress of the house she had half expected the evil sorceress to appear herself but instead it was a superciliouslooking manservant he gazed at her down his long nose she was wearing the guise of that wealthy widow perfectly ordinary in every way and he evidently didnt recognize her for what she was he wore a livery so rich with gold braid that if one actually had to buy it the clothing would probably fetch twice as much as the gown that elena was wearing so the sorceress was taking the indirect option that was interesting it suggested that she might not be the sort to resort to outright murder or at least not yet my mistress wishes to purchase this house he began its not for sale she said rudely and slammed the door in his face it was not in her best interest to give him or rather his mistress a good look at her a magicians disguise is seldom proof against the probing of another magician at the least the other would be able to tell that there was a disguise in place if not the true identity beneath it the knocking began again she ignored it and directed her servants to do the same and eventually from an upper window saw him trudge away the sorceress was clever more so than the usual because the next person she sent was the village constable a spell on him that elena could read from her window like one of her favorite books meant to make him think that elena was to be evicted she opened her door to him and before he got more than the word you out she struck him with the counterspell she stood there in the doorway while he stood stupidly in the snow trying to remember why he had come there in the first place well constable she asked have you come about that prowler the neighbors have been talking about ah he actually shook himself then brightened ah yes mum the prowler your neighbors said there was something or someone around their walls last night and it fair gave them a turn did you have any sight of him yourself not a bit of it she lied because of course there had been a prowler around her walls but if it had been another servant of the evil one her protections had probably kept it off but the neighbors had evidently seen it as well and been frightened out of their wits that was a stroke of luck though it wasnt anything that she needed to count on there was always someone in every village who saw prowlers at night every night and would berate the constable about them in the morning i have stout walls and good locks and if there was a prowler and not something out of the bottom of a bottle hed know better than to try my door right enough mum the constable said agreeably and turned to go about his business as he left her gate she saw that he was going to talk to the neighbors another stroke of luck the sorceress would not be able to get at him until he was alone again and that might not happen for the rest of the day three times was the usual number for frontal assaults and sure enough just after sundown the evil sorceress arrived herself she came in full array parading down the road from the forest in a black carriage drawn by black horses with fiery eyes horses that elena sensed were not horses at all where she walked up the path to the front door the snow melted when she struck the door with her fist it sounded like the pounding at the gates of a tomb it even shook elena and she was ready for it she had the feeling that the neighbors were all hiding under their beds shivering but now that the moment was at hand somehow she didnt feel quite so frightened anymore in fact the imperious pounding on the door just woke elenas native stubbornness and her anger too along with the weapon that bella had given her she gathered her courage made sure she had the weapon in her hand went to the front door and flung it open the sorceresss hand was raised for a second volley of knocks caught by surprise elena did not give her a chance to recover she jabbed the needlesharp spindle of a spinning wheel right into the upraised hand there was a flash of light and the smell of lightning the spell of sleep hit the sorceress like the fist of doom and she crumpled it was a good spell solid and wellturned it should be it had been diverted from being used on yet another princess several years ago taking down one evil sorceress with the spell crafted by another had a certain satisfying irony about it and anyway madame liked to conserve effort whenever possible the magic had been expended for this weapon of the enemy it only made sense to make use of it if they could this spell had been meant to hold a princess for a hundred years it would only hold an evil sorceress for about a month but that was all that elena needed now at last robin appeared from where he had been waiting in the cypresses in case elenas attack failed he helped her drag the unconscious sorceress into the house together they installed her in a spare room arranging her on the bed then elena sealed the room with triple bindings to make sure the woman stayed there as she closed the door she felt and saw the weight of magic around the house shift and took a deep and steadying breath the sorceress was now in the house the real owner was gone and someone in her image was now mistress of the place the first part of the tale was complete elena looked out at the walled garden at the back of the building and was not at all surprised to see the snow melting away from the raised vegetable beds as if it was springtime even though it lacked but three days to christmas that was the tradition at work if the sorceress herself was not capable of enchanting the garden so that the fateful rampion could grow the tradition would take care of that little detail for her in a way the sight was more terrifying than the sorceress and her dreadful horses at the door here the tradition revealed the power that it could exert in the five hundred kingdoms here was magic moving and working without any human medium at all at that moment elena felt the tradition looming over her like a giant wave about to crash down on her like a silent avalanche about to overwhelm her unless she could direct it she could not control it but if she was careful perhaps she could make it work for her elena went to bed and in the morning when she checked the garden again the little plants were already sprouting from beds in which the earth was warm to the touch her lips tightened with anger but she took care not to show it what she did do was to check again to see that the sorceress was fast asleep by christmas the rampion was half grown by new years it was full grown lush and luscious and on new years day rosalies husband came over the wall in the early morning to steal the verdantly green plants for his wife the roots were at their most perfect crisp and sweet about the size of prize carrots but with a white flesh peasant food which made it all the more ironic for this peasant food would nourish a peasant child who would one day marry a prince but only after royal blood had soaked the earth beneath her tower once he came pulling up a handful of roots before fleeing twice a bit more boldly this time when no one appeared to stop him and the third time in the dusk elena was waiting for him as the sorceress would have been he bent to rip up a plant hastily but without a lot of fear he should have been afraid it should have occurred to him that nothing natural could have produced these plants in the heart of winter nothing like this had ever happened in the widows garden before he should have realized that there was something very very wrong he was thinking only of his wife his beloved the mother of his childtobe the widow who lived in this house might be angry at him for stealing her property but the worst that would happen would be that she would summon the village constable and the constable was a man with a family himself there might be a punishment the stocks perhaps but everyone in the village knew about pregnant women and their cravings and the punishment wouldnt be harsh surely the tradition demanded a dramatic entrance and elena obliged so she cried in a cold voice stepping out of the darkness in a flash of greenish light thief while she wore the widows face she also wore the sweeping black gown and winglike cape that the sorceress had worn the cape streaming out behind her in a selfcreated wind rosalies husband dropped to his knees his face transfixed with terror the plants falling from his hands he might not have been very clever but he was brave he might have blamed rosalie but the explanation he babbled out held no touch of accusation for his wife in fact he begged only for mercy because rosalie was with child and would need him he said nothing of her craving for the magical rampion there was no doubt in elenas mind at that moment why rosalie loved this man who would willingly sacrifice himself to save her but the tradition had a certain momentum of its own and it demanded the child she felt it impelling her on well she already knew what she would do about this the tradition demanded that this child become a part of one of its tales very well she would give it a tale a different tale not ladderlocks you will take me to your wife she decreed sternly you have stolen my property there must be restitution and there must be punishment i know that your wifes hunger for my plants brought you here she must pay as well as you he no less than she was impelled by the weight of the tradition he could not have disobeyed her if he had been possessed of a stronger will and more wits than he actually owned as if he was sleepwalking he rose his face a mask of despair he led her to his little home the lovely garden now shrouded in snow the lights of their home streaming out into the darkness from the open door rosalie now heavily pregnant stood in the doorway she was expecting this and praying that the woman who followed her tooloving husband was elena not a stranger still the tradition demanded this child and in that it was too strong even for a godmother like bella to withstand so the child would be elenas to do with as she pleased in that much the tradition would be obeyed the man stopped and elena pushed past him imperious and unstoppable come she said coldly and head hanging he obeyed one month later elena stood again in rosalies cottage this time to look down into the face of a tiny baby elena had seen her share of newborns over the years and most infants looked like wizened redfaced old men with sour dispositions this child was enchanting with a perfect little pink rosebud of a face and wide blue eyes that stared blankly up at the apprentice this only made her feel terribly guilty about what she was going to do next im sorry she murmured then took a hard dried pea jamming it with her thumb into one of the babys tender little buttocks whispering a spell that she knew was going to bring pain until the infants face crumpled and the mouth opened in a wail of discomfort elena instantly left off torturing the poor little mite and after making certain that the offending pea was going to leave a satisfactorily livid bruise handed the baby back to her mother and she felt the power shift again the pea in her hand became oddly heavy and when she dropped it into the little silver casket she had brought it nestled into the velvet like a jewel the tradition felt what she had done and had begun to alter its impetus and even as elena stood there she could see the glowing drifts of power leaving rosalie and beginning a slow circling spiral towards the baby thats all rosalie whispered bouncing the baby and hushing her with kisses and petting thats all elena replied then added as she had to for now youll lose her when she turns sixteen of course it was almost as cruel a fate in a way but rosalie sighed and bent her head over the baby she probably thought that elena couldnt see that she had wiped a tear away surreptitiously it could be so much worse and we would lose her to a husband anyway eventually but it was clear that rosalie was only waiting for elena to leave to break down weeping who could blame her hearing that you will lose your child after only sixteen short years is never easy but it could have been so much worse she could have had clarissa snatched out of her arms to be locked away from her forever elena left quickly she could not bear to be here a moment longer there was relief in this little cottage but there was pain as well when little clarissa turned sixteen something would happen to her that would mean that her parents could never see her again except at a distance and that was a hard thing for a mother to learn besides she had another journey to make and she had borrowed the help of sergei the little humpback horse she wouldnt keep him standing about waiting any longer than she had to he stood in the traces of the gaily painted cart shaking his head sadly he knew what she had been forced to do in order to avert the greater tragedy of the birth of a ladderlocks child this is a sad thing he said and elenas dragonsblood gift of the speech of animals allowed her to understand him as she had not been able to the last time she had seen him to have your child for only sixteen years or to know that she is the cause of many deaths elena replied climbing into the cart do you know how many young men died to save the last ladderlocks it is hard to weigh sorrow against sorrow and i fear you have made the only possible choice the horse agreed but i cannot like it her grief pulls at my heart come let us be gone from this place he looked back over his shoulder at the cottage and his skin shivered all over it is better not to linger he took off at a trot once beyond sight of the village he rose into the air taking the cart and elena with him now she was prepared for the ascent well as prepared as anyone could be she clutched the wood of the seat as her heart jumped right into her throat she clenched her eyes tight shut but then decided that she had to face this some time and opened them again the ground was not very far away the horse was just skimming the tops of the trees this time in fact he was using the trees to hide their progress from below you ought to put the disguise on he called over his shoulder no one will be surprised to see a godmother flying in a magical sleigh she blinked bella was right the horse was exceedingly clever she summoned power from within her and pulling her wand from the pocket of her gown pulled the power into a shape it drifted just above them a glowing cloud that only she and the horse could see with a shudder of effort she pulled it down to cover both of them it settled over the horse the cart and her and obscured them for just a moment then as he ran on across the treetops he became a snowwhite stallion and the cart transmuted into a silver sleigh overflowing with furs ha said the horse now thats more like it he didnt rise much more than a foot or so higher though which made elena feel very much better this she could cope with shed climbed all manner of things as a child before madame klovis arrived to blight her life trees clock towers up onto the roof of the house this wasnt much higher than that this she could cope with the tradition demanded a tale it demanded a tale that had at least a modicum of tragedy about it and it demanded a tale in which the ending made a princess of a peasant there was only one path that elena had been able to think of that matched those demands she was on her way now to meet madame bella to establish the second half of the tales beginnings she was in fact on the way to a place she had not really expected to ever see again the royal palace of otraria where king colin and queen sophia were meeting with the godmother who had brought them together bella was the only possible person to explain all this to them they trusted her as they did not yet trust her apprentice and no wonder if it had not been for bella the princess now the queen would still be pining away in her room unable even to smile and colin would still be a gooseboy elena was already dressed for the occasion and not merely as bellas apprentice this time but in the full formal garb of a godmother when visiting royalty from the tiara of rosebuds carved from pink crystal in her powdered wig to the same crystal rosebuds set into the silver buckles of her highheeled pink satin slippers she was garbed as madames equal and counterpart in a pink that favored her coloring rather than the lilac that favored madames wrapped in an ermine mantel her hands in a matching muff she had probably been an odd sight sitting on the benchseat of that little painted cart rosalie had been too overcome with emotion to really pay any attention to what the apprentice was wearing or perhaps she would have been more than a bit overawed they landed well outside the city and the horse paused on the road for just a moment he looked over his shoulder again while she caught her breath and added a little more power to the spell making the changes real solid tangible she very much wanted tangible she wanted those furs tucked in around her in this state she drove to the palace and had the rare privilege of seeing people she knew both well and only slightly gaping at her with a total lack of recognition no one saw ella cinders in the fancifully arrayed godmother but it was clear from the startled gazes and the sudden deference that the people she passed knew exactly what she was in a way she enjoyed it and in a way it was rather sad for the first time she felt the widening gulf between her and the people she had grown up among she had always been lonely but now she felt alone the sleigh glided past the klovis house which was still unoccupied and elena had the melancholy satisfaction of seeing that someone perhaps the creditors had actually begun the process of dismantling it the slate roof was half gone and the stone wall down to no more than knee high she suspected that the elegant paneling had been stripped away by now and any of the builtin furnishings taken out first of all when madame klovis reappeared she would have a great deal more to worry about than her missing stepdaughter what did they think those people who were taking the house apart bit by bit did they ever wonder what had become of the missing elena or had she dropped out of their minds relegated to some unimportant corner of their memories oh elena klovis ella cinders you mean dunno went to the mop fair after madame did the runner never saw her again suppose she mustve hired out after all the horse brought the sleigh neatly to the steps of the palace a footman hurried to help her alight and she descended from the sleigh in a swirl of pink silk and white fur she climbed the steps the silverheeled slippers she wore clicking with every pace two footmen sprang to hold the brassbound door open for her as soon as she was inside her mantel was taken by another servant stationed just inside the door and she was conducted immediately by a fourth footman to a small goldandwhite audience chamber where as she had expected madame was waiting with the king and queen what she had not expected was that the queen would immediately throw herself at elenas feet and seize her hand covering it with grateful kisses and tears queen sophia please elena cried trying to raise the weeping woman to her feet what in heavens name our godmother decided to do a divination on what would have happened if wed played unwitting host to the ladderlocks child in otraria said king colin whitefaced it seems that our son would have been the first to die at the hands of the sorceress who held her captive for a moment elena really did not understand what had just been told to her then when the meaning struck home she looked to madame bella who nodded slightly blessed saints she whispered feeling as if she had been hit with a deluge of cold water i had no idea it only occurred to me that the prince was the right age to be the babys suitor when she turned sixteen and that he was near enough to encounter her by chance perhaps when out hunting except that the chance would not have been chance at all the tradition would impel the boy who would be a handsome young man by then towards the girl as steel was drawn towards a lodestone the moment she turned sixteen it would be inevitable in fact in either scenario the ladderlocks or the tender princess that attraction would have taken place but the ladderlocks would have killed him it seemed when she turned sixteen even if she was a ladderlocks she faltered but she would not have been rescued until she was eighteen madame bella said quietly and before then the sorceress would have battened on the potential power of well far too many young men who died trying to bring the girl away for the tradition did that throwing questers at the quest even if they died of it until one of them achieved it the power it invested in them would go to the nearest magician who was ruthless enough to take it that was why the dark ones went along with the tradition they could batten on the power inherent in those who failed for as long as they could keep the task so difficult that there would be plenty of failures and our dear son would have been the first the queen had risen gracefully to her feet at last and dabbed at her tearstreaked face with a dainty laceedged bit of linen if you had not had the wit and the will to turn the infants tale from one course to another and at that reminder elena hastily brought out the tiny silver casket in which resided the perfectly ordinary looking dried pea she pressed it into the queens hands and there it was that strange feeling of something looming then as suddenly settling turning away as if a mountain had silently rotated to face a new direction or an avalanche decided that it would fall some other day the path was altered there you are elena said seeing from bellas expression that she too had felt the change keep it safe and when in sixteen years your son brings home a beauteous young woman and your courtiers demand proof that she is worthy to become their next queen place this beneath a pile of twenty mattresses and announce that this will be the test to prove that she is of royal blood for only a princess born would be tender enough to feel a pea beneath so much padding we will colin pledged taking possession of the casket and until then it will reside in the treasury elena felt a little dizzy now with the effort she had expended in resetting the course of the tale and let madame do all of the talking after that not that there was much of it even kings and queens did not engage in idle chat with one godmother much less two it had occurred to elena and more than once that people were happy to see a godmother when there was trouble brewing but as soon as the trouble had been sorted they were just as happy to see the godmother go she wondered if that was the case with all magicians perhaps it is even the case with heroes nevertheless though king colin and queen sophia were far too polite to make it obvious that bella and elena made them uncomfortable the uncomfortable pauses began to stretch into uncomfortable silences and at that point madame very gracefully stood up and took her leave very shortly after that elena and bella were bundled up together in the sleigh and the sleigh itself was soaring over the treetops on the way home oh heavens elena said then inexplicably felt herself bursting into tears bella gathered her against her shoulder there now she soothed its all over youve given rosalie a daughter to raise youve saved colins son from death youve eliminated a ladderlocks and well ive done something a bit naughty while you were dealing with rosalie i had arachnia discharge some of her misgotten power by further enchanting our sorceress and locking her up asleep inside a ring of fire in a cave it will take a hero to get past the fire and wake her and there is quite a warning carved into the rock bed she is lying on maybe if she sleeps for a hundred years or so shell wake up in a better frame of mind and if she doesnt asked elena through her tears bella shrugged elena felt her shoulder move she wont be our problem anymore shell be the heros her ironic tone of voice startled a shaky laugh out of elena who pulled a handkerchief of her own out of a pocket and wiped her face with it this is horrible though were taking one womans daughter away once shes sixteen which i think is too young to marry were turning a poor bewildered peasant girl who will barely have seen a knife fork and spoon at place settings together and imprisoning her in that golden cage of manners and the tradition is going to make her wed a man she wont ever have seen before rosalie will have her daughter for as long as most women do bella pointed out reasonably as the horse increased his pace and the height they were flying at the girl would probably have married as young as fifteen otherwise most peasant girls wed early colin knows very well what it is like to be a peasant in a kings court and he will see to it that no one is unkind to her while he has teachers show her how to behave and last of all even if she remained with rosalie she still could have wound up in an arranged marriage with someone she didnt know elena blotted her eyes and had to admit the justice of madame bellas words most of them anyway but marrying a man she doesnt know the tradition will ensure that she falls in love with him directly when she sees him bella replied patting her hand soothingly as the horse tossed his head and whickered agreement colin and sophia are raising a wellgrounded boy i believe that clarissa will remain as much in love with her prince as colin and sophia have with each other eleven years between their ages is no worse than most royal marriages and a great deal better than many maybe but elena began so what have we possibly done that is wrong madame asked i dont know but we did the best we could on that point at least elena was sure she looked out over the head of the horse and saw that they were approaching the cottage she had never been so glad to see a place in her life she could talk this over with randolf he would understand she could have a good meal and rose and lily could talk of small things and she could forget the cruel fates that the tradition forced on people the sleigh touched down with a bump on the snow and drew up to the front door madame patted her hand and there you are that is all we can do we magicians the best we can i think youre ready now she was halfway out of the sleigh before she realized what madame had said ready ready good heavens surely not but both her feet were already on the ground before she could clamber back in the horse tossed his head and the sleigh moved off madame she cried desperately panic overwhelming her madame bella please come back you cant im not you are as ready as i was madame called over her shoulder and the sleigh rose into the sky over the treetops and vanished among the clouds leaving her standing on what was now her doorstep now the godmother of some seven kingdoms and she had never felt more alone or been more terrified in her life chapter deep in the middle of decanting a tincture elena heard the sound of something crunching in the garden just outside the window of the stillroom crunching was not the sort of sound you wanted to hear coming from the kitchen garden she looked up already prepared to yell at whatever was out there she was not sure just what it would be there was supposed to be a barrier that kept things like rabbits and deer out but sometimes the spells failed and such spells did nothing to keep out other visitors some of whom seemed to be of the opinion that the garden had been planted for their benefit there was a unicorn in the garden eating the new peas daintily taking each pod and munching them up between his strong white teeth with every evidence of enjoyment elena thrust her head out of the window indignantly you she shouted at him shoo i put out an entire flower bed of lilies for you lot go eat those the unicorn looked up and focused his attention on her then went crosseyed with the immediate onset of the stupefied devotion every unicorn was overcome by when in the presence of a virgin his big brown eyes misted over his ears swiveled towards her and his ivory horn began to glow with magic unicorns like the fair folk were practically made of magic elena made a note to ask one of the mares later if the stallions who kept coming around would be willing to allow her to siphon some of it off if they were going to plague her and eat her garden the least they could do was to contribute to the cause so to speak it was no use asking the stallions of course they went entirely idiotic at the sight of her the mares went idiotic too of course but only for virgin boys fortunately those were in even shorter supply than virgin girls dont like lilies he said absently around a mouthful of pods he had forgotten to chew the moment he spotted her half chewed pods fell out of his mouth as he spoke he had of course also forgotten that he was supposed to look noble like peas well i dont care she snapped in irritation youll eat the lilies and youll learn to like them ah the unicorn replied then dreamily turned and looked at the bed of pastel lilies on the edge of the garden he turned his bearded head back to look at her if i eat the lilies may i lay my head in your lap no you may not she began then at the sight of his ears drooping with dejection changed her mind she could spare a minute or two oh all right the unicorns head and ears came up and his tufted tail flagged he trotted over to the lily bed and began eating with unbridled well of course unbridled enthusiasm a unicorn would do just about anything that a virgin asked of him elena finished her potions and dried her hands before going out into the garden with a feeling of resignation this was the fourteenth unicorn loitering about eating up the garden this spring the first one had taken her breath away and it was only after an entire afternoon spent petting him that she realized that he had destroyed the roses shed been warier at the second she was getting tired of them now why had there never been unicorns when madame bella was the godmother here maybe because she didnt qualify as a unicorn extractor as soon as she sat down on the wooden seat that robin and lily had fitted around the trunk of the apple tree the unicorn knelt at her side and his head dropped into her lap his round brown eyes gazing up at her soulfully with a sigh she stroked his head and scratched behind his ears while he moaned in ecstasy shouldnt you be making those sort of noises at a mate she asked crossly what was it about virgins that made them go so idiotic not until autumn godmother the unicorn replied shivering all over at her touch oh uh i was sent im supposed to tell you something she waited still scratching unicorns were not the brightest of beasts at the best of times they tended to remind her of highly inbred lapdogs to tell the truth all beauty and no brains there was no point in rushing him while the stray thought fluttered around in his thick skull like a butterfly in a box and he tried to catch it at least once you told one something he never forgot it it might take him a while to remember what it was but he never actually forgot it questers he said at last in phaelins wood for the glass mountain three princes they came just after karelina left theres no one there to guide and test them ah that explained why he was here shed had a message yesterday morning by way of randolf that the witch of phaelins wood was off attending to a difficult birth that had a lot of traditional potential behind it twins if you please which meant that someone had to be there not only to make sure that mother and babies survived the birth but to figure out just what the tradition was going to try to do with them karelina had the same problem with unicorns that elena had she too had a mirrorslave inherited from her grandmother the previous witch and she had sent a message by way of randolf this morning that she was going to be out of her wood for a while well this meant that no one would be able to meet the questers at the crossroads and test them unless elena took the task herself did karelina send you she asked karelina might be away from her mirror but she was never far from a unicorn the unicorn gave another faint moan of pleasure but answered sensibly enough yes we came and told her that they had gone in and she sent me to you shes put the tanglefoot on their path until you can get to the crossroads the tanglefoot spell would make sure that all three of the questers would travel in circles without realizing it and without meeting each other until elena got into place small wonder that the woods that questers entered always seemed to be much bigger than they had thought at least in this case she was going to have no crisis of conscience over the quest king stancia of fleurberg had only one child a daughter and he was old he was understandably concerned that the husband she took be clever intelligent and kind as well as strong ironwilled and tough because he knew that he was probably not going to be around for very much longer to protect her from the consequences of a bad choice he had a great many neighbors most of whom had several sons and he also wanted to be sure that whoever wedded his daughter would rule his kingdom as stancia would have wanted so he had obtained the services of a powerful sorcerer and placed her in a tower atop a mountain the mountain wasnt really glass or at least it wasnt manmade glass and the tower was hardly a place of imprisonment the mountain was volcanic there were obsidian boulders and shards everywhere and it would take a very strong man with immense stamina merely to endure the path to the top to complicate matters further there were many tests and trials for anyone who wanted to earn the reward of her hand and throne as for the tower it was the sorcerers own home and the princess was by all reports having a delightful time exploring it the king and the sorcerer had been very careful in deciding what trials the questers would face unless a man was very stupid or exceedingly stubborn there was no chance that anyone would actually die along the way not unless he kept trying until he perished of exhaustion or did something monumentally foolish everyone understood the tradition in this case and making it work for them the sorcerer had a great many truly dreadful tests of courage intelligence quickthinking and so forth set up once the questers set foot on his mountain but the first of these trials was the simplest and it weeded out any seeker who was not kind generous and unselfish there were at least a dozen magicians who were tasked to provide this particular test and for once it was something that elena had no second thoughts in agreeing to not now and not when she had first heard of the quest she gave the unicorn one last scratch and pushed his head out of her lap gently all right she said the sooner i get on my way the sooner i get this over with and you cant lie here in my lap all day either now shoo the unicorn heaved a final sorrowful sigh got to his feet cast a last longing look at her and slipped off into the forest elena stood looking after him for a moment shaking her head unicorns she said to nobody at all im not surprised theyre easy to hunt its a good thing for them that the bait is so hard to find then she went back into the cottage to get her stoutest walking shoes and a staff poor old dobbin had finally dropped dead of extreme old age last february and she still hadnt replaced him so she was going to have to get to where she needed to go by walking well sort of she pulled out her wand the simple one today anything else would be drastically outofcharacter for the old peasant woman that she was going to appear to be she released a tiny packet of power and sent it into the path ahead of her concentrating on where she was now and where she wanted to be the crossroads in the middle of phaelins wood which would be where she would meet and test the questers she held up her staff shorten my way please she told the path the glowing power circled over her head like a swarm of tiny starbees then dropped down and zoomed down the path out of sight in a moment the forest became very still for a moment and then she felt the path shiver beneath her feet and braced herself she knew what was coming she hadnt necessarily expected this but this was a forest that the fair folk as well as many other magical creatures lived in and when that happened even inanimate objects and bits of landscape could take on a life of their own the path rose up about a foot beneath her and suddenly began to move shed done this before when bella was still the godmother she remained perfectly still but the path was carrying her along on top of a little mound at a pace that a horse would be hard put to equal the last time shed cast the wayshortening spell the path hadnt moved but every step shed taken had covered a dozen yards and the time before that shed apparently reawakened the remnants of an all forests are one spell because she just strolled down the path a few yards and found herself where she wanted to be it was a chancy thing living in a magical forest things tended to get minds of their own not long after bella turned over the position to elena one of the few true fairy godmothers had paid a call and had told elena that the cottage and the forest had once been the home of another of the original fairy godmothers and had hinted that this uncanny semiintelligence of the very forest itself was a common thing where the fair folk dwelled elena had not precisely gotten used to it but she was no longer surprised by what happened she had also taken to saying please and thank you when the forest responded with something to help her anything that allowed her to conserve power was a fine thing and if the forest was going to help her she was willing to let it help her in its own way bella had never stood for that sort of thing when shed cast a spell she byheaven wanted the same spell to do the same thing every time and no freewill nonsense but that took a lot more power and perhaps because of coming from a childhood where the next meal was not taken for granted elena did not feel at all comfortable with simply using all the power that was available to her instead her style was to use the minimum possible to get the result she wanted and if the means to that result was a bit unnerving now and again well that was the chance she was willing to take elena leaned forward a little into the wind created by her passing and the path responded by speeding up still more she hoped that there was no one else actually on this path if she came up on them before they had a chance to get out of the way theyd be bowled over like tenpins as it was there were half a dozen small animals left scattered to the right and left of the path in her wake still it was a novel form of transportation and peculiarly enjoyable like running but without the effort she was almost disappointed when she felt the path begin to slow recognized the landmarks and knew she was nearly at journeys end the path dropped her gently where the road that would ultimately lead out of otraria crossed the one that led to the kingdom of kohlstania and kohlstania was presumably where the three princes were coming from elena stepped out into the road and sat down on a stone at the crossroads taking a little book out of her pocket now this was a very useful bit of conjury that she had worked out for herself and she was terribly proud of it working with the spell that allowed a godmother or other powerful magician to copy his or her chronicles to the libraries of other magicians this little book was able to repeat what was on the pages of every other book in her library if she knew what to ask for she opened the blank pages waved the head of her staff over them and let a little sparkle of power drift down over them the current royal family of kohlstania please she ordered something appeared like blurred writing beneath a smudge a moment later the writing resolved itself and so did the smudge and she saw an image of the stern visage of a man who appeared to have never laughed in his life king henrick of kohlstania read the caption beneath the picture widower three sons yes those would be the questers has held the throne for twentyseven years took the crown in she skipped the rest and moved on to the next page three more smudges resolved into three more drawings three young men octavian alexander julian well it was easy enough to see where this tale was going octavian and alexander looked like hard uncompromising men formed in the image of their stern father julian however must have taken after the nowgone mother while no one could possibly say that he looked soft he certainly looked softer and there was a very gentle and humorous look to his eyes that elena liked quite a bit laws attitude and recent history in kohlstania regarding magic magicians and godmothers please she said aloud and the pages filled with notations she read through it all swiftly nothing there to be particularly concerned about although there had not been any magical intervention in a major way in the kingdom for three generations there was in fact no one alive there who had any experience of any magician more powerful than a witch much less a godmother and witches and hedgewizards were creatures that the countryfolk depended on not citydwellers and certainly not the upper crust of nobility for the king and his family magic was probably a thing of nurserytales and this did not seem like a family in which nurserytales were encouraged on the whole that was not a bad thing at all it meant that none of the young men would even guess she was testing them she closed the book and put it back in her pocket now because elena liked to conserve power as much as possible she had a number of clever ways to do things using a minimum of magic that bella would have accomplished with several spells and the next item she pulled from her pocket was a false nose it was a particularly beaky object carved and colored by robin and held onto her face by means of two pink ribbons that tied in the back ludicrous one might say until she put it on for the nose was ensorcelled with a spell of illusion whoever put it on would appear as an old crone or an old man in this way elena only ever had to cast one disguise spell thus conserving her power and allowing her to disguise other people as well if there was need she was rather proud of herself for coming up with such a thing she tied on her false nose over her real one and although she felt no differently anyone looking at her would have seen a bent and feeble old woman with a great beak of a nose and a dowagers hump her hair had gone from golden to white as snowdrops her face was a mass of wrinkles and her hands were spotted with age although she was standing straight she would appear to have a dowagers hump and her clothing aged just as she had the colors faded the seams took on the look of having been unpicked and resewn as the cloth was turned and turned again and the hems looked tattered now she was ready she looked down at the crossroads at her feet there were conventions that any witch would have followed the more especially when she knew that someone else would have to take up the task in her place karelina had as expected cast the tanglefoot spell from this very crossroads there were three threads to the skein one for each prince ending in a knot practically at her feet she took her staff and touched it to the knot tradition must be served eldest must be tested first octavian she said aloud and a little spark of power jumped from the wand and ran down the thread to release him from the spell and bring him to her prince alexander of kohlstania was hot thirsty and exasperated it was quite bad enough that he found himself on this ridiculous quest though he could certainly understand his royal fathers reasoning but to have been wandering in this stupid forest for days was outside of enough now he was sorry he had ever agreed to this but i had to he reminded himself all of kohlstanias immediate neighbors were if not allies at least not overtly hostile but king henrick had not held his throne for this long by being naive king stancia did not particularly care about the politics of the man who would win his daughter and his throne so long as that man would treat daughter and country alike with care and gentleness how he treated his neighbors did not matter a whit to stancia although he certainly would never actually come out and admit that father is right we cant just sit by and hope that whoever won the girl would follow stancias policies king henrick could not take the chance that some enemy would win girl and country and then proceed to sit on kohlstanias border and cast covetous eyes on what henrick ruled as well stancias land was prosperous and could easily afford to field a large army this would never do he had gathered his three sons before him the moment that he got the messenger from stancia throwing open the contest to any and all comers you will go to fleurberg and one of you will conquer this socalled glass mountain and win and wed the girl he ordered if it is you octavian all to the good we can unite the kingdoms into one if it is you alexander that will be excellent too since it will give you a kingdom of your own if it is you julian which may i add i do not anticipate he had cast a jaundiced eye on his youngest son then at least we will be spared having to try to find something for you to do with your life alexander also understood why his father had given his youngest son such a poisonous look julian was considered by the king and by his eldest brother to be a fool and a dreamer alexander nearer in age to julian was not so sure of that but he doubted whether julian had the necessary abilities to go through whatever tests stancia was going to put in front of them most likely he would be eliminated at the first poor julian he seemed content enough with his lot but alexander wondered sometimes if it was all a facade but maybe he simply didnt have any ambition at all and was perfectly happy with his books and his horses octavian had been the first out of the gates somewhat to alexanders chagrin he would have thought that being heir to one kingdom was enough but apparently not with the prospect of not one but two kingdoms within his grasp one of which he would not have to wait for or at least not very long since stancia was well over sixty octavian had ordered up his provisioning and been in the saddle within an hour alexander had taken longer he hadnt left until later that afternoon for he had been taking careful consideration of what he should and should not pack and had decided to forego speed for preparation he had a packhorse tied to the back of the saddle of his destrier he did not intend to fail one of the tests because he lacked say fifty feet of rope or a stormlantern that the wind could not blow out when he had left julian was still not ready and oddly enough he seemed to be taking as little as octavian furthermore he wasnt taking any armor and in fact was carrying little more than his sword and a bow by way of weapons for a moment alexander had considered staying long enough to advise him but he shrugged the impulse off octavian would probably fail this quest for lack of preparation well and good he was the heir and he already had his kingdom guaranteed julian would fail because of foolishness and too bad for him well and good that would get him out of alexanders way he had trotted off on his best warhorse in a very positive frame of mind this quest should cause him no great difficulty he was prepared for every possible eventuality he was the one after all who had been sent to military school and had learned everything there was to know about tactics and campaigns octavian though the elder could not best him on that score and octavians haste and greed would probably be his undoing not that he blamed octavian their royal father showed no signs of shuffling off the mortal coil any time in the near future and octavian was not the sort of fellow to enjoy sitting about kicking his heels as the kinginwaiting not that any of them wanted the king to die or at least alexander didnt think either of the others did but it was hard to be trained to rule but not actually get a chance to do so as for alexander he had long ago resigned himself to playing commanderinchief to the army of kohlstania under his brothers rule for the rest of his life he wanted a kingdom of his own and although he would rather it had come without the need to marry some brainless bit of fluff probably spoiled into uselessness by her father he would put up with the girl to get the throne this opportunity was not going to slip through his fingers princesses and thrones for the taking were not presented to one on a platter every day even if one was a prince himself he thought that he would be generous once he had won and find julian some pretty young heiress to marry once he had settled into the position he liked julian well enough certainly more than octavian did and julian would be much more comfortable in alexanders court than in octavians and far more comfortable than under fathers eye he had been full of these plans right up until he got well into these cursed woods and found the first night falling without any sign that he was going to get out of them before darkness fell and without any sign that octavian was on the road ahead of him either though initially that didnt worry him as much as the coming of darkness of course he had made camp an excellent camp long before the last of the twilight had faded and because he had made careful provisioning he had not gone hungry or cold either but he had gone to sleep seriously concerned for where was octavian he had a map of course and a compass so he could not be lost and at any rate the road simply didnt branch at all until it came to a marked crossroads therefore octavian must have somehow strayed off the road unlikely though that seemed there was of course the possibility that he could have been waylaid but alexander had interrogated peasants outside the woods very carefully before he went in and they had all assured him that there were no bandit bands living in phaelins wood there might they said be a robber or two but there were no groups of outlaws and no single robber could have overcome octavian even octavian only lightly armed besides there had been no sign of a struggle anywhere octavian would never have given up without a fight he had gone to sleep still worrying over the problem and not really even thinking about the fact that this wood which he should have crossed in a few hours was still all around him however the longer he traveled the next day the more he began to think that there was something more going on than met the eye he had certainly been thinking about that very problem when he camped for the second night he had gotten out his map and compass at first light and gone over them and then his irritation had only increased the road on the map ran straight and true right to a crossroads in the middle of the wood the road he had been following had twisted and turned like a snake in its deaththroes the road on the map represented a journey of no more than half a day to cross the wood entirely he had been here for two days now and there was still no sign of the crossroads which left only one answer and it wasnt that he was lost magic he said aloud savagely someone was plaguing him with some sort of magical impediment he did not like magic it was not logical it was not ordered and any sort of riffraff could use it it might have been a very useful weapon in war but the trouble was the only time that the socalled good magicians would consent to do such a thing was when you were fighting against an evil magician you could employ an evil magician of course but you could never trust him not to turn on you and anyway the moment you made use of such a tool every good magician for hundreds of leagues around would come fight for your enemies because you were using an evil magician and then there were the other things that were associated with magic beasts and birds and things that were neither people who did not answer to any laws that he recognized and could not be depended upon to act logically he didnt like any of them when you fought a man you should be able to use straightforward tactics on him and not have to wonder if he was going to set fire to you when you met a woman you should be able to tell at a glance what her station in life was and know what to expect from her and not have to wonder if she would seduce you or let you think you were seducing her and then wake up turned into a pig no he did not like magic at all and if this was king stancias idea of a good first test it might well be too hed heard a rumor that stancia had got the aid of a sorcerer in setting up this quest sorcerers had a habit of showing complete disregard for such niceties as borders the sorcerer might think it amusing to set the first test in phaelins wood on the kohlstania side of the border the more he thought about it the angrier he became he packed up his camp seething and mounted his destrier in a foul mood magic it might as well be cheating wretched magicians stupid senile old men who depended on them well he would show them from now on he would depend on his compass and not the map if he had to cut his own road to do so he took his compass out of the saddlebag and opened the case with a smirk that swiftly turned to a teethclenched frown for the compass needle was spinning merrily with no sign that it intended to stop magic elena waited sitting on a rock in the concealment of a dense clump of birchsaplings just before the crossroads she had the advantage that the crossroads itself was on the far side of a relatively cleared space in the forest she was able to get a good long look at the questers as they emerged from the denser growth the first prince octavian approached on a great bay warhorse looking rather the worse for two nights spent in the forest he was wearing light armor but he didnt seem to have a great deal of kit about him and it showed in his appearance from the look of him moving stiffly dark circles under his eyes twigs in his hair hed spent both nights on the ground under the stars with his saddle for a pillow all three boys had reminded her of animals actually julian an amiable hound and alexander an arrogant and rather sleek fox this one was the gruff wolf and the resemblance was only heightened by his state she waited on her rock quietly to see if hed notice her she saw his eyes flicker towards her then saw just as clearly that he dismissed her as unimportant oh yes do that she waited until he was just passing her before speaking up have ye a crust of bread milord she whined theyve turned me out as too old to work and im perishing of hunger he ignored her she raised her voice please milord please good sir nothing now at this point he could have stopped offered her something and asked for directions she would have given them to him she would not have told him the keys to the puzzles that the sorcerer was going to set him but at least he would have gotten to the glass mountain he did neither he rode on as if she was of no more importance than a beetle fine she thought and touched her staff to the path again as he rode out of sight under the trees twist me and turn me and bring me to grief muddle my pathway and give no relief send me to wander a month and a day give me no guidance and keep me astray then when a month and a day will have sped if i am kinder and my prides been shed then send me on homeward but if im too high then keep me astray till a year has gone by there that would take care of him hed stumble along in phaelins wood and possibly several others if karelina decided to invoke the all forests are one spell against him when she got back and hed do so while his provisions ran out spring thunderstorms deluged him and every possible minor disaster that could would arise to plague him after a month and a day of this if hed learned his lesson hed finally come out of the wood right where he went in if he was smart he would go home again if he wasnt well karelina would have to decide what to do with him hopefully he would come out a humbler and wiser man than hed been when he went in a mere month because otherwise hed be stumbling around for the next year smiling to herself she touched her staff to the path again on the knot representing the tanglefoot spell alexander she told it and the spark of power leaped from the wand and raced down the tangled skein of the spell it was not more than an hour later that she heard hoofbeats on the road and saw her quarry approaching and she had to give him a few points for preparation anyway unlike his brother he not only was fully armed but he had a packhorse laden with armor and apparently quite a bit of other luggage as well from the look of things he had not been spending his last two nights huddled next to a pathetic little fire she hid behind her sapling screen and waited to get a good look at him before he could see her elena parted the branches of the birches and peered through them as the sound of hooves on the path stopped and there he was framed by two of the saplings looking exactly as he had when shed seen him in the book he had stopped at the edge of the clearing that held the crossroads frowning truth to tell she hadnt paid a lot of attention to his appearance other than to make sure she wouldnt mistake him for some other princeerrant or one of his two brothers now as he paused staring at the crossroads his frown turning into a scowl as he tried to make up his mind which way to go she studied him and she didnt much care for what she saw not that he wasnt handsome enough he was all of that his wavy brown hair thick and shining fell down past his shoulders giving him a very romantic appearance especially combined with the rakish tilt of his cap and the fact that he was much better groomed than his older brother of course part of that was due to the fact that he hadnt been sleeping in the open but still vain she thought to herself cynically ive never yet seen a longhaired man who wasnt a popinjay and cleanshaven too he must spend as much time in his valets hands as any primping girl as for his face square chin chiseled cheekbones broad brow well it was shapely enough even if his nose was entirely too aquiline to suit her he could plow a field with that nose but the regular features were spoiled entirely by the unpleasant frown and the furrowed brow and the air of unbending rigidity about him that together with a tunic that managed to suggest a military uniform without actually being one made her think that this was a man for whom there was always and for everything one right way from which he would never deviate even when it was wrong well this isnt going to be much fun she thought with resignation and with a sigh steeling herself for unpleasantness she stepped out onto the path if the tradition held true to form the first prince had been merely rude and haughty this one would be haughty and rude and arrogant and aggressive his frown deepened the moment he saw her if that was possible what was more he added suspicion to the emotions of irritation and arrogance on his face suspicion what could he possibly suspect her of have ye a crust of bread to spare good milord she quavered holding empty hands out towards him theyve i have naught to spare he interrupted get from my path old hag well not that shed expected politeness but that really was more than a bit much still she kept hold of her temper reminding herself that she was the tester here and she could make sure he got sent down an even longer path to wander than his brother but milord she whined pathetically theyve turned me off as too old to work and im then find work or die he said now turning his frown away from her and looking about as if trying to find something that might be hidden those who cannot work will not be fed well have no beggars here you wretched little once again she caught hold of her temper but something like this could not go unpunished and wandering around for a month or even a year was not going to teach this arrogant lad what he needed to learn no this was something that needed a more imaginative punishment still she would give him one more chance but if he failed this time she was going to take his lessoning into her own hands but can you he ignored her as his brother had instead he touched the spur to his horses flank and rode straight at her at a canter so she had to scramble out of his way or be run down now she was angry what if she had been a poor old woman she could have been hurt or even killed what right had he to run people over as if they were nothing oh that tore it as he passed she whirled and took her staff in both hands you she cried out in her own voice pointing it at him startled by the change in her voice he pulled up his horse and turned in his saddle to stare at her she did not bother with a rhyme this time the force of her anger was more than enough to shape the power she aimed her staff at him like an accusation you are as illmannered as stubborn and as stupid as an ass she shouted so be one the power exploded out of her coursed down her arm and shot from her staff in a stream of redgold light if hed had eyes to see it hed have been terrified it hit him full on covered him enveloped him in a single moment hiding him from sight inside a great globe of light that held him and the horse he was riding on he cried out in fear though as he felt it take him and in the next moment the cries changed deepened and hoarsened the globe pulsed once twice and on the third time there was another flash of light there were three beasts on the path now not two a great bewildered warhorse the packhorse tied to its saddle and and a donkey standing petrified all four hooves splayed still trying to wheeze out a terrified bray hah she said looking at him with satisfaction i need a donkey youll do he was clearly in a great deal of shock too much so to move though likely if he had tried hed have fallen to the ground for he was not used to moving on four feet instead of two she had plenty of time to rummage through his packs find the rope she was sure was in there and fashion a crude nosepinch halter and chokerope and get it on him before he even began to react to his muchchanged situation and by the time he did she had him right where she wanted him if he tried to rear she could choke him at the neck if he tried to bite she could pinch off his nose and choke his breathing from that end he tried both not once but several times until she finally picked up her staff and pointed it at him again he froze you will behave she told him or ill take your horse instead of you and turn you into a frog at that his ears flattened against his head but it was clear he didnt doubt either her ability or her willingness to do so instead he allowed her to lead him stumbling into the cover of some bushes and tether him there the horses beside him she wasnt going to take any chances though she used more of the rope for hobbles and tethered all four feet she waited until she was back on the road before she took a deep breath paused and steadied herself she was still angry with him and that was no mood to be in to test the last of the princes she counted to ten twice took another deep breath and let the anger run out of her when she was sure she was steady again she shook herself all over and took her staff in hand besides this would be the easy one right she said aloud to the empty air and touched the staff to the knot of the tanglefoot spell julian and for the third time the spark of light sped away chapter alexander suspected that the appearance of the old woman was some sort of trick how had she gotten out here anyway she didnt look as if she could travel six feet much less limp her way into the middle of the wood she might be the bait for a trap or something in disguise and if he stopped for her the trap would be sprung all he could think of was that if he charged her shed get out of his way and whatever magic the sorcerer had been hexing him with might be broken then shed shouted you and hed been stupid enough to stop and turn to look back at her then he knew the moment that he saw the old hag pointing a stick at him that he had been right someone had been working magic against him but it had been her not some sorcerer working for king stancia but he didnt even have a chance to duck much less do anything about her before she shouted out something else something about being as arrogant and rude as an ass and in the next moment he was engulfed in more pain than he had ever felt in his entire life put together it felt as if his bones were melting and his insides turning to water he tried to cry out but his very voice changed and he felt himself falling off his horse and hitting the ground on all fours and well he really didnt know what it felt like then for there were no words to describe how it seemed as if he was made of warm wax and a pair of giant hands was remolding him remolding even his head his eyes felt as if they were going to pop out of their sockets his mouth like something had hold of his teeth and lips and was stretching his face and his ears well they burned and hurt past all reason then as if that wasnt enough he began to itch finally as quickly as it had come upon him the pain left him but it left him dazed and very confused because now although he could see exceedingly well to either side and somehow actually see behind his head he couldnt see much of anything that was straight ahead of him and when he tried to stand up he couldnt and when he looked down at his feet he saw four hooves four hooves the old hag what shed said you are as stubborn as an ass so be one he blinked he stared the sight did not change four hooves and if he craned his head around he saw a round barrelshaped body covered with grey hair and a tufted tail if his legs hadnt been locked at the knees hed have fallen to the ground if his throat hadnt been choked with despair hed have howled shed done more than confuse his path shed turned him into an animal he scarcely noticed that the old hag had come up to him until it was too late and she had some sort of fiendish torture device made of his own rope around his neck and nose too late he tried to fight her and finally when after the third time she choked off his breathing until he began to black out he gave up he allowed her to drag him into the shelter of some bushes and watched with even greater despair as she hobbled him so he couldnt move then she went back to the crossroads so this is what happened to octavian he thought dully he could not imagine why what enemy had managed to set a witch on his family had the business with stancia and the glass mountain all been a ruse to lure them into this cursed forest and her clutches i wonder what she turned octavian into oh bloody hell what if shed turned him into a bug or a frog what if hed trampled his own brother he tried to fight the hobbles and all he did was nearly fall over his horses stared at him down their long noses with astonishment as if they couldnt imagine what he was doing or why he was there he tried to fight the ropes around his neck but the witch had tied them cunningly if he fought them they choked him and only when he hung his head in resignation did they relax and let him breathe i have to warn julian that was his thought but it came too late for julian rode into the clearing on his handsome black palfrey just as he realized the danger and alexander couldnt get the breath even to bray a warning kind sir whined the old hag both hands outstretched theyve turned me out as too old to work kind sir and and julian soft foolish julian was out of his saddle in a moment helping the old witch to her rock fussing over her as if she was his own grandmother he ran to get water for her then rummaged through his saddlebags shes going to kill him or worse than kill him he tried and tried but he couldnt get free his balance wasnt right and he kept falling to his knees he kept blacking out from lack of air here old mother julian said gently putting half a loaf of bread in her hands and closing her hands around it its all i have i wish i had more but if youll bide just a bit ill see what i can hunt for you ah nay good sir youre too kind too kind the old woman said sounding absolutely delighted and of course she would shed just gotten all of julians provisions off him and he was a terrible hunter oh julian julian he thought in despair waiting for that stick to come out for julian to be turned into something horrid it was a plot that was what it was it was all a plot by stancia or that sorcerer or both to strip kohlstania of its heirs and send their father into despair there probably wasnt a quest there never had been a quest now then old mother just you wait julian was saying with that goodnatured grin on his face that drove his father mad youll have a good meal and ill put you up on morgana here and well all go on into fleurberg together now he froze eyes bulging with fear but unable to understand what was going on she hadnt done anything to him why hadnt she turned him into something nothing was happening as hed thought he stared at them through the underbrush feeling his upsidedown world flipping for a second time the old hag was hiding her face in her hands and for a moment alexander hoped again was her conscience overcoming her was she going to let julian go but then something odd happened she seemed to shimmer all over as if she was caught in a heathaze and then then she changed her clothing was what he saw first it unaged somehow all in a moment it got newer the fading the frayed bits they all went away and as her clothing changed she began to stand straighter that oldlady hump on her back vanished her hair went from straggling and grey to golden and curling and her face well she certainly wasnt an old hag anymore julian stared too gapemouthed as the handsome young woman lifted her head and looked him over boldly with a twinkle in her eye you are certainly an improvement over your brothers she said she lifted the stick and made a tiny gesture and the peasants clothing she was wearing transformed again this time into something pink and satiny and shining a gown his own mother would not have been ashamed to wear and there were diamonds at her throat and wrists and ears and the stick in her hand was now a long slender ivorywhite wand alexander stared and stared blinking in disbelief so too did julian whats going on here there was something about the way the woman looked it tickled the back of his mind something he remembered from a long time ago from a distant part of his memory he heard a voice hed thought hed forgotten a womans voice speaking softly once upon a time there was a lovely princess who was guarded by her fairy godmother julian poor fool stood there with his mouth dropping open not that alexander was in much better case shes got to be an elven queen but why ambush us why go through all of this to intercept us finally are you one of the julian stumbled over the words not surprisingly as they didnt come readily to one from kohlstania one of the fair folk she laughed there she did not resemble a fine lady of a lofty court at all it was a hearty laugh and rang around the clearing it didnt tinkle like a tiny silver bell nor did she hide her mouth behind her hand when she laughed no julian but i am a fairy godmother and your kindness and courtesy to an old woman shall have its reward i am here to help you on your quest shes here to help us alexander could hardly believe his ears fine help shes been to me and what did she do with octavian but then from somewhere deep inside perhaps the same place as that memory came another set of thoughts when you thought she was nothing but an old peasant woman you would have dismissed her as something less than the dirt in your path and you tried to run her down the moment you thought she might be a threat without waiting to see what she would do or answering her cry for aid you seem to have forgotten all those knightly vows you took and you havent exactly proved yourself worthy of help have you he felt his ears flattening against his head and he gritted his teeth i am a prince of the blood why should i care about some stupid old base born woman julian bleats about the peasantry all the time and this is where his concern leads him let her family take care of her or let her go to the poorhouse where decent people wont be bothered by such as her isnt that why we built the things the voice in the back of his head snickered nastily ah i see so long as you dont have to look at such as her you neednt concern yourself is that it of course it was but somehow that felt like exactly the wrong answer and he didnt know why the woman who was calling herself a fairy godmother made a tiny gesture with the wand as alexander watched her with his ears still flattened against his skull beside him in the bushes something moved snakelike his attention was distracted away from the woman to the horses and as he stared the reins of both horses came unknotted from where theyd been tied they moved as if they were alive or as if there was someone actually undoing the knots but that wasnt the least of it oh no before his very eyes they changed color the bay became a grey and the packhorse a dapple the armor packed onto the latter simply vanished altogether and the shield with it she gestured again and the two horses tossed their heads to free the reins and ambled out into the clearing as if she had called them and then as calmly as if the horses and their burdens were her property to give away she handed the reins over to julian here is all you will need for the physical tests you will face she said as alexander nearly choked his fear for his brother turning to outrage at her highhanded behavior but it will take more than strength to win the princess it will take cunning julian bent his head to her as humbly as if she was some sort of queen instead of a thief and a trickster tell me he begged what must i do the next half hour was the worst period in all of alexanders life as he watched and listened unable to move speak or interfere in any way while that infernal woman coached his younger brother through everything he needed to win through the trials and get king stancias daughter and throne not that some of it made any real sense some babble about freeing trapped foxes rescuing baby hawks feeding ants but that didnt matter she was cheating helping julian and why because hed stopped to help a worthless old woman where was the sense in that shed stolen his gear too and given it to an idiot who didnt have the sense not to leave without the proper equipment the more he watched and listened the angrier he got until he was nearly faint with rage and trembling in every limb of all the questers that elena had ever tested this one was probably the best he was even betterlooking in person with the animation of a good intellect in his eyes and a ready smile on his lips like his brother alexander he was cleanshaven and longhaired but somehow and perhaps it was the faint air of untidiness about him the lack of perfection in his dress she got the impression that julian was not given to much thought about how he looked to tell the truth his horse was better groomed than he was his brown doublet was just a bit faded and someone else probably would have given it to a servant by now his linen was clean but it was clear that he hadnt changed his shirt before he left and his breeches of soft doeskin were made for use not for looks everything he said was intelligent and to the point prince julian was a fine considerate young man but more than that he was much cleverer than his brothers and father gave him credit for that was borne out in his conversation have you done something with octavian and alexander he asked quietly when he accepted the reins of the two horses that prince alexander had brought with him by the tone of his voice it wasnt exactly a question he knew he just wanted it confirmed i cant imagine them getting past you you see he didnt quite accuse her but he clearly remembered the sorts of things that godmothers did which was more than his brothers had she raised an eyebrow ill tell you that theyre as safe as i could make them she said finally but that they wont be competing with you for stancias daughter and neither of them will be seeing kohlstania for a while ah he replied and grimaced and for a moment those fine dark eyes were shadowed alexander has always been kind to me and i dont wish any harm even on octavian hmm even on octavian some bullying there i suspect well if thats the sort of fellow octavian is he wont be seeing home next month ill keep my eye on alexander then she promised repressing a little smile oh she would be doing that all right she took note of the angle of the sunlight across the clearing in fact the clearing was entirely in shadow at the moment and it wouldnt be long until sunset she needed to get him on his way and soon he probably wouldnt make it out of phaelins wood tonight but at least now hed have the gear for a night in the forest never mind them julian its you who will be needing help all right now before you ever get to the glass mountain youll probably encounter several tests like mine perhaps there will be a trapped fox that you will need to free perhaps you will have to rescue a young hawk or eagle and return it to its nest perhaps you will have to save an ant colony from flooding i cant tell you what it will be but i can give you this she handed him a tiny red glass vial that contained in part some of the dragons blood that she herself had once drunk this however was not the straight undiluted stuff this was a potion created by her which would last no longer than it took to finish the trials being able to converse with animals could cause a great deal of trouble it was not a gift given lightly and few deserved or needed to be burdened with it for very long when you are a mile or two down the road stop and drink this she told him when it takes effect youll be able to speak with the animals for several days at some point youll get the chance to save the lives of one or more wild creatures and by doing so youll earn the right to their help later in the tasks now when you get to the glass mountain the first task youll encounter will be to find a way to get past a lion without fighting him she did not actually give him the answers that would be for him to work out for himself that was why it was a trial and every other quester who got past the initial test of kindness and courtesy would be getting the same sort of advice so it wasnt as if they werent all on the same footing there was no guarantee that julian would be the one to win the princess though she had a good feeling about him no this was just a way of making sure that the best questers were not only the ones that actually made it to the testing but were properly equipped when they arrived and she had to admit that it tickled her to use the arrogant alexanders equipment to outfit the quiet and considerate julian after about a half an hour of coaching he was as ready as he was ever going to be time to go she said and he mounted onto the warhorse he looked back uncertainly at his palfrey there was no way that he was going to be able to manage three horses and he knew it ill take care of morgana she promised then hesitated and decided to add one more little bit of advice it wasnt exactly the sort of thing that went with the tradition but it was still good advice prince julian in the future you do not need to be quite so generous he blinked at her what do you mean he asked well when someone begs you for food for instance as i did it is quite generous of you to say i have food and ill share it with you and quite unnecessary to do what you did and give it all to me the former is nobleminded and generous the latter is daft she gave him a long and level look not everyone you meet is going to be a fairy godmother oh he said and ah and colored up i do things without thinking sometimes well if you want to win king stancias daughter youd better practice thinking first and acting second now good luck and godspeed she told him and she sent him off down the path into whatever the tradition had in store for him he rode off into the shadows under the trees as the air in the clearing cooled noticeably and the sky in the west turned to red and gold at least if he failed this quest the worst that would happen to him was to be sent home too many of these things ended up with questers dead she had difficulty with her conscience over those never mind that the reward in the end was a good one the point was that there was only one reward and that failure was fatal she always warned the ones she sent on too and some of them even turned back not enough though did bella ever have trouble sleeping at night after testing questers does anyone else she wondered it wasnt the sort of thing you brought up at the little godmother gatherings that happened at christenings and weddings she let the illusion of her court gown fall once the lad was gone no point in looking overdressed out here and she didnt feel the need to impress alexander well with julian safely out of the way there were only two things to be dealt with julians palfrey which he had left in her hands and julians brother the horse first she was easiest for a moment elena toyed with the idea of keeping her she was a beautiful creature with a fine arched neck flowing mane and tail and a broad forehead but while elena did not own a horse at the moment and presumably alexander would learn his lessons and be gone so that they would not even have him to do the chores this was not the sort of beast that was of any real use to her she needed a carthorse not a palfrey she sighed with regret though she couldnt ride but she couldnt help thinking about how nice it would be to be able to she toyed just a moment with the image of herself in an elegant riding habit the sort she had seen the sorceress lilliana wearing riding along the greenshadowed paths of the forest ah she could see it the palfreys mane and tail shivering and rippling with every step she could feel it a freedom like flying through the air when the little humpback horse pulled the cart silly when would i have the time to learn to ride properly besides theres a traditional use for julians horse and i need to cement the path to it nothing like doing the job right and getting the whole family in one go she turned her attention towards the pretty black mare and put herself in the right frame of mind to talk to it i want you to go home she told the palfrey which flicked its ears forward to listen to her two liquidbrown eyes gazing into hers why the mare asked because home is where the food is elena replied knowing what every horse is most concerned with at bottom the palfrey licked her lips the oats she said longingly my stall my manger thats right you need to go home elena seconded then she used just a touch of magic to reinforce her command go straight home as fast as you can and do not allow anyone to touch you until you are in your stall the mare tossed her head as the magic geas settled over her elena made her stay while she cut the reins away from her halter so that she wouldnt get hung up on them anywhere and so that anyone who tried to catch her would not have anything to hold onto then she stood back and the mare was off like an arrow cantering back down the path she had just come on she would arrive back at the castle with cut reins without julian and in a lather all of these things combined should manage to raise a great cloud of alarm and guilt in even the king of kohlstania who would discover that there was no more word of them after they had entered the wood with good luck and the tradition on her side king henrick would learn that there are things more important than ones ambition things like ones children when octavian returned he would be welcomed back with tears of relief and the warmth that he probably had not felt since he was a child and that would reinforce the lessons of humility he had learned behold my son who was lost to me is returned she thought and smiled it would even be good for king henrick who would spend his last days as a beloved king as well as a strong one but that was for the future and now that she had put it all in motion it was out of her hands so much for the horse now for the ass overhead the sky was growing dark and in the far east there the first few stars were coming out pale diamonddust against the velvet blue not only was it time to get home but she and the ass both needed to be out of these woods quickly she would be safe enough but it was going to get cold and she didnt want to try to negotiate the path in the dark as for alexander asses didnt see well in the dark even if she could get him moving which was debatable hed be stumbling over every little stone and root she sauntered back to where she had left alexander tied up and was not particularly surprised to find she was being glared at out of a pair of eyes nearly red with rage his ears were back his teeth were bared and his neck was stretched out towards her now unlike a real ass alexander probably wouldnt bite her it simply wouldnt occur to him to do so but he was angry enough that he might and besides he was certainly likely to try to step on her or kick her a good thing that i hobbled you i think she said regarding him thoughtfully however this does present a problem how to get you home with me let me go brayed the ass angrily witch slut traitor let me go oh no she said amused in spite of herself first of all you brought this on yourself so dont blame me blame your own behavior for your information im not a witch im a godmother and i am charged with seeing to it that virtue is rewarded and now how shall i put this she regarded him with a raised eyebrow hmm nasty little boys who behave like cruel rude brats get their comeuppance the ass nearly burst with anger at being called a nasty little boy now just to complete your edification on this business of stancias daughter she continued really beginning to enjoy herself your brother octavian is currently wandering in the woods very nearly as illprovisioned as your brother julian was he will continue to do so until he learns to treat all people with the same politeness that he would give to his equals and to give them the consideration he would expect for himself she tilted her head to the side and matched him glare for glare she also tried not to laugh the donkey looked absolutely ridiculous trying to twist his face into an expression of affronted outrage does that sound familiar it should i suspect he will be quite ragged and very well acquainted with the kind of hunger cold and misery the poorest of the poor live with by the time he mends his manners and i suppose that youre wondering why i let him go his way still human he only ignored the poor starving old woman you attempted to run her down the asss eyes flashed warningly she feigned surprise what you dont think there was anything particularly wrong with your behavior i suppose youre under the impression that your birth gives you the right to trample whoever you please under your horses hooves he looked for one moment as if he was about to say something she didnt care to hear it well your punishment is in my hands my lad and as it happens im going to see to it that while you are not as wellacquainted with hunger and misery as your brother you will learn all about the hard labor that turns your peasants old before their time i told you i need a donkey and you will do the main problem now is how to get you home since i doubt that youre going to cooperate of your own free will she crossed her arms over her chest and tapped her cheek with the tip of her wand while she thought out loud i could put a spell of coercion on you but you might hurt yourself trying to fight it that was a distinct possibility for as angry as he was although she doubted he could break it he might well wrench muscles or even break a bone trying to keep from obeying it such things had happened in the past because the sort of coercion spell that good magicians used only worked on the subjects body and imperfectly at that now the coercions used by practitioners of the dark arts were more insidious they worked inside the subjects head and sometimes even when the spell had been lifted the subject was never quite right again i could blindfold you and ask the path to take us home she continued but if she did that the odds were good that he would fall off hed try to escape or try to hurt her and hed fall off possibly hurting himself certainly ending the magic right there then it would be all to do all over again and most of it in the dark probably a bad choice considering her options she decided on a third on the whole i believe i will see what magic and the tradition have around us that might suit best in the time since bella had turned over the position to her elena had learned something very interesting about the tradition which was that when it had no set path that it was trying to follow it could be very helpful indeed apparently the tradition always had to do something whenever magic was used and if she merely used a very little magic to get its attention she often got a very large benefit in return now this was more to elenas liking again conserving magical power if she was not specific in how she wanted something done it also tended to happen much more efficiently and faster than if she had been the tradition would bring whatever help she requested that was nearest and best suited to the task and in the process of doing so laid down a trace to follow at some other time in some other place she was in effect using the tradition itself to build new paths the more paths the tradition had to choose from the easier it would be to keep it to one she and other good magicians preferred so she released another thread of power and sent it seeking saying only i need some help in getting the pair of us to my home quickly please to the twilight air she saw the little wisp of glowing light waver uncertainly like a thin stream of smoke from a pipe for a moment then suddenly it compacted itself into a tight ball and shot off into the east at tremendous speed so that suggested that there would be an answer to her request very soon there was so soon that she barely had time to finish that thought before she heard something large very large crashing and crunching its way through the forest towards them it wasnt just twigs that were snapping out there it was large branches and she had no idea what could be that big but she didnt go anywhere beyond the walls of her cottage without at least one talisman that would react to the presence of anything evil really wicked not merely bad as octavian and alexander had been and whatever was coming was not making her talismans the least uneasy so she waited with anticipation but no trepidation to see what her magic had called to her side now phaelins wood was a very old forest and the trees were enormous much taller than the tallest building that elena had ever seen and since becoming an apprentice she had seen quite a bit so she wasnt at all surprised that she couldnt actually see what was coming what did surprise her was that when it stepped into the clearing it he certainly stood as tall as say the average town hall he was a giant the first one that elena had ever set eyes on i didnt know there were any giants in this kingdom a very civilized giant he was and clearly visible in the twilight nicely clothed in a patchwork leather jerkin which had probably taken the hides of six or eight cattle to make a canvas shirt which had probably been sewn from ships sails a good pair of woolen breeches likely made from blankets and in place of boots which obviously would have been very difficult to have made for one so large heavy felt shoes with wooden soles he was bearded but his beard was neatly trimmed and though his hair was a little wild it did look as if he made an effort to keep it tended he looked around the clearing for a moment and she helped him out by stepping out where he could see her his gaze fell on her and his face lit up with a smile ah our godmother i wondered why id felt a summoning he said in a voice like a flood of warm dark velvet she smiled with delight in return you couldnt not like someone who sounded like that how can i serve you godmother an exchange of services is in order i think she replied ive changed a fool into an ass and i dont think hes going to cooperate in coming home with me so i need a bit of help in bringing him along the giant laced his fingers together and pushed his hands outwards cracking the joints with a laugh well im your man for that and if its an exchange youre offering well i could use a new ram for some reason completely unfathomable to elena or any of the chroniclers of the tradition that she had ever read sheepherding was a traditional occupation for giants along with woodcutting and as it happened although this was not normally the case elena had a ram penned up in the old donkey paddock given her by one of the women shed made haying charms for it was completely useless to her and shed been searching for something she could barter it for this was not unlikely coincidence this was how given free rein and the nudge of a little magical power the tradition worked for a godmother who knew how to manipulate it she needed a way to get alexander home he needed a ram she had a ram and a touch of magic and the tradition put them together it could have been a farmer passing through with an animal cart it could have been one of the fair folk who could whisk them home in a breath anything would serve so long as she had something that the other wanted this time it was a giant who was nearest and fit the bill done she said and to the giants delight spit in her hand to seal the bargain in the country way they told me the godmother whod apprenticed for our bella was a right lass he said with that broad grin spreading across his face again and so you are godmother elena im titch howler titchfen in full but mostly they call me titch and im pleased to meet you titch she replied almost giggling at the notion that anyone with so mellow a voice as this giants would be called howler how do you propose to help me lets see your wee donkey he replied and she led him in the gathering gloom to where alexander was tied up the ass was petrified with fear all four legs were rigid and his eyes practically bulged out of his head his ears were flat down against his back and he shook so hard it was almost comical evidently alexander had never seen a giant before either i dont think this ones likely to give me much trouble godmother titch said with a chuckle like thunder in the distance i reckon the easiest is to carry the two of you him neath my arm and you on my shoulder and so it was titch knelt down and offered her his hand to step up onto from there she got into a comfortable sitting position on his shoulder and took a good hold of his hair he seized the trembling ass with both hands and tucked alexander under his arm and away they went back down the path to her cottage each one of titchs strides covered a good thirty feet so elena reckoned that was probably how tall he was since a man can usually stride the length of his own height when hes in a hurry it was a very good thing that she no longer had any difficulties with heights though the giants hair was like strands of yarn so it was easy to hold onto and his broad shoulder made a surprisingly comfortable seat he kept up a lively conversation with her as they walked modulating his voice so as not to deafen her she suspected that he must spend a reasonable amount of time around humans to be that sensitive about their needs and a moment later he confirmed that and the wife says to me titch she says your old mams getting creaky in her bones and im not so young anymore can you find me a couple of human lasses and lads to help with the cleaning they can get where i cant and godmother bella she set us up with some lively folk that dont mind living off in the beyond said they was tenant farmers turned out by the lord for havin sauce sauce away says i i like a man wholl tell me what he thinks to me face and we get on as right as rain she hoped that alexander was listening to this it was the sort of thing he needed to hear for here was a giant a monster giving help to humans whod been dismissed not because they hadnt done their work and done it well but for speaking their minds and furthermore this same giant approved of men speaking their minds then again at this point he had probably passed out from fear before they were home elena learned all about titch his halfdeaf old mother his wife of thirty years the four humans who helped them tend house and the herds and the sheep themselves now sheep dont live in forests they live in grasslands and elena finally asked titch what had brought him down into phaelins wood oh he replied thats no secret got a bargain with the elves when theres a storm i clear deadfall and leave it in four special places humans around about know where i leave it and they go there for their firewood and stay out of the deep woods so no trees get cut and theres no one trampin around where they shouldnt be and i get deer when i get tired of mutton when i felt that tuggin i thought twas maybe one of the elves that wanted something by this time the lights of the cottage were gleaming warmly through the trees and elena felt her stomach whisper a complaint that it had been too long since breakfast and that made her offer though not without trepidation since she wasnt sure they had enough food to feed a giant look were here would you care to stay for supper titch laughed ah no thankee godmother ill be taking my ram and be on my way the wee wifell be in a taking if i spoil her meal by coming home late and it appeared that titch was no stranger to the cottage for once hed set elena down at her door and the houseelves came out to see who was there there was a round of friendly greetings and banter before alexander was put down in the stable with strong charms about him to keep him from running away then titch collected his ram tucked it under his arm and was off striding away under the stars so lily said hands on hips looking at the ass who was still shaking the lantern in the stable shone down on him and she had to admit that he made a very good ass strong wellmuscled whats the tale behind this one elena told her and lily raised her eyebrows well she said judiciously i hope you know what youre getting into i dont actually she thought but she wasnt going to admit that its within the tradition she pointed out oh i know its a little grey to haul him home with me and make him work for a while but i could hardly have left him out in the forest hed probably have gotten eaten by something and its not as if ive put some impossible conditions for him to meet on his state hmm lily replied as they walked back towards the house that wasnt what i was thinking im more thinking whats going to happen when you give him his days as a man youll have to do that you know she nodded shed given thought to that herself only the most powerful of sorcerers and sorceresses good or evil could do a transformation on someone without the risk that the person transformed would lose himself in the creature for anyone else there was the need to allow the person time as himself in human form on a regular basis ill have him hedged around believe me she replied as they stepped into the warm fragrant kitchen he wont be able to even think about violence or about running off that wasnt what i meant ah never mind lily replied somewhat to elenas puzzlement well see what happens the first time he gets his day as a man and in the meanwhile we have an ass again robin said with great satisfaction poor dobbin was so old i was afraid to work him as much as we needed i have plans for a great gathering of firewood tomorrow and elena hid her smile behind a spoonful of soup tonight the prince of the blood would be eating dry hay and drinking water his only companions would be three cows and in the morning he would find himself roused at dawn and working harder than he ever had in his life until sunset she could hardly wait chapter alexander woke slowly to the sound of roosters crowing hed always come awake slowly for as long as he could remember no matter how much racket anyone made in his days at the military academy he might have gotten into trouble over that if he hadnt been the prince as it was some adjustments were made to the usual procedures for cadets not to allow him to lie abed longer good god no king henrick would never have countenanced that no another arrangement was made while the officers did not allow him to lie abed at reveille until he was actually awake they did allow his batman to come in and begin the waking process for him alone specially a half hour early he had a batman of course though the other cadets did not and he had his own room though the other cadets shared a dormitory he was a prince of the blood after all while he was expected to abide by discipline and study as hard as the rest he could scarcely be expected to shine his own boots or make his own bed it was thanks to the batman that by the time the bugle sounded he was awake and ready to fall out with the rest of the class as thoughts began to form with glacial slowness he gradually realized that something wasnt right he didnt feel right and there was something different about his surroundings he was lying all wrong and he wasnt in a bed a new thought oozed to the surface of course he wasnt in his bed at home he was on his way to win stancias daughter he couldnt be in an inn though or he would be in a bed no of course he wasnt in an inn hed been wandering around for days in the wilderness he should have been in the forest but there werent any roosters in the forest so something was still wrong he managed to move a little and a foreign aroma not unpleasant but foreign came to his nose along with the crackle of something underneath him from the scent he seemed to be lying in straw he managed to move again although he could not get his eyes open his foot hit a wooden wall he was lying against another he got one eye open got a hazy impression through sleepfog and predawn light of a narrow space hemmed in by crude wooden walls he was in a stable in a stall he was lying in a very odd position he should have felt cramped but he wasnt he looked down at himself he had four legs four stubby hairy legs ending in hooves he had in his life on a very few memorable occasions come awake in a single moment this was not the first time such a thing had happened but it was certainly the worst he remembered everything all in a rush that horrible woman the curse julian the giant the memory sent a cold shock through him jolting him into movement fueled by anger all four hooves scrambling he heaved himself up braying at the top of his lungs full of rage and despair and knocked himself senseless on the manger hed somehow wedged himself underneath in the night the second time he awoke that morning it was with a head that pounded as if five men were playing bass drums inside it and a pain behind his eyes that stabbed all the way through his brain with every beat of his heart and this time he couldnt remember where he was or what he was doing there he gazed around at what was clearly a stall in a stable without any idea of how he had gotten there before he could get his thoughts clear he realized that there was someone standing over him all right with you lad said the voice above him time for you to go to work work but then it hit him all over again for a second time the memories came back to him in a rush but this time he was feeling too sick and his head hurt too much to sustain the rage he lifted his head from the straw and looked blearily at his captor it took him a moment to realize that it wasnt a human although it was a male the man couldnt have been taller than three feet but he was as weatherbeaten and wizened as an old man he had overlarge ears that came to hairy points and wore clothing that alexander associated with common laborers or peasants homespun shirt leather breeks canvas tunic his clothing looked new and clean though and the creature had a bridle in his hands a bridle he wouldnt the man wouldnt dare alexander opened his mouth he was going to say i am a prince of kohlstania and i demand to be restored except that what he started to say came out in a bray and anyway as soon as he opened his mouth the creature jammed a bit into it and the next thing he knew his head had been trussed up in the bridle and the creature had the reins firmly in his hand up with you the creature said and he must have been immensely strong because somehow he hauled alexander to his feet by main force the prince swayed there a moment torn between rage and fear hed always thought of himself as a brave man but this time it was the fear that won and he tried to bolt only to find himself brought up short by the reins that were now tied to the manger he reared and fought the bridle kicking not at the man but wildly at random trying desperately to break free hold still ye daft bugger said the little man who then brought his fist down on alexanders nose hitting the manger with the top of his head had been bad this was infinitely worse alexander went nearly crosseyed with the pain his knees buckled and he almost fell darkness speckled with little dancing sparks covered his vision and when he could see again there was a harness on his back as well as the bridle on his head the little man came around to the front of him and seized both sides of the bridle pulling alexanders head level with his now you listen to me my fine young prince said the man staring into alexanders eyes with an expression that was perfectly readable alexander had seen that expression on his fathers face many a time it meant cross me and youll pay for it we know who you are and we know how you come to be what you are and we dont give a toss youre not in kohlstania now youre in godmother elenas house and what she says is law you stepped over the line my buck and youll take whats coming to ye like a man or yell be treated like the brat she says ye are you understand me he was seething with every passionate emotion in the book and they all tangled up with one another and got in each others way run said fear and fight said anger and lie down and die said despair he was trapped trapped in the web of a witch and even if he could get free where could he go he didnt know how to get home again he didnt know where he was and even if he did how could he tell anyone what he was theres no use you trying to run the little man went on remorselessly any peasant that sees you running loose is going to grab you to work his land and bear his burdens half of them cant read nor write so its no use thinking you can scratch out what you are in the dirt and anyway the ones that are literate around here are all beholden to godmother elena and before you can say knife theyll bring you right back here so until you mend your ways im your master you do what i say and do it honestly and well get along all right you try to cross me up or give less than your best and youll find out that im no bad hand at fitting the punishment to the crime myself he believed the little man he believed every word they had that ring of truth about them that he used to hear in his instructors voices at the military academy despair won out over every other emotion and his knees went weak oh god help me he prayed deliver me from the hands of my enemies he wanted to weep and he was denied even that for he was trapped in the body of an ass and animals could not cry and god did not seem to be answering him today i see we understand one another the little man said with immense satisfaction then he looked up and when alexander in turn raised his head to see what the man was looking at he found himself gazing into the knowing eyes of that terrible woman no beating him hob said the woman the man frowned but godmother im not saying not to give him a sharp stripe or two if you have to get his attention but no beating if you beat him all hell learn is the old lesson he already knows that the strong have the right to enslave the weak if hes ever going to warrant getting his old shape back he has to learn better than that the way she was talking about him as if he wasnt there or couldnt understand her made him mad all over again but the little man was still holding his bridle and the memory of that blow to his nose was a powerful incentive to him to stand quietly now my lad said the little man its time for you to earn your keep and get to work well maybe he wasnt going to fight where he couldnt win but he would be damned if he was going to be this womans slave he set all four hooves and refused to move staring at her and her minion defiantly ah so thats how its going to be said the woman when all of the mans hauling could not make him move an inch good enough then hob tie him up and make sure there isnt a scrap of hay or a grain of corn about but do put fresh water within reach i want to teach him a lesson not kill him or drive him mad she put both her hands on her hips and matched his defiant glare if you wont work you dont eat he snorted angrily at her very well have it your own way she replied the little man tied his reins short and left a bucket of water hung within reach then he too left and alexander was alone in the stable it didnt take long for him to get bored there wasnt much to look at the high walls of the stall cut off his view of anything outside so he was left with the rough wooden walls the old bucket on a peg the manger and the strawstrewn dirt floor to stare at the view palled pretty quickly he closed his eyes and listened roosters crowed occasionally or a rooster did he didnt know enough about chickens to tell if there was more than one hens clucked and beyond that he could hear several sorts of birdsong and jackdaws calling and someone humming someone female he couldnt imagine a witch humming under her breath so it must be yet another servant his stomach growled it had been a long time since yesterdays lunch he buried his nose in the water bucket and then snorted and choked as the water went up his nose it took several tries before he figured out how to drink as a donkey the water eased his hunger temporarily but what began to creep in on him was another sense so much sharper that it might have been an entirely new one he could smell everything the straw under his feet for instance strong and strangely appetizing the damp earth under the straw green growing things a smell which began to tease him mercilessly with need baking bread which drove him mad with wanting it the scent of roasting meat which oddly was faintly nauseating a whiff of honey which made his mouth water hed never actually missed a meal in his life before this he was behind by two now could you eat straw if you were a donkey he strained at the rope and reins holding his head to the manger but they were tight and so were the knots the straw was just out of reach damn them could he bite through the bonds holding him he gave it a try but the leather was tough and wouldnt yield to his teeth and the additional leadrope was thick even if he could get through the reins he didnt think he could chew through the rope he almost gave up but the thought of the witchs smirk galvanized him he started in on the rope at least it was something to chew elena heard randolf laugh and looked up from her writing whats so funny she asked hes chewing on the everrenewing rope randolf replied with unconcealed glee oh i know its not that funny but i cant wait for the moment when he figures out that however many strands he breaks they always get replaced sometimes randolf shows his origins a little too clearly to be comfortable she thought and the personality traits he picked up from his previous owners it was like the wicked sorceress to whom he had belonged to take delight in the pain of others she kept her tone light however there was no point in rebuking randolf as he wouldnt understand why he was being chided i think it will be more interesting to see how many meals he misses before he gives in she replied you ought to let me give him a good hiding hob said from the door she turned her head to see him standing there with his arms full of clean linens she wondered how long he had been there im not going to kill him with kindness hes already had much too much spoiling in his life and ive no desire to reinforce that but i told you before and i will repeat it there will be no beatings she said adamantly it will just make him feel martyred and justified think hob if you beat him hell be certain that he is in the right cant you see that no we have to do this the hard way nothing to make him feel that we are worse than he is everything to make him see that our way is the better way hmph robin said from behind hob his arms full of clean clothing spare the rod and spoil the child is what my old father used to say elena pursed her lips and frowned but hes not a child not by our count of years anyway no the lessons he learns have to come from his pain things that he essentially brings on himself not from anything we actively do to him she returned to writing her part in the tale of stancias daughter thus far she already knew thanks to another volume that was writing itself down in the library that prince julian had passed the second of his tasks freeing a fox whose tail had been caught in a log it was not just any fox of course but he was not to know that and the fairy godmother who was responsible for that task did not elaborate on just what sort of fox it had been prince octavian was nowhere to be found at the moment but she wasnt worried there wasnt much in phaelins wood that could harm a fully armed man the size of octavian though by now he was surely getting tired unkempt and rather hungry now if he ran across a segment of road where an all forests are one spell had been put in place and was still active there was no telling what he might run into and of course there was always the chance that an evil magician would get wind of his wanderings and intercept him but that was out of elenas hands now karelina was back in her place and what happened to octavian was largely up to her and when she began to feel a little pity for him she just thought of his stonecold expression as he looked right past her and moved on no he deserved what he got and like alexander the end of his punishment was in his own hands she finished her chronicle and fanned at the ink to dry it i think itll be tomorrow before he gives up she said consideringly and at the end of six days ill have to give him a day as a man you know hmm dangerous that hob said and madame were not much help if he decides to attack you i know ive planned for that she replied at least i hope i have if missing breakfast had been a torment missing lunch was an agony all alexander could think about was food the hot summer breeze from the garden brought him the scent of the vegetables out there and to his surprise he could identify them by their scent if he didnt think too hard about it not that it helped if anything it made it worse and the scent of baking bread oh if there was a heaven for horses alexander now knew intimately that it was full of loaves of freshbaked bread the aroma of freshcut grass made his mouth water the scents of other things were not at all tempting but the memories of the foods he had enjoyed as a man were maddening and no matter how hard he tried not to think of them more memories of sumptuous breakfasts al fresco luncheons and amazing feasts piled into his mind to the point where he could taste his favorites it didnt help at all that there was nothing to see or do in this stall with his head tied up to the manger he was able to hear things perfectly well but it wasnt enough to occupy his mind and what he could scent for the most part only made him hungrier by nightfall he had learned two more things the first that not even three buckets of water are enough to keep hunger at bay for long and the second that all that water has to go somewhere that was when his final humiliation occurred that of having to stand in his own well he could only hold it for so long after all if hed thought it smelled when he was a man it was a lot stronger to a donkeys nose the strange little man came and carried the soiled straw away but still hed had to stand over it for hours he vowed that if he was ever himself again he would assign a stableboy the task of doing nothing else but carrying away mess as soon as it was made it was humiliating dreadfully humiliating darkness fell without anyone coming to look in on him but that little man who elected not to speak to him when it was pitchdark in the stable he managed to fall asleep again actually standing up as horses did even with his stomach growling at him he woke in the middle of the night out of restless dreams interrupted by hunger and emotions he couldnt exactly put a name to it was very dark in the stable too dark to see anything his ears twitched and it was an extremely strange sensation to feel them twitching to feel the air moving over the surface of them to be aware of how big they were hed never been aware of his ears before only of the sounds they brought him there were owls hooting out there his ears twitched again and he realized he could pinpoint where they were or close to it they were moving flying from tree to tree he guessed calling to each other were they mates why couldnt she have turned him into an owl he heard crickets outside the stable frogs somewhere in the distance the night was a rich tapestry of sound the like of which he had never experienced before was this what life was like for an animal why couldnt she have turned him into a frog a frog would be better than a donkey he heard something else then something coming in out of the forest two things hooved beasts he thought walking so lightly they hardly made a sound deer being a deer wouldnt be bad he felt his nostrils spreading as he tried to scent what it was that was out there and what he got was a bizarre odor that his donkeyinstincts couldnt identify it was sweet with musky overtones not horse certainly not deer or goat too sweet for any of those if a flower could have been an animal or an animal a flower it would have smelled like that the godmother said to eat the lilies whispered a voice out there in the darkness not the peas a second voice sighed but i like peas it objected then he heard a snort enemy it said more loudly i smell godmothers said the first voice dismissively a quester who failed but it is not a virgin the second objected disapproval heavy in its voice it is also not a man said the first and the brownies are not virgins either let the godmother deal with it all right you two snapped a third voice that was altogether and detestably familiar to alexander his tormentor the little man with the bad temper we figured some of you would be here tonight come along the godmother wants a word with you but we didnt touch the peas objected the first voice indignantly yet said the voice of the witchs little servant darkly now come along will we get to lay our heads in her lap asked the second voice so full of hope and yearning that it made alexander blink then blink again why would someone want to put his head in that witchs lap well see the little servant replied just come along the sound of hooves and feet moving off was the last he heard of that conversation he finally fell asleep again falling back into troubled dreams that were interrupted at the first hint of light when the chickens began fussing over something if anything he was more hungry and more stubborn than ever this day was a repeat of the first at this point he would so gladly have eaten even the dry straw at his feet that he found himself tearing at the leadrope on his halter in a frenzy of activity that ceased only when his jaws tired that was when he took a good look at the place hed been gnawing on and cursed the witch fervently and thoroughly there was no sign none whatsoever that he had been chewing on it for most of two days it was magic of some sort of course more of that cursed magic a surfeit of magic when had he ever had anything to do with magic oh he knew it existed but at a distance the peasants called on witches and other magicians to help them because they were well stupid peasants it was not the habit of the sophisticated folk of the towns to do so or if they did they did not do so openly certainly not one of the people of king henricks court ever used magicians for his father prided himself on surrounding himself and his sons with people who were rational and logical and had no need of magic magic was for those who did not have the intelligence to come up with other solutions magic was for the weak for it relied on weak little things like potions and talismans the strong used their own will and force of arm to bring about what they desired it appalled him in a way how quickly he had come to accept so quickly that magic really was strong enough after all to bring him to his knees and it had it had brought him to his knees because when the little man arrived just before darkness fell with the last bucket of water for him he heard himself saying or rather braying stop the little man looked down his long nose at him oh he replied you have something to say to me ill work he said in despair so hungry now that he was positively nauseous ill work tomorrow i see the little man put his bucket down and regarded him skeptically so i feed you now and in the morning you decide that you wont work after all i didnt fall off the turnip cart yesterday young man alexander shook his head impatiently unable to comprehend just what that was supposed to mean i pledge it my word of honor feed me and ill work the little man hmphed and glared at him word of honor my word as a prince of the blood and a knight he repeated his temper starting to rise just who did this dwarf think he was to question his word just now youre an ass of the blood and more like the thing the knight would use to carry his squires bags the little man observed crossly and you certainly werent acting like a knight when you tried to run the godmother down but the godmother said you might make that sort of pledge and that i was to accept it if you did all right then pledge accepted he left the bucket of water went off somewhere and returned with a pottle of hay and a great wooden scoop of something alexander felt his nostrils widening again as he greedily drank in the scents and identified them as not only the best cloverhay but a scoop of grain as well the oats went in the manger the hay in a haybag the little man tied to the side of the stall and then it was a matter of a moment and the little man had the bridle off as well alexander had no thought for him his nose was deep in the grain and he was on his first mouthful when the man hit him lightly this time between the ears mind the man said sharply youre a man think like one ye gurt fool eat too fast and yell founder curse it hes right so though his empty stomach was crying out for him to shove the food as quickly down his throat as he could he did nothing of the sort he chewed each mouthful slowly and carefully counting to twenty before he took the next and he wasnt taking big mouthfuls either just dainty little bites he didnt shove all the grain in first either he alternated one bite of grain one mouthful of hay torn from the net one sip of water he would never have believed that anything could taste as good it surprised him actually hed expected the hay to taste like well hay it didnt it was a little like dry cake a little like new peas and there was just the faintest hint of nectar in fact it tasted like newmown hay smelled utterly delicious as for the grain it was earthy a little bit truffleflavored and a lot like breadcrust from the best bread hed ever eaten well no wonder horses seemed to enjoy these foods so much it made him wonder what grass tasted like when the little man was certain that he wasnt going to eat fast enough to make himself sick he took himself off with a grunt and a word of warning im not going to leave you tied up tonight the man said but remember what i said about running away try and run off and youll soon find yourself in more trouble than you think if youre lucky someone will eventually figure out you belong to madame elena if you arent the work youll be doing will make what i have planned for you seem like mild exercise and if by some chance you actually manage to get into the deep forest something about the relish with which the little man said that made alexander look up at him he was grinning it was not a sign of mirth let me just say that the packs of wolves in the forest would find donkeyflesh quite the tastiest thing to come their way in a long time fancy yourself being able to take on a wolf pack in your current shape since alexander had no illusions about being able to take on a wolf pack in human shape he shook his head and thats just the wolves theres other things in there youd rather not learn about the little man slapped him on the rump alexander elected not to protest the insult to his dignity so be a good little prince and stay where ive left you only then did the little man walk out leaving alexander alone again only now he had a full stomach and the ability to pick a clean spot to lie down in and when he did so he slept the dreamless sleep of the utterly spent it was alexanders fourth day of working for the little man whom he learned he was supposed to refer to as master hob and he ached in every limb he had thought when he underwent his training as a knight that he had worked hard he had certainly exercised until he was ready to drop and he had certainly gone from dawn to dusk but it was not this bad he had thought that he had exerted himself when he had been in the military academy and he had indeed done hours of drilling in all weathers but that had been nothing compared to this they had gone out every single day at dawn and he had spent every morning hauling deadfall out of the forest this meant that he was hitched to a tree and had to pull and strain until he pulled it loose from the undergrowth then had to drag it all the way back to the cottage where the little man unhitched it at the woodpile then they went back after another tree then after a break for a meal he spent every afternoon but one hauling stones to build a wall the one he did not spend in hauling stones he spent hitched to a cart on a trip to and from some village nearby relatively nearby that is he had never before appreciated the difference between being the one doing the riding or driving and being the one doing the pulling then after a final meal he spent each evening until twilight with panniers over his back in the company of someone he was supposed to call mistress lily tramping about in the forest again this time so that mistress lily could pick wild herbs and berries and bits of things he couldnt identify he had to admit that the little man worked just as hard as he did he was the one hacking the brush away from the fallen trees hitching them to the harness and guiding them and he walked the entire way he was the one piling the stones into the garden cart dumping them at the wall and building the drystone wall himself and it hadnt been master hob who had driven the cart to the village it had been a second little woman whose name he did not know for master hob had been busy with some other task if this sort of thing was easy work he did not want to contemplate what the peasants outside of the grounds of the cottage would do with him if they caught him trying to escape but his memory was giving him some hints with bits of recollection of things he hadnt paid a lot of attention to at the time donkeys with bundles strapped to their backs to the point where it was hard to see anything but four staggering legs and a nose donkeys hitched to carts that a warhorse would have been hard put to move donkeys so thin you could have played a tune on their ribs their patchy hides showing raw rubbed places and sores where flies had been feasting on them hed seen these poor beasts often enough in the streets of eisenberg the capital of kohlstania and in polterkranz the city where the military academy had been hed seen them and his eyes had skimmed right over them he certainly hadnt done anything about them he had plenty of time to think about them now hauling things didnt take a lot of mental concentration why did you look right past us said those sad reproachful eyes in his memory why did you ignore us why didnt you help us but they were just donkeys brute beasts he tried to rationalize they werent men they hadnt been men they couldnt suffer as i am suffering oh no replied that other hateful voice in the back of his mind really and it would force him to remember those thin bodies those sores those hopeless glazed eyes those thoughts well plagued him like the flies hed been cursed with until another little man this one called master robin had come out with a bottle of something that master hob had rubbed into his hair and hide it smelled sharply of herbs but whatever it was it kept the flies away nothing kept the thoughts away nor was that all it was only when he hurt the most that he thought about those donkeys when he was resting other thoughts swarmed him what was his father thinking julians palfrey must have gotten home by now riderless with cut reins what was the king thinking what was he doing had he sent out riders to look for julian to ask after octavian and alexander if he had he would have found only that their trail stopped at the forest and he could scour the forest all he liked but hed find no trace of any of the three of them would he send to king stancia if he did hed find out that julian at least was there what was going on for julian were the trials of the glass mountain over had he won the girl and the throne or had he already started his defeated way homeward and what would he tell their father in either case the questions buzzed in his head like the flies and tormented him they were his last thoughts before he went to sleep at night and his first thoughts when he awoke in the morning there were other questions too but they were not as urgent still when his mind wearied of going around and around in the same fruitless track they did float to the surface just who and what was this fairy godmother person what did she want with him it wasnt ransom or anything else he could understand it wasnt some sick desire to see him suffer because she was never around or at least never around him what did she want what did she think she would gain from keeping him in the shape of a donkey if she was this powerful a magician what in heavens name was she doing in this cottage out in the middle of nowhere why wasnt she ruling a kingdom herself it made no sense it all made his head ache and none of it stopped the anger inside him from building either he worked it out during the day by throwing himself into the tasks hed been given but it burned in him all the time such was the state of his mind and heart when on the morning of the seventh day of his captivity he woke slowly as ever in the thin grey light of predawn to find that he was himself again and the mysterious godmother was standing over him magic wand in her hand chapter he lay there staring up at her stupidly for a moment his vision was a bit foggy and more than a bit distorted he had trouble focusing until he realized that his eyes were now on the front of his head not the sides he shook his head trying to make his mind wake up then of all the ridiculous things to be worried about his first reaction was of horror that he had come back as a man and was now lying there naked in front of her at her feet like some sort of of naked slave boy the voice in the back of his mind suggested slyly but in the next moment relief washed over him for no he was exactly as he had been when he was transformed into an ass in the first place he was still wearing the same clothing in fact though it was a bit worse for wear he blinked again his eyes still having trouble focusing and the feeling of having only two legs again was extremely disorienting wake up your highness she said prodding him in the ribs with a toe her tone of voice making the honorific sound very sarcastic i cant leave you a donkey forever much as i would like to if i do youll become more ass and less man with every passing day not that you werent an ass already she added matteroffactly but it was a rather different sort of ass he really wasnt thinking as she was speaking he was really still waking up right up until the moment she finished talking to him then with a jolt his mind started working and he didnt exactly think instead he reacted in the way he had fantasized he would in the first hours of his captivity he leaped to his feet he meant to lunge at her at this vile witch who had ruined his life he had done it so many times in his mind he would throw her to the ground and truss her up then demand that she restore him his possessions and send him home but his balance was all wrong his legs didnt work right but after tripping and falling he scrambled to his feet again anyway he made a grab for her and there was a sort of bang and a flash of light and he found himself flat on his back in the straw with a monumental headache as i was saying the woman said calmly but with an edge to her voice and her blue eyes flashing with suppressed anger i cant leave you in the donkeyskin for more than a few days without your mind becoming more donkeylike she looked down at him and shook her head not that it would be a huge difference apparently so once a week or so youll get to be a man for a day and he leaped to his feet for a third time despite pain in his head that threatened to send him to his knees this time he didnt make the mistake of trying to attack her instead he just shoved blindly past her and ran he blundered into the wall of the stable but the clean chill air braced him and he staggered a few more paces then broke into a real run his steps growing more sure with every moment in the thin grey predawn light he got his bearings by the cottage he could get away the witch hadnt a prayer of catching him after all he knew the forest around here now he even knew how to get to the village and while the villagers might not treat an enchanted donkey with any consideration they couldnt ignore the demands of a prince of kohlstania he sprinted down the path to the cottage then leaped the low stone wall around the garden and pelted for the road in a moment hed be in the forest under the trees and she didnt have a horse to chase him on nor did she have a hound to track him with he found himself pelting down the path to the stable he whirled and reversed himself running this time for the forest itself rather than the road there must be some sort of spell on the road fine hed get into the forest and get onto the road again later hed get to the village that way that would be even better she couldnt possibly find him in the forest and he found himself running down the path to the stable so how many tries you going to make before you figure it out boy asked a voice to his right he stopped and looked the little woman called lily stepped out from between two blackberry canes her head crowned by a flat straw hat bobbing with suppressed laughter you reckon were all as big a set of fools as you are its you the enchantments on not the path nor the forest you cant leave here unless the godmother lets you he heard footsteps coming towards him and saw the witch emerging from the stable and walking towards him in a leisurely fashion a smug smile on her face and rage completely overcame him he seized a pointed stake supporting a plant and yanked it out of the ground he hadnt intended to kill her before but this was clearly war and none of the laws of chivalry applied and if he couldnt touch her he was a prizewinner at the spear and javelin he pulled his arm back to impale her at the same time he caught a kind of silvery flash out of the corner of his eye and suddenly he found himself looking at something very sharp the tip of which was less than an inch from his eye it was the shining silver tip of a unicorns horn he clutched at his improvised spear wondering if he could manage to duck under the threatening horn to kill it before it killed him there was a second flash and a second unicorn in his path this one was braced to charge and the tip of its horn was pointed somewhat lower than the firsts very much lower he gulped and his hands clenched hard on the stake i wouldnt do that if i were you said the first unicorn its voice hard and angry thats right you arent a virgin the second said in a tone of accusation then it snickered but try it go ahead and youll wish you were his mind raced for a moment what did being a virgin have to do with oh of course unicorns were not only held spellbound by virgins but they were the protectors of virgins he remembered the things in the nightshrouded garden the conversation hed overheard so the witch was a virgin not a big surprise he thought sullenly if this is how she treats real men he dropped the stake and the unicorn imperiling his eyeball backed away a pace or two without dropping its threatening posture the witch came up even with the second unicorn and placed a hand on its shoulder oh yes the bitch is a virgin all right it would have been funny under other circumstances to see how the unicorn tried simultaneously to melt under the witchs touch and maintain its threatening posture towards alexander she would have been attractive under other circumstances he wouldnt have minded tumbling her if he found her serving as potgirl in an inn but at the moment now if i may continue the woman said one hand absently petting the unicorns neck you will be permitted to wear your shape as a man from sunrise to sunset when you will become an ass again he thought for a moment that she was going to make another one of those nasty comments but she evidently restrained herself but just because youre wearin your manshape my lad dont think that means you dont work said that detestable master hob from behind him the same rules hold true whether youre a man or a beast if you dont work you dont eat the unicorns both seemed to wake up a bit and became all threat again and perhaps that was because master hob stepped past alexander and shoved an axe into his empty hands he hefted it experimentally it was a woodmans axe of course and not a waraxe but dont even think about it master hob warned and poked him hard in the ribs with the stake hed dropped shes been easy on ye until now and theres more unicorns where these twain come from dont i even get some breakfast first he said plaintively his voice sounded unpleasantly whiny even to him the witch raised one eyebrow master hob nodded at the east sun isnt up yet he countered you go over to the woodpile and you chop some wood your breakfastll be ready when its ready you ought to let us poke him godmother said one of the unicorns as the prince slouched angrily away in the direction of the woodpile you ought to drop the spell and let us chase him away with holes in his hide you dont need him here of course i dont need him here she replied looking after him thoughtfully but he needs to be here he has lessons to learn then let him learn them in the forest said the second in an uncanny echo of what master hob had said to her just this morning before she transformed him that ones all trouble madame elena hed said shaking his head let me go down to the village and buy us a new donkey drive him out into the forest like his brother she tapped her cheek with her wand looking after him astonishing how like a sulky adolescent he looked from the back and finally shook her own head and walked briskly back up the path to the cottage she was of two minds about letting him inside to eat on the one hand she wanted to keep an eye on him to assess him on the other the rest of the household was divided over keeping him on and that sort of tension would only be increased if he shared the breakfast table with the rest of them lily thought he was hilarious and so did rose robin was of two minds about him hob thought he was trouble waiting to happen randolfs reaction was predictable to randolf prince alexander and his family were a fresh new source of entertainment julians horse had returned to its stable with the desired effect king henrick had frantically sent searchers on the path of the princes only to learn that once they entered phaelins wood they vanished he was frantic he had sent messengers on to king stancia to determine if any of the princes had arrived but the messengers were being delayed by stancias sorcerer prince julian had only just completed the last of the tasks which was to play chess with the sorcerer with impossible stakes now the sorcerers intention there had been something that was the talk of all of the white magicians that had heard about it everyone agreed that the way he set up the final task was a brilliant bit of trickery if julian lost two things would happen the princess would be spared the sorcerer cleverly did not specify what she would be spared the second thing was you will meet your fate but of course at this point julian was putting the worst possible interpretations on everything he assumed that it meant that the princess would live and he julian would die on the other hand if julian won the outcome would be just as bad from the point of view of someone who was worried about the princess you will live the princess will be no more of course what he didnt know was that the princess would be no more because her father intended to make her queen and coruler with her new husband and julian of course being the gallant young fellow that he was and probably hoping that somehow he could wiggle out of the fate that awaited him threw the game so by losing he won which was the whole point of the trial not the outcome of the game itself at this point of course the tradition was in full flood and the moment they set eyes on each other they were passionately in love the sorcerer was making certain that the wedding went off unhindered in order to have king henricks messengers arrive at the weddingfeast itself beautiful timing this put any idea of julian returning home out of the question he was prince regnant now and had his own kingdom to rule king stancia having established julian and his daughter as corulers and intending to abdicate in a year or so so the messengers would return home with the news that the most despised of the three had triumphed but with only the vaguest hints of what had happened to the other two princes meanwhile karelina in phaelins wood had passed octavian on to arachnia and that was proving to be a stroke of genius arachnia and her consort looked the part of evil sorcerers and at this point they really enjoyed playing the part so long as they could do so without ever harming anyone so octavian was now wandering about in arachnias forest a place perpetually shrouded in gloom dripping with rain thick with willothewisps and foxfire abounding in giant frogs enormous insects and colossal spiders some of the weirder tribes of the fair folk liked to live in such surroundings and they were all of the mischiefmaking sort the place was tailormade to give octavian the sort of lesson he deserved and eventually arachnia herself would take over the final portion of it as he was reduced to begging at the door of her kitchen for shelter and work and when he proved himself worthy he would be sent home beautifully clothed and armed on a finer horse than anything king henrick had in the stables randolf had done some delving into the past for her and it seemed that octavian was less of a bully than elena had thought the bullying was octavians clumsy attempt to get julian to come up to the standard that their father thought was acceptable it wasnt done out of sadism or spite in fact octavian was dimly worried for his youngest brother afraid well what he was afraid of was the sort of thing that one didnt talk about in kohlstania but one single conversation that randolf dug up explained it all octavian had been talking to his best friend the masteratarms of the castle afraid hes turning into a octavians voice had dropped to a whisper a nancyboy both men had shuddered as at a fate so much worse than death it didnt bear thinking about octavian had straightened his shoulders gotta cure him of that by god hed said gruffly cant have that in the family disgrace besides papad kill him and octavian had then gone about making his clumsy simpleminded best effort to turn julian into a real man for his own good alexander had missed all of this of course having been packed off to the military academy to get him away from julians possible taint all of which explained a great deal about the youngest and oldest scions of the kohlstanian royal family julian was the rebel in his own quiet way and had come out of it all the better man certainly the more humane man octavian desperately needed some of that moral superiority shaken out of him but alexander alexander was a different kettle of fish altogether he was afflicted with octavians sense of moral superiority he was also afflicted with a case of class superiority but there was one more little problem with prince alexander it was what the military academy had made out of him she sighed she did not understand it and could only observe the results which were dire there was no apparent connection in his mind between himself and the vast majority of mankind the only people that mattered were the ones of his class and a little below everyone else was chattel she suspected this was because the military academy to which he had been sent turned out officers that treated their men like little counters on a gameboard fodder for the front lines and not human at all and it was a place reserved only for the sons of the elite of kohlstania which only reinforced the cadets sense of superiority whatever the reason it would take more than wandering about as octavian was doing to drive it home to him that he was when all else was stripped away no better than any other man and quite a bit worse than a lot of them i believe hed better eat in the garden she decided aloud and went on to help robin in the kitchen at least he had learned his first lesson as a donkey according to rose who brought him his breakfast there was quite a pile of chopped and split wood already stacked up for seasoning elena had almost brought him his breakfast herself except that she had realized even as she was reaching for plates that there was something other than her own thoughts nudging her down that particular path and when she realized that she stopped closed her eyes and felt the unmistakable presence of the tradition when rose brought the dirty plates back she took a moment to check again and there was no doubt the tradition was trying to fit them into a tale at that moment she thought she could hear madame bella and her warning about what having a prince hanging about a godmother could mean she tightened her lips and realized that it was far more important for her to keep the upper hand with him than she had realized there was no place in the tradition for a godmother to be courted honorably by a prince therefore the tradition would be hunting for some other option that might fit the most logical one was to fit him in as the prisoner which in effect he was and there was a precedent for good magicians holding royalty prisoner in order to facilitate their going through a set of trials that was the path she wanted this thing to take the trouble was in that case the magician was usually old and male the tradition was having some difficulty with her being neither so the next logical role for alexander was that of the seducer and ultimately the betrayer and as for her she remembered all too well what bella had told her she was supposed to have been the bride of a prince and hence every unmarried prince that crossed her path was going to be irresistibly attractive to her she was going to have to fight that every moment that he was not a donkey hob was right the man was trouble the problem was she had taken the situation on she was honorbound now to see it through im an idiot she muttered under her breath and went off to see the unicorns the stallions had agreed to let her have as much magic as she wanted which was considerably less than she was going to take there was at least one bright spot in all of this if the tradition was going to start trying to manipulate her again there was going to be magic accumulating around her magic she could siphon off of herself for the first time since she had become a godmother there was a sort of ironic justice in it she was going to have the magic she needed to fight the will of the tradition from the magic the tradition was using to try to force her to its will and using that magic to fight the tradition was only going to make the tradition bring more magic to bear on her which she could in her turn use to fight it it was enough to make a sane person dizzy at least she was getting firewood for the winter out of all of this confined to the cottage and grounds as he was alexander got his fill of looking at the witch early in the day as the sun rose and the heat increased hob took him off cutting wood and moved him to carrying water for the brownie lily to water the garden at several points in the proceedings that woman sauntered past with a unicorn following her like a faithful dog and finally he muttered something under his breath the brownie had sharper ears than he had reckoned on shes not a witch lily said matteroffactly as she carefully watered the base of each of the squash plants what he asked shes not a witch lily repeated shes a fairy godmother except that shes mortal not one of the fair folk he muttered something under his breath the brownie evidently took this to mean that he was interested and proceeded to lecture him at length about witches godmothers and sorceresses and how they were different from each other he got some relief from the lecture when he had to go fetch more water but not much since she took it up again where she had left off the moment he returned and she asked him questions about what shed told him just as if she was one of his tutors if he didnt answer to her satisfaction she went on about it until his head was full of it and he took to paying attention just so she wouldnt natter endlessly about it so much so by the time he got to take a break for something to eat at around noon he knew a thousand times more about magicians than hed ever learned in his entire life at least he knew enough not to call that woman a witch again though he was damned if hed call her godmother he thought about mistress with the sarcastic inflection that would turn it into an insult but decided on the whole hed better stick to what the brownies called her madame elena arrogant bitch after lunch master hob came and dragged him off to some other work helping to lay the drystone wall that he had hauled stone for as a donkey at least hob didnt lecture finally though when he saw that woman wander by three times in the course of what could not even have been an hour he growled under his breath oh godmother is it baseborn peasant more like belongs in the kitchen she does too stupid to recognize her betters cleaning pots would be good enough for her doesnt she ever do any work hob stopped what he was doing stopped dead and in a cold voice that put goose bumps on alexanders arms said dont ever say that in my hearing again no threat no punishment just that and somehow that simple sentence felt more imperiling than a cold knifeblade laid along his neck he coughed hob ignored him not as in merely ignored him but as in paid no attention to him because his intelligence was less than that of the village idiot to say he resented that was an understatement but he was also not going to push things because thanks to lilys lecture he knew what exactly the four little people were though they might play at being servants they were fair folk and if the tales of his childhood were anything to go by they could be powerful he already knew that hob was physically stronger than any two adult human men and all you had to do was look at the amount of wall hed built today by himself to know that there was something quite formidable about the brownie hob had magic himself for sure because every stone he laid and he laid them twice as fast as a human mason was placed perfectly and never moved or shifted alexander wasnt particularly anxious to see hob perform some sort of magic on him he must have offended hob more deeply than he guessed for about dinnertime hob simply got up and stalked off leaving him there beside the stone wall wondering what to do it was lily who came for him a moment later come along young fool she said beckoning to him youve gotten hob in a temper you have and that takes some doing alexander got up and followed her obediently as she led the way to the kitchen yard she pointed at the pump wash yourself up she told him curtly and yes i know what you said around hob maybe your kind dont think that much of an insult but im going to tell you why our kind does and while he stripped himself to the waist while he washed himself in cold water and harsh soap until she was satisfied and while he donned the clean coarse clothing of a baseborn laborer that she handed to him she told him he got the main idea early on how it was the godmothers and the wizards who worked tirelessly to keep things running smoothly but as she elaborated on her theme detailing all that madame elena had herself accomplished in the last several weeks he found himself grudgingly impressed against his will it wasnt so much the steering of lives into the most pleasant or at least the least harmful path it was something else the way that the godmothers also served as intermediaries between the world of the fully magical and the real world that he had until now at least lived in madame elena had been doing a respectable amount of what he would call herding protecting the fair folk from human encroachment and the humans from fair folk meddling used to be before there was a lot of godmothers and wizards half the time a farmer wouldnt know when he went out to his barn of a morning whether hed find his horses lathered up from being stolen for a wild hunt in the night or whether his cows had been milked dry and as for you socalled highborn lot well used to be unless you had nurserymaids awake all night and horseshoes over the cradle youd end up with a changeling in place of your firstborn thered be fair folk coming around at feasttime and woe betide if you failed in courtesy theres many a noble house was in ruins within a year or still has some dreadful curse hanging over it because the door got slammed in some fae queen or elven knights face and then there was what you mortals used to do to our kind now as it happened this was one aspect of which alexander himself had direct experience and no reason to doubt when he had first been sent to the military academy his best friend had been another young prince the only other royal scion in the place at the time robert of bedroford the instructors and indeed some of the other pupils had kept their distance from the likable young lad for no reason that alexander had been able to see his own valet had tried to discourage the friendship but when he had been unable to dissuade alexander by indirect means had finally shrugged and said enigmatically well perhaps it wont come being as he isnt home what it was no one would tell him and robert had seemed blissfully unaware of the existence of it then came the morning of roberts seventeenth birthday the two of them had planned to spend it together once drills and lessons were done but robert was missing from his bed at reveille frantic searching and questioning of the servants finally uncovered a single kitchengirl whod seen him just after midnight going down to the stables whitefaced and moving like a man in a nightmare hed emerged a short while later astride a huge black redeyed stallion and galloped off into the night now as alexander himself knew there were no stallions of any color and no black horses redeyed or otherwise in the academy stables in point of fact because the academy uniform was a handsome dark blue all of the academy horses were a carefully dappledgrey so that all of them matched and all of them were geldings a search party was organized but it had seemed to alexander that it was a singularly disorganized party with no sense of urgency to it and in fact nothing was found a week later a letter had come from bedroford which alexander as roberts friend had been permitted to read prince roberts body had been deposited as anticipated on the threshold of the palace by a huge black redeyed stallion at dawn on the morning of his birthday it was the phrase as anticipated that had come as a shock even more of a shock had been the explanation carefully and clinically given to him the royal house of bedroford it seemed was under a curse incurred when the firstborn son and heir had insulted an elven queen and stolen her favorite stallion five hundred years before since that time the firstborn son of every generation was doomed to try to ride the elven stallion between midnight and dawn of his seventeenth birthday very few of them survived the experience as the stallion could and usually did perform antics such as galloping along the bottoms of rivers and charging along the tops of mountains where the air was too thin to breathe and of course it could and did gallop through the faerie realms as well which contained things that were not meant for mortal eyes of all of the firstborn princes of bedroford only three had survived the ride and of those three only one had emerged sane all this alexander had learned only after roberts death his family had hoped that the curse might be subverted if he was not raised at home that when the stallion came for him it would look for him at bedroford and not finding him give up clearly nothing of the kind had happened have you ever heard of the curse on bedroford he asked hesitantly she put her hands on her hips and raised an eyebrow oh yes and have you ever heard our side of it she didnt give him a chance to answer young fool makes a drunken bet marches into the high hall as drunk as a tinker sits down at the queens table and treats her like his doxy then if you please he steals the black horse bad enough except the black horse is her brother and the bridle he bound the horse with was made with cold iron he was a year in healing cant show his face now without a mask he bears the scars and the pain of them to this day mark one of us with cold iron and we suffer from it forever and thanks to that hell never be made king for our kings must be without flaw alexander thought about robert thought about all of the princes before robert who had died then thought about living forever in pain denied the right to your own throne it might drive you mad its thanks to the godmothers and the wizards that sort of thing doesnt happen nearly as often anymore and you lot dont see any of this lily finished crossly handing him a thick wooden comb to get the tangles out of his hair with because thats the way its supposed to be them as dont want to be bothered with magic doesnt have to see it which lets us as is magic go about our business without having to turn the likes of you into toads out of temper and that doesnt even begin to cover what all the white mages do keeping the dark court fae away from you and the black mages in check so dont you dare even hint that madame elena doesnt work she reclaimed the soap and her comb snatched up his filthy clothing and stalked off she returned with his dinner and shoved it at him then stalked off again apparently no one was going to invite him to the table he glanced around and finally elected to sit on another section of drystone wall to eat he could hear the murmur of voices in the kitchen and occasional laughter he wondered if they were laughing at him sunrise to sunset he didnt have much longer as himself hed better enjoy it as the sun began to set elena reluctantly finished the last of her pastry and went out to look for the prince a bit to her surprise because it wouldnt have been out of keeping with his attitude for him to try to make a few more attempts at escape she found him waiting in the garden back in his princely now clean clothing again there was a stubborn set to his chin and a rebellious glare in his eyes but she ignored both and crooked her little finger at him down to the stable my lad she said leading the way another surprise he followed he had looked quite different in the sort of loose shirt and breeches that common folks wore with his hair all tousled and roughcombed he wouldnt have been out of place in the village though she had to admit he was quite a bit handsomer than most of the village lads hmm break hearts and promises and never give a damn either she reminded herself as the last light of sunset faded from the sky she watched her spell take hold again watched the despair on his face before it turned into that of a donkey and decided out of fairness to him to at least tell him what had happened to his brothers she perched on an upturned bucket your brother julian has won king stancias daughter she began oh yes the donkey grumbled with your help cheating no it wasnt she retorted my test was as valid as any of the others and for your information twenty young men both royal and common passed that same test at the hands of other white mages julian was the twentyfirst quester to make it that far but he was the only one to get the help of all three wilderness spirits before he got there wilderness spirits was that what you were gabbling about with him the donkey asked reluctantly as if the words were being pulled from him the first was a foxspirit whose tail was caught in a tree that one was fairly obvious the second was a lark whose nest was being threatened by a snake that one only about half of the questers spotted the final one was something you truly had to look for she smiled to herself but the donkey noticed his ears flattened a little sulkily a queen ant on her maiden flight was caught in a spiderweb he heard her crying and freed her what good is an ant the donkey asked crossly now the first task on the mountain was to get into the maze that surrounds it by going past the lion at the obvious entrance she continued ignoring him that was where the fox came in she could slip through a rabbit tunnel dug under the wall and trip the latch to a locked door on the other side the second task was to thread the maze and that was where the lark came in she could hover above and call out the right turnings but the third task was to separate a bushel of wheat from a bushel of oats and place the oats in one measure of a scale and the wheat in the other only if the scale balanced correctly proving youd separated them all would the door to the sorcerers tower open it was the ants that separated the grain for julian the queen he had saved called on them and got them to help him those are stupid tasks the donkey burst out what about fighting a terrible monster or climbing a cliff things that would prove a quester is a good warrior what about them she replied the mountain itself is enough to prove whether or not you are strong and can endure as for fighting she shrugged any fool can fight the wise man is one who knows when not to and when to rely on the cleverness of others there was a long moment of quiet shadows had begun to fill the stable and she wondered if alexander had fallen asleep so what was the final task the donkey asked suddenly out of the darkness she told him huh he grunted so wheres the cleverness in that he had to lose without making it look as if he was losing on purpose otherwise the sorcerer would have known he was stupid not gallant and willing to sacrifice himself she replied huh another silence does my father know yes she told him and left it at that now i have things to do good night huh said the donkey as she rose she waited a moment longer but there was not even a curt good night coming from the shadowy corner of the stall where he stood still no more manners than a donkey she thought in disgust and left him alone in the dark chapter alexander bided his time during the next six days working well like a donkey waiting for the seventh day when he would be himself again all right so he couldnt escape because of that womans spell very well he would break the spell by breaking her wand he had tried to remember as many nurserytales about magic as he could and every one of them said that when you broke a magicians wand you broke all the spells that had been cast with it and if that didnt work he had some other ideas sure enough at dawn on the seventh day he woke up to find himself in his own shape again and in his old clothes with the woman standing over him as before this time though he feigned sleep until his disorientation and dizziness passed waiting for her to poke him with a toe again wake up your highness she said again with that smirk in her voice that turned it into an insult this is no holiday that was when he jumped up out of the straw seized her wand before she or master hob could react and broke it over his knee at the least he expected a flash of light and a peal of thunder as all of her spells fell apart what he got was a peal of laughter in fact that woman was so convulsed with laughter that she had to hold onto the wall of his stall to keep standing up she bent nearly double with one hand on her stomach tears leaking out of the corners of her eyes as she laughed it was master hob who supplied the explanation around peals of laughter of his own ye gurt fool he howled what sort of ignoramuses are they growing in your country ye think a magicians power is in a puny thing like her wand his face must have fallen a mile for one look at it set master hob off a second time and that woman too and when she picked up the pieces and fitted them back together again as if the wand had never been broken at all that just put the icing on the cake for him all his energy ran out of him in a single moment like water out of a broken jug utterly crestfallen he slouched his way up to the woodpile without being ordered eager to get away from their pitiless laughter thank heavens they did not follow him and he picked up the axe waiting for him in a foul angry state of mind he worked off his anger on the wood all right so his first ploy had failed he still had a second string to his bow and hed bide his time and watch for an opportunity to try it today it had to be today he didnt want to spend another week as a beast he wanted to go home he had to be careful though the one thing he didnt want around when he tried his second plan was a unicorn it wouldnt be hard to carry off really the wench was pretty enough curled golden hair that she wore without powder surely a sign that she was base born sparkling blue eyes a luscious red mouth that practically begged for kisses skin like cream and the peasantcostume she wore most often displayed the best and most interesting of her attributes to the fullest a pair of ripe breasts that made his groin tighten even when he was around her as a donkey if hed seen her working in the castle hed have tried for her assuming octavian hadnt gotten there first of course his father wouldnt have liked it he didnt like the idea of anyone trifling with the staff but he wouldnt have been more than annoyed about it id have gotten a lecture but no worse than that a woman like that still a virgin shed probably been mewed up here with some old stick teaching her magic never seeing a proper man alone a waste that was a damned waste shed be easy so long as he could corner her somewhere without a unicorn or one of those brownies about to interfere he was angry now and it made him want to humiliate her bring her to heel show her who was the rightful master here master thats what she needed all right a master and women needed that needed to be shown their place whether or not they realized it they wanted it too especially a baseborn peasant wooing was too subtle for them a woman like that wanted to be conquered wanted to be overwhelmed thats all these peasants knew really they were like rutting animals no subtlety to their lovemaking once she had an idea of what a real man could do shed quit this nonsense about teaching him lessons and come to heel like a proper wench not before lunch though he had to work off his anger and besides he wanted the memory of his humiliation to have faded before he tried it was after luncheon that his opportunity came the last of the drystone wall was laid the woman lily was off somewhere doing something else and didnt need his hand at watering the garden just then and he was alone in the kitchen yard that was when she came by basket full of some herbage or other without a unicorn in tow and not a brownie in sight he stepped into her path her thoughts were clearly elsewhere and she practically ran into him she stopped looked up at him with a frown as if just now really seeing him for a moment he thought she was going to say something then she shrugged he moved to block her way completely as she tried to step around him and her frown deepened those eyes beginning to take on the hue of stormclouds shouldnt you be doing something she asked irritably yes he replied and seized her crushing his mouth down on hers ruthlessly left hand around her waist right hand thrust into the top of her bodice for one glorious moment he felt her warm breast under his hand the nipple hardening against his palm tasted the faint sweet taste of her mouth as he thrust his tongue past unresisting lips there was a flash of light and a sound like a church bell booming right in his ear then nothing and he woke up flat on his back in the straw in his stall his head aching as if from a dozen blows and when he tried to move he realized that every headache hed ever had including the other ones her magic had left him with was nothing compared with this one whats the matter cried robin in alarm as elena stormed into the kitchen and threw the basket of herbs at the table it skidded across the tabletop and landed on the floor that that that man she shouted scrubbing at her mouth with the back of her hand to get the taste of him out of it he tried to to seduce me i warned you rose said dourly coming into the kitchen and rescuing the basket and its contents i told you he was going to be trouble ill just take these to the stillroom shall i well hes trouble with an aching head now she replied savagely and if he tries that again ill ill geld him i doubt thatll be necessary hob put in his bit coming in through the door from the yard himself but i think ill just go threaten him with it after he wakes up from your spell that is i saw you knock him down just now and i just dragged him off and put him in the stall by the way hell be unconscious for an hour at least that much gave her some satisfaction he was going to lose some of his precious time as a man and serve him right im going upstairs leave me alone until dinner please the houseelves exchanged significant looks but she pretended not to see them at the moment she wanted to be alone to get herself under control again and not because she was angry or to be completely accurate not just because she was angry and not just because she was angry at him she ran up the stairs and through the sitting room to fling herself into a chair at the window fortunately the curtains over randolfs mirror were closed not that he couldnt have seen what happened for himself of course but at least she wouldnt have to talk to him about it once again she rubbed her mouth with the back of her hand in a very unladylike fashion her lips felt bruised well hed be feeling a bit bruised himself when he woke up she didnt actually know how hard her magic had hit him when shed finally gotten over her shock she was so angry that she had lashed out without thinking he was lucky she hadnt used a killingstroke instead of the disabling one brute beast how dare he try to overpower her like that did he think she was some idiot milkmaid in a bawdy song ready to spread her legs for the first goodlooking man who came her way actually that was probably exactly what hed thought and the tradition had done its best to make his thought a reality evidently bawdy songs created as many paths as the traditional tales did she would have to remember that from now on shed felt it when he kissed her felt it hit her nearly as hard as her spell had hit him felt the weight of it crashing down on both of them making her knees go weak parting her lips for him making her secret places feel tight and hot with a rush of longing as she she realized what was happening and slashed at the thought with venom damn it it was doing it again furious now she got up and splashed cold water on her hot face no she thought at it summoning up images of ice and snow of frozen rivers and chill grey skies no damn you you will not do that to me half of her wanted to send him away now this instant sending him away perhaps to a wizard would be so much safer she would never have to see him again and surely there was someone she could trust with his education half of her refused to even consider the idea of giving up it wasnt only that she hated to concede that she had failed which she hadnt not yet it wasnt only that now that she was looking into his past with randolf she had an idea that if she could just get past the arrogance and the assumption of superiority there was something there that could be worked with well look at octavian she would have been willing to bet that it was going to take until winter set in before he humbled himself to appear at arachnias castle to offer himself as a kitchenboy but there he was scrubbing pots submitting himself to the insults of her cook ithink it was the mirrormede arachnia had said in her letter brought by bat just last night he managed to find his way to the mirrormede you know that naiad pool i have that shows people what they most need to see about half the time it shows people the present about a quarter of the time it shows them what other people think of them and about a quarter of the time it shows them their future as it will be if they go on as they are i dont know what he saw in it but whatever it was its shaken him to the core whatever it was and elena had to wonder if it wasnt a glimpse of the future the image of him that randolf showed her was a far cry from the arrogant prince that had passed her by without a word he was working as arachnias lowest stablehand he took the abuse that her coachman heaped on him without a word of complaint and he had begun to take notice of the timid little tweenie who served as the cooks scullerymaid if he was moved to protect her rather than abuse her himself that would signal the moment when the ruse would be dropped and arachnia would send him home so it was clear that julian was already a decent fellow it appeared that octavian was good enough stock to have an unexpectedly swift redemption so there was plenty of hope for alexander plenty of hope for such a handsome fellow with such fine broad shoulders and hard strong body with a face like a young god and hands that knew how to caress a stop that furious all over again she stood up out of her chair and gazed up at the ceiling without really thinking about it she gathered her power around her like storm clouds filled with the lightning of her anger and she confronted the tradition in her mind as if she was a sorceress facing off against a great enemy of her own now you can just listen to me right now she told the tradition and anything or anyone else that might overhear i will not go play the greensick goosegirl to suit your tales and your plans you cannot seduce me with a pretty face i am godmother elena by all thats holy and i was elena klovis before that me myself and no puppet to be danced about on a path you choose i did not lie down for my stepmother to be ella cinders and i will not lie down for a prince with a handsome face i refuse to be any mans doxy to be flung aside and forgotten i will be me on my own terms by my own rules with my own plans and my own decisions everything went very still then very very still once again elena had the feeling of great power looming over her but this time it was waiting waiting for something some direction perhaps whatever it was it was certainly listening to her now not even a breath of breeze stirred in the room she realized that she could not hear anything outside the room not the cackling of the chickens in the garden not the houseelves working inside or outside not the birds in the sky nor the wind in the birches the skin on the back of her neck prickled her back was to the window but she wondered if she dared to turn around and look would she see the world going on as usual out there or would she see nothing at all something very odd perhaps even unprecedented was happening here godmother bella had never ever told her about anything like this she needed to say something she knew that as certain as the blood flowed in her veins she felt it in her bones something wanted shaping words are power in a magicians mouth choose them carefully and yet she always got her best results when she wasnt too specific when she let the power choose its own shape she took a deep breath one by one the words fell carefully from her lips a playfellow ill be but no mans toy a partner helper but no ones servant nor slave i will be captain of my fate and commander of my destiny though the path i may share and the course i chart be followed by others what i have ill share but ill not give it over what i am i am and ill not change it what i will be i will be by my own will and no other now take that and make something of it there was something like a great intaking of breath something like a sigh then the world gave a shake like a dog and dropped back to normal she wondered what she had bound or what she had unleashed alexander was getting used to waking up to find people standing over him wearing unpleasant expressions what he was not used to was finding people standing over him holding a crude metal instrument in one hand that he happened to recognize master hob must have seen his eyes track immediately to that hand and what it held because he smiled grimly i assume ye know what this is ye creamfaced loon he asked happens im practiced in the use of it never seen any reason to keep jack or stallion around here when a geldings so much steadier a great shudder of horror convulsed alexander as he stared at the hideous thing and itd be wise for ye to remember my lad master hob continued softly but with great menace what happens to the ass happens to you it felt as if a cold hand closed around his throat and he nodded slowly good now we understand each other master hob turned but only to stow the dreadful object in the pocket of a leather apron hanging on a hook next to his stall she might be put out if she found id been altering ye but itd be too late by that time shed rather just keep you in the asss skin for longer i take a more direct approach to the problem he shuddered again he had no doubt that the little man would follow through on the threat if it suited him now then up with ye master hob continued and i doubt not yeve an aching head and too bad mistress lily needs help with her watering again so aching head or no aching head he got up and followed the little man back up to the cottage garden it had been a long day it was getting longer by the moment it took two days before his fear wore itself out and his anger came back to the surface he wanted to kill her she had ruined his life and that assumed he was ever going to have a life again at least a life as he had known it no he didnt want to kill her he wanted to humiliate her he wanted to see her crawl wanted to see her humbled wanted to see her made lower than the lowest whore in the cheapest tavern in the scummiest city in the five hundred kingdoms and he didnt dare touch her he might be many things but stupid wasnt one of them the unicorns never left her side anymore two of them at a time if he touched her theyd kill him if they didnt kill him her magic would knock him arse over end again he didnt care to repeat that experience the days were bad enough slaving away in harness sunup to sundown angry thoughts buzzing around in his head like bees in a disturbed hive the nights were worse he dreamed at night he dreamed of julian and nearly went mad with envy seeing him ruling his new kingdom with his exquisite young bride at his side it nearly made him sick and yet he couldnt hate julian that woman had made it quite clear that julian had won his prize fairly and if he was honest with himself and in dreams he had to be he had to admit that given the nature of the trials he would have lost but bloody hell how it grated on him it was only made worse when in those dreams julian proved himself to be a fairly good ruler not perfect it was clear enough from one or two of the decisions that alexander saw that julian had a lot to learn but he was respected and admired by his underlings and loved by his bride and his people he dreamed of octavian too dreamed of him humbled as badly as alexander was slaving away in a stable in some grim dark keep eating whatever he could beg from the kitchen cleaning filthy stalls it shocked him to see octavian brought so low it shocked him even more when he realized that in his dreams at least octavian believed that he deserved this terrible punishment and he dreamed of his father seeing king henrick as he had never seen him before not a broken man but a severely battered and lonely man pale silent and grieving two of his sons gone the only one left being not at all the favored one and in his way henrick feared to approach the only son that he knew he had left fearing what that son would say to him the father who had held him in scorn no the third son was not lost but certainly out of reach so far as henrick was concerned it cut alexander to the heart to see his father in such a state and in his dreams he tried to reach out to the king to tell him what had happened to all of his sons but he was like a phantom he could hear and see all but no one could hear or see him he would awaken from these dreams in the middle of the night sweating if he had been a man he could have wept but he was a donkey and beasts couldnt cry the best he could manage was a fit of dry wheezing sobs that shook his bones and made him ache all over and finally tired him out until he could sleep again he hated everything at that point including himself but most of all he hated her he watched her as she went about her business as she came and went from the cottage sometimes garbed as richly as any queen sometimes in the dress of the merely wealthy but mostly in her peasant guise he never knew where she was going or what she was going to do when she got there but at least twice she went out in a strange colorful cart pulled by the oddest looking excuse for a horse he had ever seen even when she was gone the work did not stop her houseelf minions acted exactly as they did when she was there to supervise them and so perforce did he finally the seventh day arrived again and he was back to being himself for whatever good it did him he couldnt think of any new plans to get himself free and the moment he was a man again the unicorns doubled their guard on her what was more he discovered by making the attempt that the cottage wouldnt allow him inside it literally there was a barrier at the doors and windows that he not only could not cross but could not see past so trying to sneak in and catch her unawares and deunicorned was not going to do him any good either he wanted with a physical ache to go home he was reduced to throwing insults at her but although master hob bristled and the unicorns glowered all she did was laugh in a contest of wit your highness i fear you are but halfarmed she said mockingly and you can call me whatever you like if it makes you feel any better being called a whore does not make me one any more than calling master hob a giant makes him thirty feet tall and she sailed off on some errand or other leaving him seething and speechless it was almost a relief when night fell and he became a donkey again another week began in anger but something odd was happening to him as the days passed there was nothing wrong with his physical energy but but he felt drained anyway the moment he was left alone without anything to do he found himself sinking into a dull lethargy it took nearly three days before he realized what was wrong and when he did the realization of what was happening took him by surprise it was getting harder and harder to sustain his anger it was as if he was blunting it against the rock of that womans indifference she clearly did not care if he was angry or in despair or indeed in any emotional state she did not even care if he hated her for the first time in his life he was below someones notice it did not matter to anyone here what he thought of her or anything else what his opinions were was of no more consequence to her than the price of corn in some far distant land how could anyone sustain any emotion in the face of that he was never going home he was certain of that now and no one would really miss him either to whom had he really endeared himself not to octavian julian well perhaps but julian knew what had become of him and if julian had really cared wouldnt he have sent someone to come looking for him his father but his father didnt really know him he was a cipher the spare useful if something happened to octavian he recalled the day he had graduated and come home home to a room that looked like every other guest chamber in the palace to a father whose presents on any occasion had always been the same thing books on military history with money tucked inside his instructors at the academy knew him better than his own father did he had not had a good friend since robert had died in a month hed been given up on in a year people might remember him with the words poor alexander in ten you would not find one person in a hundred in kohlstania who would remember he had even existed his bulwark of anger collapsed like a fortress of snow in the spring at that point without it he had nothing to sustain him and he sank into a kind of insensate despair saying nothing to hob doing what he was told eating what was placed in his manger more and more lost in a grey fog of apathy he just could not muster the mental energy even to decide to go out in the meadow and eat grass instead of the hay that was in front of him when he woke as a man for the fourth time he was still sunk in that state of despair and even hob noticed it when he came to fetch him for the mornings work the little man looked at him sharply for his part alexander just looked back at him dully without getting out of a sitting position what ails you the brownie asked sickening over something he shook his head and why should you care he thought except that you would be able to go buy a beast thats less trouble if i were to die it occurred to him that perhaps he ought to ask that woman to leave him as a donkey from now on surely getting lost in the beast would be better than this hob gave him another look even the lowest scut gets a halfday a month he said gruffly no working for you today that penetrated his fug and he raised his head a little what take it ye greengoose afore i change my mind the brownie growled and promptly turned on his heel and stomped off leaving alexander alone in the stable again no work then what was he supposed to do with himself he sat there for a long moment in the gloom but the straw prickled him and there were little rustlings of mice and insects that didnt bother him as a beast but made his skin crawl as a man with a sigh he got to his feet and wandered outside he looked around for the first time really looked around at the cottage and its grounds lying quietly in the predawn there was a light mist lying along the ground just at kneeheight giving the place an air of mystery to his right lay the stone cottage greywalled and thickly thatched the only signs of life were the birds twittering in the thatch around the windows he knew from experience that it would not be until the sun actually rose that anyone would be stirring there in front of him was the bare hard dirt of the stableyard though yard was a bit of a misnomer as there was not a great deal of space there just enough to turn a small cart around to his left were the kitchengardens and beyond that the drystone wall he had been working on so far there didnt seem to be anywhere to go behind the cottage were some little sheds the ricks of curing firewood and the chopping block where he would have been if hob hadnt ordered him to take a rest that was no help in front of the cottage was a flower and herb garden but he was hardly the sort to putter in a garden even if it had been his but all around the cottage grounds separating it from the forest was a meadow left to grow as it would where he was allowed to graze when he was a donkey he already knew that his boundary was the edge of the wood that was where he was turned back any time he tried to pass on his own but the meadow was wide and irregularly shaped he hadnt seen most of it yet and there were probably places where he could be alone for as long as hob didnt actually come looking for him for lack of anything better he wandered out through the kitchengardens over the stile and into the bottom meadow he thought there was a pond out there sure enough he found when hed waded through mist and grass for a bit that there was a pond fed by a lively little stream rimmed with willow and birch someone hob perhaps had tied a little boat up to the bank it was far too small to take someone of alexanders size and weight or he might have gone for a row just because the boat was there but if he sat down on the bank he couldnt see the cottage from here maybe he was no good at pretending that he wasnt held in this bizarre captivity but at least he wouldnt have it thrust in his nose blackbirds sang a few experimental notes in the reeds and off in the woods he heard a cuckoo it was peaceful here and somehow soothing to the aches in his soul he sank down on the bank and watched the sun come up the clear thin light streaking across the hazy blue of the sky as the birds began their morning carol he let his mind empty of everything he had never done that before but then hed never been at a place in his life where he could in kohlstania hed been prince alexander one day to be commander in chief of the army currently standing duty under the present commander and second in line for the throne in the academy hed been cadet alexander squad leader and prefect responsible for the behavior of all of the cadets subordinate to himself hed always had things to remember duties to perform here he was no one and nothing his rank mattered not at all his titles were meaningless his value only so much as paid for the food he ate and for today at least he had no responsibilities at all there was a curious freedom in that perhaps that was all that freedom really was in the end the knowledge that you had nothing and were nothing and thus had nothing to lose or gain free as a bird was synonymous with tied to nothing after all so he sat and watched the new day unfold as he had never quite watched a dawn before and for an hour at least he stopped being prince stopped even being alexander and just was the sun swiftly burned off the mist the sun dried the dew off the grass and he lay back on the soft grass and stared up at the sky he thought about going up to the cottage for breakfast but since he hadnt been working like a dog he wasnt particularly hungry ill just lie here a little he decided after everyone else has gotten food ill slip up there and get whats left if i get hungry if and somehow he slipped into a drowse without ever noticing that he had done so he dreamed or thought he dreamed and in his dream he opened his eyes at a little sound and looked into a pair of extraordinary eyes they were an intense violet color and belonged to a creature that was about the size of hob but nothing like him this was a girl a very young child wraiththin but bright with health clothed so far as he could tell in nothing but waterweeds there were waterlilies in her streaming wet hair and she gazed down at him with all the solemnity of a judge why are you so unhappy son of adam she asked in a voice that reminded him of the sound of a brook flowing over stones because i want to be free he replied without thinking i want to go home before people forget i ever existed ah the child said looking wise are you sure that is what you want of course im sure he replied id do anything to figure out how to get out of here oh that is a dangerous thing to pledge anything son of adam said the child you are lucky i am a small fae and have so little power i could do you a mischief with that pledge if i were minded she gurgled a laugh but it is a lovely day and i am a lazy fae as well as small and she tilted her head to the side considering it is in my mind that you are the thing maybe that our king called for on a day not unlike this one on a spring morning when a girl old in pain but young in power came to be weighed and judged and gifted so i will give you what you ask the thing that will help you though it may not seem that way at first to you she stood up and held out her hands which seemed to fill with light and then she spilled the light over him it floated down on him in incandescent motes that filled him with warmth as they touched him mortal heres the key to free you she halfsung and halfchanted see yourself as others see you then she suddenly lifted up on one toe spun in place and vanished with a tinkling laugh and a glow that blinded him there was nothing standing above him and no sign there ever had been anything but dream he blinked and raised a hand to rub his eyes maybe i am sickening for something he muttered to himself what kind of a daft dream had that been his stomach growled and he sat up and maybe some of the leaden lethargy had lifted he was hungry anyway breakfast first then see what would happen on a day when nothing was happening as he had come to expect he got to his feet and brushed himself off and really saw the clothing he was wearing each day that he had spent as himself he had awakened in it and despite all the heavy labor he did while working in it the clothing looked exactly as it had the moment he had been transformed into a donkey the first day after he had washed lily had taken it from him and given him coarse common laborers clothing hed taken back his own and put it on damp when shed washed it after that first day he had refused to surrender it but now as he brushed grass and bits of leaf and twig from the tight militarystyle breeches and tunic he paused in dismay not because it was filthy because it wasnt it was no dirtier than it had been when hed been so unceremoniously transfigured but he realized at that moment how utterly ridiculous it was it was completely unsuitable for doing the sort of work hed been put to too tight too ornamented too ostentatious too impractical too hot there was a reason why that woman swanned about in her peasant garb this was a farm and she was working just as hard as the rest of them hed seen her milking the cows tending the garden and presumably doing things in the cottage as well you couldnt do any of those jobs trussed up in a court gown teetering on highheeled slippers and apparently the rule of if you dont work you dont eat applied to her as well he wasnt proving anything by clinging to this ridiculous suit of clothing except that he was stubborn and possibly stupid as well yes well look what she turned you into after all commented that voice in the back of his mind making the outside match the inside he would have had a hard time denying it at that moment so he didnt even bother to try instead he made his way slowly up to the cottage with another request besides food on his mind to his intense relief there was no sign of the unicorns or that woman but the brownie lily was already at work in her garden she straightened as he came up the path and gave him a measuring look robin says he thinks your sickening for something she said abruptly well not that i know of mistress lily he said but i would like something to eat and he hesitated then blundered on if you still have the shirt and breeches you gave me to work in i would like to get rid of these for now anyway her expression didnt change except that her eyes narrowed a little in speculation perhaps he wondered what she saw when she looked at him then got a kind of flash of what it might be sullen rude restless stubborn foolish insisting on working in his stupid quasiuniform as if anyone around here where magic flowed and your dress could change in a wink would be impressed pigheaded too and very very young of course hed seem young to one of the fair folk however not he had no idea how old lily was but shed mentioned serving several of this godmothers predecessors so he must seem like an infant to her he flushed and added belatedly if you please if i ah right come along with you then she said and got to her feet she led him to the kitchen door left him there and came out with the clothing and a basket here she said thrusting both at him you cant go far but well breaking your fast by the pond is and a book ah here startled he took the clothing and basket remembered at the last minute to thank her and decided to leave while she was still treating him nicely what had gotten into these people first master hob thinking he was ill and giving him no work for the day and now mistress lily feeling unwontedly modest he got out of sight around a shed and changed into the commoners clothing and knew in an instant that he had been a fool to refuse it before this it wasnt coarse on the contrary the loose shirt was of linen as fine as anything he owned for the first time he felt comfortable not hot and sweaty with a collar and waistband that were both too tight that left the boots he looked at them looked at his bare feet and wriggled his toes in the grass experimentally riding boots especially cavalry boots were not made for walking he hadnt gone barefoot since he was a child he left the boots on top of the clothing on the kitchen step and took the basket back down to the pond there was a book on top of the napkin that covered the food he picked it up curiously the five hundred kingdoms a history of godmothers said the faintly luminous letters on the cover he hesitated a moment then chose a piece of fruit and began to read while he ate hmm elena said when lily had finished explaining why the pile of clothing was beside the kitchen door and the prince was nowhere in sight you dont suppose he did say if you please lily pointed out and thank you its possible hes finally turned the corner and its possible that pigs will fly but im not running out to buy any manureproof umbrellas just yet rose replied dourly before elena could say anything his brother is just about to earn his freedom elena felt moved to counter and id have given that lower odds than this hmph id have said it would take magic to get that one to see what faults brought him here said rose and gathered up the quasimilitary uniform to clean and put in storage from now on elenas spell would transform alexanders current gear rather than his original clothing maybe maybe not lily said to roses retreating back i dont know that it would matter elena replied picking up a bread roll dripping with melted butter and biting into it thoughtfully once the blinders are off its rather hard to go back to seeing things the way you used to lilys glance was startled you dont suppose then she stopped i dont suppose anything elena told her but i do know this much some of the other fae have been very interested in him there have been a great many of them flitting about on the edges of the forest far more than usual and i dont think its entirely because of the presence of all the unicorns here some of them have even come to me directly to ask about him welladay lilys eyes widened a little as elena helped herself to another roll the wild fae dont talk much to us weve not much in common with them like a fish trying to talk to a bird i suppose or a rock to a star i hadnt noticed them about but then i wouldnt but interfering just tell me this what would one of them do if just speculating mind you he happened to wish aloud to know how to get himself out of here elena raised an eyebrow at lily who clapped her hand to her mouth by huons horn that would appeal to the mischiefs lily exclaimed because the only way for him to get out of here without even bending your magic is to change his ways they said together and elena smiled and it has to be sincere and permanent just like what his brothers going through she added so maybe the wild fae dont wont bind if they can help it but theyll change oh yes or else theyll midwife change along well see im not entirely agreeing with rose either but it doesnt take much to backslide and the tradition lily asked cautiously elena shook her head the truth was that since that odd day in her room when she had confronted the faceless force that was the tradition with her own will although she had still felt its power circling around her to the extent that she felt like one of the great sorceresses with enough magic at her command to move the world she had not felt that terrible pressure of it on her forcing her to walk a path she was not at all willing to take this doesnt feel like the tradition she said only this is new lily blinked then said well good it will be if he can hold to this course elena replied if if ifs and ands were pots and pans thered be no work for tinkers quoted lily briskly and my garden is not getting weeded by me sitting here nor those harvestpotions getting brewed by themselves elena agreed finishing the last of her breakfast still she took a long thought lets make a point of rewarding virtue shall we she and lily exchanged a smile that might have been called conspiratorial good idea said lily a very good idea catching more flies with honey eh theres truth in old saws elena agreed and maybe in a wild faes help as well chapter whatever had happened to the prince whether it was a bit of helpful interference from one of the fair folk getting sense beat into him as hob opined a bout of brainfever the way robin suggested roses suggestion that hed managed to wear out his stupidity or just simply that he realized that there was a reason why hed wound up as a donkey that day marked the turningpoint he still got angry insulted people and showed his temper but it was in short bursts usually after a long and exhausting task and he had even begun apologizing for it afterwards and as the season moved into harvesttime elena made good on her determination to reward virtue by making a profound change she allowed him to spend every fourth day as himself then every third then every other day and told hob to find a real donkey or really whatever you think we need to purchase when the horse fair came to the village hob left in the morning with a purse full of silver and returned that evening well before sunset just as alexander came up to the cottage for his supper the sound of hooves on the road made him look up and brought elena to the door the look on his face when he saw hob arrive riding one donkey and leading two mules was worth every silver penny that hob had spent nevertheless he hastened to help the brownie to unharness and put the three new animals in the stable and put one of them into the very stall that he had been occupying since he had been brought to the cottage he was still enough of a prince not to go to the subordinate for answers though when the work was done as she had expected he came straight out and looked about to see if she was anywhere in sight since she had been waiting for him to do just that he didnt have far to look and he walked straight over to her his demeanor a mixture of emotions and attitude that was so comical in its way that she had to fight to keep a straight face for all that he was being scrupulously polite to her he still deeply resented what she was doing to him for all that he recognized what an idiot he had been he resented that she was punishing him for it and he was sullenly burningly angry that he was still in effect her prisoner she was in a way the enemy and now he had to come to the enemy to find out what was in store for him now she watched him try to find a way to ask what her intentions were without asking the question directly he didnt want to hope too much yet hope was hard to keep down finally he settled and asked harshly probably more harshly than he intended am i sharing my stable with animals now in a manner of speaking she replied since i expect youll be using the room in the loft now she watched varied emotions chasing themselves across his face no real surprise that there was some bitter disappointment there since this might have meant and he surely hoped it had meant that his term of correction was over unless of course she added so he understood why she was not letting him go quite yet you backslide i she watched the temper rise watched him struggle to control it and expected the outburst of anger and insults it never came very well madame he got out through gritted teeth then turned on his heel and stalked back into the stable well i like that rose said indignantly from the door actually i do like that elena said thoughtfully turning to go back inside herself he could have done or said much worse i believe were getting somewhere my thorny rose im still not buying manureproof umbrellas was all rose said but as she also turned to go back into the house elena caught a glimpse of a grudging smile lily was already in the kitchen setting out plates on the table take him out some fresh linens and things would you lily she asked she wasnt going to do so herself not because she thought herself above the task but because she wasnt going to give the tradition a second chance at going down the bawdyballad path oh no that was still the easiest road and if she was going to keep it from happening she had to keep her wits about her at all times already have godmother lily said with a sidelong look and a smile when you told hob to go off to the horse fair we knew what was toward saw to it this morning while he was down clearing the nettles out she had to laugh at that and she did you know what im going to do before i do dont you she asked the brownie have to dont we lily countered with a tilt of her head been serving godmothers a mort of years now youll be our ninth i reckon be a sad thing if we hadnt learned a bit by now nine that surprised her she hadnt known that the quartet had been doing this sort of thing for so very long are you weary of it yet have you ever wanted to to stop serving anyone but yourself there it was the question she hadnt dared ask when she first became godmother did they want to be free she didnt know what she would do without them but lily laughed at her and her fears dissolved bless you no whats a brownie without a home were the fae of housen godmother not the wild fae of the woods oh ill admit that now and again we wish we had a whole family to serve instead of just the one godmother but youve managed to keep us on our toes enough to keep us busy thats why hob brought back the extra beasts he reckons well need them ah she was a bit nonplussed at that for what oh lily replied waving her hand vaguely things robin came in at that moment with an empty basket that held a napkin evidently lily had also sent down the princes dinner figuring he would not want to come to the door for it tonight lily took it from the other brownie then continued after he left hadnt you noticed that some of the witches and hedgewizards of other kingdoms have been asking you for help we reckon youre going to get made godmother of a couple more realms before the year is out that means youll be getting more people coming to you and that means guests and guests means a bigger house and more work we think the house is getting ready to bud off a couple new rooms theres a funny feeling upstairs off the old apprentice rooms you used to be in and downstairs too the libraryll probably budexpand first and then all those books madame bella put in the parlor and the dining room will move themselves into the new space so well have proper places to receive guests lily said all of this so matteroffactly that elenas head reeled the house had she said budding rooms as if it was some sort of plant and the books were going to move themselves it was in a way one thing to work magic herself it was quite enough thing to hear that it was going to be working without her intervention and was she really going to be given the keeping of other kingdoms but which ones in the course of an hour once again her life was taking on a brandnew direction and one she had never anticipated if only she had a way to contact madame bella right now she badly wanted advice she wanted to talk to an older more experienced godmother she needed to learn more than madame bella had initially taught her and she had the feeling she needed to learn it quickly but wait there was advice advice in plenty already written down and waiting for her she had only to find it ah i see she said carefully and laughed a little i suppose you must be used to it by now oh aye lily said cheerfully but shrewdly and she was watching elenas face quite narrowly elena remembered something that bella had told her the houseelves might seem common as clay and without any kind of magic sometimes dont allow yourself ever to believe that theyre fair folk as truly fae as any youve seen through and through they serve us because it amuses them to and this house and everything around it is their creation if they wished to they could snap their fingers and it would be gone in an instant and them with it ill be in the library i think she said then a little nervously it isnt going to do anything while im there is it bless you no lily replied whatever it does itll be while youre asleep it knows that budding unsettles the sons of adam and daughters of eve and its sensitive about that sort of thing oh my she thought she talks about the house as if its alive then came a more comforting thought but so is a tree alive and ive no qualms about walking inside one of them to take tea with a dryad and like her house the dryads trees were all bigger on the inside than the outside perhaps that was what the cottage was a kind of dryadic tree well ill be in the library she repeated more confidently now all evening probably very good godmother lily said looking pleased out of all proportion to what elena had just told her ill let the others know now what did i say thats made her smile so elena wondered as she waved the lamps to light in the library and prepared a simple seeking spell to help her find the exact books she needed or was it what i didnt say but she couldnt spare any more time in wondering one way or the other she had to find out just how it was that godmothers were assigned more responsibilities and what it meant to the godmother in question when it happened the seeking spell led her to book after book until she had a pile of them twenty deep on the table she used as a desk she looked at them and sighed it was going to be a very long night alexander was racked with so many conflicting emotions that he knew better than to be around anyone else so he strode rigidly off back to the stable that womans casual pronouncement had left him both elated and crushed when hed realized that hob had brought back other work animals he had hoped and simultaneously told himself not to hope that his term of punishment was at an end to learn that it wasnt made him want to howl but on the other hand on the other hand tonight i go to sleep as myself and wake up as myself in a bed or at least in whatever passes for a bed in that loft and he realized then that he didnt even know what was up there he had never been there and and i guess i was just taking it for granted that master hob slept up there but come to think of it i never heard any footsteps up there in all the time ive been here so it must be empty hed gone back to the stable of course out of habit it was nearly dark and he should have been in his stall waiting bitterly for the magic to turn him back into a beast tonight it wouldnt and that felt unsettling to shake off the feeling he sought the ladder that led to the loft and climbed it might as well find out what his new domain looked like he pushed open the hatch at the top of the ladder and warm welcoming light spilled down around him blinking he finished his climb poking his head up into an odd but quite comfortable room the attics at the academy had been like this right under the roof so that you could only walk upright down through the center this was a thatched building but someone had gone to the trouble of putting in tongueandgroove boarding lining the ceiling so that at least he wouldnt have wildlife dropping into his bed and belongings out of the thatch there was one very tiny window at each end of the single long room curtained with the shutters opened wide to the night air there was a table under each window and a brass lamp on each table that made sense you wouldnt want candles with open flames around so much hay and straw the lamps looked very heavy youd have to work hard to tip one over in the center of the room was an odd box that looked like a brick stove except there was no chimney he couldnt imagine what it was so he dismissed it for the moment from his mind his bed was on the right somewhat to his surprise it was a real bed somehow hed expected a pallet on the floor or something similar but no this was a real woodframed bed with a dark wooden blanketchest at the foot of it neatly made up faded blue linen coverlet and pillows and all and if he wasnt mistaken beneath the sheets and coverlet was a featherbed mattress to his left the lamp shared the table with a floralfigured pottery pitcher and basin and fitted in under the slope of the roof down both sides were shelves there was clothing on those shelves and a pair of sturdy boots he didnt recognize along with the carefully folded and familiar pieces of his princely garb and his ridingboots and there were books now that he had not expected at all he hadnt laid his hands on single book except for that strange little history that lily had given him since hed arrived here that he had read from cover to cover and had thought about it quite a bit but here were more books many more and though he was not the bookworm that julian was he was still fond of reading and he had missed it so the first thing he did the first things he inspected were the books now this was a stable and these were presumably the quarters of a stablehand he expected books about horses and mules and donkeys these were histories and practical books on magic and it didnt take very long to discover that like the book that lily had gotten into his hands they were written from and for the very peculiar viewpoint of the godmothers and wizards the godmothers book of days read one and that was the one he settled in with reading propped up in his new and oh so comfortable bed after blowing out the lamp at the farther end of the room elena glanced out the window of the library after darkness fell and frowned for a moment to see a square of light where she hadnt ever noticed a light before then after a moment she realized what it must be and smiled ruefully the room over the stable of course so the prince was in his new quarters probably nothing like what hes used to she thought then had to laugh at herself of course lately he was used to bedding down in straw at the clean end of his loosebox a bed of any kind should seem like a luxury to him now it was certainly better than his brother octavians lot octavian got an empty stall and slept on what he could find he hadnt sunk so low as to use dirty straw but he wasnt allowed the new clean stuff the horses got no the best he could manage was fusty stuff from last year that had gotten a bit moldy the thin heap of it covered over with rags he slept under several motheaten blankets arranged so that the holes at least didnt intersect octavian would have regarded the clean little loft room with raw envy and his reaction to the featherbed would have been disbelief she wondered what alexander was thinking she hoped he was grateful she wanted him to be grateful he hadnt been grateful for much of anything in his previous life instead he had accepted the good things that had come to him as his due the more feelings of things like gratitude he could muster the better off he would be reluctantly she turned her eyes away from the window and back to her books apparently there was some mechanism whereby godmothers just got authority over kingdoms as their experience cleverness and strength warranted there was no formal announcement of the fact it just happened but there were unmistakable signs that one had gotten the kingdom the witches and hedgewizards would begin reporting information to one and at some point the godmother would have the opportunity dropped in her lap to make some grand gesture at the royal court a gesture like like returning a lost prince a former failed quester who has learned his lessons to his parents there it was unmistakable and here was arachnias latest letter brought by bat lying open on the table next to her and i cant risk ruining my reputation as the dark lady by bringing octavian back myself elena thats the job of a godmother so you might want to think about how you want to do this because i expect hell be ready within the month and unless he backslides i really dont want to risk his health out there in that drafty stable in the winter my stableman does fine but hes a troll no really a troll a good enough fellow but as stupid as a block of wood and as hard to hurt as a stone the conditions he likes might kill a man elena chewed on the end of an ivory pen arachnia was right she was much too useful as a stalkinghorse the faux evil queen who was actually in charge of a failed questers ordeals she was far enough away from kohlstania that someone would have to invoke all forests are one to bring octavian back and ideally in order to wake up kohlstania to the fact that magic was very much alive and a force in the kingdoms as well as to cement king henricks change of heart as well as octavians changed ways the return of the lost prince would have to be conducted with a great deal of fanfare which meant which means i fear that kohlstania is now mine she wasnt certain whether to be pleased or worried kohlstania was certainly an orderly place perhaps a little too orderly when things were too orderly the tradition had the unsettling habit of stirring matters up by creating an opening for a dark one to move in well all right at least im forewarned ill have to have karelina put me in touch with the witches and hedge wizards i might be able to nip trouble early she made a note of that on the tablet she was filling right underneath octavian make him my helmeted knightescort until i reveal him to his father she glanced out the window again the lamp was still burning over the stable it looked as if alexander was celebrating his first night as a man again by staying up a bit she thought she recalled lily asking for some of the duplicate copies of books in the library had she put them up there well where else would they go if so she hoped he was something of a reader the more he learned about magic and the tradition the sooner he would really come to understand the path that he had made for himself that had brought him here a bat flew in the open window and fluttered around for a few moments before catching itself on a beam and hanging upside down staring warily at alexander he had been startled when it flapped past his ear but he wasnt the sort to think that bats were somehow evil or to want to chase it out the palace gamekeeper had once had a bat with a broken wing that hed rescued and nursed back to health before turning it loose and hed shown it to the two youngest princes explaining how bats ate all manner of insects and were very useful to have about alexander had found the tiny thing fascinating with its delicate wings soft fur and miniature features it was nothing at all like a flying mouse so alexander watched the bat watching him without moving from his bed and finally the bat had relaxed dropped off the ceiling and fluttered around the room for a bit catching the moths that had been attracted by the lamplight the arrival of the bat had been a useful interruption because at this point alexanders head was beginning to feel very full when the bat flew out again having swept the room clean of moths rather than returning to his reading he put the book aside and turned over on his stomach to blow out the lamp and when he had done so he saw a square of light down below and in it the unmistakable silhouette of elena he supposed that he ought to be thinking of her as madame elena but somehow the title really didnt fit her it was like trying to put a collar on a wild doe you could embellish it with gems and gold filigree all you wanted but the doe was still a wild thing and would never be a pet godmother suited her but only when she was becoiffed and powdered and tripping about on her silverheeled slippers in court garb in her ordinary clothing she seemed to him at least nothing more imposing than simply elena of course if he dared address her that way hob would probably lay him out on the ground he wondered what she was doing it looked as if she was writing or reading or perhaps both well so much for thinking she was an illiterate peasant he wasnt doing very well on his analysis of the situation that he had found himself in truth to tell hed fouled it up almost beyond recognition with his assumptions for someone who was supposed to be trained in assessing conditions correctly and making the right decisions based on those assessments he was doing a damned poor job of it and to think he was supposed to become octavians commanderinchief if this was how he would have fared in a war maybe the academy hadnt trained him all that well after all from what he had read in the godmothers book of days he was what was known as a quester or to be more accurate a failed quester it was his brother julian who was the real quester julian had succeeded he had passed the trials and won the princess alexander and octavian had failed the very first test put in front of them the test of courtesy he had been knighted and so had octavian but he knew now that they had been knights in name only he knew it now or rather acknowledged it at least to himself he wasnt quite ready to confess it to anyone else but there was something else that he was finally putting together in his mind that was beginning to make him feel a smoldering anger that was nothing like the anger he had so unthinkingly loaded onto godmother elena the first book he had read had left him a little baffled referring to something called the tradition but in a way that had not left him with any sort of clear definition of what was meant in the first chapter of the book of days everything that the tradition was had been boldly and clearly spelled out it was that which was making him so angry but not at godmother elena not anymore it was quite clear to him now that elena was doing quite a bit more than the average godmother to use the tradition against itself she should never have brought him here for instance godmothers just did not intervene personally with failed questers there was no place in the tradition for a godmother to take the training of a failed quester on herself she properly should have done to him what shed done to octavian turned him loose to wander without being able to get home until he either died or learned his lessons lessons that would make him a much better king than he would ever have been without this humiliation and if he died well that was too bad either the second failed quester himself would survive his lessoning or julian would inherit both kingdoms and if elena had not intervened it was the latter that was the most likely the book of days had unflinchingly given the odds of a failed quester surviving long enough to redeem himself and the odds werent at all good elena had gone out of her way to get both himself and octavian into situations where even if they were brought down lower than the humblest commoner they were not in any danger of dying except perhaps by being monumentally stupid alexander turned over on his back and stared up into the darkness above his bed now that he knew about the tradition he had an explanation for something he had felt all of his life a ponderous implacable sort of weight hanging over him from the moment hed been born hed often ascribed that feeling to god the weight of the almightys regard upon a young prince now he knew better it hadnt been god it had been this faceless formless impersonal force that went about shoving people down the way it wanted them to go just because it fit a sort of wellworn path it didnt care what they wanted it didnt give a toss about pain or pleasure it only wanted things to happen in a predictable way oh how he hated it he wondered if robert had been aware of such a thing for surely robert was a victim of the tradition in all its cruelty on the whole he hoped not to live your life feeling yourself impelled towards your early death as if your fate was a cliff that you were rushing towards with no way to stop that would have been unthinkably horrible turning what had been a tragedy into something infinitely worse he sighed and the sound filled the little loft room he became aware that outside the window crickets sang and frogs croaked much quieter to his human ears than to the donkeys for the first time in too long he was in a bed feeling two arms two legs all the parts of him what they should be and where they should be resting on a feather mattress as good as any in the palace of kohlstania and better than the ones at the academy he was himself again i wont backslide he vowed fiercely to himself iswear it no matter how provoked i am no matter what that damned tradition wants and tried to make me do i wont backslide i will be courteous i will be considerate i will remember my knightly vows and i will live up to them instead of merely giving lip service to them there was nothing absolutely nothing he would not do to avoid feeling his body warp and change into the beast which meant he would have to be careful very careful if the tradition could not force him into one role dead failed quester it would probably try and force him into another he would have to read and study to find out what that role might be and whether or not it was one that would get him out of here he might hate the tradition but there was no point in pretending it did not exist nor that it was not very very powerful clearly it took knowledge and magic to beat it he only had a chance at half of that equation he closed his eyes and for the moment felt rather disinclined to open them again strange he thought as he felt sleep creeping up on him strange how things worked out he might have discovered that he was little more than a fancy pawn on some giant chessboard but at least now he had a better target for his hate and anger than a pretty woman shortly after midnight elena blinked looked down at her notes and realized that her handwriting was just short of illegible it was time to call a halt to all of this and go to bed before she dropped off to sleep right here at the table she really wasnt minded to wake up at dawn with a crick in her neck and an inkblot on her cheek she tidied her papers put up the quill corked the ink and with a wave of her hand extinguished the lamps a glance out the window showed her that alexander had already given up for the night he was probably smarter than she was she made her way up to her room behind his curtain randolf was very quiet he might not even be there at the moment it was likeliest that he was off watching something or someone else she waved the lamps in this room to darkness and went on into her bedroom with a few touches it was very much as madame bella had left it by the time she had moved into it elena had decided that she liked it that way and saw no reason to change anything that was there it felt old very old she had to wonder in fact if the furnishings in this room dated all the way back to the first human godmother to live here for the furniture was in fact rather more antique than anything in the klovis household had been and far more than anything in any other room in the house except perhaps the kitchen the walls were of wood but there were tapestries hung on all of them the bed was huge a whole family could have slept there comfortably it stood on a little dais of its own and it was curtained twice the inner curtains were of thin gauze the outer of heavy velvet in the summer she closed only the inner ones to keep insects out so that she could leave the windows open without resorting to a spell the rest of the furnishings wardrobe a sort of couch backless chairs chests and her dressing table were just as massive and had an air of comfort about them that was rather surprising given how heavily they were built the walls were dark oak paneling the floor darker yet the colors of the curtains and cushions all dark burgundy and garnet the tapestries all around the walls were of magical creatures the one above the fireplace showed unicorns sans maidens sometimes she wondered if a godmother had woven it herself and why it certainly managed to portray them accurately beautiful but with a certain vacuity in their eyes she left her clothing draped neatly over the blanketchest at the foot of the bed for rose to deal with in the morning and slipped into the clean nightgown that was waiting for her left lying on the pillows it smelled pleasantly of violets and lavender she waved the lights out and climbed up into the bed feeling fairly satisfied of course there was no way of knowing what alexander would actually do or think following his first night of freedom from his curse but she had high hopes for him given that he had managed to remain in control of his temper and she could hardly blame him for being angry that she hadnt just freed him outright he still hadnt in his heart acknowledged that he had failed some crucial tests of character on the other hand if he was reading her spare histories they might point his mind in the right direction it would be a bit awkward to have him around in his natural form though when hed been an ass she hadnt thought twice about acting as she always had in his presence the more she had allowed him to be himself the more conscious she had been of the presence of an admittedly goodlooking young man about the place and now if he was going to be himself all of the time but hell be gone soon she told herself by winter im sure of it besides hes made it quite clear that he considers me very much his inferior in birth if our births were to be compared so although he may begin to treat me with courtesy at last she yawned and closed her eyes of course the courtesy her thoughts began to ooze away from her will be the kinda princegives she did not often dream or at least she did not often dream in ways that could be linked back to the real world that was deliberate the dreams of a godmother had the potential to take on a life of their own and one of the things that bella had taught her was how to dream in pleasant nonsense so when her dream began and she found herself walking along a shore of purple sand by an amethyst sea beneath a silver sky with three azure moons in it she felt quite relaxed and comfortable so comfortable that she did not in the least mind when she realized that alexander was walking beside her they did not speak but after a while quite easily and naturally her hand stretched out a little of its own accord and encountered his reaching for hers their fingers entwined and they walked on climbing up the purple dunes through sand as soft as powdered velvet there they sat down together on the top of the tallest dune listening to the sea and watching as the moons set one after another like blue pearls on an invisible chain being pulled below the horizon she leaned her head to the side and quite naturally found that she was leaning it against his shoulder and just as naturally his arm came around her and pulled her closer then her heart started to pound and her skin came alive so that she was acutely aware of the brush of his fingers against it the touch of the warm breeze on her face she felt her stomach tighten and when he bent his head down to hers and she lifted hers to meet his and their lips met she felt as if lightning had jumped between them or maybe the spark of life itself though she could not have told if it went from her into him or the other way around he turned more towards her and his free hand came to cup her breast her nipples hardened and the soft teasing of his fingers sent jolts of pleasure through her that made the secret parts between her legs tighten and burn with anticipation she moaned a little and her lips parted insensibly beneath his kiss and his tongue slipped between them teasing and tickling her lips and teeth and playing with her tongue until she damn it she came awake all at once and in a fury the benighted tradition couldnt manipulate her when she was awake so now it was trying to do so in her sleep no that was all she said into the darkness but she put every bit of her will behind it nothing answered her there was neither an increase in pressure upon her nor a decrease nor was there any change in the amount of the magic she could sense swirling in potential around her could it possibly be that what she had just dreamed had come not out of what the tradition wanted but out of what she wanted or what her body wanted anyway she lay there afire with wanting and not knowing well not really not truly what it was she wanted madame kloviss servants hadnt bothered to hide themselves when they dallied but her curiosity had never been enough to overcome her embarrassment and past a certain point shed always covered her eyes but she ached with frustration and need and it took a very very long time to get back to sleep again and when she did it was to toss the rest of the night as part of her tried to get back to that purple sand dune and part of her utterly refused to go there which left all of her so blearyeyed when she woke at dawn that rose took one look at her and ordered her to sleep in late for a change chapter when alexander woke the next morning it was with strange dreamfragments echoing in the back of his mind blue moons and purple sand and a very sweet and lissome lady in his arms for the very first time since he had left kohlstania he woke feeling good warm and very pleased with himself it had been a wonderful dream apparently he just wished that he could remember more of it but just because he wasnt waking as a donkey didnt mean that the work was going to stop hob had made sure he knew that weeks ago back when hed been thinking hed only be spending every other day as a donkey rather than most of a week hob had told him in bald terms that man or ass if he didnt do his share the same rule held no work no food alexander didnt think that things would have changed just because the godmother had decided that he was going to be spending his time as himself from now on this was the season of harvest and there was work even for the untutored hands of a prince alexander bellowed hob from somewhere beneath him get your lazy royal ass down here royal ass maybe it was the good mood that he had awakened in but the phrase that would have made him livid with anger yesterday struck him this morning as inexpressibly funny he rolled out of bed and stuck his head through the hole in the floor hob was looking up at him lazy i am but today at least i am no ass he replied give me but a moment there were three new beasts to tend now and one of the few good things about being a donkey had meant that he didnt have to tend himself his first chore on his first morning waking as a man were quite enough to drive the last fragment of erotic dream out of his mind nothing was less erotic than mucking out a stall still it didnt spoil his good mood at all the beasts were mildtempered and easy to work around and he was done reasonably quickly he joined hob at the pump in the kitchenyard just as the sun came up the two of them doing a thoroughwashup in the cold water we wont be able to do that much longer hob said shaking his head and sending droplets flying everywhere be too bloody cold before long i dont fancy icicles off my nose i dont fancy them hanging off elsewhere on my anatomy replied alexander who had been a bit more thorough in his washingup but then hob hadnt been mucking out the stable either hob grinned at him come on lad he said and led the way up the kitchen stairs alexander stopped where he was ah come on lad hob repeated dubiously and certain that he would be stopped dead at the door as he always had been before alexander followed him followed him right into the warm and fragrant kitchen where he stood in the doorway blinking stupidly in the light just as rose entered from the door opposite godmother wont be coming down until later she informed master robin who was the source of the wonderful smells of sausage and egg of baking bread and frying ham she looks as if she hasnt had nearly enough sleep she was awake rather late last night alexander offered both rose and lily who was already seated at the table gave him odd looks she was reading i suppose he added i could see her from my window i trust your room meets with your approval rose asked tartly managing to sound only the slightest bit sarcastic rosie hob injected with a note of warning in his voice lad sit down have some breakfast alexander did sit where hob indicated but he also answered rose mistress rose it is exceedingly comfortable thank you he replied as courteously as if she really had asked him the question seriously and i thank you for asking rose blinked at him for a moment then sat down without another word she ignored him during the meal speaking only to the other brownies but hob robin and even lily addressed him from time to time making him a part of the conversation whether rose liked it or not so youll be going out with lily and a cart today past the watermeadow hob told him after some discussion of what needed to be got in time we beat them deer tthe orchard fruit im thinking a fine plan hob robin said nodding with enthusiasm as he cleared up the plates from the table ive always said there was almost no point in having the orchard we get so little out of it each fall and nuts with alexander and the new beasts to help we can rob the squirrels of the harvest of the nut orchard as well later this fall he grinned i mind me that theres none of you would object to apple cake and spiced nuts so alexander found himself harnessing up one of the mules to a small twowheeled cart loading it with empty sacks and a couple of baskets and a ladder and leading it out to meet the brownie woman lily it was she who beckoned him down a path he was sure hadnt been there before today past the meadow with the pond in it and into what he had thought was just forest but it wasnt a forest it was an incredibly ancient apple orchard the trees were huge and gnarled with age the apples were small and a very bright red but when he pulled one off a lowhanging branch and bit into it experimentally expecting it to be sour or woody he found it utterly delectable tart and sweet at the same time and bursting with juice finish that and lets get on with it lily chided but with a smile ive a mind to fill the cart before the mornings over at the least in fact about the time that breakfast was beginning to wear off robin appeared with a second cart mule and their luncheon of bread onion and chunks of cheese he brought water too but they hardly needed it with the juicy apples all about well have cider this year i think lily said with satisfaction as robin led the mule and laden cart away and preserves and plenty of apples in store too first year well have had cider of our own pressing in a while um he paused not sure how to word the question he had delicately then he decided to just blunder on with it why i mean why are we doing this by hand why not use magic you mean lily didnt look in the least offended by his question well its like this we browniefolk dont have all that much magic to use for that sort of thing were small fae as such things go the great fae theyve no need of mortal foods for they create such things out of their own power if they choose we little fae who havent the magic either feast at their tables or live as mortals do by the work of our hands but surely the godmother ah she laid a finger alongside of her nose and nodded well heres the thing aye godmother elena could use magic for suchlike things if she chose but she dont choose and thats because shes a saving wench she dont see the need to do with magic what can be done with hands ye see theres only so much magic that she has without gathering more and she reckons she cant always count on gathering more am i making sense you mean he groped to understand lilys words you mean magic is like rain and sometimes theres a drought and you cant always tell when a drought is going to come so you you save it in a cistern very like lily applauded now not all godmothers think like ours theres plenty who do a lot more with their magic but madame elena always thinks what if something really terrible happened and i didnt have the magic to fix it every time she goes to do something so there you are i see and actually he did see though it seemed a rather novel and perhaps parsimonious approach to him after all what was the point of having magic if you didnt use it but then again what if she did go about squandering magic then didnt have it to turn him from donkey back into man again hed supposed that hed have felt very differently about her approach if hed been the one feeling the drought now one of our godmothers one we served a long time ago was like that lily continued thoughtfully using her magic to do this and that cleaning her rooms and appearing and vanishing where she chose and suchlike and something bad did happen the kingdom of lorendil was invaded and a black sorcerer took the throne and held it for three generations and our godmother didnt have the power to stop him because shed used so much of it on things we could have done traded for or done without at the name lorendil alexander found himself feeling cold even in kohlstania they had heard of the black beast of lorendil a sorcerer whose atrocities were the stuff of nightmare could she have he asked i mean she was a godmother but he was a sorcerer well never know will we lily countered but lorendil was her responsibility and it went down on her watch and it took a prophecy a child of prophecy and a sorcerer to set it all right again he pondered that for a moment there was just so much he didnt know about magic well in that case he said finally licking the juice of his last apple off his fingers and wiping them clean on the napkin his luncheon had come wrapped in lets get back to these apples they filled that cart as well and a third before lily decreed an end to the harvest for that day and they headed back to the cottage and that was when something odd occurred to him the kitchen that he had sat in this morning was huge it should have filled the entire ground floor of the cottage except that it hadnt for rose had come in from what was clearly another room and elena had been sitting at a table that had not been in a kitchen lily he said hesitantly as they neared the building that cottage is bigger on the inside than the outside i know she said nonchalantly no worries youll get used to it after a bit and not even think about it ah he replied and tried not to because the very idea made his head begin to hurt how could a building be bigger on the inside than the outside it sounded mad and yet he knew that his own eyes had given him contrary evidence hob came to take charge of the cart and its contents and alexander and lily proceeded on to the kitchen yard and if alexander had thought that the aromas issuing from that chamber had been delicious this morning they made his mouth water this evening but lily drew him away from the kitchen door to one of the outbuildings mens bathhouse she laughed pushing him at the door go make use of it and when the weather is too cold to bathe at the pump you can come here but youll have to fire the stove yourself it was his first bath since he had left home he would have lingered except that he was far too hungry even so to revel in hot water was something of a revelation now he felt wholly human again hob had washed him down regularly as a donkey and what had happened to the donkey had of course happened to the human in fact washing him as a donkey seemed to clean his clothing as well but that was no substitute for a real hot bath nor for real clean clothing with the scent of the hot sun that had dried it still in the folds he walked alone into the kitchen with some of the same euphoria that had buoyed him this morning there he found that the others were already sitting down to their dinner the godmother sitting at the kitchen table among them and that surprised him a little ladies did not eat in the kitchen among their servants but then again this was no ordinary lady nor were these creatures strictly servants quietly he took his own seat and held his peace while they talked of the day the godmother kept sending odd glances in his direction and though he kept his mouth shut he wondered what was going through her mind did she regret her decision to allow him to remain himself but why whatever the cause of her behavior she said nothing to him and eventually he gave up trying to figure out what was in her mind and just listened and ate of course the food was marvelous and the results of todays work appeared at the end of the meal in the form of a huge apple pie robins food had always been good it was just a great deal better eaten like a civilized man on a table in company with others however strange that company might be strange company indeed while casual talk of what must be done over the next several days went on all around him he felt curiously detached from it all it occurred to him that had anyone described this situation these surroundings to him a year ago he would have considered them to be mad sitting in a room in a building that was larger on the inside than the outside in company with a magician and four fae and if he made one misstep he might be spending the night as a donkey again theres a new room in the cellar robin was saying in answer to some question of lilys that he had not been paying attention to complete with barrels for the cider ah well thats one problem sorted lily said with satisfaction elena was looking from one to the other of them with a look that was something between a smile and a grimace would any of you mind telling me just how the house does this gets bigger when we need space i mean we dont know rose replied as it finally dawned on alexander just what they had been talking about its some magic that the first godmother to live here did actually i dont think that the house is actually getting bigger i think that it is merely giving us access to parts of it we didnt have before weve never actually seen it growing you know even though robin talks about it budding did you not say alexander said thinking quite hard about some of his recent reading that the first godmother to live here was one of the great fae they all turned to stare at him as if they had not realized that he was there yes lily said so i always thought he shrugged childrens tales in kohlstania speak of the elven queens living in great palaces well what if this is and always has been a great palace ah robin said his wizened face lighting up yes one of the great halls of faerie so that the house we see is is just the entrance hall to it so to speak its as good an explanation as any other i suppose elena said after a moment of thought but she looked relieved it makes sense but why didnt any of you know this because we werent here except hob and he was in the stable said lily matteroffactly we did not take service here until the first of the mortal godmothers was in residence then the place was as you have seen with fewer storage rooms and workrooms and a much smaller library alexander shook his head this was only contributing to his sensation of living in a dream but the food in his belly was warm and solid and the scent of sweet apples was still in his nostrils were all mad you know elena said aloud looking straight at him i had begun to suspect this he said in all seriousness she broke into a smile a completely unexpected smile she had never really smiled a great deal around him and never at him before or at least she had never done so without a great deal of ironic mockery to her expression this smile accepted the joke as being on both of them and invited him to share in it it hit him with an almost physical impacthe managed to return it but not without a struggle to get his heart and breathing going again shes beautiful how had he never noticed that before well if that is the explanation and thank you prince alexander for thinking of it i will confess that i am much relieved elena said to all of them it had occurred to me that if this house was capable of growing it might also be capable of shrinking what would happen for instance if some enemy were to somehow drain away some of its magic would it shrink with us in it she shuddered but one of the palaces of the great fae slowly opening rooms as we need them now that i feel much more comfortable with and on that note i shall go back to my studies that seemed to be a sort of dismissal for all of them elena got up and left robin collected the dishes rose left through the same door that the godmother had used lily moving to help robin hob stood up and gave him a sharp look weve had our dinner he said with a meaningful glance towards the stable alexander understood him time to feed the beasts he replied and got to his feet himself hob actually fed them it was alexander who gave them all water and made sure they were comfortable then hob left and alexander climbed the ladder to his loft room taking the lantern with him when he got there he stripped down to his breeks and slipped into bed taking a book with him many pages later he felt his eyelids drooping and put the book aside turning to blow out the lantern as he did so he glanced out the window and saw the silhouette of elena also bent over a book in the window that faced the stable it was another long night but at the end of it elena felt as if she had a better idea not only of what would be expected of her on taking the responsibility for a new kingdom but what she could expect from kohlstania and she had a batdelivered note from arachnia to the effect that octavian had passed not only her trials but a few little tests that her consort had contrived she made a few notes based on other restoration spectacles in the various chronicles and her imagination began to get to work she fell asleep with her head full of ideas but the next morning she had to work hard to wrench her concentration back to her plans for restoring octavian to his proper place for she had had a second one of those dreams about his brother wretched man she thought irritated beyond all reason by the fact that he had so sensuously invaded her dreams she put off going down to breakfast until after she saw lily taking him back down to the apple orchard again the sooner i get all of them off my hands the better she decided feeling very glad that lily had taken responsibility for alexander for the day she told rose that she would be gone overnight and with a sense of relief drove the donkeycart out into the forest and evoked the all forests are one spell to take her to arachnias dark and forbidding palace there she gave octavian one last test resuming her guise as the old woman she came to the back entrance to beg for food not only did octavian give her half of his share but he prevented the stabletroll from running her off and he was about to give up his sleeping place to her as well when she dropped her disguise and revealed herself to him that went well arachnia appeared right on cue dropping her guise as the evil sorceress and the two of them played out the first act of octavians redemption precisely as the tradition preferred in fact the tradition unleashed a veritable flood of magic upon the scene presumably to ensure that acts two and three would take place as well arachnias servants took octavian off to be bathed and reclothed feasted and finally put to bed until the morrow when they would take him back to his father when the hurlyburly was over elena and arachnia retired to the peace and quiet in arachnias library it was nothing like her own cozy little chamber this was a library stretching up three full stories with two balconies ringing it dark banners hung down from the rafters above them banners that featured not the arms of defeated enemies nor of ancestors but beautifully rendered images of creatures normally associated with night several species of owls bats wolves and cats as well as a dragon or two the rare ebon unicorn and the nightmare there was a fireplace in one wall of a size sufficient to make any ox placed on a spit therein look like a suckling piglet dare i ask how you got all of this elena said looking about her arachnia laughed she was all in all very much prettier than she had been when elena had first seen her and for all that she and her poetprince preferred being semi nocturnal much rosier being in love and beloved evidently suited her well indeed i killed the owner she said elena felt her eyes widen youre joking oh no arachnia assured her i was her servant she had a sleeper here she wasnt playing by the tradition and after she enchanted the poor thing she carried the girl off to here her palace she wanted to ensure herself of a steady diet of failed questers without having to work at it too hard ah elena nodded she remembered bella telling her that like those whom the tradition was trying to set down a path not of their choosing there was a great deal of magical power invested in the life of a quester when one failed all that magical power was available to the evil magician and it was also possible to transmute lifeforce into magical power as well so it was in the interest of an evil magician to attract and slay as many questers as possible she had half a dozen human servants that she had kidnapped or lured here and easily three times that in magical servants or enslaved magical creatures she was really dreadful to all of us but i was the only one who dared to think about killing her arachnia shook her head over the cowardice of her former fellow servants i watched for my chance and one day when she was gloating over murdering yet another quester and feasting on the magic that his death had released i pushed her out a window arachnias eyes glinted at the memory elena had to wonder just how bad dreadful had been in order to bring that look to her face the sleeper awoke and ran off with the stableboy arachnia continued in fact everyone ran off except me and the talking statue she indicated a statue in the corner of the library of a very graceful halfnude woman the statue gave elena a stiff little bow elena bowed back and of course a few ghosts i decided to stay partly because i hadnt anywhere else to go and the statue began to talk to me she was the one who discovered that i could see magic she pointed out that this meant that i could be a magician and i decided that i would be the sorceress here i knew that the ghosts would keep everyone away until i had learned enough to be formidable she shrugged not a very exciting story but the statue tells me that i was supposed to have been a witchkiller except that the spiderqueens hunters found me wandering around in the forest before i could find the evil witchs hut which is probably why i could see magic in the first place and why you shoved the spiderqueen out a window i suppose elena said thoughtfully as she watched the swirls and eddies of magic play about the banners overhead it was so thick up there you could practically read by it the tradition really truly wanted octavian reunited with his father and reinstated as the heir and it was putting all sorts of effort to bear on the situation perhaps because not one but two magicians with a habit of opposing it were sitting here with octavians fate in their hands dont witchkilling children usually shove the witches into their own ovens or down wells i suppose shoving just was the natural thing for you to do how old were you seven arachnia said serenely the statue taught me how to read there were plenty of provisions stored under preservation spells more than enough to feed me while i learned magic what i didnt learn from the books here some of the ghosts taught me but of course it was all a bit slanted slanted considering that this has apparently been a stronghold of evil sorceresses for the last three hundred years im surprised that she didnt go completely to the bad but of course elena didnt say that aloud the ghosts are mostly very sweet she continued thoughtfully they were all victims of my former mistress and her predecessors so they were disposed to like me and wish me well and the statue was stolen by her mistress so she wasnt particularly upset about seeing me get rid of the spiderqueen either now what are we going to do with octavian have you any ideas you do realize that whoever brings octavian back is going to become kohlstanias godmother dont you she asked instead of answering directly it was only fair to give arachnia the chance at having the place it would mean another source of magic for her hellfire and damnation arachnia swore with a start no elena if you dont take him back i swear i will revert and curse you elena choked on a laugh well that was certainly vehement enough i thought i ought to at least give you the option i do not want to be a godmother the wretched man is yours and his kingdom with him now have you any ideas two pink spots flared on arachnias cheeks as she calmed herself i dont suppose you have any sort of transportation that flies said elena of all of the means of transportation elena had used as a godmother this was by far the most unique shed had to do some quick cosmetic work on it though or it would have frightened threequarters of the citizenry of kohlstania into fits and had the remaining quarter running for the spears and bows it appeared that there was a reason for the dragonbanners in the library the traditional means of transport for the occupant of this castle was formidable an elaborate black warchariot apparently forged of blackened silver drawn by two black dragonets which were the much smaller unintelligent subspecies of draconis sapiens a third dragonet generally served as the mount for the chariotdrivers outrider this was why the stableman was a troll when the beasts were feeling fractious nothing short of a troll could control them these were not the beasts that octavian usually had charge of although he was familiar with them and they with him elena didnt change much about the rig other than to make it far less menacing she made the chariot and dragonets white an opalescent rose and gold instead of black and silver and she made a few cosmetic changes to the beasts heads giving them more a look of scaly horses than of maneating carnivores octavian got armor to match of course and she herself had donned her most impressive costume as the rose fairy complete with powdered wig and sixfoot staff topped with a pink diamond in the shape of a star octavian was in full armor enameled in white and rose with gilding luckily for him it was magic in nature which made it a great deal lighter than real armor he had gotten very carefully detailed instructions from elena but she was taking no chances there was such a superabundance of magic available that elena took the precaution of putting a tiny geas on him to obey those instructions this time at least she was going to give the tradition what it wanted a full spectacle which would probably turn into a tale that traveled through the kingdoms for generations maybe that would make it leave her alone for a bit and no more dreams she told it fiercely not that she had any evidence that the dreams of alexander of which she had had another last night were coming out of the tradition but she had no evidence to the contrary either and in absence of evidence so the whole outre procession went flying off into the morning sky heading for kohlstania and the royal palace she driving the splendid chariot octavian riding beside her on his winged mount the whole of it buoyed on swirling clouds of magic that would have enveloped them in a thick peasoup fog except that only she could see it it was practically thick enough to cut she had stored as much of it away in wand and staff whatever talismans she had on her person and could put together last night and in her own reserves and still it was like this and that was after she insisted that arachnia divide the power with her the tradition was making certain that the kingdom of kohlstania got its godmother with a vengeance or perhaps it was trying to bribe her into being more cooperative and conciliatory well it wasnt going to work on the other hand there was no harm in taking the bounty that was given naturally since she insisted on flying at a little above treeheight to ensure being seen they attracted a great deal of attention and even with her cosmetic changes they excited a good deal of fear for every face upturned to watch them pass there was someone running for concealment down below so by the time they landed in the courtyard of the royal palace all of the royal guard had turned out armed to the teeth and she suspected that most of the army was on its way from the royal barracks on the outskirts of the city the dragons pulled the vehicle around to stand as near to the door as the guards would allow she remained in her chariot octavian however dismounted from his dragon and took his place between her and the guard with his visor down he looked very formidable indeed she surveyed them all haughtily as the dragons tossed their heads is this any way to greet me she demanded one woman with a single escortknight where is your king she suppressed a smile at her own words though oh yes one mere woman clearly some sort of extremely powerful magician three dragons and a fellow whose face no one can see youre right to be nervous my lads he is here lady said a weary wary voice and the guard reluctantly parted to let king henrick through what is it you would have of me the king was armed as well though hed only had time to buckle on a breastplate over his velvet doublet and replace his crown with an openface helm still he was brave she had to give him that he wasnt hiding in his throne room depending on his guards to protect him he had his sword in his hand and he looked as if he was prepared to use it you have three sons king henrick she said sternly where are they answer me true for i am a magician of no little power and i will know falsehood if i hear it and the cost of falsehood may be more than you can ever dream of course the cost of falsehood would be that she would not allow octavian to reveal himself not that she expected to hear anything but truth out of henrick if everything randolf had shown her was true he had spent a very long time learning a great deal about himself since his sons had vanished and he did not much care for what he had learned he reeled as if she had struck him a blow and yet from the expression on his face it was a blow he had in part expected it did not break him but in that moment she saw him look at her and admit his own defeat and his own failures i know only what has befallen my son julian lady he replied bitterly in my folly in my greed i sent them out all three of them to answer my neighbors quest and win his daughter thinking to add his kingdom to my own and it is true that of the three i sent julian out expecting that he would fail and rid me of the one son i did not understand and could not care for my coldheartedness was wellrepaid it is julian who has won the maid and the throne for himself and not for me and my other sons are lost and in a sense all three are lost to me for i fear that julian knew my heart only too well and will never forgive me so here i am surrounded by wealth that i care nothing for facing my own declining years with neither friend nor son at my side he straightened then and looked her in the eyes so work your will on me witch i am already living in the worst i can dream and i brought it all upon myself she caught octavians eye and nodded slightly he needed no further encouragement father he cried pulling off his helm and flinging himself to king henricks feet father i am here i am home again there was a moment of stunned silence then the king fell upon his son weeping and embracing him as the royal guard erupted into a cheer and after that well that was when things got very interesting indeed it was long after dark that elena finally headed back home to her cottage and she was just about ready to drop with exhaustion first there had been the whole reconciliation scene to play out then some by no means all of the explanation of what had happened to octavian and why then this time in private elena had delivered herself of a bit of a lecture to king and prince not much of a lecture but she had made it very clear that their first act must be to reconcile with julian by delivering the one thing that the king had not been able to bring himself to send an apology a long one for a long list of wrongs and neglect going back into his childhood it was the newlyhumbled octavian whod had no difficulty with this rather obvious necessity and in the euphoria of having his favorite son back henrick had agreed as for the rest well that would mostly be in octavians hands but his redemption had been very real and she didnt think he was going to backslide there would be some gradual improvement in the lot of the common people of kohlstania and it would begin with being accorded the common courtesies that had heretofore been honored more in the breech than the observance she had left flying off into the sunset with the third dragon harnessed with the other two and had returned the whole rig to arachnia by the time darkness fell and by the time she had left there was one very interesting change already visible in kohlstania out in the marketplace there were stalls and shops hung with the signs of various sorts of magicians those hadnt been there when she flew over that morning so magic and magicians were already been accorded a great deal more respect by the sophisticated city folk well it only took looking up and seeing a dragon flying overhead to make a believer out of you she supposed that was yet another change that had been badly needed here from what elena had learned from alexander and her own readings kohlstania had been rapidly on its way to banishing magic altogether and that would have had a very serious effect on the very soul of the country for a country whose people ceased to believe in magic soon lost much of their ability to imagine and dream and before long they ceased to believe or hope for anything this was one of the fundamental truths of the five hundred kingdoms even the lowest of swineherds could believe that he or his son or his sons son could one day be a prince because all it took was magic and being the right person in the right place and the highest of kings could know that at any moment an act of dishonor or cruelty could send him tumbling out of his throne because all it took was magic and doing the wrong thing to the wrong person in this way the tradition could be a blessing and the magic by which it operated certainly was the carrot and the stick madame bella had once said dryly when explaining it all to elena the carrot for the lowly the stick for the mighty it is quite astonishing how effective these things are when applied in that particular order elena left the dragons and their chariot with arachnias troll and enjoyed a fortifying and amusing dinner with the dark lady and her lord at least it had been amusing right up until the moment that they said their farewells and she drove off into the forest alone at that point she was overcome by a spasm of envy so powerful it felt akin to pain she clutched at the reins and slapped them over the donkeys back to make him hurry his pace wise little fellow that he was he ignored her he was going no faster than a walk for he could not see the road well in the darkness she had evoked the all forests are one spell of course and he might even be in her home forest even now but it had never taken less than an hour to traverse the distance between where she was and where she was going and she very much doubted that was going to change tonight just because she was feeling miserable and wanted to be home she stared into the darkness and felt tears dripping down her cheeks arachnia hadnt meant to hurt her of course in fact she had no idea that her words had left elena feeling as if she had been stabbed shed only meant to explain why she had no intention of being the godmother to kohlstania or any other kingdom and she had meant it as a compliment icould never be as strong as you elena she had said earnestly you godmothers living all alone as you do i dont know how you can bear it you completely amaze me now that ive found it i could never stand to be alone the way you are to live my life without love if she could see elena now she would be horrified for she could have no way of knowing how bitter those words had been and how they had made elenas heart ache with pain not just because of what they meant now but what they meant for the future because of course godmothers did live alone who had ever heard of a godmothers consort or a fairy godfather it was one thing to manipulate the tradition it was quite another to forge a new one that would create such a monumental change as that in the back of her mind she had been planning on having alexander with her all winter had been looking forward to his company during the days when snow would confine them all within doors she had not been thinking at all or at least she had not been thinking like a godmother if anything she had been thinking like an ordinary woman which of course she was not that was what arachnias words had made her realize that she would have to put more effort into alexanders redemption so that he could be back in kohlstania himself by the time the snows came that she was going to be spending another long winter alone as she would for the rest of her life chapter i dont know why youre letting him watch this rose complained aloud for the fourth or fifth time as alexander stared intently into the depths of the magic mirror and the scene that was playing out there it would have been fascinating enough to watch just about anything there and know that he was seeing a reflection of something that was going on elsewhere far away but to be able to see his own father and brother well he simply could not tear himself away it was a pity that he could not hear as well as see but randolf was giving a fairly good precis of what was going on rose however was speaking not to alexander who probably would not have answered but to lily because oh impossibly obdurate one itold her to bring him here replied the mirrorspirit randolf in a bored tone and to repeat myself one more time i told her to bring him here this morning because i am something of a predictive mirrorslave and it seemed imperative to me and important to the lads redemption that the prince see and understand what was happening to his father and brother today the godmother has given me fairly broad scope for me to use my own judgment in such matters and this is how i choose to use it the spirit of the mirror paused you do want the boy redeemed dont you out of the corner of his eye alexander saw rose glare at the mirror but she said nothing instead of going out to work in the orchard today directly after breakfast lily had insisted on bringing him into the house right up to this rather feminine chamber where she had placed him on a hassock in front of a mirror that was not silvered but black he thought he had gotten used to magic and the idea of it but when a face appeared in the mirror that was clearly not a reflection of anyone in the room and then when it spoke to him he had nearly jumped up and gone looking for a weapon his selfcontrol had the upper hand however and quite honestly it was impossible to listen to randolf without being amused and forgetting that he was basically a disembodied head and before too long he was talking with randolf almost as if the spirit was an ordinary person rather than something that only lived in a mirror then randolf began showing him what had taken the godmother away from home and that it had to do entirely with his brother octavian now the godmother had been keeping him fairly if sketchily uptodate on the rest of his family but it was one thing to hear about it and quite another to see it octavian just astonished him his brother had never been a weakling but the amount of muscle that he had put on was matched only by the changed look of his face there was thoughtfulness there and intelligence octavian had once seemed a bit imitative reflecting what others thought rather than thinking for himself alexander scarcely left the mirror for anything lily brought him a ploughmans lunch and he ate it without even tasting it it was not only that he was halfstarved for the sight of familiar faces and anxious to know the welfare of his father and brother it was that if octavian had managed to win his freedom how had it been done and could he manage as well at least that was how he had begun his vigil but as he watched his father and brother together and heard from randolf what they were all saying he had realized something quite profound they did not need him oh they wanted to know that he was all right and when elena had assured them in rather vague terms that he was they clearly dismissed him and his current situation with some relief but it had been octavian who had been brought up at their fathers side it had been octavian who was the crown prince the problem that had occurred with julian had in a lesser fashion been going on between alexander and his father hed been raised by nurses and tutors educated by the academy and although he idolized his father he realized that before his return on graduation he had probably spent less than a month in his fathers presence all told realistically he was the spare and with octavian hale and hearty and as like to their father as if theyd been hatched from the same egg there was no place at the kohlstanian court for alexander except as a perpetual princeinwaiting even that promised position as octavians commanderinchief would probably have been in name only the commanders of kohlstanias army were practiced and competent and he was unblooded exceptionally welltrained but unblooded so by the time that randolf showed them elena in her little donkeycart on her way home again the question had been significantly altered in alexanders mind it was no longer how can i get home but do i want to go home what would he do when he got home again oh he could take command of the army he supposed but to what purpose to watch them drill and take them out on parades and make some effort at keeping them sharp the current commanders would be better at that than he was he didnt know a great deal about anything other than military matters and to put it bluntly he doubted that seasoned commanders would give more than lip service to his leadership he had no practice and no real experience and they had no reason to trust his judgment so what would he do when he got back he had a taste of real work and real life now and while he wouldnt miss the blisters and the sweat and the deadstupid physical labor the artificial surroundings of the court did not seem particularly attractive anymore watching the intrigues going on playing politics sitting in on the council sessions and pretending he was actually contributing to the discussions seemed an utter waste of time and a day filled with games hunting flirting wenching and the like wasnt particularly attractive either well perhaps the wenching but a man could only rise to the occasion so many times in a day you couldnt actually fill a day with wenching as a grumbling rose made certain that he was out of the house and heading back to the stables he was no longer sure that he belonged in kohlstania anymore hed had more of those dreams of purple sands and a lovely lady he was not altogether certain of her identity but by now he had a shrewd guess oh yes indeed he could guess the strange light had given an odd color to her hair but under proper sun he reckoned it would be golden and while hed never seen elena in quite so little clothing well that could just be chalked up to the fact that his imagination was very good at creating a picture from a small amount of information not that he was under any illusions that the dreams meant anything except that he had stopped thinking of madame elena as an enemy and someone to blame all of his troubles upon no he was not about to make any overtures in that direction he had no particular wish to go back to being a donkey most of the time not that she wasnt a tasty little thing and not that she wasnt exactly to his particular taste but no and not that she still couldnt make his groin ache if he thought about her in that way but definitely no even if she didnt turn him back into a donkey it wasnt worth finding himself flat on his back with that sort of headache for a second time it was enough that as he had become less of an ass in both senses she had become friendlier if she didnt yet treat him as an equal well maybe he didnt yet deserve to be treated like an equal a godmother was both above birthrank and apart from it so if you want respect from a godmother you have to earn it i suppose he climbed the ladder to his loftroom slowly and as he poked his head through the hole in the floor he realized that tonight he was disinclined to read anything he didnt even light his lamp he merely blew out the one he had brought with him and stripped down in the darkness instead of reading he climbed into his bed and lay there with his hands clasped behind his head thinking no i dont think i want to go home not unless something horrible happens to octavian father would need me then but as long as they know that im all right i suppose it wouldnt matter to them where i am so where should i go and what could i do julian might be able to use him hed always gotten along reasonably well with julian truth to tell though his brother was probably handling the civilians in his new land well enough where the military was concerned julian wouldnt have a clue according to alexanders instructors it was usually better all the way around for a rulers commanderinchief to be someone he trusted and knew personally he could probably talk julian into giving him the position the real question was how julians new people would feel about it and there were other things to consider what the shape of julians army was if he even had an army if he didnt well in that case there was no doubt there was a place for him at julians side building an army up from nothing or back up from decay yes he knew how to do that in theory at least but of course if julian happened to have a perfectly good army and a commanderinchief that suited him then even if alexander talked him into the job there would be a colossal amount of resentment no he wouldnt walk into that particular tigerpitnot without a lot of forethought and planning anyway it might be worth it especially if hed actually be able to accomplish something he tried to think of all of the possible ramifications and repercussions and found himself drifting off to sleep and as he relaxed and his concentration faded away one final very odd thought floated up through the formless shapeless stuff of his dreams i wish its a pity the godmothers dont need an army it was probably a good thing after all that it had taken elena the better part of two hours to get home again by the time she drove up to her door she had managed to cry herself out find a stream wash her face and get herself looking no worse than tired hob was waiting for her ready to take the donkey and cart but surprisingly rose was right at the door and she hadnt even gotten across the threshold before rose made it very clear why shed been waiting or rather lying in wait in order to get a very particular complaint lodged before anyone else could say anything she started at the front entry and continued her complaint all the way up the stairs and on into the suite in your rooms if you please the whole day not a jot of work done and that randolf acting like the lord of the manor i did not act like the lord of the manor came randolfs voice muffled by the velvet drapes that had been drawn across the face of the mirror i merely told lily that in my opinion and based on my presentiment the young man needed to be here to see what you were doing with his brother elena went to the mirror and pulled back the drapes randolf was ensconced squarely in the center of the mirror looking seriously miffed i do not often have premonitory feelings godmother he said stiffly but when i do i am not accustomed to having them questioned he looked down his long nose at rose who sniffed scornfully really godmother particularly from a creature with no experience at predictive magic and no thank you randolf elena said interrupting him by holding up her hand i do understand your feelings but it is roses duty to act in a manner that protects my interests rose looked smug for a moment but elena continued however you are entirely correct your previous owners did use you to foretell the future in a very limited way as we both know and although you lost some of that ability when bella gave you more freedom when you do feel a prescient impulse it is wise for us to act upon it if this happens again in my absence i would wish you to speak with the others first and let them know your reasons before you act just so that everyone knows what is happening and why now both of them gave a derisive sniff which since it probably meant that neither of them felt the victor in the disagreement was the best she was going to manage silly geese randolf took the attitude that since he was entirely a magical entity and had served only queens and kings among dark sorcerers he was somehow higher up in the faerie ranks than a mere houseelf he was in his nonexistent bones a snob while rose who had served godmothers for hundreds of years here believed in her heart of hearts that any decision she made in a godmothers absence should take precedence in her own way she was just as much of a snob as randolf which meant that they were doomed to clash robin and hob either humored her or ignored her when she was in this mood but lily enjoyed slyly tweaking her skirts and it was clear to elena that this time randolf and lily had conspired together to take rose down a peg well here was the one valuable piece of advice that madame klovis had ever given regarding the staff when the servants begin quarreling stay out of it the rest of the advice all you will do is inflate their already bloated opinions of themselves was utter nonsense but the first part was right enough i would have told the prince everything anyway elena continued ignoring the sniffs but i dont think anything but good can come of his actually seeing it all unfold it will probably give him extra motivation to prove that he has reformed and is ready to go back to his family himself that last cost her a pang she ignored it rose looked a little more mollified but randolf frowned but godmother thats he began but once again elena cut him off rose i am wearied to death could the rest of this wait until morning rose flushed mortified at being caught at permitting her own grudge to interfere with the wellbeing of the godmother in residence as elena well knew it was the only thing that would shake her off her current crusade i beg your pardon madame elena she said of course it can wait your bed has been turned down and warmed and theres a tidbit waiting on your bedside table thank you rose elena said but she was already gone whisking herself away as only an embarrassed houseelf could now she turned back to randolf so what was it about your presentiment that was so important you were going to set rose off again she asked with more than a touch of impatience madame randolf said with immense dignity godmother it was important because if i am correct what is going to happen is unprecedented my sense is absolute that prince alexander is perfectly ready to pass any trials of his nature that you or anyone else may set him and also that when he does so he will never leave here make of that what you will it utterly baffles me i certainly cannot imagine a prince of the blood being content with laboring as a common farmhand elena controlled her expression somehow and managed to thank randolf gravely before dropping the curtains over his mirror but inside the emotions that she thought she had brought into check roiled up again if she had not been so tired randolfs words probably would have kept her up late into the night but after a glance out the window to see that there was no light in alexanders loftroom she found herself so exhausted that she nearly fell asleep with the glass of honeyed milk in her hand she caught herself just as it started to slip from her grip she drank it down quickly and got into bed and was literally asleep before she even turned on her side to her usual sleeping position the little shallow waves of the amethyst ocean were as warm against the skin of her feet and calves as the milk she had just drunk she noticed that the filmy little halfhearted excuse for a skirt she was wearing barely came to her knees well at least it wasnt going to get wet while she waded the silkysoft sand was even softer under the water experimentally she reached down to touch the slowly undulating waves then brought her fingers to her lips the water was sweet not salty interesting she wondered what that meant since dreams had their own logic elena are you going to paddle out there all night she looked up alexander was standing just above the waterline watching her with a huge grin on his face unlike her he was attired in real clothing rather than the few bits of veils that she was wearing what on earth was her dream trying to tell her she waded obliquely towards him enjoying the feel of the water on her feet when she was near enough he held out his hand to her and she took it you called me by my name she said curious to hear what the dreamalexander would say to that youve never done that before well i finally figured out who you were he replied and it doesnt matter what i say to you here anyway he continued impudently you arent a godmother here you cant punish me in a dream i can say what i like and i wont end up as a donkey or on my back with a splitting head i can do this he took her in his arms and this he wound both his hands in her hair bent his head and kissed her his lips were already open and hers were parted but in surprise rather than initial arousal because she had just realized not only what he had just said but what it meant this wasnt her dream or to be more accurate it wasnt just her dream it was their dream they were sharing it his tongue teased hers and his hand slipped inside the flimsy bodice of her gown to caress her naked nipple which hardened immediately she thrust all other thoughts aside for later this was a dream and she was going to enjoy it he slipped the straps of her gown off her shoulders and her breasts slid free of the silky fabric the warm breeze played over her shoulders each of his hands cupped a breast now and his thumbs made little circles on the exquisitely sensitive skin little lances of pure pleasure and incredible sensation followed every movement of his fingers and her groin tightened as she opened her mouth to his probing he took his mouth from hers and began to lick and nibble at her neck she discovered that ah the wonders of the dreamstate his shirt had vanished altogether and she moved her hands over his chest the muscles moving marvelously under her palms as he breathed until her fingers found his nipples and it was her turn to make him gasp but he took his revenge immediately before she knew what he was about his head had moved lower and he fastened his mouth on her breast and his tongue and teeth were so much cleverer than his fingers had been that it was all she could do to stand upright dreamlogic again for the very next moment they were lying in the soft sand both of them utterly naked he moved the attentions of his mouth to her left breast and she moaned aloud her hands in his hair wanting to keep him there forever but also wanting more he chuckled his free hand went to work on her right breast and she felt her back arching without her even thinking about moving and then his hand began to move lower lower her legs parted involuntarily as his fingers just stirred the first soft hairs of her sex and a rooster crowed right in her ear swearing she woke up the wretched bird crowed again it wasnt right in her ear but it was certainly just under her window she was breathing as hard as if she had been running her secret parts were still tight and hot with need and if at that moment she could have gotten her hands on an axe there would have been poultry for dinner instead she closed her eyes and forced herself to think rationally difficult though that was under the circumstances it wasnt the damned birds fault it must not have gotten into the coop with the rest before lily closed them all in for the night it was lucky it had escaped the ferrets foxes and owls it was dawn it was only behaving like a rooster there was some cold comfort in knowing that alexander had been jolted just as rudely out of the same dream think about this she reminded herself rationally you were sharing the same dream that doesnt happen to just anyone unless she was greatly mistaken that meant that alexander had a touch of magic himself probably not a lot or he would have been able to put up some resistance to her spells even with no training at all but even a little magic was certainly enough to qualify as a hedgewizard that put something of a different complexion on things even a little magic would allow him into the brotherhood of magicians which meant which meant he could stay he wouldnt be a common or uncommon outsider anymore he could be allowed free access to everything here ihave to find out if the elves will give him the power to see magic if they will if they did then there was no question if he chose to remain here as part of the household the mere fact that the elves gave him a magical ability of that nature would mean that not only could he stay if he wanted to but that they intended for him to stay even rose would have to give in to the will of the great ones of faerie only those born to be among the sorcerers could see magic naturally as arachnia did and there were plenty of witches and hedgewizards who never having the chance to gain that power went on and blithely worked with magic without being able to see it you didnt need to see it to be effective it simply made things much easier for the godmothers and wizards if they were able to see the magic following the will of the tradition and could gauge how strong it was at a glance that was why they were always given the gift after they were accepted by the fae and when she remembered that a plan fell into place in her mind whole and entire and despite the level of her frustration she very nearly laughed aloud if it worked if it worked well there would be some changes if it didnt shed be no worse off than she was now and with that she was able to fall back to sleep this time without dreams i take it you can hunt lily said to alexander over breakfast never heard of a noble who couldnt but are you any good at it he blinked at her in surprise still feeling a bit muzzyheaded from the dream that had been so rudely interrupted by that wretched rooster if hed had ready access to an axe thered have been poultry for robins stew pot this morning rose was assiduously ignoring him but everyone else seemed interested in his answer so he took the time to think about it before he said anything well id have to ask what you wanted me to hunt for and with he said wondering what had prompted the question im good with any kind of bow pheasant quail waterfowl im quite good at hunting those rabbit and hare are best taken with snares youre more likely to lose or break arrows going after them with a bow and i have to be honest with you i never learned how to set a snare he was not going to say that the snare was considered to be fit only for peasants to use if its deer youre wanting i would feel more comfortable with a crossbow without a hound to help me track a wounded one i want to be able to take the beast down at once not let it run off to die slowly at that he saw hob smile approvingly and went on feeling encouraged i wont hunt boar alone thats for fools and braggarts although if theres a boar giving one of your villages trouble you can count on me for the hunt and i wont hunt anything i cant eat and i count swan stork crane and heron in that category does that answer your question perfectly said lily with great satisfaction we have beef and chicken and goose too but robin wants deer in storage and some wild fowl the house has a larder that preserves anything put into it and keeps it at the state it was when it went in robin said gravely turning away from his cooking for a moment youve heard us speaking about the house growing and you recall from yesterday that madame elena is now the godmother for kohlstania as well as her other kingdoms as a godmothers responsibilities grow so do her obligations and we believe that we may be required shortly to be able to play host to visitors i wish to have something more on hand than the ingredients for simple countryfare and we dont hunt lily concluded if you do and youre good at it then godmother thinks youre ready to have the bounds taken down so you can go hunting a few months ago that pronouncement would have set his plans for running into motion what more could he have possibly asked he was being made free of the forest and fields with a weapon in his hands no matter how far away kohlstania was he was certain he would be able to find his way there of course that was before he learned thanks to what had happened to octavian that the godmother was perfectly capable of putting a curse on someone that would make him wander in circles until she cared to collect him he might still have considered making the attempt to escape but no when he left this place he wanted it to be because he was deemed ready to go like octavian id prefer fowl to begin with robin was saying interrupting his thoughts since i dont believe well be seeing more than one or two important visitors at a time at least at first frankly wild boar is no tastier than domestic swine and we have plenty of farmers prepared to sell or trade us for pork id like to be deeper into fall before i hunt deer he replied and since were hunting for the pot i would prefer to draw them to a baitspot where ive set up a blind anyway it might not be as sporting but it will give me a better chance to select a target and the best chance for a clean quick kill ill leave the does and the kingstag given my choice and cull out some of the younger bucks that sounds like a fine plan robin nodded agreeably hob finished your plate hob asked and at alexanders nod said come with me then well get something that suits you and ill point you in a good direction for some fowling it was to another of the outbuildings that hob led him one that was no bigger than a gardening shed on the outside and in fact the last time alexander had looked at it it had been a gardening shed empty but for a few pots but when hob opened the door ah i thought that mightve happened hob said with satisfaction alexander knew he should not have been surprised and yet he foolishly was outside was a shed he could have circled in ten paces inside was a royal huntinglodge with polished wooden floors covered with bright carpets polished wooden walls adorned with huntingtrophies from all manner of animals including a span of antlers that must of once belonged to a creature the size of a small elephant and furnished with massively constructed chairs and benches and there must have been a second perhaps even a third floor since there was a staircase beside the door there were no windows on the outside ten enormous glass windows on the inside let in the light from a landscape of stunning beauty a wide meadow studded with flowers on one side and a forest with tall graceful trees of no species he recognized on the other it was mountainous too the purple snowcapped mountains rising above the trees at the far edge of the meadow and of course there were no mountains within sight of the godmothers cottage good place for putting visitors said hob matteroffactly course the great fae can come avisiting by coming through here an they choose and as alexander stumbled across the threshold hob strode the length of the lodge to the racks of huntingbows on the wall at the far end which also had a door in it come along lad he called over his shoulder reaching for a longbow youll want to check the pull on these for yourself alexander hurried across the room which did not show a single sign of wear dust or occupancy and took the bow that hob had selected it was a thing of beauty the work of a master craftsman who had not wasted time skill or the strength of the wood on foolish carving or inlaywork it was a thing of perfectly polished simplicity the close grain of the wood speaking for itself the surface like satin only the ends were sweetly capped with silverchased fittings alexander nocked the string and tried the pull too light he said with disappointment for it was an otherwise exquisite piece and had roused an unexpected avarice in him aye well youve muscled up a bit since you came here hob replied with a smug smile doubt you could still fit in that candysoldier tunic you showed up wearing and before alexander could react to that statement hob handed him another this one just as fine as the first differing only in the chasing on the silver tipcaps was still a bit light but the third choice felt perfect and hob took down a quiver full of fowling arrows and a second of targetarrows and led him back outside again have you seen that place before alexander asked as they set up a target at the bottom of the garden oh aye back when the godmother here thatd be madame beaubaton was the first mortal after the fae godmother the emerald fairy replied hob eying the distance between alexander and the target back up a bit lad i think youll find with that pull you have more distance to work with aye by rights she shouldve been a sorceress should madame but she was more minded to the herding of things so to speak happens that way sometimes them as should be sorcerers decides they want to be more active said she didnt care to sit on a mountain and wait for a great quest to set things aright when she could nip trouble in the bud he sighed reminiscently that there was the huntinglodge of the emerald fairy and thats fae lands you see outside the windows and since madame was so powerful and all the lodge stayed put until we didnt need it again last of the outbuildings to shut up and first to open fae can come and go from there and now probably will oh aye we had visitors in them days great sorcerers mortal kings and fae needed the room then me and the rest we was under servants then serving under ald kelm hes sir kelm now if you please him as runs the elven queens household as her seneschal now never dull but a morto work i tell you we scarce need magic now but then crikey couldnt get through a day without casting till you was dizzy with it and that was just to keep the stables clean so many invisible servants the air fair buzzed with em do you miss it alexander asked taking careful aim truth to tell no ah good see i told you that youve got more range with this one as alexander took aim again his first shot having hit the target but high hob continued no im a simple fellow and i like a simpler life we all do or we wouldnt be here but now well done there thats not to say i wouldnt like things a little livelier a visitor now and again thats a good thing seeing some of the great fae madame elenas like madame bella before her shes got some good notions not minded to just react to what the tradition does more inclined to do a bit more pushing and a bit less following if you take my meaning id like to see some of the great ones putting some consideration into her notions but a court here again like madame beaubaton and the emerald fairy before her no no now there you go youve got the range of her now alexanders last arrow hit dead in the center and he felt comfortable with the bow now well he replied i agree with you now where do you suggest i go much to roses exasperation elena was taking alexanders place out in the old orchard though little did rose guess that elena was doing so in order to talk with lily privately all that rose knew was that elena and hob had decided to see what alexander would do with the freedom to hunt alone and unescorted she didnt know that this was part of a much larger plan nor that lily had gone to see if she could have an audience with the elven king before the sun rose this morning so madame like you thought when i mentioned the lad they took me right to his majesty and like you said i made no suggestions lily upended her basket of apples into the back of the cart and elena followed it with hers a moment after i just said that you were looking for a real trial for the prince knowing that hed recognize all the usual sorts of things and that you were sending him out hunting today and his majesty did give me a look then told me to tell you that hed see to it personally she gave elena a look of her own pleased but wary well she was right to be wary elena shivered a little it is chancy leaving this sort of thing to them she said soberly the great fae dont always think like us she included the houseelf in that brownies were as close to mortal in their ways of thinking as any fae could get true enough lily agreed whatever trial they give him is going to be dangerous but letting him wander about in the forest like a donkey would have been dangerous sending him off on any redemption trial would have been dangerous questing is dangerous and with all that reading hes been doing he will recognize just about any trial that you could put him to that the great fae dont think like mortals will just mean that hes not likely to recognize a trial for what it is until after hes passed it or its too late elena thought but kept that thought to herself so they worked on side by side with a tacit agreement to say no more about it if alexander passed his trial and if he was the something that the king had been looking for and if he was so unusual that randolf was right and he was suited to remain here only the king and queen could make that judgment and mark him in a way that even rose would respect elena knew now as she had not known when she first came as an apprentice that the first godmother the emerald fairy was the sister of huon the king of the sylvan elves of this part of the fae lands he had a particular association with the godmothers of this place though his queen made most of the decisions concerning the mortals who lived here he had the right of direct intervention whenever he cared to exercise it but she still worried had she been within her rights to call on the elven king and queen for this had she been within her rights to subject alexander to that sort of danger the fae operated by laws and rules that few mortals really understood but how else was she to test him and if randolf was right about him how else was she to get the authority to allow him to stay well it was out of her hands now and whatever happened she would have to live with the result or the blame now this is the way to hunt alexander thought with great satisfaction as he stood on the edge of a sundrenched meadow waistdeep in waving grass a light breeze stirring his hair hob had outfitted him with moleskin breeches stout boots a doeskin jerkin and a most remarkable game bag made it myself back in the day hed said with great pride and besides being of fine workmanship there was another reason for the pride it was magical it would hold virtually as much as you cared to put into it without ever getting an ounce heavier alexander had already stuffed two pheasants and a half dozen quail into it it was much better than trying to carry around a conventional game bag or tying the game to your belt it was better even than having to trail around with a crew of servants to carry what you shot since a pack of servants always managed to scare off so much game that it hardly seemed worth having them along he missed having beaters or a dog though having to go it alone flushing his own game was chancy when confronted with a single man quail and pheasants were as likely to run away under the cover of the grass as they were to flush into the air on the other hand given those circumstances he wasnt doing badly and it was wonderful being out here without anyone looking over his shoulder it was a perfect day too sun bright in a blue sky air crisp not enough breeze to give him any serious windage problems in fact he could almost believe that he was a free man free to do whatever he a shriek cut across the peace of the meadow startling a covey of quail into the air practically at his feet they whirred away tiny wings a blur presenting him with five clear shots but he had no time for game now not when a second scream rent the air and he knew it for the cry of a woman in terror the quail were barely in the air and he was already half across the meadow running in the direction from which the scream had come a third scream put more speed into his heels and he burst through a coppice of birch trees to find himself at what was clearly a woodcutters cottage with an axe still in the stump and a pile of wood chopped that was as tall as the cottage and a second and third beside it a chestnut palfrey in fancy tack was tied to a sapling nearby he took little more note than that of his surroundings though not with the bleeding body of what must have been the woodcutter himself lying facedown on the ground and a young woman struggling in the grasp of a richly dressed man not thirty feet away without even thinking about it he had an arrow nocked and flying and a second one drawn the first flew right past the mans ear close enough to brush him with the fletching and thunked into the tree behind him just as alexander had intended the man froze the struggling girl still in his grasp she could not have been much older than fourteen or fifteen and only just womanripe and once maybe alexander would have laughed to see this and gone on his way for the girl and the man on the ground were only peasants after all and had he not come down the path that madame elena had laid for his feet some future harder alexander might even have demanded his share of the girl but that past alexander was gone and the future one erased and this bastard be he never so noble was not of a like kind with the alexander who stood there with his second arrow aimed for the eye the stranger slowly met alexanders gaze he was clad in blue velvet and silk and around his neck was a thick chain of golden links otherwise he was nondescript with short hair cut to fit beneath a helm and an ordinary enough moustached face well met fellow the man said coolly come to take a share of the spoils i saw her first but youre welcome to her when let her go said alexander feeling an icy fury rising up in him at the sight of the poor childs terror i dont think you quite understand the situation here the man replied without turning a hair these are my lands i own these peasants they are mine to let her go alexander interrupted with a roar lands you may well own but people never now unless you want my arrow in your eye the man barked a laugh and what if my men have you in their sight what then i can drop you before they can reach me alexander countered instantly he knew it for truth he also knew that it was unlikely the man would have positioned his men in hiding if hed even come with men at all if they had bows id be dead already assuming they even exist now let her go you have until the count of three or you die like the baseborn cur you are one slowly the mans grip loosened on the terrified girl two the girl wrenched herself free and threw herself down beside the man on the ground alexander did not lower his bow girl he barked girl weeping she looked up from the victim does that man live he asked harshly she nodded tears streaming down her face good then hell last long enough for us to find him help and deal with this dog here give him what tending you can then get you rope from the house the face of the nobleman went blank just what precisely do you intend fellow he asked carefully and the girl ran back to the house justice alexander replied succinctly i see by the belt you wear that you are a knight or you pretend to that rank by the laws of chivalry i could kill you where you stand for the insult you gave that maiden the mans face went black with rage and he shook as he made his reply you dare he howled you dare take me to task for what i do with my cattle on my shut your mouth alexander roared again yes i take you to task for people are not cattle to do with as you will and the vows you swore as a knight bind you to honor all women be they never so base and speaking of bind bind him girl bind his hands behind him and bind his arms to his body then take up that poor man and put him on that horse i see over there he jerked his head in the direction of the richly caparisoned palfrey that clearly belonged to the knight you will lead the horse and i will prod this dog before us and we will go to a lady who will see justice done for you and to this and the man and the maid abruptly burst into peals of delighted laughter like the wild pealing of joyful bells ringing out for a great victory and the triumphant trumpeting of bugles on the battlefield and before alexander could even begin to react to that the body on the ground vanished and the cottage vanished and the peasant maid and the richly clad knight also vanished but in their places stood two beings the like of which alexander had never before seen that they were fae elves he had no doubt but they were to the brownies and that odd little creature he might or might not have met down at the pond what a brilliantly faceted diamond was to a quartz crystal or perhaps what lightning and thunder were to the little spark that came from rubbing silk against amber there were no words to describe them adequately and now he knew why when the books in elenas library had tried to tell what the great fae were like they simply said their like is not in the world there were things that marked them the delicately pointed ears the long and narrow faces the slender graceful bodies the groundsweeping manes of silken hair that graced both sexes the strange intricately wrought garb that they wore that was both jewelry and clothing in all the colors of green that ever there were but none of that was what they were if enchantment had a form it was theirs well done prince alexander said the she who was a queen among her people surely and well and truly said and meant for meaning is as important as action you have passed our test more than passed pearl of my heart the male also most surely royal we looked only to see he intended a rescue instead he dared to think of justice and against one he might well have sought common cause with once as alexander slowly lowered his bow the string going slack in his fingers they both approached him with deliberate grace and gliding steps yes the king continued fixing alexander with a penetrating gaze yes i believe he is what i hoped for then a gift i grant to you prince among mortals said the queen for it is i think a gift that you will use wisely and well and she reached out with one long slender finger and touched him lightly in the middle of his forehead and a second time on his lips he licked them involuntarily and tasted something like honey it was as if some dam inside him burst and suddenly he was flooded with sensation mostly vision as swirls and clouds of glowing light sprang up around him and all about him but mostly circling the two elves but there were other things sensations he couldnt quite put a name to but which left him dazzled nonetheless then the king did the same but this time nothing happened or at least nothing obvious now go you back to dwelling of the mortal godmother called elena said the king with a pleased chuckle and tell her alexander managed oh she will know what to make of you the queen said amid more peals of that silvery laughter that he joined in with without quite knowing why he did so trust me she will know chapter madame elena said rose in a rather strained voice she peered into the doorway of elenas study to which elena had been banished when lily felt that she had done more than her share of applepicking the prince has returned i think you had better see him elena looked up rose looked as if she had seen something she still could not believe yet dared not disbelieve she looked shocked rather than smug but shocked as in having her own view of the world turned upside down rather than if something truly dreadful had happened to the prince that even she was appalled by so hes returned in triumph i suspect elena took a deep breath and let it out in a sigh of relief all of her tension going with it it was over and it had gone well alexander had passed the trial and apparently managed to do a great deal better than merely pass it behind his curtain she heard randolf chuckle with immense satisfaction rose did not even glance his way very well ill come down elena said setting aside the chronicle she was reading rose turned and was gone by the time she reached the door onto the staircase she went down the stairs and passed through the parlor and the library and noted that most of the books had left the parlor though whether the houseelves had moved them or they had moved themselves she could not say what mattered was that the new library room must have opened up in the night i shall have to look into that in a bit she thought hastening her steps at the sound of voices in the kitchen there she found all of the houseelves rose included and alexander they were standing he was sitting at the table dressed in huntinggear cradling a cup of ale and looking bewildered there was no doubt why rose had reacted to the sight of him in the way that she had the amount of magic about him was matched only by the magic that had swirled around octavian when it was time for him to return to kohlstania but that could have been explained away what could not be explained away was the forms that had been laid over him and that was what had given rose her shock the same forms had been laid upon elena though she had not known it when she was accepted as an apprentice the elfqueens mark was on the prince in the form of a crimson bird with flaming wings the sign of the protector laid over his head and shoulders visible to those with the eyes to see magic and yes the elfkings as well a circlet of emerald fire around his brow that raised a narrow mildeyed head at her approach and showed itself to be not a circlet at all but the emerald serpent the symbol of wisdom both would fade in time probably by morning but the mark upon the spirit was there for all time there it was the elven royalty had accepted him if he chose to remain here he could not be turned away small wonder that rose had been shaken alexander looked up at the sound of her footstep and it was very clear from his expression that he was utterly bewildered she knew how he felt to see magic itself raw and primal for the first time and not to know what it was he must think himself going mad its all right she said immediately and sat down beside him patting his hand youre not moonstruck the elves marked you and when they did they opened your eyes to see magic you must have some magical ability of your own or they wouldnt have been able to do that it means that not only did you pass the trial they set you but theyve accepted you as a kind of of knight of magic like i am actually you have to be able to see magic to use it with finesse if you can see it you can do more with a very little ability than someone with more ability but unable to see its very disorienting he said carefully just want it to go away she told him these things answer to the trained will and i know you have that all that military training you had must have given you discipline at first it might help to close your eyes before you concentrate on making it go away then when you want to see magic again want it to come back its probably the easiest of all of the magic powers to control he closed his eyes and opened them again and relief spread over his features its gone i told you it would be she patted his hand again i dont think you heard me the first time youve passed your final trial prince alexander just like your brother would you like to go home that last cost her to ask but the offer had to be made and if he said yes she would have to honor his request but he opened his mouth then closed it again without saying anything then opened it again im a magician he asked instead of answering her they all nodded even rose now that you can see magic even though you dont know how to use it yet aye said hob and seeing it youll train up right quick he looked thoughtful how powerful am i he asked this time looking to elena she shook her head i dont know for certain she cautioned but i would guess not very no more than a country witch or a hedgewizard if you were more powerful than that youd have come into your powers earlier and youd at least have felt them every day all the time as if there was something you should be doing something amazing that was going to happen to you though you didnt know what it was he rubbed at a scratch on his cheek absently what about now and again feeling like there was someone looming over me watching me hedgewizard all the brownies chorused at once with rose looking relieved thats just the sense that the power is there lad said hob as it was of course it looms over everyone born royal from time to time now huh ive a thought he glanced at elena who nodded encouragement well he said slowly its been a long long time since ive seen such a man but its also a long time since anyone wizardborn was also warriortrained it comes to me that you dont need a lot of magic to be a champion a what asked elena but she was drowned out by a chorus of what sounded like fervent curses from the other three houseelves now why didnt i see that coming lily said aloud throwing her hands up in the air of course it would be nice if someone would explain this to both of us mere mortals the prince said but so plaintively that it would have been impossible for anyone to take offense youve heard of the green knight the knight of the black rose sir gavin the hawk at each of those names alexander nodded vigorously well they was all champions the great fae have em among them of course warriors with a bit of magic but sometimes they see a mortal they think worthy and make him one too specially if they think hes the kind to go charging in without regard for his own safety seeking justice protecting the innocent defending the virtuous all that knightly sort of thing for some reason that elena could not fathom alexander blushed but nodded thing is you see now you know not everything that comes out of faerie thinks kindly of mortals eh and some of those things just laugh at ordinary swords and arrows and whatall hob waited to see if alexander was following him and as the prince nodded he went on now of course you know that theres magic swords and so on that can take such an enemy down but a champion dont need a magic sword or arrow or spear because whatever weapon he has is magic when he chooses you see you may not be able to channel much magic into your weapon but any magic is enough to make it bite and bite as hard as you can hit elena felt her eyes widen and alexanders mouth formed a silent oh ye see said hob with satisfaction you mind gavin the hawk thats how he got through the scorpion kings black armor how do i learn to do this alexander asked eagerly weell id say to go look in the chronicles to be sure but i think youll find you dont need to learn it lily put in i think once you can see magic its more a matter of will and instinct than learned and practice lots of practice with someone who can see magic to supervise now alexander turned to elena you said i can go he said hesitantly but may i stay instead just until i understand all this he added quickly flushing but theres probably not anyone in all of kohlstania who could help me and and he averted his eyes well fathers got octavian back they dont exactly need me and i would be truly deeply grateful if you could help me i dont know why i was given this thing but i cant see having it and going off to kick my heels at home and not use it elena looked at him gravely prince alexander you do realize what it means if you take this on yourself being a champion is not not i know it means my life wont be my own he replied and now he looked up to meet her eyes again but it never was was it its just trading one set of responsibilities for another then an altogetherly unexpected bitter tone crept into his voice at least ill have real responsibilities and a real job that no one else can do she was taken aback by that for a moment in fact everyone in the kitchen seemed to be and strangely enough it was rose who answered him thats no less than the truth prince alexander she replied and for once there was no halfhidden scorn or irony in her voice become a champion truly and therell be no secondson makework for you then thats what i want he said firmly and looked back at elena may i stay but she looked at the other four its not only up to me she said you only play at being servants here when alls said and done you have as much say in this as i do i have never ever heard of a champion in the household of a godmother before be damned useful hob said stroking his chin thoughtfully cant think of anyone else to send him to observed robin and i can show him what to do i think it cant be much different than using a wand ill get his things said lily and ill make up the guestsuite said rose both at the same time well then its unanimous elena said trying not to show her elation but i will insist on one thing you must inform your father that you are well whatever else you tell him is up to you i can arrange to have the letter to him by nightfall he grinned ill use the things in the study shall i or will you require me to write it in blood she aimed a blow at his ear which he ducked in the study with you your highness she said and still grinning he obeyed oh me she thought looking after him half in pleasure half in dismay what have i bound and what have i unleashed the letter went off carried by one of the wise old white ravens that hung about the place which were fed from the leftovers carefully saved from meals as arachnia used bats as her messengers so elena as had madame bella before her used the clever white ravens and she watched in randolfs mirror as king henrick and prince octavian read the letter sighed a great sigh of relief and then went on with their lives so there it was alexander had been right all that had awaited him in kohlstania was makework cooling his heels and no real responsibility and she she had a championintraining in her household and she did not know whether to be glad of it champions could be called out to any need at any time to right any injustice fight any good fight and so can godmothers champions lives were not their own no more are godmothers but he was busy here and she thought happy robin was making good on his promise to teach alexander the channeling of magic power which was coming harder for him than it had for her yet another proof had she needed one that he had not been born with the ability of a full wizard that was a relief to her for if he had been a wizard he would eventually been given responsibility for kingdoms of his own and he would have had to set up his own household in the midst of them now that she knew what to look for she had gone back through all of the library books and the godmother chronicles and had found champions after all she had paid little attention to the mentions of them before this partly because she had been under the mistaken impression that they were just a different sort of knight and that their ability to slay the terrible creatures of the black fae and those enslaved by dark sorcerers was merely that somewhere along the line they had gotten hold of those rare magical weapons it had never occurred to her that they were magical weapons in and of themselves silly of her now that she came to think of it still in all of it she never came across a reference to a champion attached to the household of a godmother to sorcerers and sorceresses yes to kings certainly most of them seemed to wander about singly or with a group of adventurers looking for trouble to eliminate she was put in mind which would at this point not be the thing to tell alexander even though it was awfully funny of the bands of traveling ratcatchers with their ratcharmers rattrappers and ferreters who went from town to town getting rid of pests of all sorts it seemed that no matter what she would have him with her undisturbed through the winter at least for as the season turned it became quite clear that magic did not answer readily to alexanders hand the last of the harvest was gathered in as the leaves turned and fell from the trees and the cruel november winds began to blow and only by that time was he getting the knack of directing power into material objects and having it remain there he did turn his hand to the household work without being asked but elena had the distinct feeling that there was a lot more being harvested from the orchards and gardens than could be accounted for by only overt work of the six members of the household she had a shrewd guess that the brownies were now using more of their magical powers than they used to but of course by the tradition that sort of thing had to happen in secret where and when no mortals could see so she just averted her eyes from the huge stores of apples vegetables and nuts in the cellars and went on about her business there was still an abundance of magical power looming over the household not pushing as she was accustomed to feeling the tradition but just hovering if a mountain could hover that is for that is what it felt like to her the tradition was clearly nonplussed by what was going on here but as she was operating completely outside of any traditional path it didnt quite know what to do with her and alexander for the moment she was not going to argue it kept her personal stores of magic topped up and provided extra for all the things that the houseelves were doing meanwhile it appeared that hob and robin were calling in favors from fae outside the household piece by piece armor was appearing wonderful stuff as light as cork but stronger than steel and fitted to alexander exactly he had a bow already from the huntinglodge hob found him a sword and an axe and shield and robin made him a lance he was a proper part of the household now and even the house responded by opening up an entirely new suite of rooms uncompromisingly masculine and suited to a warrior complete with an armorstand and a big empty barnlike room in which he could practice the windows looked out into some other part of faerie than the huntinglodge did his rooms appeared to have been built in the edge of a sheer cliff overlooking the sea it gave rose vertigo she had to leave the cleaning there to robin or lily it was not an amethystcolored sea under a sky with two moons though elena expected him to comment on that but he did not in fact even though the delicious frustrating dreams continued he said nothing he treated her with respect with honor with courtesy in fact he was acting in the most knightly fashion possible it was utterly maddening not that she didnt want respect honor and courtesy but but she also would not let the tradition turn this into a bedroom farce or worse she would not let it undo all the work she had done to help him become someone that the great fae the great fae had been willing to make into a champion she would not allow all of that to be wasted no matter what it cost her on that she was determined even if all she got out of this was respect honor and courtesy alexander stood quietly looking out of the window of the library at the road to the cottage which was disappearing under a thick snowfall as dusk fell the houseelves had gone to bed or at least they had gone to wherever their private quarters were leaving the house quiet elena had sent them off early tonight insisting that they could and should take a kind of halfholiday we can manage dinner for ourselves shed said he hadnt objected though she had looked at him oddly as if she had expected him to this fit in altogether perfectly with some halfformed ideas of his own and even if he had to eat stale bread and rancid cheese tonight he wasnt going to discourage anything that left the house empty for once because having the brownies around was frankly awkward you never knew when they were going to just pop in a doorway and he was very tired of awakening in the morning with his groin aching from one of those delightful and frustrating dreams he had decided that he was going to court elena court not seduce because his intentions were ultimately honorable that is if godmothers were permitted to wed mind if the bedding preceded the wedding by quite some time he wouldnt object it wasnt that he objected in the least to a wedding but well he had the feeling that the wedding of a godmother would turn into an occasion that would be the talk of a dozen kingdoms and possibly the center of news for a dozen more he knew what weddings were like in a single kingdom bloody hell you had to plan the wretched things for months or even years in advance and the celebrations generally stretched on for a month or more which tended to make things a great deal less than comfortable for the newly wedded couple and the wedding of a godmother he rather fervently prayed that he was wrong because there were old old stories that described wedding celebrations between very great heroes and important princesses that carried on for a year and a day and no no he could not manage to perform for performance would be what it was for an audience of thousands every day all day for a year and a day and he didnt think that such a thing would really appeal to elena either if the tradition even allowed it a formal wedding might bring down all sorts of horrible calamities on their heads but becoming lovers well there was nothing in the tradition against it so far as he could see witches and hedgewizards could and did take spouses and lovers sorcerers and sorceresses took lovers all the time consorts they were called and even the masculine counterpart to the godmother the full wizards were mentioned to have companions from time to time no mention for godmothers but there was also nothing against the idea either and maybe that was because the godmothers were all assumed traditionally to be fae or because they were simply very very discreet but he knew that he was going to have to tread very very carefully his old ways were not going to work with elena she was not to be conquered not to be seduced and certainly not to be taken by force and the truth was that he didnt want to do any of those things the truth was he didnt want to change the slowly unfolding friendship that was building between them especially now that he had some of her respect he just wanted to add to it well he was going to try tonight and with luck he wouldnt find himself flat on his back in the stable with a head like a ringing bell as darkness fell elena began rummaging among the things in the pantry and alexander probably hearing the clatter came wandering in with a wistfully hopeful look on his face i dont know anything about cooking that doesnt involve spitting a bird over a fire he admitted its not the sort of thing that princes are taught well it is the sort of thing that i had to learn she replied dryly or did i not ever tell you my sordid little lifehistory actually he said looking interested no of course i know now that all godmothers and a lot of wizards are out of failed tradition paths so i assumed you were too which one she told him as she rummaged up the ingredients for omelettes and began cracking eggs into a bowl he listened with every evidence of interest and when she thrust a knife and some mushrooms at him managed to chop them without losing either the interest or the fingers so you would have married a prince he said when hed finished how odd i cant see you in that role somehow oh maybe it would have been all right for you when you were sixteen or even eighteen but not now crown princesses dont really do very much other than the occasional good work and i cant imagine you being content with being merely ornamental wandering about the palace gardens and posing amongst the peacocks sitting for hours at your embroidery frame it seems too passive well my goodness why thank you for that she said carefully tending the pan over the stove i believe that is one of the nicest things you have ever said to me i must admit i cant imagine you kicking about idly in your fathers court anymore no neither can i he watched with interest as she slid the first omelette onto a plate i swear that must be some sort of magic of its own turning things into food i mean hmm robin would agree with you she turned out her own omelette and joined him at the table have you ever thought about how brave the first person to eat an egg must have been think about the way they look raw i mean eeeyew they ate in silence which she took as a good sign that she hadnt produced a dinner that positively revolted him but after the food was gone and the dishes left in the sink an awkwardsilence sprung up between them it lasted long enough to become uncomfortable until finally she stood up abruptly but so did he at the exact same moment somehow either her feet got tangled up in the legs of the chair she had been sitting in or she lost her balance a little for whatever reason she started to fall and was just catching herself when she found instead that he had caught her for a moment in which she found herself strangely short of breath they stood in a frozen tableau faces mere inches apart staring into each others eyes she expected him at that moment to seize her as he had tried before expected a hand to paw at her breast and all the rest of it expected in fact anything except what actually happened elena he said haltingly have you been dreaming of purple oceans she nodded speechless he sighed oh good then may i kiss you only if you do it the way you do it there she replied without thinking and he did and it was better than in the dream they separated only when it became obvious at least to her that if they didnt they were likely to end up naked on the kitchen floor which was very hard and very cold he was breathing very heavily as if he had been running i i wasnt intending not like im not he said really i swear and i wouldnt i dont she stared deeply into his eyes for a long moment then said i think we should take this discussion to your rooms he blinked why theyre downstairs theyre closer randolf not that randolf couldnt watch them anyway in all likelihood but at least he wouldnt be in the next room ah he cleared his throat elena may i invite you to my rooms you may she replied suppressing the urge to giggle and i accept your invitation it struck her that nothing he was doing or saying would have fit in with any traditional path not a bawdy song not a tale of seduction and abandonment was he deliberately trying to break with the tradition or was this purely by accident whichever it was he gravely led the way to his suite bowed her in with just as much gravity and then looked as if he was at a loss for what to do next she made up his mind for him by sitting down on the hearthrug which was the skin of a bear bigger than anything she had ever seen it must have been the size of a drafthorse when it was alive the fire didnt need poking up but he did it anyway then sat down beside her she was trying to think of something to say when he spoke tell me about your dreams will you he asked do you have them every night are they always the same ive been having them most nights and theyre never exactly the same she said staring into the fire leaning back on her elbows they always start when i find myself in a a very odd place im on the shore of some large body of water and its night but very bright bright enough to see colors because there are two moons in the sky he said instantly and the sand is purple so is the water its sweet too not salty she put in is it i never tasted it he replied a little surprised when my dreams start im usually right at the waters edge so am i but sometimes im wading in the water up to my ankles she raised an eyebrow at him and i dont seem to be wearing very much to speak of ah he flushed and couldnt look at her for a moment when i was very young i had a book of tales and thats the sort of thing the fairies in it wore of course he continued thoughtfully they also looked like tenyearold children which you dont especially not in that she said dryly and he flushed again apparently were having the same dream does that mean something he asked and ran his fingers through his hair nervously is it significant i wish i could tell you she turned her gaze back to the fire what i can tell you is that i like you in the dreams and out of them very much i didnt before but youre a rather different fellow now than you were when i turned you into an ass i wouldnt do that now that made him laugh which pleased her and if you were to meet me now what sort of animal would you turn me into i wouldnt she replied and turned back to look at him again because you would treat the poor old woman well like julian he nodded yes i would like to think that i would even without knowing all i know about trials and questers now but i would not go offering you every crumb of food i had she had to laugh at that there is such a thing as being too generous she agreed and frankly i like you rather better than your brother hes blissfully happy with his milkandhoney princess who is only too delighted to be ornamental and i prefer the sort of lady who who can drive a flying chariot pulled by dragons he said are you sure she asked archly and she would have said something else except that his lips were in the way it was different from the kisses in the dreams and even from the wildly passionate kiss in the kitchen it was a slow deliberate kiss not exactly gentle but not torrid either he cupped one hand along her cheek the fingers just touching her hair and his lips moved against hers she closed her eyes and moved closer to him until they were no more than a few inches apart her heart began to beat a little faster and she felt a warm glow on her cheeks he parted his lips a little and insinuated just the tip of his tongue between them she opened her mouth beneath his then gently nibbled his lower lip he moved his hand behind her neck playing with her hair then drawing her closer until there was no space at all between them she let herself sink into the bearskin so that she could put both her arms around him she was acutely aware of every nerve every bit of skin and when his hand began to slip from her neck down to her shoulder she felt his fingers leaving trails of exquisite sensation where they passed places that ached to feel the touch of his fingers again he traced the line of her collarbone pausing in the little hollow of her throat for a moment then drew his fingers down into the cleft between her breasts while her breath quickened and she felt a flush spreading from the point where they rested his hand slipped inside her chemise and she was wildly glad that today she was in her simplest garb with no corseting to get in the way then his fingers touched the nipple of her breast and she thought she was going to explode with pleasure her hands tightened in the fabric of his shirt and she gasped at the sensation which was so much more intense than it had been in her dreams that there was no comparison his fingers toyed gently with it and each tiny movement seemed to send a shock straight to her secret parts her womb tightened and yet the feeling made her legs move apart as if of their own will he took his hand away and she groaned with frustration and opened her eyes only to see and feel that he had removed it just to unlace her bodice evidently hed had plenty of practice because he did it faster than she could he slid the chemise down off her shoulders freeing her breasts then as in the dream he licked and nibbled his way down from her neck until his mouth touched the place where his fingers had lately been playing and she uttered an involuntary cry of pleasure every tiny movement sent a shudder through her and a tidal wave of urgent desire until she thought she could not bear it any longer and then he stopped her eyes flew open and she glared at him he had the most peculiar expression on his face that she had ever seen a mixture of tenderness something she was sure was pure lust and a touch of surprise elena he said i bear with me a moment ive just had the most extraordinary flash of memory she licked her lips and nodded though she wished that he would stop talking and go back to doing what he had been its the custom among my people for young men of my rank to be ah initiated by ladies of experience he blushed theres a slightly crude saying in kohlstania two virgins in a bed is one virgin too many fine so he wasnt a virgin as if she hadnt figured that out a long time ago and ive just recalled a certain set of instructions that lady gave me regarding this situation so im going to do something you might find rather peculiar but its for a reason she had no time to ask what on earth he meant for he went right back to where hed left off and it wasnt until hed stolen up her skirt and suddenly his head was good heavens what was he doing between her legs she might have tried to push him away except that she couldnt because all she could do was melt away as his clever tongue probed all those parts of her that had been longing aching for something and she hadnt known what it was she had never felt anything like the excitement the pleasure and she moaned wanting more and then the world exploded her entire body spasmed and she cried out something between a gasp and a scream when it was over she lay there panting and spent and opened her eyes again to see him grinning like a boy who has just stolen an entire cake what exactly did that lady tell you she managed to get out he resumed the place beside her that he had temporarily abandoned she said someday you will find yourself with another lady an untried lady whether your new bride or your new lover and she will be a lady you wish to make as pleased with her first experience as you were with yours now that is not possible in the conventional sense but i will teach you the unconventional so that she will know truly and completely that there is very great pleasure waiting for her once the pain that is sadly inevitable for an untried lady is over oh she thought about that for a very long moment plenty of kitchentales about first times flashed through her mind the maids had seemed to take as much glee over telling them as they did over tales of childbirth that went on for days so now she knew what she could expect once the whole painful business of deflowering was done with furthermore she had no doubt hed do this again until they were good enough at the other to make it equally pleasurable for both of them is there any way i could thank her she asked at last he chuckled perhaps someday oh and she also said the only woman who will thank you for spoiling her gown is the one you are buying a better gown for so since im not in a position to buy you a better gown he tugged at her skirt and raised his eyebrow suggestively ha turnabout is fair and youve got less skin showing than i do she said a spirit of mischief rising in her as she grabbed for his sleeve and pulled it became a roughandtumble game for a little while as clothing got pulled off piecemeal a stocking there a shirt here a game that got more heated when she tried some of what she recalled from her dreams and some of what shed watched covertly when kitchenmaids trysted with stableboys and parlormaids with footmen it actually ended in his bed where he picked her up and tossed her surprising her with his strength and by the time they both fell asleep in a tangle of limbs and blankets she was almost embarrassingly grateful to that unknown lady with her uncommonly good advice chapter blessed saints coughed alexander reaching for the second cup elena handed him im not sure that is worth being able to understand animals its a traditional power of champions rose pointed out as he drank down the entire hot cup of tea to wash away the taste of dragons blood it had taken elena the better part of a month to find a dragon to trade a bit of blood for one of the jewelstudded trinkets out of the huntinglodge a dragon could always find food but elvenmade treasure for its hoard was worth shedding a little blood over apparently bosh im sure youre only getting revenge on me for eating that pie you were saving alexander coughed holding out his mug for a refill but if you will leave a pie in the middle of the kitchen table and then announce that dinner has been put back an hour because the goose was bigger than you thought whats a man to do robin only smiled and handed over a plate full of sausages and eggs to further take away the taste there is only one thing that i am truly sorry for alexander said after polishing off his first helping ive deprived you of unicorns elena burst into peals of laughter lily giggled hob and robin chortled and even rose unbent enough to chuckle a little dont be elena told him as he glanced from one to another of them looking utterly bewildered its a little like being deprived of fawning brainless lapdogs or a surfeit of turkish delight one is sweet two are amusing but after youve been inundated by them a while you start to think uncharitably of deep ponds and burlap bags and no matter how many beds of lilies and roses you put out for them they will eat my new peas lily added in such an aggrieved tone of voice that they all laughed again elena was definitely of two minds about her new situation on the one hand she had never been so contented not that she and alexander were of one accord on all matters that would have been ridiculous and besides she would have immediately suspected that the tradition was about to unleash something awful on the two of them they were lovers they were still friends life was full of wonderful things rose was still clearly harboring some reservations but the other three were as delighted with the new state of things as elena herself was even randolf approved alexander had overnight gotten the trick of projecting magical power into his weapons and now needed only to perfect that skill and hone his fighting abilities to be ready for whatever challenge was put in his path as a champion but on the other hand she kept waiting for the consequences of her action to occur no godmother so far as she had been able to tell in all of the chronicles had ever broken the tradition as thoroughly as she had when it came to this oh there had been champions in the households of godmothers before this but they had all been true fairy godmothers of the great fae and so had their champions been the chronicles were very sketchy concerning those godmothers which was hardly surprising since the fae did not particularly care to be written about nowhere had she found any reference to a godmother with a lovermuch less a princely lover it did seem terribly unfair though wizards got to take lovers so why not godmothers madame bella got along perfectly well without unicorns robin said gesturing emphatically with his fork there are plenty of other sources of magic and elena is very careful about how she uses the power she has shes that saving indeed she is said rose bestowing an unusually benevolent gaze on elena she never wasted any bit of magic on indulgences or on show usually by this time a young godmothers been caught a bit short and had to improvise but our madame elena never has touch wood elena said automatically well if youre sure you dont mind alexander said after a moment of silence but id thought you were really fond of them im fond of toffee pudding but that doesnt mean i want to eat it for every meal she pointed out logically yes but if you couldnt ever have it again he persisted oh it isnt that shell never have unicorns about rose told him theyll come if she calls on them magically or if the great fae sends them she just wont be able to touch them he opened his mouth to say something but no one would ever learn what it was because at that moment they all heard the unmistakable sound of something galloping towards the cottage up the hardfrozen road and there were missteps in the sound that told them all that whatever was coming was exhausted and on its last legs but most of all there was the unmistakable yet intangible sensation of a great weight falling on them as the looming wave of magic and tradition collapsed upon them it completely staggered elena hob reacted first running to the kitchen door wrenching it open and hurling himself out into the frozen yard alexander was right behind him as elena burst from the door behind them the rider tumbled off into alexanders arms hob had seized the horses bridle and was doing something something magical elena saw the bluegreen motes of magic power that has been separated from the mass of undifferentiated magic and given a purpose swirling around the beast they were no thicker than dust in a sunbeam but whatever hob was doing gave the horse enough strength to stumble towards the stable the magic motes sank into the beast rapidly as hobs spell took effect she clasped her arms around herself shivering as she hurried to alexanders side the cold hammered at her but she ignored it as best she could for the man alexander was supporting was trying to gasp out something prince julian captive he croaked hoarsely the princess locked in the east tower trolls everywhere and his eyes rolled up in his head as he collapsed without a word alexander hefted the man over his shoulders and hauled him bodily into the kitchen where rose and lily took the stranger from him he turned on his heel without a word his face grim and pale and would have run straight out again had elena not caught him by the shoulders and forced him to stop what happened she asked urgently what happened to your brother he stared at her wildly julian blessed saints elena julian some wicked magician has taken fleurberg king stancia is dead princess kylia is imprisoned and my brother my brother julian she shook his shoulders alexander calm down make sense what happened you have to tell me so i can help you it took a few minutes and they had to go back into the cottage where rose and lily had revived the messenger but eventually they learned the truth a stranger had come striding into king stancias great hall when the entire court was at dinner he had not come alone he had been accompanied by an escort of heavily baroquely armored men and monsters the messenger called them trolls but they didnt correspond to any description of a troll that elena knew he had not gotten past the guards on the walls nor the walls themselves he had simply appeared in the grounds his creatures had swarmed the few guards that they encountered within the palace to clear his path to the great hall he had announced nothing no challenge no gloating not a word he had simply unleashed his escort and his magics the messenger had been one of the few able to flee the room he hadnt seen much but what he had seen was terrible he was no knight only a young squire and fortunately he was wise enough to know what he could not do he had hidden himself and waited within the hour most of stancias court had been slaughtered stancia was dead julian had been thrown into the dungeons and kylia imprisoned in her own tower the only reason that julian himself was not dead was that he had come in late to dinner had joined with stancias guards in trying to repel the invader and had been thrown unconscious and injured into the dungeon with the rest of the survivors the messenger had crept out of hiding to one of the dungeon windows where julian had told him what had happened himself he probably had not been recognized for who he was but that could not last for long get help julian had urged go to the glass mountain and if you cannot find the sorcerer go to my brother the messenger had stolen a horse and fled to the sorcerer who had created the glass mountain only to discover that he too was dead the messenger had returned to discover that the city had been sealed off and stancias army was milling about outside the walls leaderless the messenger had gotten another horse having ridden the first to foundering go to my brother julian had probably meant his brother octavian or had he alexander was the one that had always been kindest to him alexander was the one who had been trained at the academy in warfare here was the thing about the tradition it often found ways of making something happen that were completely without logic so if julian had been thinking about alexander when he had said go to my brother then the tradition putting that together with the fact that alexander was now a champion very likely arranged the rest how had he gotten here how had he found his way to this remote place the messenger could not remember elena had a guess though she could not be sure the sorcerer might have left a spell like the all forests are one spell that survived his own demise he might have set something of the sort in the hope that he could escape only to die before he could reach safety certainly the sorcerer knew that prince julians brother was here and this would be the first place to seek help for king stancia perhaps that had been the last spell he had cast with his dying breath to bring whatever messenger sent for help by stancia directly here or perhaps given a very wellworn traditional path of sending to a champion for aid the tradition itself had bent distance and magic and made it all happen such a thing was not unknown that didnt matter now and it was neither the time nor the place to discuss such things the messenger was of no more use for he was unconscious now and rose was not sanguine about his being in any shape to respond any time soon and time was most definitely of the essence if ever the evil mage could be dislodged it had to be now now before he discovered that he already had prince julian in his grasp before he replenished all of the magical energy he had used in taking the palace and before he cemented his hold on the kingdom of fleurberg you cant just elena began but alexander interrupted her i know he replied his voice hard and his expression rigid i studied military strategy i cannot merely go haring off wildly champion or no champion if i charge straight at that evil mage i have no chance at all elena sighed with relief even while she throttled down a weight of guilt that felt as heavy as the weight of magic that had washed over them all we need a threepronged plan she said instantly first ill send a message to arachnia and every other godmother wizard and sorcerer i know yes and my friend the giant and that dragon i traded for his blood and even the unicorn herd second i will send a message to your father if ever there was an act that would redeem him in julians eyes it would be by sending an army to his rescue and lastly now while two people actually have a chance to accomplish something we will go go he asked baffled it would take days to get there less than that first i need to contact arachnia and someone else more than anything else we need something that can fly no more than two hours later that something arrived elena had contacted every magician that she could sending out every one of the white ravens with messages that would not arrive until at the best nightfall she had sent frantic messages via her own chronicles as well but had no guarantee that anyone would read the things any time soon more than ever she cursed the fact that there was no good fast way of sending messages from magician to magician the best one could manage was the better part of a day and often it was far longer than that but by noon she had the transportation she needed it came galloping down out of the sky and drew attention to itself by drumming excitedly on the rooftop before coming to land in the courtyard at the sound of hooves on the roof alexander had started up eyes flashing wildly but elena had known exactly what it was and ran out again into the stableyard where her help was waiting for her sergei she cried with joy and flung her arms around the neck of the little humpbacked horse this is dreadful godmother the horse said somberly in her ear the sorcerer who has taken fleurberg is one out of my countries i do not know what he is doing here invading your traditions elena did not say what she was thinking but she had been fighting terrible and despair guilt from the moment that she had heard of this disaster and sergeis words only seemed to confirm her worst fears that this was happening because of her she had broken the tradition by taking a lover and now a black mage from another set of traditional paths had taken advantage of the weakness she did not say it not because she did not want to acknowledge her own guilt but because doing so would serve no purpose would weaken alexanders spirit and resolve and would only waste time time that was already precious what can we expect sergei she asked pulling away from him and stifling the wish to simply hug his neck and wail i think it is a katschei said sergei in reply while alexander stared at them both bemusedly which will mean that his heart is not in his body so you can only kill him by finding his heart he is in a new land so he probably has not yet done anything other than encase it in a diamond and place it somewhere he considers safe which is usually somewhere near him i would guess that it is in the throne room under the throne if one of you can penetrate the throne room and find the heart and return it to where it belongs you can kill him if you can break the diamond and smash the heart you can kill him of course he added thoughtfully youll have to get past his army of creatures first ill alexander began then stopped at the look on elenas face tell me he demanded instead whoever defeats the katschei and rescues the princess cant be you she said slowly because the tradition is very strong in fleurberg and princess kylia is going to fall in love with the man who rescues her alexander looked at her for a moment then licked his lips then what use am i but before she could answer his face lit up wait if i gather the remains of the army and attack the city and the palace the evil mage will be distracted and i can go in and try and find his heart said elena but i will need more than a distraction and someone needs to occupy the mage in a way that will keep all of his attention elsewhere she took a deep breath and wondered if she could keep her face from showing her pain champion he straightened and his entire demeanor changed he seemed taller and larger somehow champion she said knowing that this was the right thing the only right thing for him as well as for fleurberg but feeling her heart whimpering in pain all the same champion you must challenge this evil mage yourself ah he took it as she had expected him to willingly even eagerly and you meanwhile will rescue kylia free julian and find the heart probably not quite in that order but i think that i have a plan to do that she agreed sergei can take both of us sergei can take you godmother the little horse interrupted mother and i suspected you were going to do something like this and i brought one of my brothers he tossed his head up and whinnied shrilly he was answered by a deeper whinny from up above there was a clatter of hooves on the roof again and a second horse leaped down onto the yard landing as lightly as a swan on the water it was a coalblack stallion as handsome as the humpback horse was homely his mane and tail swept the ground rippling like waterfalls of silk and his coat gleamed like the finest satin and he was both incredibly graceful and massively muscled his beautifully formed head turned towards alexander and the prince stepped forward entranced dont expect the kind of intelligence and cleverness that i have out of him but hes loyal as a hound brave as a lion strong as a bull and he can fly just as i can mother says that every champion needs a proper mount said sergei eyes glinting with satisfaction so from this moment on nightsong is yours from somewhere hob came up with what must have been armor meant for a young elven princeling for elena it fit well enough although her breasts were squashed beneath the breastplate still it was no worse than what the flattening corsets favored in arachnias kingdom of bretagne did to a womans breasts and elena was not going to complain if it kept her alive and further that it made her look like a young man and kept her from being recognized as a godmother they knew from the messengers story where the window into the dungeon was that he had spoken to julian through the princesss tower had a balcony that sergei could land on so there was just one more thing that needed to be arranged it would take a lot of magic she hoped that there was enough still here that it would not seriously deplete her own resources hobs magical game bag could actually hold just about anything put into it the katscheis creatures were probably things that could only be harmed by magical weapons sergei was not sure on that point but he agreed that it was likely so the houseelves and alexander stripped every room in the cottage and lodge of anything that was remotely weaponlike right down to the knives and cleavers in the kitchen elena enchanted every one of them with just a touch of magic enough that they could actually hit a magical creature then they were stuffed into the game bag when she was done she had exhausted all of the ambient power that had dropped down around them when the tradition closed its jaws on them and every bit of power that the brownies could spare she hoped that what she had left was going to be enough but she knew that she was going to have to be very very clever with every bit of power left to her by sunset they were as ready as they were ever going to be alexander was dancing with impatience wanting to be off elena felt as if her heart was so heavy that sergei would never be able to fly under the weight of it but they had no choice neither of them with a last longing look at the cottage elena clambered into sergeis saddle ungracefully for she still had never learned to ride as alexander vaulted lightly into his seat on nightsongs back and accepted his lance from hob he looked every inch the champion as bold and brave as a legend and eager to be off she closed the visor on her helm his was already down and she was glad of it for it would have been much worse if she had been able to see his face with that weight of guilt on her it was bad enough knowing that with the weight of tradition along with his own eagerness alexanders mind heart and soul that of a champion and if he thought of anything else it was fleetingly ready he asked his voice echoing hollowly out of the depths of the helm she nodded sergei gathered himself beneath her she clung to the pommel of the saddle with both hands and the two sons of the east wind rose on their hind feet and leaped into the bloodred sky it was near midnight when they landed amid the dispirited mob that was what was left of stancias army alexander had made a proper show of it too for had anyone been alert or brave enough it all might have ended then and there but calling down from above loyal sons of fleurberg we have come to aid you and having elena illuminate him as he landed meant he had no chance of being mistaken for some warrior of the katcheis now he stood on a rock ringed by torches as the tired old soldiers surrounded him looking at him with expressions in which fear warred with hope so far alexander had said nothing to them other than to send out word to gather together and elena had kept her mouth shut this was not a godmothers business it was the business of a champion here it was alexander who was the master of the moment finally when no more men were coming in from the darkness alexander drew himself to his full height hear me men of king julian the voice that rang through the night sounded like alexanders ordinary speaking voice but stronger deeper and certainly a great deal louder below him the men started and gasped as alexanders words told them what they had feared that stancia was dead alexander would not have named julian king otherwise hear me men of king julian alexander repeated your old king is no more a foul usurper has attempted to seize the throne king stancia fought nobly and died as a warrior his sword in his hand now that was a complete fabrication as elena well knew but it was the sort of thing that a soldier wanted to hear no soldier wants to be told that his king was cut down before he could rise from his dinner that he was slain as he tried to push away from the table by magic against which he had no defense they wanted to hear that their beloved monarch was a fighter to the end someone they could emulate and whose memory they could honor but julian lives and your duty is now to him hear me warriors i am alexander brother of your king and have come to help you you must hold until our allies arrive you must fight to enter the palace and destroy the evil usurper how bleated one grizzled old man demandingly interrupting alexanders stirring speech how when spears and arrows just bounce off em and swords and spears wont bite but alexander simply gave the man a pitying look with the weapons my squire will give you alexander countered not missing a beat weapons enchanted by the hand of the fairy godmother elena to strike to the heart of these monsters and give you strength beyond your own thats a bit much she thought though she was secretly pleased at being accorded such great power by alexander but well it isnt going to hurt i suppose to have them think that theyre being given magical strength even if they arent if they think they are who knows it might actually happen taking that for her cue elena opened the game bag and began passing out whatever came to hand there was a moment of reluctance but then she was engulfed by men who were desperate to have something anything that would serve them against these creatures that some were already calling demons rather than trolls they were neither but that didnt matter either there were still weapons in the bag when the last of stancias men the survivors of what had been a rather pathetic little army in the first place had each claimed a weapon alexander began his rallying speech at that point and elena stared up at the castle it was not a big castle and fortunately it was not surrounded by a moat but the walls were stout and there were an awful lot of torches and forms moving up there a frontal assault to occupy him and keep him from spreading out to conquer the city and the kingdom alexander was saying when she turned her attention back to him do not spend yourselves needlessly it is a holding action that we need help is coming from kohlstania my father would never permit his son to languish a prisoner more help is coming in the form of magical allies brought to our aid by the godmothers themselves your father would never permit an evil magician to set up shop in the neighboring kingdom you mean she thought with some irony this was in fact king henricks worst nightmare come to pass the very thing he had hoped to prevent by sending all three of his sons to the glass mountain and i only hope that the other godmothers do respond and what are you doing while were doing this asked that same troublemaker dubiously alexander drew himself up and yes there was no doubt of it his armor began glowing as he took on the full aspect of a champion i he said with great dignity will be fighting the evil mage in challenge combat alone all right alexander said urgently to her as the little army organized itself around its few surviving officers and prepared to make that frontal assault on the gate time for you to go find julian get him out and send him around to the front as soon as you hear the fighting start then go to the aid of the princess when you hear the trumpet sound for my challenge she nodded a great lump arising in her throat rendering her speechless he was going through with this and unless she could find the evil magicians heart he could be killed and elena he paused and his voice lost that quality of champion so that it sounded like nothing more than alexander i want to know i have to know what she asked thickly expecting some dreadful question about her own guilt in this mess but she would answer him truthfully if he asked she owed him nothing less than the truth will you consent to marry me she felt as if something had slapped her across the helm so that her head was ringing she heard her own voice say joyfully yes before her head had formulated an answer good thats all i needed to know he grinned at her and closed his helm down over his face before she could say anything else he had lifted her into sergeis saddle and the little horse was off like a shot she sawed at sergeis reins trying to bring him back around but the little horse was having none of it godmother we have a job to do sergei said acidly the bit clamped between his teeth are you going to put all of it to naught she let go the reins but her heart wanted to be back there with him demanding to know just what he had intended with that question except of course he was not actually going to be there by now he was at the forefront of the army on nightsong making himself visible as the attack began before he and nightsong flew over the gate and into the forecourt to challenge the sorcerer the evil one would have to answer the tradition would force him into it never had elena ever heard of a challenge going unanswered sergeis night vision was better than hers was he spotted the dungeon window in the shadows and plunged down towards it like an owl on a mouse stancia had been a good king as had all of his ancestors his dungeons might be stout but they were not lightless nor airless they had heavily barred windows in their walls that were just about at ground level on the outside oh twenty feet above the floor on the inside of course but still windows it would take magic and cunning to use them for an escape but magic and cunning elena had she hoped in abundance at just that moment the attack on the front gate began there was a roar and the sound of weapons and a batteringram hitting the front gate virtually every torch on the walls skittered in that direction and there was more than enough noise to cover anything that elena was about to do elena slid from sergeis back and ran from dungeon window to window whispering urgently until she found the one letting into the great room where stancias guards remaining nobles and julian were imprisoned they were thank heavens sensible they did not shout at her whisper and in fact she was able to talk to julian himself who are you he called up the old woman in the forest she whispered back i gave you the gift to speak with animals i advised you not to be so generous in the matter of your food sir if youll recall only that woman knew this he replied sounding out of breath i believe you lady have you come to succor us i have are you hurt a bad slash to my shieldarm but i am alive and afire to get out came the whisper up out of the darkness that was all she needed to know time for a little more magic give me but a moment majesty and you will be leading your men again she hitched sergei to the bars of the grate took out her wand and ran a trickle of magic along the perimeter chanting under her breath giving the magic form and purpose time erodes all that is made weakens iron and crumbles stone undermines all that is laid time is lord and time alone this spell should have the effect of accelerating the hand of time there and weakening both the bolts and the cement pull she whispered to the little horse who threw himself against the ropes nothing she ran another trickle around repeating her incantation sergei pulled again and this time the entire grate came free with a groan it would have landed with a clatter but she caught it before it fell and lowered it to the ground she stole a quick glance up at the walls but so no sign of movement no one had seen them yet perhaps with luck there was no one there to watch she put her wand away took the coil of knotted rope from sergeis saddle and tied it to the grate that had just been pulled free she tossed it down through the empty windowframe climb up she cried and the rope tightened at once with the little horse bracing against the weight of the men clambering up the rope the first two leastinjured came popping out of the window these two first pulled up anyone who was too injured to climb unaided julian was the first or added their weight and strength to sergeis when all of them were out she cut sergei free and distributed her remaining magical weapons she didnt have to tell them what to do for the noise of the fighting drew them as soon as they got weapons in their hands she caught at julian before he could lead them into the fray your brother alexander has rallied the army she began julian groaned those poor old men i never mind that theyre just a distraction but they will still fight better with their king beside them she interrupted more help is on the way from kohlstania and other places if a giant appears dont attack him hes on your side and there may be other beasts coming who will tell you they come from me they may get here before dawn in fact princess kylia now julian looked about wildly kylia she didnt escape i majesty she gave him a hard shake leave that to me ill send her to you i swear but i cant get to her if you dont keep up the distraction of the attack and she shook her head wondering how to tell him of everything planned without confusing it more when he suddenly calmed and gathered himself together never mind he said alex is in command he went to the academy whatever he planned will be the best that can be done she slapped him on the back he staggered a little for she had forgotten her armor can you fight maybe not but i make a damned good figurehead he replied with a grim smile good luck lady send my wife safe to me good luck majesty she scrambled onto sergeis back as the king led his men towards the thick of the fighting in a moment the darkness had swallowed them a moment later she and sergei were in the air she was supposed to wait until alexander made his singlecombat challenge but she felt as if she was better off not waiting for one thing the longer the attack went on the more likely it was that extra guards would be sent to watch the princess for another for another she wanted to get her hands on that evil magicians heart alexanders life would depend on it there were no safeguards none on the princesss tower there probably had been something winged up there to keep watch but all the noise and the fighting must have been irresistible to them that was one of the odd things about most magical creatures like nightsong like the unicorns the vast majority of them were not all that bright it almost seemed as if a creature born of magic could have magical abilities and be beautiful or strong or intelligent but only two of the four sergei and his brother were excellent examples of that that was the reason why the wise magician did not entrust the safekeeping of anything he was concerned about to a magical creature unless it was an extraordinary one elena and sergei landed on the balcony without incident had sergei been the size of his brother nightsong they couldnt have done it but the balcony was just large enough for something ponysized she slid off and pushed open the balcony door clang she staggered back reeling from the blow to her head which fortunately had been mostly absorbed by her helm but still her ears were ringing and for a moment she had seen stars hey she shouted indignantly fending off the angry poker wielding young woman who advanced on her what do you think youre at wench julian sent me im here to rescue you what the poker dropped from the young womans hands and clattered to the stone floor as she stared at elena in shock you once again elena felt the weight of the tradition collapsing around her and even as she seized on the opportunity to replenish her magical stores she was pulling off her helm the tradition had its own path for those who rescued ladies in durance vile and princess now queen kylia had spread her arms wide to embrace her rescuer automatically impelled by the tradition and in a moment kylia was going to find herself a different sort of prisoner manipulated and pushed into falling in love or at least into something that felt just like love and she might possibly recall that once she had felt exactly the same thing for her husband but at that point it would already be too late yes elena said shaking her hair loose firing the words out as quickly as she could to warp the tradition back to the path she wanted im godmother elena your husband julian sent me hes leading a frontal assault on the gate as a distraction in order to set you free to join him kylia stopped dead in her tracks as stunned for the moment as elena would have been if that poker had connected with her skull instead of her helm oh she said in a small uncertain voice a woman julian sent me elena said firmly i am a fairy godmother come at his call for aid hes singlehandedly leading an heroic assault on the front gate to act as a distraction so you can escape this was of course a lie that didnt matter what mattered was to deflect the tradition from the course it was on with certain key words it wasnt quite a spell as such but it had all the force of a spell kylia and through her the tradition heard julian singlehandedly heroic so you can escape the force impelling kylia into falling in love with her rescuer which had been the source of no end of tragedy in the past was deflected by the clear impropriety of kylia falling in love with a woman and by the apparent sacrifice that julian was making of himself given those key words she was impelled right back into the love of her husband this was the problem with traditioncreated love it was manufactured in time it would solidify into the real thing far more often than not but in the first year or two of marriage the bond was fragile easily broken and easily reformed onto another object of affection the tradition created tragedy as well as happy endings the tradition did not care if a story ended happily or in sorrow so long as the tale was powerful enough for every sleeping princess there was a fair rosalinda for every mark and yseult the tradition was perfectly prepared to create a trystan not in my kingdoms julian kylia breathed hes out there you say he is and waiting for you elena took the opportunity to shove her out the door of the balcony before she had a chance to object and before she had a chance to react to the presence of a horse on the balcony elena had lifted her into sergeis saddle just in case she tied off the poor childs belt to the saddle kylia grabbed the pommel reflexively off she shouted darting back inside good luck sergei shouted back and leaped from the balcony with kylia suddenly coming to her senses and shrieking in fear at finding herself several hundred feet above the ground and plummeting towards it like a stone but that was not elenas problem that was sergeis with luck if any of the winged things were attracted back to their guardpost by kylias shrieks sergei would already be on the ground by that time kylia would be silent or even fainted poor thing and they would find the balcony door open and the balcony vacant and assume that rather than become the bride of their master she had flung herself from the tower and being no fools if not very bright and as were the minions of most evil creatures believing firmly in the principle of looking out for themselves first if they were not magically bound they would swiftly bugger off before their master found out what had happened rather than go looking for a body she dashed for the door to the room if winged guardians did come back she wanted to be sure that she herself was not here the door to this level wasnt locked and she darted into the staircase closing and locking the door behind her creating one more reason to believe that kylia had plunged to her death it occurred to her as she began working her way down through the levels of the tower that kylia might not be quite the milkandhoney princess that elena had thought her she had after all armed herself with that poker yes and she had been perfectly ready to attack anything coming in the balcony door with it well good good for her that boded well for julian too get your mind back on what youre doing she scolded herself the most difficult task is yet to come and she worked her way down through the empty tower levels until at last she found a door that was locked she paused her ear pressed to the keyhole listening with all of her attention was there a guard out there was there some other sort of creature she couldnt hear anything nor could she sense any sort of magic all she could hear were the distant echoes of the fighting either alexander had not yet challenged the sorcerer or he had but the fighting at the gate was continuing anyway that might change at any moment it was time to take yet another chance and hope that luck was with them all chapter elena knelt beside the door touched her wand to it and teased another fragment of magic into the doorlock open locks whoever knocks she whispered to it and tapped gently on the wood of the door beside the lock with a click the lock tripped and she pushed the door open gently she peered around the door to see that she was in a hallway there should have been lamps illuminating the whole area but this hall showed signs of a struggle only about half of the lamps were lit the rest lay on the floor broken and the little tables that had once held vases or statues were overturned their burdens shattered evidently kylia had not gone to her imprisonment quietly once again elena found the princess rising in her estimation so she fought did she well done to her at least the hallway was clear if i were the throne room where would i be she wondered or did she in fact actually want the throne room sergei had guessed that this was where the sorcerers heart would be but he had not actually known so who or what would well there was dark magic everywhere the sort that only evil mages could use without being tainted for it carried the overburden of death or of being wrenched away from someone who was afraid and unwilling that was the bad part she couldnt use it it hung in the air in clouds dark and glowing with a sullen red as if the place was on fire the good part was that with so much magic hanging about a little more wouldnt be noticed so she eased out a tiny trace a thread of the stuff spun it out from her wand and concentrated on it clever cunning silent wary come to me and do not tarry anyone whos wise knows that nothing will escape a cats eyes the thread of magic formed into a tiny sphere and shot off at floorlevel she closed the door most of the way sat back on her heels and waited she did not have to wait long fortunately for her patience within a few minutes a long slender black shape oozed through the crack she had left open and stood looking expectantly up at her godmother she said elena was not surprised that the cat identified her immediately cats even the commonest barn and kitchen cats had an affinity for magic daughter of bast she replied with a little bow cats liked to be reminded that they had once been worshiped they pretended that they didnt that they were above flattery but of course that only meant that they were all the more susceptible to it i am looking for something it will be strange it is very precious to the bad pack leader of the bad pack that has taken over this castle and he will have hidden it she used the word pack leader not because cats had a hierarchy anything like a pack but because they very well understood how dogs operated and tended to think of humans and other twolegged creatures in those terms strange the cat pondered this there is hard shiny noscent stuff but it is precious to all of them and like the hard shiny stuff that was here already will it be and here the cat used a word that didnt translate into human terms this was because it was the complicated multilayered feline term incorporating scent sound sight magicsight and a sense that only cats seemed to have that somehow involved magic at a level completely alien to humans it meant something that is physical but is also extremely magical with a modifier specifying bad magic yes it will elena whispered grateful beyond measure that she had somehow managed to attract one of the castle matriarchs and not a kitchencat a kitten or a pampered ladys cat hmm the size of a sixweek kitten hard shiny stuff on the outside but alive inside the cat persisted now that could only be the heart as sergei had described it hell probably encase it in diamond or something and put the diamond in a box and youll have to figure out how to get it out thats it exactly wisest of the wise she exclaimed can you take me to it can you walkthroughwalls the cat asked now elena had never been entirely certain what that meant cats used the term all the time sometimes it seemed to mean only that the cat could ooze through small cracks and holes that seemed too small for it sometimes it seemed to mean merely that it could find a way wherever it wanted to go but sometimes it seemed to mean just that literally as if there were cats who could indeed walk through walls mind knowing cats she didnt entirely doubt it though that didnt help her at the moment no she said with regret i am not so clever clever in feline meant a number of things that included being powerful intelligent cunning and very very magical can you walk unseen the cat persisted we must pass many dogs of the bad pack they are roused by the good pack at the gate and the two pack leaders fighting but there are still some along the way who are not distracted elena felt her throat tighten so alexander was in combat she had to move and move quickly for he could not battle so powerful a magician for very long i can she said electing to spend a great deal of her magic to make herself invisible she hadnt planned on doing so it would leave her very little to work with but now it was a matter of time and they had none to waste do the cat said and sat on her haunches expectantly elena gathered the magic and smoothed it over herself with her wand like a second skin then holding it in place she concentrated with all of her will and gave it the direction she wanted it to take fool all eyes that look on me fool each mind that wants to see make me clear as purest air im the one who isnt there she had never done this before although she had read about it and it was most unnerving to watch herself for she just faded away growing more and more transparent until there was nothing where she was at all shed taken pains to form the spell so that it not only worked on the eyes but on the mind so that even if one of the sorcerers creatures could ordinarily see things that were invisible such as spirits it still would not see her unless it worked a counterspell because its mind would refuse to acknowledge that she was there the cats mouth opened in a feline grin well done godmother i see you not come that was proof enough that the spell was properly set for cats as everyone knew were perfectly capable of seeing spirits the cat oozed around the door again and elena pulled off her boots and followed the hallway was quite short and probably represented the point where the tower connected to the castle itself it led straight into a larger room much much larger that could only have been stancias great hall where everyone had been at dinner when the sorcerer came the bodies had been taken away but the tables and benches were pretty much still where theyd been when the fight was over crockery shards and broken wooden trenchers were scattered everywhere there were sticky pools of what might have been blood and what might have been drink mostly dried now there was no sign of anything edible some of the tables and benches were broken or hacked up the tapestries had been torn off the walls and shredded or were lying in heaps against the walls there was a foul stench in the air that made both elena and the cat wrinkle their noses in distaste the foul aroma probably came from the creatures still here elena could not put a name to what they were they were outside her expertise and now she could understand why stancias men were calling them demons the things that they looked most like were spiders except that they had a hard armoring skin and only four legs all four had nasty cutting pincers on them though and they had a manlike torso with two arms each as well with appendages that served as hands they had oval hairless heads with masklike faces and large slanting glittering eyes they were all from the top of the head to the tip of the pincers a shiny black in color there were fifteen of them and they were simply immobile they might have been statues except that elena was perfectly certain that they were watching everything that passed around them no wonder the cat had asked her if she could be invisible they paid no attention to the cat however perhaps they were unconcerned about anything below a certain size the cat wove her way across the hall tail in the air sauntering as if she hadnt a care in the world and elena followed in her wake elena did note however that the path that the cat took was the one that enabled her to keep as far away from each of the things as possible even though that actually meant that she was weaving her way among them rather than going in a straight line well that suited elena she made herself as small as she could and was glad that she had thought to take her boots off first she clutched them to her chest and walked as silently as stockinged feet would permit that cat moved slowly as well perhaps rapid movement would also trigger their interest that suited elena just fine as it made it easy to keep right on the cats heels when she was most of the way across the room with none of those creatures between her and the doorway something back behind her fell there was a tremendous bang and clatter she froze the change in the monsters was instantaneous they came alive they rose up on the tips of their feet they all turned as swiftly as thought and then moved they swarmed on some spot near the other door presumably where the noise came from they moved like nothing elena had ever seen before with a clattering sound and the ticking of claws on stone the sight was terrifying and elena only gave one horrified glance behind her before turning tail and following the cat into the safety of the doorway the cat said nothing but her tail was a bottlebrush and her back humped as she scuttled on she led elena through a succession of three rooms all of which had been richly appointed and all of which had been ransacked and not yet cleaned there were more dried dark stains here as well and there was no mistaking that rusty color for anything but blood then came the fourth room elena stopped and blinked for a moment eyes dazzled it was difficult to say what purpose this room might have served king stancia it had no windows but all the light came from magnificent sconces that had probably held huge fat candles but which now supported weirdly glowing balls of green light but what dazzled her was that around the walls heaped up as if they stood in a dragons hoard was treasure there was far far more of it than there could possibly have been in stancias treasury the heaps were as high as elenas chest and there was no order to any of it except that the heaviest and most massive items were on the bottom avalanches of coins loose jewels and jewelry cups plates platters and bowls boxes and bags bales of clothofgold and clothofsilver candlesticks incensecensors breastplates swords daggers lamps bottles if it could be made of gold or silver it was probably in those piles if it could be studded with precious gems it was probably in those piles it reflected the light and dazzled the mind if it was meant to impress it certainly did that but there was no sense or reason to this display it was too chaotic to allow anyone to appreciate it a dragon made a hoard like this to sleep on why would anything human arrange a room like this a room that could only serve to excite greed and distract anyone who came here from the person who was supposed to be the center of attention because in a clear space in the middle of the room was a throne made of solid gold ornamented with twisting shapes that looked like nothing elena recognized and studded with rubies each the size of a pigeons egg the cat was standing to one side of this monstrosity waving her tail impatiently there she mewed under there wait elena said and thought very very hard if i dont appear and the good pack takes back the castle look for a man in a metal skin called alexander hell be able to understand you find him and bring him here all right i do not like this place i am leaving and she did whisking herself out the door leaving elena standing by herself in the doorway no wonder sergei had said to look for the heart in a throne room this was certainly a throne room although not as elena understood the term a throne room was meant to concentrate all attention on the ruler here whoever was sitting in that chair was of minimal importance compared to what was in the room she shook her head maybe sergei could explain it later right now she circled around the throne and came at it from the back somehow not wanting to approach from the front those rubies all felt however irrational that was like sleeping eyes she didnt want them to wake up and notice her the back of the throne was plain unornamented gold beneath the throne was a box she tried to move it it was heavier than it looked she tried again and discovered that she could make it move though with great difficulty carefully she slid it out making as little sound as possible she didnt know if those black spidery things could hear anything from this room but she didnt want to find out that they could the hard way the box was horribly horribly heavy and if the floor of this room hadnt been of very slippery marble she would never have been able to manage it as it was she could only ease it out a little at a time biting her lip with the effort shed been afraid that the box would be locked but it wasnt because the lock had at some time in the past been broken the hasp that held it shut had broken off not a surprise really if someone was foolish enough to make a lock and hasp out of soft gold it should be no great shock to discover it breaks after very little use which made no more sense than this room she opened the lid of the box and there it was embedded in gold that filled the box protected by a steel cage it was a diamond a diamond the size of her head and inside it seen through the glittering facets something the size of her fist something wet and red pulsed rhythmically her heart sank the diamond was embedded in the box the box was too heavy to lift the cage prevented her from smashing the stone and even if she did she wouldnt be able to get at the heart immediately and by then it would be too late alexander would have lost the fight in fact the only reason she knew that he hadnt was that the sorcerer would have made short work of julian and his army and from the faint sounds penetrating the walls of this room the fighting was still going on seconds ticked by as she tried her dagger on the steel cage on the gold and finally broke the tip off trying to shatter the diamond through the cage anyway nothing worked and she became more and more frantic dark magics wove a web around it as impervious as the steel cage preventing anyone from getting at it without shattering the diamond she didnt have enough magic to get the thing out or did she surely the thing was proof against any spell meant simply to remove it from the diamond but the sorcerer had to put it back where it belonged from time to time and he wouldnt want to bother with dispelling and resetting the magic around it carefully feeling as if she was wading through sewage she tried to work her way through the ugly vicious magic used to protect the heart bit by bit she unraveled the closewoven spells with her mind and identified them or at least their purpose since she wasnt trying to dispel or break them the magic left her alone allowed her to worm her mental probe deeper and deeper into the noisome ball until finally she touched and identified the last spell which was not a protective spell just as she had thought she rested for a moment her stomach heaving fighting against throwing up wading through sewage this was more like swimming through it a torrent of sewage and rot and despair and it engulfed more of her the deeper into it she went and she was going to actually have to do more than touch this stuff there was one chance here to save them all one chance it would leave her helpless and if it didnt work the sorcerers minions would find her if that happened if she was lucky theyd kill her and if she wasnt lucky she would spend days weeks or months wishing for death with every breath she took even if it did work the sorcerers minions might still find and kill her before alexander killed the sorcerer all or nothing but if she didnt alexander and everyone else would die the sorcerer could reign unchallenged for generations he would engulf all of the nearby kingdoms her kingdoms and rain death and terror down on the people she had vowed to help and the tradition would help him they had to stop him now or his conquest would not stop at all for some time to come of all of the spells here this one was the simplest it did not need to be able to recognize the person activating it it did not need to be warded for it could only do one thing and that one thing was always always to the sorcerers advantage and had no potential to harm him he thinks it only took a touch of power she gathered up a tiny mote of it inserted her wand into the cage of steel and touched it to the tangled tail of the spell go home she whispered to the heart inside the diamond it vanished and there was only one place where it would be home only one place for it to go she took the last of her power the very last she stole the last of the power remaining from her invisibility spell and she saw herself in all of the reflective surfaces blinking back into place then she took all of her own strength all of her energy everything she had she took a deep breath raised her wand over her head and cast this spell too required no finesse it was simple and crude it did one thing it would engulf the castle and grounds in a single overwhelming shout that would be heard no matter how loud the fighting and as the glittering room blacked out as she felt herself falling over onto the box she too heard it three words in her own voice if shed had the voice of a giant and the lungs of a dragon strike the heart and then she knew nothing more strike the heart it was elenas voice and alexander was so startled that he missed his stroke but so had the mage and alexanders reactions were those of a fighter as the evil mage distracted for that crucial second glanced to the side looking for the source of the shout alexander dropped his own shield seized his swordhilt in both hands ducked under the sorcerers guard and rammed the swordpoint home against the sorcerers breastplate as he did so he willed every particle of magic every bit of his own strength into the blow as the mage flailed at him the sword glowed whitehot there was a moment of resistance then it slammed home the mage froze with a great clap of thunder the evil mage fell he went over like a statue carrying alexanders sword with him and a silence descended like a hammer as everything and everyone just stopped alexander fell to his knees the last of his strength running out of him he remained there panting as a howl shattered the silence as the sound of great wings rose all around him as the gate behind him burst open and as every torch illuminating the courtyard where he and the mage had fought was blown out leaving him in darkness he could not think he could only feel hammered by the pain of his injuries fighting for each breath with sweat running over his face and down his back he was barely aware that there were people swarming around him until two of them seized his biceps and hauled him to his feet pounding his back which he barely felt through his armor that blessed blessed blessedly light and strong armor that had saved his life over and over again in this fight alex alex is that really you in there it was his brother julians voice he tried to get enough breath for an answer the mage had struck him a blow towards the end of it that had knocked him off his feet and left him with at the least a bruised chest but someone was already fumbling with the straps holding his helmet on the straps came undone the helmet came off and he gasped in great glorious breaths of cool clean air and looked bewildered into julians battered face which he could see only because the other person holding him up that same grizzled old man who had raised so many doubts during his rallyingspeech was holding a torch in his free hand and peering at his face as if he did not quite believe what had just happened jules he gasped alex said julian my god man youve saved us you and that weird army of yours army what let me take him friend julian rumbled a deep voice like thunder on the mountains then he was scooped up as a gentle child would scoop up a toy and he was staring into the face of the sheepherding giant champion the giant said slowly and carefully where is the godmother when last we heard she was in the guise of a squire going in through the princesss tower but we cannot find her i dont know he replied gathering his wits about him i aaaaaaaalexanderrrrr it was his name in a long feline wail like a cat calling her kittens aaaaaaaalexanderrrrrr he located where it was coming from the top window of the tower nearest him take me to that window please he shouted to the giant who obligingly stretched out his arm there was a small black shape in the black of the open window a cat aaaaaaaalexanderrrrrr thats me he called to her i am alexander tell the mountain to hold still came the reply hold still he shouted to the giant i think a cat a cat flew out of the darkness to land on his chest and slide off the slick surface of the armor into the palm of the giants hand she spat and cursed at them both for being fools ill put you both down then said the giant hastily and he carefully lowered alexander and the cat back down beside julian by that time alexander had picked up the cat and was cradling her as carefully as his armor would allow her claws slipped and scratched on the metal of his armor and she mewed her irritation until he managed to place her on the stones again at his feet the godmother said if she did not appear to find you the cat said when she had all four feet on solid ground again come now she ran off he ran after her pausing only long enough to snatch a black sword out of the hand of the dead man who had been holding it the cat kept glancing back at him over her shoulder to make sure that he was following there were still knots of fighting men and monsters in the rooms that he passed he and the cat dodged around them they emerged into an enormous room that held more fighting a few of julians men with enchanted boarspears but also three unicorns an armored elf in elaborate armor and a bleeding enraged gryphon all fighting hideous spidermen that glittered blackly as they moved and shed black blood from their wounds the cat rushed past them he followed and stopped dead in the final doorway it wasnt the piles of gold and gems that arrested his attention although that might have under any other circumstances it was the terrifying black spider thing bending over elenas unconscious body he had thought that he had no strength left he had been wrong terrible strength and energy coursed though him as if he had been struck by a bolt of lightning that had energized him instead of killing him the creature was only just starting to turn as he leaped upon it with a scream sword in both hands attacking like a mad dancer a threshingfiend a manmachine of death his first blow sliced the things right arm off his second took the left and the third cut the head cleanly from the body sending it to the top of one of the piles of treasure where it remained eerily staring out into the room with its sightless unblinking black eyes its body fell over sideways as all four legs collapsed beneath it he did not even look he threw his sword aside staggered to elena fell to his knees beside her and saw with a relief so intense that it made him weep that she was still breathing and outwardly unhurt and that was all he knew from that moment until the moment when julian and some of the strange army of magical creatures found him again lying beside her holding her hand in his the cat standing over both of them hissing as if she was guarding her kittens elena tried to keep herself calm as she sat in the hall outside the library of the keep on glass mountain no matter what the convocation of godmothers wizards and sorcerers decided there was one thing they couldnt change she and alexander were married it was the first thing that had happened after the castle had been cleaned up and it might have happened sooner than that except that no priest could be induced to come near while the place reeked of evil magic they cant separate us she told herself no matter how hard they try they cant unmake him a champion and i dont think they can take my magic away from me if im not willing to give it up how much difficulty do you think were in alexander asked her soberly im not sure she replied yet again and smiled wanly at least weve broken the traditional paths so completely that there isnt a scrap of tradition to give them a hint of what to do the doors opened and a servant beckoned them inside they stood up together and followed him into the library there were about a dozen people at the long table in the center of the library and at least one was a genuine fairy godmother elena didnt know any of them which was probably on purpose and if she didnt have any friends here at least she didnt have any known enemies either champion alexander and godmother elena said the fairy godmother in the center have you any idea what you have done um said elena flushing we had a band of six new champions that you deprived of a battle said the fairy godmother ticking the faults off on her fingers you gave three unicorns entirely unsuitable ideas of a new vocation so now well have to pair three of those champions with the unicorns and heaven only knows how well manage to keep those boys virgins you almost intervened as a godmother which is a very very bad precedent to set but thats why i was dressed as alexanders squire elena protested we know dear said one of the old wizards not to worry very wise of you to think of that wiser still that you realized what the tradition would have done and that you could have made a dreadful mess if kylia had fallen in love with alexander it isnt in the tale now youre just the champions female squire who followed him into battle in disguise thats two traditional paths youve combined there the disguised female serving a boob of a man who hasnt figured out his servant is a she and the brave and cunning girl who follows her lover into battle so thats all right youve opened up the traditional warriorwoman path a bit wider now though so the fairy godmother grimaced and shrugged whats to come of that i suppose well have to see but why didnt you wait for a few hours to get the replies to your messages if you had if she had alexander said his jaw set my brother would probably be dead it wouldnt have taken that katschei was it very long to discover he had the prince in his dungeon yes it was a katschei said a sorceress a kind of northernkingdom halfdemon not entirely human he shouldnt have been in your kingdoms at all elena bowed her head and waited for them to tell her that the katscheis presence was her fault but they didnt try this if you will said the fairy godmother grimly despite traditional pressure against anything of his sort coming into our kingdoms he got his foothold by getting an unscrupulous ambermerchant to bring his heart as far south as he could and bury it a hundred years ago then he waited for the ambermerchant and anyone else who might remember what had been done to die of course a hundred years is nothing to his kind elenas head came up and she gaped at the fairy godmother you mean it wasnt my fault she squeaked of course not the old wizard replied what were you worried because youd been breaking traditions good lack girl thats what the best of us always do bend them anyway shape them the way we want them to go fretting because youd gone and married that handsome piece you redeemed asked the sorceress with a lecherous smile well generally godmothers take lovers but if youre going to restrict yourself to just one man that just leaves more choice for the rest of us shariss scolded the fairy godmother as elena blushed and alexander began to grin youre telling tales its all right dearie said a particularly grandmotherly godmother the only thing you did wrong and im not saying its wrong wrong because as your young man said his brother might well have been discovered before we could set up a rescue was to go haring off before you could hear from the rest of us no indeed you mustnt do that anymore and you must promise us that you wont elena and alexander exchanged a look and a nod i think she said carefully that providing the next emergency doesnt involve any of alexanders brothers or father we can promise that the fairy godmother looked up and gave elena a quick wink the wizard chuckled shes learning he said to the air as for alexander there is ample precedent for champions in a godmothers household as consort said the fairy godmother at least in the elven tradition there is i see no reason why that cant be extended although as shariss pointed out i suspect that there are not as many as you might think who will take advantage of it champions tend to have wandering ways you see and they roam over several kingdoms in the course of their careers elenas brow wrinkled but im responsible for several kingdoms she pointed out and youre about to get one more said the wizard theres no one to take fleurberg poor old hessian never took an apprentice and he wasnt strictly a wizard anyway he was a sorcerer who liked to meddle so fleurbergs yours and i expect this young man is going to have his hands full for a while the katscheis minions mostly fled hes going to have to track them down and dispose of them as they pop up and its possible that having heard of a way out of an area other evil things may try to follow the katscheis example so hell have to look sharp for that he shrugged wed better get together before we leave and put a portal to your cottage in the back of an old wardrobe or something what do you want to do about glass mountain why dont you bring those six young champions here and set them up as a sort of order asked alexander unexpectedly that way they have a place to come and go from youll have them here to clean up the katscheis monsters and theyll be able to come directly to elena if they need magical help hmm you didnt do so badly did you dear shariss asked elena with an upraised eyebrow beauty brawn and brains alexander blushed and elena flushed done said the fairy godmother an order of champions is a fine new tradition to start very useful indeed i can see that you are going to be a valuable addition to the ranks champion alexander she turned to elena as for you are you certain you wish to continue to be a godmother you certainly qualify as a sorceress if you choose it seems a waste of your time for you to be puttering about with small problems and making potions and amulets she shook her head vehemently no i would much rather take care of things while they are small problems please and i really dont mind making potions and amulets for farmers and shepherds its only the ones that live in my village that come to me for such things anyway true enough there are witches in plenty in your other kingdoms well dear there are those of us who would rather hide away on the mountaintop until terrible situations require resolving and those of us who prefer to have people about us and nip smaller emergencies in the bud she smiled and truth to tell i wouldnt be living among you mortals if i wasnt the latter nor me said the old wizard cheerfully theres room for all sorts thank heavens now i hate to put you two to work immediately but youll have to for a bit you alexander i need you to go help your brothers sort out what to do with that little army that your brother octavian brought and help julian out with his reconciliation letter to your father from all reports he keeps weeping over it and tearing it up hes a good boy but a bit sentimental the wizard and alexander said together anyway when you get that sorted do something sensible with the katscheis treasure too just burying it or putting it in the treasury will only invite more trouble i dont think julian will need convincing especially not if you hint at curses you could offer most of it to a dragon elena suggested suddenly recalling her initial impression of a dragons hoard in exchange for monster hunting or something the dragon could even live up here as the symbol of the order oh theres a lovely thought said the sorceress brightening and wed have a source for shed scales and blood does that suit you the fairy godmother asked alexander good ill find the dragon then and the rest of it can be used to reward octavian and his force those magical creatures that came to help us and repair the damage to the palace and compensate the families of those who were killed said alexander and when you finally return home i believe youll find that you now have all the resources of the first inhabitant of emerald cottage and the responsibilities that go with it which means that you will need to establish a permanent portal or perhaps i should say reestablish with one witch wizard or sorceress in each of the kingdoms for which you are responsible the fairy godmother gave elena a long look you will have your mirrorslave randolf contact my mirrorslave esteban when you have decided who will play host and where each one will be and the appropriate moot will gather to create them or reopen them if you decide to use the old ones this is as much to keep you from acting too impulsively as it is for your convenience if you know you can get to the source of trouble by stepping across a portal youll be less likely to fly off without waiting for answers to your messages elena blushed now i believe that this will do she looked up and down the table getting nods from all assembled very well this grand council session is closed commendations to godmother elena and champion alexander who are admonished to go back down into fleurberg and finish tidying up keeping in mind that a godmother always cleans up after herself and a champion never leaves a job halffinished all agreed agreed came the chorus opposed abstentions good she looked back up at alexander and elena well what are you waiting for an invitation to join the grand council be careful or youll get it elena made a small sound of alarm in her throat and to the sound of kindly laughter from around the table they turned and fled as one nightsong was waiting for them at the door tacked up in a new saddle with a pillion seat alexander took the saddle and greatly relieved not to be responsible for being anything other than a passenger elena took his hand and pulled herself up onto the pillion behind him ready he asked for anything she replied with a soaring heart be careful what you ask for godmother he warned you might get it and if i do she shrugged gaily then we handle it together so we do he agreed so we do it cant be any worse than the family reunion were about to negotiate she laughed and shook her head youre right oh families all right nightsong to fleurberg he laughed as well to fleurberg and my brothers but this time well take our time about it and the great black stallion trotted off rather than flying under a cloudless blue sky epilogue madame fleur plumped herself down on a chair at the little table in the window of the rose and ivy with a sigh and tucked her heavy string shoppingbag beneath the seat her sister blanche did the same dear saints what a day blanche said fanning herself with her hand i do believe that every living body in town was in the market today i would not disagree fleur said what a crush i dont know dear perhaps were getting too old to fight our way through the market do you think we ought to hire a boy for it or a girl actually i would not be averse to hiring another girl altogether for more of the household chores blanche made a face perhaps we are getting old well if we are then theres no shame in hiring another girl weve earned it said fleur decisively she looked out of the window i must say its very convenient having this inn right next door she added brightly so nice being able to nip over for a bite when were too tired to cook terribly convenient echoed blanche a twinkle in her eye the potgirl a bit of hair straggling damply into her eyes hurried over to take their orders ah daphne there you are what has theresa got on the menu today now both of them knew very well what theresa klovis had on the menu because it rarely changed but both of them took a great deal of pleasure in watching daphne klovis stand there and recite it all redfaced from her exertions the formerlyplump daughter of madame klovis told over the menu without a flicker of exasperation she darent display any bad temper not now not when she knew very well that if anyone complained to the debtors who owned what had been the klovis home there would be a reckoning well i do believe that i will have a ploughmans luncheon said blanche as she always did with a nice ale to wash it down and cold quiche for me and a glass of white wine said fleur as she always did daphne hurried off her back hair straggling down from under her cap gone were the silk gowns and ribbons the kloviss all wore what any working servant did a plain smockdress and canvas skirt a plain apron to go over it and a plain mobcap well all this work is doing her good blanche observed that weight has come off nicely when madame klovis had returned without a rich husband but expecting to find her house being cared for by her stepdaughter she found something else instead forewarned by madame fleur that she was coming a committee of those to whom she owed money was waiting the committee included a brace of constables and before you could say knife they had hustled off madame and her daughters all three of them protesting at the tops of their lungs while their creditors stripped the coach of everything and divided her belongings among themselves there was less there than she had taken with her foreign climes had not been receptive to madame and the girls and foreign merchants disinclined to part with anything on credit and she had been forced to sell a great many things in order to support herself and her daughters in what she considered to be the proper style there certainly was nothing near enough to settle her enormous debts but a solution had been suggested to this problem by a party who had wished to remain anonymous and the judge had presented them with this solution as a fait accompli the next morning the portion of the home that is hers already having been deeded to the creditors most generously by elena klovis the remainder is declared confiscated the judge had said sternly as madame and delphinium stared at him with angry arrogance and daphne wailed being as the debts are still not discharged your creditors have agreed to refurbish the house as an inn and hire a plain cook until you madame have demonstrated that you have mastered the art of producing edible food whereupon you will become the cook and kitchenmaid monsieur rabellets cousin will serve as innkeeper and you and your daughters as the inn servants until the debt is fully discharged at which time you may either continue to serve as servants for a wage or go your ways fleur and blanche had been in the gallery as had all of the creditors and indeed nearly anyone who had a dislike for madame and her daughters and they really had fallen mightily even the gowns they had been wearing had been taken from them and they were now garbed in ugly grey linen prison smocks and caps madames nostrils had flared as daphne wailed still louder and if we refuse she had asked icily then madame you and your daughters will be packed off to the workhouse the judge replied just as icily and there you will remain until you die since it is unlikely at workhouse wages that your debt will ever be discharged i advise you to accept there really was no choice in the matter madame was forced to assent and so she and her daughters had become exactly what they had forced elena to be unpaid servants sleeping in the attic on whatever was deemed to worn to use in the inn eating what was left over after all of the customers had been fed in that they were treated better than they themselves had treated elena they got two new smocks and a skirt a year where elena had gotten rags a set of sabots and underthings every year and woolen shawls and stockings for winter and they never starved but madame and the girls soon found out that if they dared to show any hint of bad temper monsieur rabellets cousin would summon the debtors and let them know and the judge would add another month to their sentence as a punishment for behaving in a fashion that would drive away customers madames fair white hands were now as rough and workravaged as elenas had ever been with broken nails and reddened skin delphinium was developing quite a set of muscles from lugging pots of hot water for the overnight customers baths and daphne actually had a figure that did not require winching down the ties of a corset to produce of the three daphne seemed to actually be learning a lesson from the situation fleur reflected as the girl brought them their meal she had stopped weeping most of the time and was beginning to show a healthy interest in one of the young farmers who frequented the place on market days fleur noted that he was at one of the smaller tables and that daphne was stopping there to make sure he didnt need anything far more often than she did for any other customer and her interest seemed to be reciprocated hmm she said catching her sisters attention and nodding towards the pair ah thats the way the wind blows does it said blanche with interest well i must say her temper and character have improved enormously she could do worse and so could he fleur agreed she and blanche were shameless eavesdroppers on the trio and she was actually beginning to feel some sympathy for daphne the girl was trying and she seemed to have finally gotten it into her dense little skull that not only was taking things from merchants without paying for them wrong but that perhaps what they had done to the nowvanished elena had been cruel fleur had heard her telling their master as much and we were that mean to her and no wonder she ran away to take service from someone as would pay her shed said now that i know what she had to do well i hope shes better off is all i can say and good luck to her no sign of improvement from the others though blanche observed as madames angry voice berating her daughter for some fault drifted out from the kitchen thats their choice fleur shrugged and the way they act if they dont take a cue from her theyll be totting up more months onto their service until theyll both be old and grey and scrubbing floors here while daphnes off making herself into a proper farmers wife ha blanche nodded it all comes down to what we make of ourselves eh the tradition or no who knows if she really continues to improve her character maybe a fairy godmother will take pity on daphne and shell find enough gold under a cabbage in the kitchengarden to buy her freedom and give her a little dowry stranger things have happened said fleur making a note of the thought to pass on to the appropriate party like a godmother wedding a champion she held up her glass of wine to happy endings however they come about blanche clinked glasses with her to happy endings indeed a qanda with mercedes lackey what does fantasy mean to you fantasy for me has always gone far beyond the magic rings and castles of the classical fairy tale although heaven knows i love the classical fairy tales to write or enjoy fantasy requires an open mind and heart and the ability to believe that things are not always what they seem why do you think women enjoy reading fantasy i think it may be because as dorothy l sayers once pointed out about the mystery genre fantasy is one of the last bastions of moral fiction by this she meant that in mystery and in fantasy good triumphs over evil the wrongdoers get their just deserts and all ends if not always strictly happily at least well this is the definition of moral fiction something that shows the world perhaps not as it is but certainly as it could and should be i think women are as a whole a lot less willing to settle for thats just the way it is than men are you tend to find that the men who read fantasy are idealists in fact what makes you write fantasy over any other subject i have greater scope in writing fantasy for my imagination than in any other genre i can write fantasy romances fantasy mysteries heroic fantasy modernurban fantasy historical fantasy dark or horror fantasy alternatehistory fantasy political fantasy even western fantasy there is virtually no genre that i could not use for a fantasy novel and even if i havent gotten around to it someone surely has because i can cite examples of every one of those books either in my own body of work or someone elses anything youd like to say about fantasy or writing or writing fantasy when a reader closes the book with regret youve done your job what we all strive for is when a reader goes back to the same book again and again and finds equal pleasure in it each time they read it thats what every reader is looking for and every writer is working to accomplish and when it comes down to cases everything written is at least in part a fantasy except maybe for the national budget thats horror
