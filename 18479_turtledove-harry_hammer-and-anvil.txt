harry turtledove hammer and anvil time of troubles when the younger maniakes looked west from the governors residencea polite name for a fortressin kastavala he could see only ocean even so staring out at that ocean did not bother him unduly he knew that beyond it lay the town of opsikion and beyond opsikion the rest of the empire of videssos he and his father from whom he drew his name had lived on the island of kalavria half a dozen years now it was exile but polite honorable exile the elder maniakes was governor of the island the avtokrator likinios had named him to the post and genesios after murdering likinios and all his sons and seizing the imperial throne for himself had seen fit to leave him undisturbed in his day the elder maniakes had been a soldier to reckon with genesios was no doubt just as glad to keep him busy far far away from videssos the city the great capital of the empire the younger maniakes stirred restlessly he knew just how far kalavria was removed from the center of the imperial stage in his six years here he had ridden over almost every inch of the island he had camped by a fire on the eastern shore and looked out to where the sailors sea ran on forever as far as anyone knew the view east shouldnt have looked different from the view west but somehow it did realizing you had your back to everything you would ever know seemed to change the way your eyes worked a voice came from behind him woolgathering again i see father i didnt hear you come up the younger maniakes said proves my point doesnt it the elder maniakes chuckled raspily he was a solidly made man in his middle sixties a great fleshy beak of a nose dominated the rest of his features he had aged about as well as he could for a man of his years he still had most of his teeth and his eyes and ears worked well enough along with his big thick bushy beard his hair was white but he had most of it too his wits if anything were sharper than they had ever been i wasnt woolgathering the younger maniakes insisted though his voice rose a little in embarrassment i was thinking he had fewer than half his fathers years but most of the same features including the impressive nose and the heavy beard that grew up almost to his eyes both were signs of the vaspurakaner blood the two maniakai shared the elder maniakes father had left the land of the princes to take service with videssos and his scions had prospered there now the elder maniakes laughed out loud and what were you thinking that was so allfired important you didnt even notice me the younger maniakes looked around and listened too no no servants were in earshot you couldnt be too careful these days lowering his voice he said about genesios that got his fathers attention were you the elder maniakes said also quietly he strode forward to stand by his son and look west with him the governors residence stood on a height above the town of kastavala proper from it the red tile roofs of houses and shops and the golden spheres that topped phos temples seemed spread out as if on a chart of parchment beyond the houses beyond the temples lay the harbor that was kastavalas true reason for being by the sea squatted sunbleached wooden warehouses and fishdrying sheds when the wind blew out of the west as it did more often than not everyone in kastavala was reminded of those sheds without any need to see them wooden piers jutted into the sea most of the vessels tied up at them were fishing boats the men who took them out day after day brought back the mackerel and squid that helped feed kastavala the merchant ships that came from opsikion and sometimes even from videssos the city loomed over them like bulls over calves at the base of one of those piers stood a spear its butt jammed into the sand suspended from the point of the spear was a skull a little skin a little hair still clung to it at genesios command that spear and its burden had stood in place there for more than five years when it came to kastavala the skull had been a head the head of hosios eldest son and heir to the overthrown avtokrator likinios softly still the younger maniakes said genesios avtokrator hasnt done all the things he might have for videssos beside him his father snorted tell the truth son as far as i can see genesios avtokrator hasnt done any of the things he might have for videssos scorn filled his voice even so he did not raise it one thing genesios was good at scenting treason growing and rooting it out before it came to flower the younger maniakes said between the civil war the kubratoi and the makuraners i wonder if there will be anything left of videssos after a few more years here on this island were away from trouble too if it hadnt been for the kubratoi likinios would still be emperor today or hosios after him the elder maniakes said with a sigh better he should have lost against the nomads than won a victory that made him think he could win more by ordering his troops to stay north of the astris river through the winter and live off the land he shivered at the thought of it if id been in that army i might have rebelled too his son shook his head not believing it for a moment the elder maniakes had the grace to look abashed duty ran deep in him he might complain about the onerous parts of a soldiers life but he would never shirk them the younger maniakes said since likinios fell it hasnt been just the kubratoi running wild up in the northeast he stopped bemused by a perspective based on the view from videssos the city kubrat lay north of kalavria but also west not east but then from kalavria just about everything lay to the west he went on the men of makuran have caused the empire even more grief i think and whose fault is that the elder maniakes pointed first at his son then at himself ours no one elses no likinios too the younger maniakes said if he hadnt ordered us to help sharbaraz in videssian fashion he pronounced the name of the makuraner king of kings as if it were sarbaraz get his throne back from that usurper makuran would be in no position to fight a war against videssos theyd have their own troubles to deal with out there in the far west likinios avtokrator may have ordered it but we accomplished it you and i his father answered sharbaraz was properly grateful too ill say so much for him and now he uses gratitude as an excuse to avenge his benefactorand swallow up as much of the videssian westlands as he can the younger maniakes turned and stared out the window again at this distance the standing spearshaft and the skull on it were invisible but he knew where they stood half to himself he said i wonder if the hosios sharbaraz claims to have with him might actually be likinios son no the elder maniakes voice was hard and flat whatever else genesios avtokrator may be he is an effective butcher if he claims he massacred likinios whole clan you may rely on him to speak the truth thereeven if nowhere else and i recognized that head when it still had flesh on it didnt you yes the younger maniakes admitted unwillingly but still you wish we had some legitimate choice besides genesios and his endless murders and betrayals his father finished for him by phos the lord with the great and good mind so do i but with genesios holding videssos the city we dont so what point even to thinking about it the younger maniakes left the window his sandals clicked over the mosaic tiles of a hunting scene as he walked to the doorway he looked out into the hall it was empty in both directions all the same he closed the door before he went back to his father when he spoke it was in a whisper we could go into rebellion no by the good god the elder maniakes said almost as quietly do you know how many rebels heads adorn the milestone in the plaza of palamas these days a couple of dozen maybe more if an avtokrator who holds the capital is even slightly awake to the world around him a revolt in the provincesespecially in a phosforsaken province like kalavriais foredoomed to failure videssos the city is too hard a nut to crack yes father the younger maniakes sighed they had this discussion about twice a year or whenever word of some new disaster of genesios came into kastavala whichever was more frequent by now they both knew all the steps in it as well as a standard opening sequence in the videssian board game but now like a skilled player trying a variation on one of those sequences the elder maniakes said or are you still pining for that fiancee of yours back in videssos the city swarthy though he was the younger maniakes knew he was flushing you know bloody well its not that he said he had been engaged to niphone the daughter of likinios logothete of the treasury and assotted of her as well but when likinios named his father governor of kalavria and packed both maniakai off to the island they had had to leave in too much haste for a wedding the younger maniakes had wept bitter tears most of the way to kastavala i didnt think that was it his father said with a twinkle in his eye but i did want to check im sure rotrude will be glad to hear it the younger maniakes flushed again rotrude had been his leman for four years now she had stayed behind in kastavala when her husband a trader in furs and amber from up in cold halogaland died of a flux of the bowels her exotic good looks had caught the younger maniakes eye almost no videssians had golden hair and eyes the greenblue color of the sea hard to believe atalarikhos will be three soon he said he gave the boys name the videssian pronunciation and ending rotrude had wanted to name her son after her dead husband and in the haloga fashion simply called him athalaric hes a likely enough lad but one of these days you should get yourself a legitimate heir the elder maniakes said his son turned that one against him like a boardgame player bringing a captured piece back into action on his own side by the good god where am i to find a girl of proper noble birth here on kalavria a point the elder maniakes conceded that it was a good one by dipping his head and changing the subject he pointed out to sea and said isnt that a sail coming in from the west by phos i think it is the younger maniakes answered nothing wrong with your eyes father thats plain enough nothing wrong for looking out over the ocean anyhow when i try to read its another matter i have to hold everything at arms length and then half the time the letters are too small to make out thats a goodsized ship the younger maniakes said gauging it against a fishing boat bobbing in the chop not far away i think ill go down to the pier and see what cargo it brings watching a merchantman unload was more interesting than most things that happened in kastavala pick up the news from the mainland too his father said it wont be goodit never is any morebut we should have it ill do as you say father the younger maniakes hurried downstairs at the doorway that opened onto the path leading down into town he almost ran into his cousin rhegorios the two of them looked enough alike to be brothers not surprising since rhegorios father symvatios the elder maniakes younger brother could almost have been his twin where away in such a hurry rhegorios asked down to the harbor i was on the top floor and saw a merchantman coming in the younger maniakes said want to come along why not his cousin answered wait here a momentlet me get my swordbelt he trotted down the hall toward his chamber maniakes was already wearing his sword belted on over a robe of brocaded silk when winter came and snowstorms rolled across the sea and into kastavala he changed to tunic and trousers and thick sheepskin jacket as did everyone else in town many men maybe most wore tunic and trousers the year around but nobles were expected to be respectably conservative rhegorios hurried back still closing the heavy gold buckle on his swordbelt he liked display better than maniakes did but then hed seen less fighting than his cousin a fancydecked soldier only made a juicier target for his foes a servant came up to bar the door behind maniakes and rhegorios the wind was rising and from out of the west maniakes coughed a littleit threw the reek of the fishdrying sheds full in his face rhegorios laughed understanding him think on the bright side cousin he said it stinks aye but it brings that ship in faster true enough maniakes said the slope of the rise lengthened his strides and sped his pace into town he knew the slog back would be long but was young enough not to worry about that till he had to do it kastavala had no wall danger here came from the sea not from the island soon maniakes and rhegorios were in among houses most presenting to the world only whitewashed fronts with narrow shuttered windows and stout doors taverns and inns and brothels that catered to sailors eateries smelling of fried fish and shops of all sorts most with trades connected to the seasailweavers ropemakers carpenters coopers with here and there a silversmith or a jeweler a good many sailors carried their wealth on them sailors and artisans merchants and farmers from the hinterland crowded kastavalas narrow winding streets only the road that led from the harbor up to the governors residence was cobbled dust rose from the others in a hovering eyestinging cloud maniakes and rhegorios picked their way through the crowd now and then dodging a wagon heading up from the quays with a rattle of ironclad wheels and horseshoes on cobbles and the hideous squeak of ungreased axles in dodging maniakes almost bumped into a priest your pardon holy sir he said no harm done phos bless you young man the priest sketched the good gods suncircle above his left breast he wore a goldembroidered circle there on an otherwise plain robe of skyblue wool that garb his shaven pate and an untrimmed beard normal for a vaspurakaner but unusual among all videssians save clerics were the badges of his office maniakes and rhegorios returned the gesture and pressed on a moment later maniakes glanced around and saw his cousin was no longer with him he whirled around there stood rhegorios ogling a pretty girl by her plain linen tunic and disordered hair she was probably a laundress or cook rather than a tart seeking to draw mens eyes come on maniakes called rhegorios came still looking back over his shoulder i want to see which shop she goes into he said the road bent he sighed shes gonelost forever he clapped a melodramatic hand over his heart maniakes let out a snort you can take a pandoura into a tavern here and sing of your vanished love bring a sailors cap along and youll cadge enough coppers for a nights worth of wine meanwhile watch where youre going you almost stepped into a pile of horse turds there and didnt even know it youre a cruel hard man cousin of mine rhegorios staggered as if wounded what are you mimingbeing pierced by the arrow of common sense maniakes asked rhegorios poked him in the ribs with an elbow they half wrestled their way down to the piers aboard the approaching merchantman the sailors had put sweeps into the oarlocks fore and aft and were using them to guide the ship toward a goodsized open space on one of the quays pull lads pull the captain called his voice easily audible across a narrowing gap of water a little to port on the steering oars a little more nowback water the ship stopped smoothly by the quay sailors jumped across to hold it in place with lines rhegorios pointed to a knot of welldressed men who stood close by the ships near rail not the usual sort of crowd you find at sea he remarked wonder what it means that theyre here it means trouble maniakes replied you see that one in the saffron robe with the red and black brocade without waiting for his cousin to nod he went on thats kourikos the logothete of the treasury your fiancees father rhegorios eyes widened thats right maniakes answered grimly him id know anywhere the othersits been six years but i recognize half of them maybe more all the ones i do recognize are men who ran things back in videssos the city before genesios overthrew likinios the ones i dont know have the same look to them too id bet theyre genesios appointees to fill the jobs of men hes killed but your question was the right one what are they doing here rhegorios drew his sword he held it with the point down by his right foot but seemed ready to raise it and strike at any provocationor none you gave it the right answer cousin theyre bringing trouble a little more slowly than maniakes had spotted him kourikos recognized his daughters betrothed he waved frantically at maniakes then turned and said something to his companions in an instant they too were waving like men possessed at the captains orders a couple of sailors extended a gangplank from the ship to the pier the richly dressed men almost fought one another to be first across it maniakes was surprised no one fellor got elbowedoff the plank and into the sea kourikos in the lead the nobles and government ministers rushed toward maniakes and rhegorios eminent most noble maniakes his fiancees father cried bowing low before him take us at once to the dwelling of your wise and heroic father that we may pour out for him our tale of the woe and horror and despair that have fallen on the city the queen of cities he meant the imperial capital but like many videssian nobles preferred talking around something to coming right out and saying it and have overwhelmed the empire one of the other menmaniakes thought his name was triphyllessaid only your father can rescue videssos from our present calamity everyone else nodded emphatically whats gone and fallen to the makuraners now rhegorios asked the makuraners now kourikos evidently spokesman by virtue of his relationship to the younger maniakes shook his head the makuraners outside the city do dreadful things too seizing our land and carrying off prisoners innumerable but that murderous genesios does worse than they within triphylles tapped him on the arm and said eminent kourikos if you go through the whole tale of woe here it will delay us in reaching the elder maniakes whereupon we shall just have to retail it over again what you say is true excellent sir kourikos answered he turned back to the younger maniakes phos grant that you forgive my cutting short intercourse with you here that we may speak to your magnificent father as soon as is practicable yes certainly maniakes said after a momenthe was no longer used to the flowery language in vogue among the upper classes at the capital and had to make sure he knew what kourikos meant but instead of leading the delegation of grandees straight back toward the governors residence he held up a hand first you must tell me whether niphone is safe and well she was well when i left videssos the city kourikos answered and as safe as she could make herself she and her mother have both entered the convent dedicated to the holy phostina we all pray that even the monster genesios will hesitate before dragging out anyone female or male who has taken service with the good god may it be so maniakes said and sketched phos suncircle over his heart with any avtokrator he had ever heard of the safety of those mured up in monasteries or convents would have been a given if kourikos still worried about what genesios would do then genesios probably was a monster maniakes took a step toward the base of the pier come with me excellent sirs eminent sirs he pointed toward the mansion on the high ground in back of town there dwells my father he will hear you with great attention i am sure together he and rhegorios led the nobles from videssos the city back through kastavala the kastavalans stared curiously at the newcomers who stood out not only because they were strangers but also by virtue of their rich and splendid robes seeing such obvious wealth a couple of tarts called sweetvoiced invitations the nobles took no notice they were undoubtedly used to better by the way they looked at kastavala that attitude applied to more than just the easy women of the town next to the capital kastavala was small and drab and dirty and smelly maniakes knew that perfectly well but the same applied to any provincial center he had seen a great many such towns all through the empire of videssos kastavala was typical of the breed after a while he realized some of the grandees hadnt seen anything outside videssos the city save perhaps their country estates and hunting lodges for them a provincial town had to be something of a shock coming out somebody called from a secondstory balcony and emptied a jar of slops splat in the middle of the street kourikos and the rest jumped back in alarm and disgust tugging at the hems of their robes to makes sure the stinking stuff didnt splash them that woman should be clapped in irons the logothete of the treasury declared why maniakes asked she warned us before she let fly kourikos stared at him in horror that only grew when he realized his prospective soninlaw was serious most of the houses and blocks of flats in videssos the city had drains that connected them to underground sewers that was an unimagined luxury in kastavala several of the grandees from the capital were puffing and red in the face by the time they reached the governors residence maniakes didnt need to open the door and usher them inside someone had seen them coming and quite a crowd had gathered in front of the residence to greet them and learn what word they brought voice doubtful kourikos asked eminent maniakes is that your father there maniakes didnt blame him for being wrong the resemblances was striking no thats my uncle symvatios father to rhegorios here he and my father have always been like as two peas in the pod and thats his daughter there beside himmy cousin lysia lysia was still too far away to have heard him speak her name but chose that moment to wave to him he waved back smiling as he did so he had hardly known her before symvatios and his family sailed with the maniakai to the island of kalavria but the two of them had grown close since so close that rotrude had teased him about it once or twice he hadnt risen to the teasing as he usually did it left him nervous as maniakes and the nobles drew near lysia called what interesting people youve brought us cousin phos blessing on you for that symvatios nodded vigorously so did more than a few of the grooms and cooks and serving women who had come out with their masters the prospect of fresh faces and fresh news piqued everyones curiosity maniakes pointed to a servant aplakes go fetch my father at once the eminent kourikos here and these other excellent sirs and eminent sirs have come from videssos the city to confer with him on an urgent matter aplakes dashed back into the mansion everyone else started buzzing the grandees looked like important people hearing just how important they were set tongues wagging lysia stared at maniakes her eyes shining in a face slightly rounder and less craggy than that of her brother rhegorios better than the servants she could guess one reason why the nobles might have come from the capital to kastavala aplakes hadnt bothered closing the entry door after him he soon emerged the elder maniakes a pace behind as soon as the elder maniakes appeared kourikos and his companions instead of bowing as the younger maniakes had expected dropped first to their knees and then to their bellies touching their foreheads to the dirt in the full proskynesis normally reserved for honoring the avtokrator of the videssians alone the younger maniakes simply gaped his fathers bushy white eyebrows climbed toward his hairline he spat on the ground as if in rejection of the dark god skotos get up the lot of you he growled anger and fear in his voice if you think youll trick me thus into treason against genesios avtokrator you can bloody well think again as the grandees rose they looked at one another with mixed horror and dismay most noble maniakes you misunderstand kourikos said a quaver in his voice we are the ones guilty of treason at least in genesios eyes we have fled here from videssos the city to beg you to take the crown and save the empire without you it will surely fall either from the ravages of the makuraners or simply from the insane excesses of the tyrant whose bloodstained backside now defiles the imperial throne the two maniakai exchanged glances not long before the ship that had brought kourikos and his comrades to kastavala came into sight they had talked about rebellion against genesios the elder maniakes had rejected it then nownow he looked thoughtfully at the group of nobles and asked what has genesios done to turn you against him after you followed him like dogs these past halfdozen years several of the grandees hung their heads kourikos had more spiritor perhaps more desperationthan most he said if you speak of following like dogs lord maniakes i noticed youve not taken poor hosios head down off its pike in all these years dyou bark with the rest of us then mm put that way maybe i do the elder maniakes stroked his beard very well eminent sir say on why would you sooner see my backside on the throne than genesios why kourikos clapped a dramaticand possibly rehearsedhand to his forehead were skotos to come up to videssos from his hell of ice he spat as the elder maniakes had he could hardly serve it worse than genesios the poxed the madman the butcher the blundering bungling idiot who is about to cast centuries of imperial splendor onto the dungheap forever the elder maniakes bowed slightly you can curse with any man eminent sir but what has genesios actually done kourikos took a deep breath let us leave to one side the disasters against makuran and the misfortunes against kubrat you surely know of those already not long ago genesios spoke to the city mob in the amphitheater currying favor with them because he knew everyone else hated him but some of their leaders jeered him because of his many failings he sent soldiers in among the seats seized a dozen men maybe more ordered them stripped naked and put them to the sword in front of the crowd when the general sphrantzes failed against the makuranersand how could he do otherwise with neither men nor money enough to fightgenesios whipped him to death with leather lashes elpidios the prefect of the city exchanged letters with tzikaste likinios widow genesios cut off his hands and feet and then his head then he slew tzikaste herself and both her daughters at the same spot where hed murdered likinios avtokrator and his sons at this rate not a man nor woman will be left alive in videssos the city by the time winter comes save only the tyrant and his toadies save us save videssos i beg you most noble maniakes save us the rest of the nobles chorused eminent sirs excellent sirs if you expect me to jump into your ship and sail back to videssos the city with you im afraid im going to leave you disappointed the elder maniakes said but ill not deny youve given me much to think on he peered down toward the harbor will your servants be fetching your baggage here to the residence most eminent maniakes we found the opportunity to flee and we took it kourikos answered we brought no servants the more who knew of our plan the likelier we were to be betrayed to the monster as for baggage what you see is what we have the elder maniakes eyebrows rose again for videssian nobles to travel without baggage was a truer measure of desperation than any woeful tale no matter how heartrending the revelation startled the younger maniakes too he did notice the grandees had fat leather pouches at their belts pouches that might well be filled with goldpieces they might have come as fugitives but they probably werent beggars well well the elder maniakes said in that case come in and be welcome i shant turn you over to genesios that much i promise you if he has a ship on your heels you can flee into the countryside and escape for now though more gladsome things aplakes and the other servants will show you to chambers we have room and to spare that we do by phos and at supper in the courtyard this evening well speak further on these matters meanwhile he used his eyes to gather up his son rhegorios and symvatios the servants led the nobles into the governors residence as the younger maniakes went up to his father lysia set a hand on his arm isnt it marvelous she exclaimed her black eyes flashing with excitement at last phos willing genesios will get what hes long deserved and then and then symvatios broke in his voice almost eerily like that of the elder maniakes we have to figure out what to do next if we decide to do anything at all are you going to plot with us here lysia made a face at her father i would if youd let me but i dont suppose you will symvatios slowly shook his head his daughter made another face she stood on tiptoe to kiss the younger maniakes on the end of his nosehe was used to that because his beard was so thick and full she did it a lotthen went into the residence herself the two older brothers and their sons put their heads together rhegorios said uncle they aim to set you on the throne his eyes snapped with the same high spirits that had filled lysias i know that the elder maniakes answered matteroffactly what i dont know is whether i want to sit there way things look to me now i have my doubts and big ones his son brother and nephew all gaped in amazement in the middle of their gaping the door to the mansion opened the cook came out he sent the elder maniakes a dirty look and headed down the slope toward the markets of kastavala almost at a run symvatios laughed thats what you get for inviting a whole raft of people to supper on short notice he said resting a hand on his paunch for a moment he was heavier than his brother if a glare is all i get ill count myself lucky the elder maniakes chuckled i just hope its not nightshade in the soup or some such he sobered back to it look at me all of you im an old man ive done nothing but fight since i was fifteen years old except these past few years here in kalavria i hated likinios when he sent me here but do you know what ive come to like this place and to enjoy the easy life i dont want to fight any more and i dont care to sit on a throne and know half the people watching me are trying to figure out how to throw me off it what do you think of that he looked defiantly at his kinsmen let it all be as you say father the younger maniakes answered can we sit out here on this island and watch the empire get dragged down to the ice if genesios is as bad as this even videssos the city may fall to the makuranersor to the kubratoi one day a fleet may sail for kalavria with the red lion of the king of kings of makuran painted on the sails the elder maniakes chuckled again but without humor and wouldnt that be strange when the two of us led the videssian army that helped put sharbaraz back on his throne but youre right if he saw the chance he wouldnt hesitate not even for a heartbeat well then the younger maniakes and rhegorios said together well thenwhat the elder maniakes answered you have to take the throne his son explained as if the necessity were as obvious as a geometric proof nonsense the elder maniakes said i dont have to do any such thing whats more the more i think about it the less i want to do any such thing im perfectly content to rusticate and as best as i can recall ive never been perfectly content before governor of kalavria suits me fine if you think the empire needs saving son you save it symvatios and rhegorios looked from the elder maniakes to the younger for a moment he didnt understand why they were looking at him as they were then he did and ice and fire might have coursed together through his veins father he said slowly if i go will you help me now it was the elder maniakes turn to hesitate before he replied you mean this he said it was not quite a question the younger maniakes nodded the elder sucked in a long breath then folded his son into an embrace that still had a good deal of strength in it of course the whole clan will his eyes swung to his brother and nephew aye symvatios said at once aye rhegorios agreed if maniakes here hadnt spoken up i would have myself now the younger maniakes stared at his cousin he was far from avtokrator as yet but did he already have a rival we shall essay it then the elder maniakes said that should have been a ringing declaration instead as had his earlier words it came out almost as a query a moment later he showed the reason for his doubt if we fail we die the whole clan dies all the kinsfolk we have whom genesios can reach we had best not fail we dont need to move on videssos the city tomorrow and wed be mad if we did we think it through before we try it yes the younger maniakes said beside him rhegorios twisted like a restive horse he didnt want to wait he wanted to charge right at genesios the younger maniakes remarked sometimes the straightest way is not the shortest one my boy his father said now full of pride youve learned something after all he hugged the younger maniakes again symvatios said now that we know we are going to do this thing lets go in and get ready for supper i want to see kourikos face when he finds out hes going to be fatherinlaw to an avtokrator right away the elder maniakes chuckled but the younger said genesios will find that out too i hope it doesnt put niphone in any danger kourikos said she was in a convent in videssos the city one more thing to worry about the elder maniakes said on campaign youll add something to your list a hundred times a day but for now symvatios is right weve done what we can for the time being lets get ready for supper one more thing to worry about the younger maniakes thought as he walked toward the tables and chairs that had been hastily set up among the flowers of the courtyard rotrude was on his arm with atalarikhos walking along holding his mothers hand how kourikos would react on seeing his soontobesoninlaw with not only a leman but also a bastard boy was liable to be interesting by rights the logothete of the treasury had no cause for complaint he could hardly have expected maniakes to have stayed celibate as a monk when he had been far away from his intended bride all these years he might have expected maniakes not to show his woman here so openly maniakes had thought about that if he had left rotrude behind it would have said he was ashamed of her which not only wasnt true but would have infuriated her had it so much as crossed her mind most of the nobles fled from the capital were already in the courtyard talking among themselves drinking wine and pretending to admire the plants the younger maniakes knew they were politely insincere there the formal gardens of videssos the city outshone this one as the sun did a dim star talk of the garden ceased when they saw rotrude few women of the halogai came into the empire her golden hair drew a videssian mans eye like a lodestone once you stopped staring at that you noticed the eyes the strong chin thrusting cheekbones and short straight nose the sheer size of hershe was almost as tall as the younger maniakes who was not shortand her shape womanly despite her inches the grandees stares gave him a certain amount of pride they irked her turning to him she said i am not one of the big beasts from the hot lands the ones with snakes for snouts her videssian was clear but slow with the halfdrawled accent of her homeland theyre admiring you maniakes said if youd been born in the empire youd be preening for them if i had been born in the empire i would have the same seeming as they and you so they would not need to gape she reached down and ruffled atalarikhos hair so your son does mostly maniakes said the hair through which rotrude ran her fingers was as black as his own but straight not wavy like maniakes but atalarikhos had some of his mothers coloring maniakes was slightly swarthier than the average videssian his son slightly fairer the shape of his face was more like rotrudes too though even at less than three he gave signs of developing a nose of impressive proportions kourikos strode toward maniakes and his companions behind the logothete the other nobles grew suddenly quiet watching to see what he would do kourikos bowed to maniakes good to see you again eminent sir the grandee said his voice politely neutral will you be so kind as to perform the introductions here of course maniakes said matching his courtesy eminent kourikos i present to you my lady rotrude and her sonour sonatalarikhos there the truth was out let kourikos make of it what he would yourlady kourikos said carefully not i take it your lady wife no eminent sir maniakes answered how could that be when i am affianced to your daughter rotrude knew about his engagement to niphone she had a fierce direct way of looking at the world keeping things of importance from her was unwise up till now the engagement had never bothered her a woman far away in videssos the city remained quite nicely hypothetical but if kourikos was real that made his daughter realer too as if rotrude were not standing before him the logothete of the treasury said of course you will put yourladyaside when your father is anointed and crowned avtokrator of the videssians rotrude looked not at kourikos but through him he might have abruptly ceased to exist dodging part of the question the younger maniakes said its not for me to discuss my fathers plans he is more than able to do that for himselfand here he comes now kourikos and the rest of the nobles cried thou conquerest maniakes avtokratorthe traditional acclamation of a videssian emperor they began to prostrate themselves as they had in front of the governors mansion stop that the elder maniakes said testily im not avtokrator and i dont intend to become avtokrator so stop treating me as if i were if you think you can flatter me into donning the red boots you can bloody well think again kourikos expression said the elder maniakes might have just taken an image of phos from the iconostasis of a temple and set a torch to it the rest of the grandees looked similarly downcast triphylles said but your majuh most eminent sir all im going to say now is that you wont get left in the lurch the elder maniakes waved to the servitors behind him first we sup then we talk sulkily the nobles from videssos the city took the places to which aplakes led them they kept on murmuring among themselves the younger maniakes watched their eyes flick this way and that sometimes those glances rested lightly on him sometimes on his father sometimes on symvatios and rhegorios whenever you caught a noble staring his gaze would flit away like a frightened fly from down the table lysia caught the younger maniakes eye her eyes gleamed her father or brother must have told her what they had decided maniakes smiled at her glad to find someone who could look his way without seeming guilty about it the cook might have been dismayed at the prospect of having to serve a flock of unexpected guests of high rank but he acquitted himself well his first course was a salad carrots and parsnips lightly cooked in olive oil and cumin then served with salted olives and hardcooked eggs on a bed of endive atalarikhos devoured his egg and the olives and started to cry when rotrude tried to make him eat some carrots dont force him not tonight the younger maniakes told her lets keep him quiet if we can she sucked in her underlip as she did when she disapproved he needs to eat to grow strong she said then she sighed i yield one nights food does not mattermuch after the salad came an earthenware casserole full of leeks and fava beans stewed in broth and then wrapped in cabbage leaves at the sight of that atalarikhos said something in the haloga language he had learned from his mother the younger maniakes was glad none of the grandees from the imperial city understood enough of that speech to realize he had called the casserole a big chamber pot for the main course the servants brought from the kitchen trays of steamed young mackerel stuffed with a mixture of mint leaves pepper chopped almonds and honey atalarikhos enthusiastically ate up his stuffing but wanted no part of the fish in which it was contained now it was the younger maniakes who avoided rotrudes probing eye the sweet was apple slices apricots and grapes candied together in honey atalarikhos swept his own bowl clean then started stealing grapes from his mother rotrude sighed he is not starving she said as if reminding herself servants swept away dishes knives and spoons while supper guests licked their fingers clean more servants lit torches all around the courtyard the sky above darkened from bright blue toward black the first stars began to glisten grunting a little and patting his belly the elder maniakes got to his feet the nobles stared expectantly at him he swigged from his cup of wine set the silver vessel down with a clang and cleared his throat im not much for speechmaking he said which was a crashing lie his son had never seen anyone better at rousing troops to go forward even when some of them were sure to die but the lie served its purpose here it let him say what he wanted without having to festoon it with curlicues of rhetoric he went on you are gracious enough to say you wanted me to wear the crown very well lords i shall give you a maniakes avtokrator thou conquerest maniakes kourikos shouted in an instant all his companions took up the cry so did some of the servants their voices rising in excitement maybe they dreamt of escaping kastavala for the fabled splendor of videssos the city the elder maniakes held up a hand he coughed once or twice a habit of his when he thought he had outsmarted someone i told you this afternoon lords i wasnt sure i cared to be avtokrator ive spent the day thinking on it and as i said before we sat down to sup i have to tell you ive decided i dont but i wont deny this carbuncle on the arse of videssos named genesios needs casting down and so my friends i give youmaniakes avtokrator he pointed to his son as the elder maniakes sat down the younger rose he had known this moment was coming but knowing that and living it were not one and the same the grandees studied him now their glances sharp as swords they were older than he and more experienced some of them would want to rule him or rule through himprobably the ones who least looked like it for they would be the most accomplished dissemblers he would sooner have gone into battle against the fearsome cavalry of makuran its men and horses glittering alike in armor of iron than face these cagey devious lords but if he could not master them how was he to hope to rule videssos he said if phos has not altogether despaired of the empire he will give videssos a ruler who can end the civil strife that has so long consumed us who can reclaim from the king of kings the cities and provinces makuran has stolen from us and who can hold in check the ferocious horsemen of kubrat doing any one of those things will be hard doing all three at once i wish the lord with the great and good mind had not brought videssos to such a pass but since he has i shall do all i can do to rescue the empire from those who threaten it whether on the borders or in videssos the city itself it wasnt the sort of speech to send men rushing into battle throats full of cheers swords held high the empires problems were too great for the younger maniakes even to think about making a speech like that if he could win the throne he knew what he wanted to do how he would do it unfortunately was another question altogether the grandees courteously heard him out he was not surprised when kourikos was again first to cry out thou conquerest maniakes avtokratorhis prospective fatherinlaw naturally hoped to use his accession for himself but all the nobles acclaimed him their voices fulsome if not necessarily sincere the younger maniakes raised his goblet high to videssos he shouted and drank to videssos shouted his family the servants and the grandees all together the younger maniakes wondered for how many that toast actually meant to me a single lamp burned on the night table next to rotrudes bed atalarikhos slept in the next room with an unbarred connecting door between them once or twice that had proved embarrassing for the younger maniakes he hadnt been used to a little boy wandering in at an awkward moment needing to piddle or to be comforted after a bad dream rotrude took such interruption in stride from what she had said in halogaland several families often lived together in one big room under the same roof privacy was a videssian notion to which she had had to acclimate herself now she sat at the edge of the bed brushing out her long golden hair maniakes watched the lamplight play off it shadows filled and magnified little lines at the corners of her mouth and by her eyes she hadnt many fewer years than he she tossed the bonehandled brush onto the night table the flame from the lamp jumped for a moment then steadied her face still full of the intent concentration it had held while she was brushing she turned to maniakes and said if you win your fight for the city you will marry the maiden kourikos sired he bit his lip he hadnt thought she would put it so bluntly but the men and women of halogaland from what he had seen of them in the capital and here in kastavala were a straighterspoken folk than most videssians rotrude simply sat awaiting his reply he sighed yes i suppose i shall he said before i came here as ive told you i was very much in love with her and her father stands high among the emperors counselors rotrude said and would have reason for wrath were she cast aside that also maniakes agreed soberly rotrude bit down on the nub of it and so what of me and so what of our son child of our flesh again maniakes had hoped that question would not come so soon or would have been phrased to give him more room to talk around it none of the answers he came up with struck him as good enough he did the best he could come what may both of you will always be dear to me if you want to stay on kalavria you will want for nothingby phos i swear it he sketched the suncircle over his heart rotrude shrugged she didnt mock phos but she didnt worship him either her reverence belonged to the gloomy bloodthirsty gods of her homeland and if we fare forth to halogaland once more what then she asked i wish you would promise not to do that maniakes said slowly the thought of how much mischief a haloga chieftain could work with an avtokrators bastard for a tool made his blood run cold so long as you stay you can have anything here you wish what i wish here mostly is you she answered he hung his head most videssian women just then would either have dissolved in tears or started throwing things rotrude did neither she measured him with her eyes as a warrior might have over the top of his shield what if i were to find another man who suited me if you wanted to wed him and if i thought he would treat you and our son well you would have my blessing maniakes said rotrude studied him again i wonder if you tell me this because you care for me not at all or because you care for me very much she said perhaps half to herself and then went on you have said what will be and not wrapped lies in honey to make them sound sweet for so much i give you credit not all men of my folk would have done as much and few of you southrons from what i have seen so i shall choose to believe you you are one who counts the needs of your folk before those of yourself is it not so i hope i am at any rate maniakes answered it gave him an easier escape than he had looked for if he wasnt that sort of man he thought now would be a good time to try to become such you shall not sail on tomorrows tide rotrude said to ready a rebellion to topple the tyrant you will need to think before you do what shall become of us before you wander west from kastavala from kalavria maniakes said i leave that up to you if you find you want nothing more to do with me now that you know im going to fight genesios that seemed a better way to put it than now that you know im going to leave you i can hardly blame you i wont force myself where im not wanted he would have felt more virtuous about that speech had he not known any number of women would throw themselves into an avtokrators bed some simply because power drew them others in the hope of the advantage they might wring from it rotrude glanced down at her robe this sleeve has a seam that wants fixing she remarked instead of reaching for needle and threadsewing like reading was best done by daylightshe got to her feet and pulled the robe off over her head she stood a moment in her linen drawers then slid them down over her legs and kicked them aside almost defiantly naked she stared a challenge at maniakes her body was thicker than those of most videssian women but shapely in its own way where the sun never saw it her skin was so pale and fair it seemed to glow in the lamplight even after she had nursed atalarikhos for close to two years her nipples were a delicate pink hardly darker than the full heavy breasts they topped the triangle of golden hair at the joining of her legs matched the long locks that fell over her shoulders maniakes mouth went dry as he looked at her if he tore a seam getting out of his own robe he never noticed only when he yanked down his drawers did he realize he was still wearing sandals he pulled out his feet without unfastening the catches and threw the shoes against the wall that was foolish it might have wakened atalarikhos this time luck went with him the coupling reminded him as much of battle as of lovemaking when rotrude bit the strip of flesh between his shoulder and neck he wondered if she had drawn blood his hands roamed rough over her body squeezing demanding their kisses smashed lips hard against teeth at last both of them afire she straddled him when she impaled herself on him she groaned as if pierced by a veritable lance rather than one that would presently lose its hardness something like triumph was on her face as she slowly began to move you will never forget me she whispered her breath warm and moist against maniakes cheek never for a moment even through growing ecstasy he knew alarm wondering if she was trying to bewitch him they had wizards and witches in halogaland even if their magic was different from that of videssos then she lowered her head to kiss him again her breasts brushed against the thick mat of hair on his chest his arms tightened around her back pulling her down to him women could work magic even when they used no spells their lips were joined once more when she moaned and quivered above him and a moment later when he too cried out the bedchamber was not warmeven summer in kastavala was mild and summer nights often cool and foggybut sweat soaked both of them he ran a hand along the slick curve of her back i will never forget you he said but youre heavy on top of me he laughed youve told me that often enough thats so she admitted and got up on her elbows and knees their skins made small wet squelching noises as they separated her hair spilled down onto his face through the strands he saw her intently looking at him you are a warrior she said at last from a woman of the halogai he could expect no higher praise on the battlefield one side or the other must lose he said this fight we both won she stretched out beside him also true she said and here we can quickly struggle again she let a hand rest on his chest for a moment then teased his nipple with thumb and forefinger as he had with her a little before her hand wandered down closed on him for as long as you are here by me i shall be greedy of you and take all you can give whether i can give again so soon maniakes shrugged when his beard was newly sprouted he had been as randy as a hegoat he remained proud of what he could do but thirty wasnt seventeen no matter how he wished it could be his lance needed longer now to regain its temper but rise again he did he and rotrude joined with something close to the desperation they had shown in their first round they were both worn and gasping when they finished after such frenzy maniakes wondered what sort of appetite he would be able to conjure up for his promised bride if all went well and he cast genesios down from the imperial throne he didnt wonder for long sleep swallowed him before he could raise his head to blow out the bedside lamp the two maniakai symvatios and rhegorios strode along the beach north of the harbor of kastavala the younger maniakes looked back toward the town and toward the governors residence on the rise beyond it he and his kinsmen had come too far for him to see the grandees up on the wall there but he knew they were staring out toward him as he peered their way symvatios half turned back toward the residence too but only for a moment he made a slashing contemptuous gesture with his left hand they have their gall he said scornfully this is family business now and they can bloody well keep their beaks out of it beaks indeed the elder maniakes said chuckling he set a hand on his own great nose theyve lived in videssos the city all their lives is their trouble they think it gives them the right to give orders anywhere in the empire not a proper soldier among em either which is too bad help worth having we could have used they help us maniakes said if his own chiefest men can stomach genesios no more videssos the city may drop into our hands like a ripe orange falling off a tree he sighed he missed oranges they would not grow on kalavria summers did not get hot enough for them to flourish if the orange doesnt fall from the tree well cut it off rhegorios drew his sword and slashed at the air if we think this fight will be easy we are doomed before we begin the elder maniakes said how many rebels have thought the city would fall to them he opened and closed his hands several times to answer his own question and of that great flock how many have seized the throne so he held up one hand the fingers curled in a fist none showing the usual way for an avtokrator to lose the throne is by treachery within videssos the city itself well what of likinios rhegorios said genesios took the city from without only because his own men wouldnt fight for him the elder maniakes answered if im keeping the accounts that also goes down as treachery from within by all the stories genesios men hate him too the younger maniakes said rhegorios nodded vigorously he made more cutandthrust motions his impulse was always to go straight at a foe not all of them the elder maniakes answered if enough of them hated him his head would go up on the milestone not those of all the rivals hes slain he set a hand on his sons shoulder i dont want to see your head there lad when we move against genesios thats not something we can take back if its not going as wed like we have only the one chance the younger maniakes nodded he had been through enough battles and had enough years on him to know things could go wrong you did what you could to keep that from happening but not everything you did was going to work symvatios said what the fleet on the key does will be the key to whether we rise or fall no one misunderstood him the island called the key lay south and east of videssos the city and was indeed often the key to the citys fate its fleet was next in power after that based at the capital itself with it the rebels would stand a fair chance of success without it you have spoken truth the elder maniakes said to his brother and it is a truth that worries me i havewe all haveconnections wide and deep within videssos army some weve not used in a while but theyre there i expect we can take advantage of them but few men of vaspurakaner blood have taken to sea the grand drungarios of the fleet and his captains have no reason to back us save that genesios is a beast rhegorios said genesios has been a beast for some time the elder maniakes replied he has also been an enthroned beast for some time thoughtfully the younger maniakes said perhaps some of our ah guests back at the residence have relations serving in the fleet we should look into that a good notion his father agreed we shall look into that well also have to gather ships and fighting men from all around kalavria to make the core of our force well have enough ships to get the men and horses across to the mainland i expect we need a decentsized fleet hereabouts to put down the pirates who drip into videssian waters we sail for opsikion i suppose symvatios said theres a fine highway from there to take the soldiers straight west to videssos the city if we leave them at opsikion they can attack by land while the fleet sails around the cape and then up to invest the sea walls see what the clan can do when we put our heads together the elder maniakes said seems to me thats the only way to take videssos the city if it can be done at all assail it from all sides at once stretch the defenders too thin to guard everything and pray all the powerful mages are either dead or fled from genesios like the grandees if we have to sit for weeks outside the citys walls some deviltry will land on us sure as genesios is bound for skotos ice rhegorios looked at the younger maniakes youll command the fleet i suppose that will be our striking arm and probably reach the city before the overland forces can give me leave to lead the infantry and cavalry then ill get them across from opsikion as fast as i can phos willing ill bring plenty of troops from the garrisons along the way too symvatios coughed id thought to play that role myself son rhegorios looked stricken symvatios coughed again it may be that youre right though he patted his belly i may be too old and too round to push ahead as hard as would suit us best have it your way rhegorios whooped and sprang in the air the elder maniakes slipped an arm round his brother im not going either symvatios he said better the young strong ones come to power now than that we seize it and have them hating us and counting the hours till we die having your sons sitting around hoping your eyes will roll up in your head and youll fall down dead off the thronethats no way to rule worrying whether your sons might give you something to make your eyes roll up in your headthats worse wed never do such a thing the younger maniakes cried again rhegorios nodded you say so now the elder maniakes answered but youre liable to find never is a long time suppose i seized the throne nowjust suppose and suppose i live another fifteen years or more till im past eighty it could happen you knownothings killed me yet he chuckled wheezily youd be pushing on toward fifty by then son would you be getting impatient waiting for your turn suppose i found some pretty little chit in the city too and got a son on her his beard would be starting to sprout would you peer at him out of the corner of your eye and wonder if hed get the prize youd wanted so long what do you think answer me true now rhegorios and the younger maniakes looked at each other neither of them felt like meeting the elder maniakes eye the younger maniakes did not care for what he feared he saw in his own heart his father was right he hadnt looked far enough ahead when he shouted out his protest the elder maniakes laughed again this time long and deep and thats why symvatios and i well stay back here on the island and give the two of you good advice while youre doing the hard dirty work itll take to throw down genesios how many men and ships can we realize from the island his son asked like the elder maniakes the younger yielded points by changing the subject in terms of numbers i cant begin to guess until i go through the records and see just whats spread out in the harbor and garrisons the elder maniakes answered in terms of what we can do with what we have my guess is that it amounts to this well get enough here to begin the job but not enough to finish it if all the top soldiers and sailors in the empire decide theyd rather see genesios on the throne than you youre a dead man were all dead men from the news that trickles out to kalavria videssos is liable to be a dead empire if they decide that the younger maniakes said which doesnt mean it wont happen his father told him if men werent fools so often the world would be a different placemaybe even a better one but skotos pulls on us no less than phos sometimes i wonder if the balancer heretics of khatrish and thatagush dont have a pointhow can you be sure phos will triumph in the end he held out his arms the palms of his hands out before him as if fending off his kinsmen im sorry i brought that up dont start arguing dogma with me now like so many theologymad videssians or well never get back to the residence rhegorios said i dont know whether our generals and ship captains are fools but i can name two men who arent sharbaraz king of kings and his brotherinlaw abivard his chief general thats true the two maniakai said in the same breath the elder went on and it was thanks to the infinite wisdom of likinios that we helped put sharbaraz back on the throne of mashiz and gave abivard the chance to show what he could do do to us i should say no the two of them arent fools the younger maniakes agreed that means just one thing if were going to keep them from swallowing up all the westlandsmaybe even keep them from swallowing up all the empire of videssoswed better not be fools either lysia strode rapidly through the courtyard now going almost to one of the doors that led to the mansion now coming straight back to the younger maniakes at last she stopped in front of him and burst out i wish i were going with you he took his first cousins hands in his i wish you were too he said ill miss you nothing like living in each others belt pouches for the last halfdozen years to make us friends is there she shook her head im sickjealous of my brother do you know that all at once she hugged maniakes and im worried more than i can say for you do you know that his arms went around her back it will work out all right i think he said we have a good chance of winning else wed not so much as try as he spoke he noticed maybe for the first time with the top part of his mind that not all his feelings for lysia were chaste and cousinly she was without any possibility of doubt a woman in his arms lysias eyes widened slightly had his arms around her tightened more than they usually did he didnt think so was she feeling some of the same things he was he didnt know or know how to ask if she was was this the first time for her he couldnt begin to guess in a small shaken voice she said phos grant that it be as you wish may your bride be safe in videssos the city and may the two of you pass many glad years together she pulled away from him with a forefinger she drew the good gods sunsign over her heart maniakes imitated the gesture may it be so he said he made a wry face if i dont go down to the ships now theyre liable to sail without me he laughed to show that was a joke down at the harbor his father would have had liquid fire flung at any ships that proposed to sail without him not that any would have lysia nodded and turned away if she was crying maniakes told himself he didnt want to see he turned walked out of the courtyard and headed for the doorway that led out of the governors mansion he had already said his goodbyes to rotrude and atalarikhos he was not surprised though when he found her waiting by the door with their son he was fond of the boy he scooped him up kissed him mashed him in a hug and set him down then he embraced rotrude and kissed her for what would probably be the last time atalarikhos grabbed them both by the legs if there was going to be any hugging going on he wanted to be included in it be bold rotrude said be bold and you will be safe if you think too much of safety it will escape you she spoke matteroffactly maniakes wondered if he was entitled to draw omens from her words haloga magic was often so lowkey that a videssian used to showier sorcery would hardly notice it was there omen or not he thought she had given him good advice and said so though you leave me though you go to another still i wish you well and i have no thought of revenge she answered from one of haloga blood that was as great a concession as a videssians yielding a doctrinal point he nodded to show he understood ill miss you he said he rumpled atalarikhos hair dark like his own but straight like rotrudes ill miss both of you now i have to go rotrude nodded she kept her face very still haloga women reckoned public tears as great a disgrace as did the northern men if she cried after he was gone no one would know but her pillow maniakes opened the door closed it after him one book of his life had just ended as he took his first steps down toward the harbor he began to unroll the papyrus of a brandnew book ships filled the harbor almost every warship kalavria boasted was tied up alongside one of the piers only a handful of vessels remained in the north to defend against piratical inroads from khatrish or thatagush or agder or even distant halogaland with all the empire of videssos at stake kalavria would have to fend for itself at the moment with warships jamming the docks the fishing boats that normally moored there had been forced aside most of them were out to sea now trying to feed not only kastavalas usual populace but also the influx of sailors and soldiers who had come into town with the ships when evening came and the fishing boats returned to harbor they had to beach themselves if a big storm blew in kastavala would go hungryand genesios would no longer need to fear rebellion from out of the east maniakes walked down from the governors residence toward the harbor only a few weeks before he and rhegorios had made that same walk to see what news the incoming merchantman might bring neither dreamed the news would pitch them headlong into a revolt that just moments before the elder maniakes had dismissed as hopeless people stared at the younger maniakes as he strode through the streets of kastavala he had had to endure a certain amount of that for years the townsfolk were always curious about what the governors son was doing but he was no longer merely governors son thou conquerest maniakes avtokrator someone called to him he waved acknowledgment that call came again and again it was premature as he knew full well only after the ecumenical patriarch had anointed him and crowned him at the high temple in videssos the city would he formally become avtokrator of the videssians but he did not fret his wellwishers with formalism if he did not soon become avtokrator he would die he had no middle ground left not anymore the streets no longer swarmed with sailors as they had since the maniakai summoned to kastavala such might as kalavria possessed now the seamen were down by the ships if the wind held they would sail later today nothing would be easy the younger maniakes had assumed that easier to adjust for things going better than planned than for worse for the first time in more than five years the spear that had held up hosios head as a warning to those who would oppose genesios no longer stood at the harbor maniakes had ordered it brought aboard his flagship not everyone had loved likinios and his clan but they gained virtue by comparison with what had replaced them maniakes could and would claim to be avenging the house of likinios he kicked at the dirt from makuran sharbaraz king of kings trumpeted the same claim even maniakes who knew better had wondered whether the videssian in imperial raiment whom sharbaraz kept in his retinue might somehow miraculously be hosios son of likinios he might have accepted the pretender as genuine simply to rid videssos of genesios now phos be praised he did not have to worry about that dreadful choice he had renamed the strongest warship in the fleet the renewal in hope of what he would bring to videssos the city in the fleet at the key though the renewal would have been no more than a middling vessel and in the fleet at videssos the city less than that he and all his kinsmen knew their revolt would fail if the empires naval forces did not join them maniakes refused to let himself think of failure he strode toward the renewal acknowledging salutes as he came the hierarch of kastavala gorgeous in a robe of clothofgold with a blue circle indicating phos sun stood on the dock by the long lean craft chanting prayers to the good god to bring it safely through the upcoming fight behind him two lesser clerics in plainer robes swung censers perfuming the air with sweet cinnamon and sharp almost bitter myrrh good day holy sir maniakes said bowing to the hierarch good day your majesty the spiritual leader of the town was a skinny elderly man named gregoras whose shaved scalp made him look even more skeletal than he would have otherwise his words were proper but his tone left something to be desired so did the suspicious stare he sent maniakes maniakes sighed he had seen that stare from gregoras before the hierarch had doubts about his orthodoxy his father still worshiped phos after the manner of the vaspurakaners believing the good god had shaped vaspur the first man ahead of all others and that all vaspurakaners were to be reckoned princes on account of their descent from him in videssian eyes that was heresy the younger maniakes had grown up taking it for granted but he had also grown up among videssians who were as passionately sure it was wrong as his father was convinced of its truth now he was certain of only one thing if he wanted to wear the avtokrators red boots and rule videssos he would have to satisfy not just the ecumenical patriarch but also the people of his orthodoxy he could not afford to have genesios scream from the housetops that he was a heretic he stretched his hands up toward the sun and recited we bless thee phos lord with the great and good mind by thy grace our protector watchful beforehand that the great test of life be decided in our favor gregoras repeated the creed of phos cult so did the lesser priests and everyone who heard maniakes prayer that did not stop the hierarch from giving him another suspicious glower vaspurakaners recited the creed in the same way as those who followed what the videssians called orthodoxy but grudgingly gregoras decided not to make an issue of it he stretched up his hands once more saying may the lord with the great and good mind bless you and all the men who sail with you may you travel in victory and may you restore to videssos the glory of which she has been too long deprived so may it be so may it be maniakes echoed thank you holy sir even a prelate as sternly orthodox as gregoras was willing not to inquire too closely into the younger maniakes beliefs for that simple reason that genesios while also orthodox was vile enough to embarrass those who agreed with him no less than those who did not maniakes walked over the gangplank from the pier to the deck of the renewal the men at the oars and the rest of the sailors raised a cheer for him so did kourikos and triphylles at his fathers suggestion maniakes had split the grandees from the capital among several ships he had told them he didnt want them all lost in one disaster which had some truth in it more important though he did not want them plotting among themselves a sailor with a long straight bronze trumpet strode up to maniakes and waited expectantly he looked around the harbor as far as he could see all the ships were ready he nodded to the trumpeter the man took a deep breath and raised the horn to his lips his cheeks puffed out like the throat sac of a chirping frog the blast he blew meant only one thing we begin sailors undid lines from the docks then jumped back into their vessels oarmasters shouted out the stroke grunting the bigshouldered hardhanded men at the oars rose from their benches stroked sat again the seats of their breeches were lined with leather to keep them from wearing through to the flesh in short order the renewal pulled away from the dock she pitched slightly in the light chop maniakes hadnt done much sailing since his journey to kalavria having the deck shift under his feet made him nervous it put him in mind of the queasy way the ground shook during an earthquake but an earthquake soon stopped while this went on and on he did what he had done when likinios sent his clan into their genteel exile he pretended he was not standing but on horseback that helped keep his stomach happy they had hardly got out of bowshot of the pier when a sailor dashed to the rail and hung onto it for dear life his head thrust far out over the side his comrades jeered at him maniakes would have thought him too busy puking to notice but when he came up he said there thats done now phos willing im good for the rest of the voyage to keep their stroke the rowers began a raucous song maniakes grinned in recognition foot soldiers sang about the little bird with the yellow bill while they were marching oarsmen while they were rowing he wondered if accountants used the same ditty to help them keep their records straight down to the last copper the song seemed to have as many verses as it did singers the rowers version included a good many maniakes hadnt heard before like those the foot soldiers sang though a lot of them had the little bird doing some very salty things indeed glancing over at kourikos maniakes decided accountants didnt sing about the little bird while they pushed pens over parchment the logothete of the treasury plainly had never imagined let alone been subjected to singing like this beneath its swarthiness his face was almost as green as that of the sailor who had vomited when the renewal was leaving its berth at the pier he walked up to kourikos and said the men are in high spirits today dont you think eminent sir eryes your majesty the logothete answered as bravely as he could he was a spindly little man so much so that the loud lewd words of the song almost had him literally staggering most uh exuberant his effort to show enthusiasm left maniakes ashamed of teasing him he turned to face the bow of the renewal the wind blew out of the west running its fingers through his beard and flipping his hair back from his forehead he said they wont stay exuberant if the winds against us all the way to opsikion thats a long hard pull across the open sea it can be done though kourikos sounded anxious oh yes maniakes said even a he shut up even a lubber like me knows that much he had started to say kourikos exhaled sharply he might not know much about sailing but he had had no trouble supplying the words maniakes had omitted scowling at himself far more than at his prospective fatherinlaw maniakes looked back over his shoulder at kalavria receding in the distance the harbor and town of kastavala passed out of view before the governors residence on the height in back of them idly maniakes wondered why that was so the mages at the sorcerers collegium in videssos the city had all sorts of arcane knowledge maybe if he took the city he would ask them no when i take the city he corrected himself when above maniakes head the wool sail flapped and billowed in the fitful breeze the wind had swung round from west to south letting the fleet from kalavria sail at a reach by now maniakes took no notice of the sails noise all that mattered to him was the dark green line that divided sky from sea in the west the highlands above opsikion as kalavria had vanished over the horizon so the mainland appeared above it the first maniakes saw of opsikion itself was the sun glittering off the gilded globes of its temples that flash told any incoming seaman he was approaching a town of the videssian empire next to videssos the city opsikion was unimpressive next to kastavala it was a metropolis unlike kastavala a formidable stone wall ringed it round the wild khamorth horsemen had raided farther south than this back in the days a century and a half before when they spilled off the pardrayan plain and overran great stretches of the videssian eastlands towns hereabouts needed walls these days the khamorth had formed themselves into three groups that functioned more or less as nations khatrish nearest opsikion and aptest at aping videssian ways thatagush to the north of khatrish whose borders did not march with those of videssos and kubrat south of the astris and touching the videssian sea the kubratoi whatever deficiencies they had from the standpoint of civilization were monstrously good at warand alarmingly close to videssos the city maniakes watched the commotion in the harbor of opsikion as lookouts spied the approaching fleet all the ships from kalavria flew the videssian banner a gold sunburst on blue but he did not blame the soldiers and marines for showing alarm even so for one thing pirates could mimic the videssian emblem and seek to use it to approach with impunity for another a fleets being videssian these days did not have to mean it was friendly if opsikions own fleet held its loyalty to genesios then maniakes galleys and transports were anything but friendly the captain of the renewal was a middleaged man named thrax he was striking to look at he had gone gray young and the sun had bleached that gray to glistening silver while baking his skin brown as bread coming up to maniakes he asked your majesty shall we lower the mast and ready for combat shall we signal the rest of the fleet to do likewise as commander of the flagship he was in effect drungarios of the fleet maniakes considered then shook his head he pointed in toward the harbor they dont look to be sallying everything they have against us in fact only a couple of small craft neither one a match for the renewal were putting to sea signal our vessels to have all in readiness to brail sails and lower masts but not to do it until i give the order or until the renewal is attacked as for what we do here we go forward and parley show the whitepainted truce shield at the bow aye your majesty thrax looked incompletely happy but turned and loudly relayed maniakes commands to the crew the renewal glided forward over the graygreen water the small ships from out of opsikion approached startlingly fast thin across the sea came a questioning hail who comes to opsikion with such a fleet and for what purpose maniakes hurried to the bow standing by the truce shield he cupped both hands in front of his mouth and shouted i come maniakes son of maniakes avtokrator of the videssians for the purpose of casting the murderous infamous bloodthirsty wild beast genesios down from the throne he has drenched with the gore of slaughtered innocents there it was done if the officers on opsikion had been unaware rebellion was brewing on kalavria they were no more maniakes added with whom do i speak for a couple of minutes no one answered him from either of the ships then a man resplendent in a gleaming chainmail shirt came to the bow of one of them wearing armor at sea was a risky business if you went over the side you drowned the fellow said i am domentziolos tourmarkhos here the garrison commander maniakes thought he must have been down by the waterfront to have boarded ship so quickly what say you domentziolos maniakes demanded thou conquerest maniakes avtokrator domentziolos shouted in a great voice the men aboard his vessel erupted in cheers so did those aboard the other small ship and so did those aboard the renewal maniakes felt giddy almost drunk with relief his force was not large a fight at opsikion could have ruined him even if he won it would have given genesios retainers the idea that maniakes could be vulnerable ideas like that had a way of becoming selffulfilling prophecies if on the other hand everyone joined him against genesios use our harbor use our city as your own domentziolos said wed heard rumors this day might come but knew not how much faith to put in them praise the lord with the great and good mind they prove true maniakes hadnt wanted anyone hearing rumors he supposed fishermen sailing out of kastavala or one of the other kalavrian towns from which he had pulled men and ships had met their counterparts from opsikion on the sea they wouldnt have kept quiet not when they were carrying that kind of news but if opsikion had heard rumors the odds were good that rumors had gone on to videssos the city and to the ear of genesios will the hypasteos of the town grant us the same welcome you have excellent domentziolos maniakes asked civil officials outranked soldiers in the administrative hierarchy not least to make rebellions by provincial commanders harder likinios had sent the elder maniakes a general to govern kalavria but kalavria was both far from the heart of the empire and subject to attack by pirates divided authority there would have been dangerous in any normal circumstances an avtokrator had little reason to fear revolt from kalavria if likinios or hosios still lived the maniakai would have lived out their days on the island old samosates hes over there in the other ship yelling for you fit to burst domentziolos pointed his vessel had drawn close enough to the renewal for maniakes to see his teeth skin back in a sharks grin besides if he werent for you your majesty wed soon fix that the lads and i in normal times a local commander did not casually talk about disposing of the town administrator appointed by the emperor civil war though changed all the rules maniakes wasnt shocked as he would have been in peacetime he was delighted splendid excellent domentziolos he said he had no idea whether domentziolos deserved to be called excellent and didnt care if the officer wasnt a noble but performed well in the fighting ahead he would earn the title with which maniakes was honoring him now maniakes went on well land infantry and cavalry here to move overland against genesios while the fleet along with your own flotilla sails round the cape and up toward the key he waited to see how domentziolos would take that if the captain was dissembling he would not want opsikion to yield tamely to maniakes men he might suddenly decide to fight or he might cast about for excuses to delay the entry of maniakes force into the town or to have the soldiers camp outside but he said by the good god your majesty come at the usurper every way you can ive sent up enough prayers that someone worthwhile would rise against him if you want em youll have hundreds of men from the soldiery here whod love to march with you not with me maniakes answered i lead the fleet my cousin rhegorios will command the soldiers that made domentziolos grin all over again who would have thought a man of vaspurakaner blood anything but a land soldier yet you have the right of it your majesty your fight will be won or lost on the sea my thought exactly maniakes turned toward the other ship eminent samosates a man who was as gray as maniakes father and bald to boot came to the bow of the vessel aye your majesty he called how may i serve you his voice was not only wary but mushy as well he couldnt have had many teeth left by yielding up your city and all its supplies to me maniakes answered since youve named me your sovereign you cannot object to that samosates was perfectly capable of objecting and maniakes knew it full well a recalcitrant hypasteos or even a reluctant one would make his stay here more difficult the bureaucrats of opsikion would take their cue from their leader and could make nuisances of themselves by nothing more than obstructing supplies separating malice from simple incompetence was never easy but samosates seemed suddenly to catch fire the city and everything within it are yours he cried dig up genesios bones to the ice with the usurper may his head filled only with thoughts of blood go up on the milestone the hypasteos bowed to maniakes i am your man he certainly was after he had publicly reviled genesios the only thing he could expect from the avtokrator now sitting in videssos the city was the headsmans sword he had made his choice and he had made it plain for a bureaucrat that was a miracle of decisiveness maniakes turned to thrax make signal to the fleet that we are to tie up in the harbor of opsikion aye your majesty thrax said and gave the order to his trumpeter notes rang across the water the trumpeters in the nearest ships picked them up and relayed them to those positioned farther out on the wings thrax spoke two other words and the trumpeter relayed them too maintain caution excellent maniakes thumped thrax on the back if they have something nasty in mind he shook his head you dont get old in this business taking people for granted but the opsikianoi all seemed as delighted as domentziolos and samosates to welcome maniakes and his sailors and soldiers of course taverners threw their doors wide and tarts promenaded in their skimpiest and filmiest outfits they had profits to make but carpenters and cobblers farmers and fishermen vied with one another to greet the newcomers to buy them a glass of wine or bread smeared with seaurchin paste and crushed garlic to maniakes that said one thing everybody hated genesios had everyone admired the ruler in the capital he would have had to fight his way into the town had feelings been mixed he might have got into opsikion without a fight but houses and shops would have stayed shuttered against his men as things were he worried only that his men would be so taken by the place that they wouldnt care to leave samosates put him rhegorios and the grandees from videssos the city up in his own residence in the center of town not far from the chief temple to phos the redtiled building housed not only him but several hundred years of the records of opsikion servants hastily carried wooden boxes stuffed with old scrolls out of bedchambers to make room for the noble guests that affected maniakes himself not at all he got the chief guest suite with rhegorios installed alongside him supper was tuna and squid and mussels much as it might have been back in kastavala the wine was better here when samosates noticed maniakes thought well of it he made sure his servitors kept the wouldbe emperors cup full as more servants cleared away the supper dishes the hypasteos asked how long will you stay in opsikion your majesty maniakes had drunk himself happy but he hadnt drunk himself foolish a few days to ready the land forces to move west and to join your local ships here to our fleet he answered how many a few may be i dont quite know and if he had known he wouldnt have told samosates the fewer people who were privy to his plans the fewer who could pass those plans to genesios but samosates said i quite understand your majesty i was just thinking that since rumor of your rebellion to which phos grant success had reached us here it might well have traveled on to videssos the city that being so you would be well advised to look to your own safety while you are here dyou think genesios could have sent assassins out so soon maniakes asked he too had worried about rumors spread west from opsikion your own valiant strength your majesty should be protection and to spare against mere assassins samosates said maniakes knew that was polite nonsense he wondered if the hypasteos did too evidently so for samosates went on i was not thinking so much of knives in the night as of wizardry from afar have you brought with you accomplished mages to ward against such danger ive brought a couple of men from kastavala the best the island of kalavria can boast maniakes answered he knew he sounded uneasy against the best of videssos the city those wizards might be a couple of coppers matched against goldpieces id not expected to need much in the way of sorcerous protection until i reached the key if then he turned to the grandees fled from the capital how say you eminent sirs excellent sirs has genesios still strong sorcerers who will do his bidding triphylles said your majesty i fear he does just this past spring philetos the mintmaster died of a wasting sickness that shrank him from fat man to skeleton in half a months time bare days before hed taken ill hed called genesios a bloodthirsty fool outside the mint someone must have overheard and taken word back to the tyrant he has mages or at least one maniakes agreed eminent samosates what sort of wizards does opsikion possess our best is a man who commonly calls himself alvinos for fear his true name would ring harshly in videssian ears the hypasteos replied he was however given at birth the appellation bagdasares a vaspurakaner by the good god maniakes exclaimed happily send for him this instant samosates called to a retainer the man hurried away maniakes sipped more wine and waited for the wizard to arrive the nobles from videssos the city kept up a desultory conversation with samosates they tried to act as if they thought him their equal but could not quite manage to seem convincing better they hadnt bothered pretending maniakes thought after about half an hour the servitor returned with bagdasares sometimes called alvinos sure enough he had the stocky build and heavy features common in those who sprang from vaspurakan he was younger than maniakes had expected probably younger than maniakes himself your majesty he cried and went down in a full proskynesis when he returned to his feet he rattled off several sentences in the throaty vaspurakaner language that left maniakes embarrassed slowly please i beg he said his own words halting i have little of this tongue i fear my father and mother spoke it when they did not want me to understand what they said after my mother died my father spoke it seldom videssian goes better in my mouth bagdasares shrugged he returned to the language of the empire my children they will be the same your majesty we are a small drop of ink and videssos a big pail of water but now phos who made the princes first willing you want to give all the empire the coloring of that ink the grandees from the capital muttered back and forth behind their hands samosates drummed his fingers on the polished oak of the tabletop seldom was heresy spoken so openly in a hypasteos hall heads swung toward maniakes to hear how he would respond if he espoused heresy too he would cost himself supportnot among the grandees who were too committed to abandon him for genesios but from simpler more pious folk to whom word of what he said would surely spread perhaps with exaggerations for effect to bagdasares he replied i fear most of the coloring has already bleached out of me what the videssians call orthodoxy suits me well enough he wondered if the wizard would rail at him for abandoning the doctrines of his forefathers but bagdasares shrugged again i know many others from among our folk who share your views some of them are good men some bad as is true of any other group i do not condemn them out of hand good maniakes said with genuine relief only later would he wonder why a wizards view should matter to an avtokrator he wasnt used to being avtokrator not yet to business he declared can you protect me against whatever spells genesios mages may hurl from videssos the city i think i can your majesty bagdasares answered theyll be stronger sorcerers than i you understand but ill be far closer to you which also matters in struggles thaumaturgic in these matters you are the expert maniakes said soldiers as you know have little to do with magic and for good reason too the wizard said the stress and passion of the battlefield make sorcery too unreliable to be worth using unfortunately however it remains a very useful tool for assassins he preened just a little few young men are without vanity and even fewer can resist the temptation to show off as a result of which consideration you have engaged my services exactly so maniakes said i am now going to seek my bedchamber for the night will you come with me and do what you can to make it safe against whatever sorceries genesios can send against me your majesty i will if you will excuse me for one small moment bagdasares ducked out into the hall he returned with a stout wooden case with brass fittings dipping his head to maniakes he said now i am ready to rally to your cause your majesty as well expect a swordsmith to beat out blades with no hammer or anvil as a wizard to work magic without his tools again i yield to your expertise maniakes nodded to samosates if a servant will be so kind as to show me to my chamber in videssos the city the room would have been reckoned spare it had bed table stools a chamber pot and a chest of drawers but no ornamentation save an icon of phos for opsikion it was surely good enough bagdasares beamed when he saw the icon the good gods protection will make mine more effective he said even if the image is undoubtedly the work of a videssian heretic half grinning he glanced over at maniakes for his reaction maniakes was convinced the wizard was trying to get a rise out of him and held his peace bagdasares chuckled then stalked about the bedchamber muttering to himself sometimes in videssian more often in the vaspurakaners native tongue at last he seemed to remember his client and that said client claimed the throne of the empire of videssos and deserved to know what was going on he said your majesty this will not be a difficult room to seal you have but one door one window two mouseholes that i found and one small hole in the roof probably under a broken tile seal those sorcerously and nothing can get in to trouble you oh perhaps the mages in videssos the city may try to shake down this whole building on your head but at this distance i do not think they would succeed though i may be wrong maniakes wished the wizard hadnt added that qualifying phrase bagdasares walked up and down the bedchamber whistling tunelessly between his teeth as he contemplated what needed doing he began at the window from his box he took what seemed to maniakes an ordinary ball of twine he used a knife to cut off two lengths of it one of which he stretched across the window frame from side to side the other from top to bottom when he pointed a finger at them and spoke imperiously in vaspurakaner the two pieces of twine stayed where they were without pins or tacks to hold them in place bagdasares muttered a spell in videssian the vertical string burst into gold flame the horizontal into blue both so bright that for a moment maniakes dazzled turned his head to one side when he looked back to the window the strings had vanished excellent bagdasares said in selfsatisfied tones that window is well and truly sealed against unwelcome intrusion from without whether physical or sorcerous the morning breeze will get in but nothing more thats what i want maniakes said bagdasares proceeded to treat both mouseholes in the same fashion he grinned at maniakes showing white white teeth in the midst of his tangled black beard the chamber should be clear of vermin for some time to come your majestyit would take sorcery to get them inside now this is a strenuous way to keep a room free from mice and rats but no less effective on account of that he wiped sweat from his forehead with the sleeve of his robe any sorcery was strenuous had it been easier the arts of the empire of videssos would have been altogether different with magecraft supplanting mechanic skills in areas as diverse as farming and forgery but sorcerous talent was rare and its application limited by the mental and physical strength of the operator bagdasares clambered up onto a stool and sealed the hole in the roof if it rains your majesty i think this chamber will not leak there but i should be reluctant to take oath on it he said i will swear however that nothing worse than rain can enter by this path very good maniakes said i always enjoy watching a fine craftsman at work whatever his craft may be competence is not so common that we can take it for granted you have spoken truth your majesty and i thank you for the compliment bagdasares descended from his perch and turned toward the door he rubbed his chin here the problem is not so simple as it is with windows and incidental openings you must be free to go in and out of the chamber and so must not only your proper comrades but alsoi assumethe servants of this establishment he waited for maniakes to nod then went on at the same time we must prevent evil influences from gaining entry a complex problem would you not agree he did not wait to learn whether maniakes agreed or disagreed he walked over to the doorway this time he set two lengths of twine across it and three that reached up from floor to lintel his first incantation seemed to maniakes identical to that which he had used before the upper piece of horizontal twine flared blue the central vertical piece gold thus the sealing spell bagdasares said now to modify it a cantrip of my own invention i am proud to say the cantrip was in the guttural vaspurakaner language every so often maniakes would hear a word or phrase he knew but while he seized it the rest of the spell would flow on past him then bagdasares shouted an invocation his father often used in the name of vaspur firstborn among mankind he smiled to recognize that but failed to follow what bagdasares wanted the eponymous founder of the vaspurakaner folk to do till that invocation the extra pieces of twine had remained in their former condition after it though they too began to glow not so brightly as the other two had but with soft lights of their own the additional horizontal piece shone a darker more nearly purple blue than that of the videssian colors to either side of the vertical that had flared golden the others gleamed one red the other orange ah bagdasares rubbed his hands all is as it should be your majesty you and your comrades and the servitors of this house may enter and leave as you see fit but no one elseand no evil influence shall enter with anyone so far as my skill can prevent i thank you very much maniakes said though he could not know for certain he had formed the opinion that bagdasares skill was considerable have you also protection for me when i am not in my chamber aye i can give you some your majesty though my guess is that genesios mage if any there be would strike in dead of night when he was most nearly certain of your location still in your boots id not trust a wizards guess that i wouldnt bagdasares chuckled he rummaged in his box and pulled out an amuleta rayed golden sundisk on a cord of braided blue and gold string he turned the disk over to show maniakes a redbrown stone set into the back hematite your majesty or bloodstone as its sometimes called having an affinity to blood it will draw the magic that would otherwise spill yours if you feel the disk grow hot against your skin you are under assault it will not long withstand the stronger sorceries so seek a mages aid as fast as you can maniakes bent his head and let bagdasares slip the cord around his neck pure gold he said judging by the weight of it the wizard nodded i shall repay it weight for weight in coin over and above your fee maniakes told him have no fear about that bagdasares said the fee includes the gold in the amulet he clapped a hand to his mouth looking comically aggrieved with himself i shouldnt have told you that should i i just cost myself some money thats what you get for being an honest man maniakes laughed if youre a true son of vaspur a true prince i suspect youll show a profit anyhow i suspect youre right your majesty bagdasares replied unabashed going up against these grasping readyforaught videssians an honest vaspurakaner needs all the cunning he can come up with by every indication the wizard had enough and to spare he closed his wooden chest bowed to maniakes and left the chamber a few minutes later samosates voice floated down the hall are you there your majesty aye im here maniakes called to the hypasteos whats toward i was just wondering if while you were in opsikion you would samosates got up to the door and started to come through it the way seemed openand bagdasares had gone outbut the hypasteos might have run headlong into a fence a flash of light came from the open air whats this he cried and tried again with no better luck suspicion flared in maniakes bagdasares had vowed his spell would keep evil influences from entering the chamber and now samosates could not come in then maniakes remembered who was allowed into the roomin the mages own words himself his comrades and the servitors in the hypasteos residence samosates did not fall into any of those groups chuckling maniakes said send one of your men after bagdasares eminent sir he cant have gone far yet and his magic turned out to be a bit too literal he explained what he thought the mage had done samosates did not see the humor in it samosates maniakes guessed did not see the humor in a lot of things when bagdasares returned he was laughing he chanted in front of the door for a few heartbeats then bent his stocky frame in a bow to the hypasteos try now eminent sir i beg of you he said cautiously samosates stepped forward and into maniakes room bagdasares waved and left again what were you wondering before bagdasares protective magic so rudely interrupted you eminent sir maniakes asked in tones as sympathetic as he could manage i havent the foggiest notion samosates still sounded flustered he snapped his fingers either in annoyance or to jar the vagrant memory loose ah i have it i was about to ask if you intended to review the garrison here in opsikion before incorporating it into your own forces i dont think that will be necessary though i thank you for the notion maniakes answered diligently keeping his face straight people who werent in the habit of using troops to fight put great stock in reviews and other ceremonial maniakes was of the opinion that putting men into action did a better job of testing them samosates looked disappointed maybe he had wanted to see troops all gathered together and glittering in armor if so he had no business being in a post as important as that of opsikions hypasteos maniakes shrugged he would worry about such administrative changes later afterand ifhe effected a considerably greater one himself doleful still samosates left when rhegorios knocked on the door he had no trouble passing through it as bagdasares had promised he had given maniakes companions full access to his chamber how soon will you be able to go on the march cousin maniakes demanded and how many men from opsikions garrison will you take west with you whew rhegorios leaned forward as if into a headwind you are in a hurry arent you i begrudge every minute here maniakes said the longer we stay in any one place the longer genesios has to plan deviltry against me whether by magic or simply by assassins knife a moving target is harder to hit how fast will be we be able to get moving again our men and horses are all unloaded rhegorios said thats taken care of i think we can add a couple of thousand warriors from the local forces without leaving opsikion in any great danger from a raid out of khatrish all that is as it should be couldnt be better in fact but maniakes asked there must be a but or you would have answered all my question not just part of it rhegorios sighed phos grant mercy to the first fellow who tries to sneak anything past you once you take the throneyoull give the wretch a thin time of it we have men and horses aplenty but a shortage of supply wagons we cant very well sail our merchantmen along the southern slopes of the paristrian mountains the opsikianoi have wains enough for their own purposes but not to keep our whole host fed as we fare west toward videssos the city a pestilence maniakes muttered under his breath no one who wasnt a soldier save perhaps a farmer whose fields had just been ravaged ever thought about all it took to keep an armyessentially a city on the movesupplied with food equipment and weapons but if you didnt take care of those essentials the army would be in no condition to fight once it got where it was going or else wouldnt get there at all i havent surveyed the town as a whole to see what we can requisition from merchants and such rhegorios said i wanted to get your approval before i started anything like that for i know itll breed ill will do it anyhow maniakes said well make their losses good as we may if we lose the war goodwill wont matter if we win those who grumble can be brought round aye when you put it like that it makes perfect sense rhegorios scratched his head i wonder if im ruthless enough to make a proper captain maniakes slapped him on the shoulder youll do fine he said you have the straightahead drive the job needs you know how to do things that need doing before long youll see what those things are too he was only a handful of years older than his cousin but had vastly more experience as a commander he felt like some old soldier of his fathers generation heartening a recruit whose beard hadnt fully sprouted ill attend to it then rhegorios said and hurried away the odd illusion maniakes had known went with him rather to his own relief he walked down to the harbor to talk with domentziolos he found the leader of opsikions flotilla closeted with thrax his own naval leader as he walked in on them domentziolos was saying word of your rising must have reached videssos the city by nowgenesios may not be good for much but by phos he can spy with the best of them so his finger stabbed out at a map we should expect to have to fight the fleet from the key not long after we round the cape and head north and west toward the capital aye likely youre right thrax replied and then looked up and saw maniakes he jumped to his feet as did domentziolos good day your majesty good day maniakes answered so the two of you think itll come to a sea fight early do you the prospect worried him if the fleets of the key and videssos the city stayed loyal to genesios he could gather together every other ship in the empire and still lose the war wouldnt be surprised domentziolos said thrax nodded domentziolos went on of course just because the drungarios of a fleet is loyal doesnt mean his captains will be and a captain who flouts his crews wishes will feed fishes if he doesnt know when to ease off you do so much to ease my mind maniakes said dryly which wrung a chuckle from thrax i was hoping to reach the key without having to fight my way there that way the lord with the great and good mind willing we can get some use out of the grandees let them soften up the officers so to speak aye well that would be fine domentziolos allowed no guarantee itll happen though and fair odds it wont all right maniakes said how do we ready ourselves to defeat the keys ships in sea battle domentziolos and thrax looked at each other perhaps because he had been with maniakes since kalavria thrax answered the question your majesty if the fleet is there in full force and loyal to genesios we wont defeat it maniakes winced then gave thrax a formal military salute setting his right fist over his heart i am grateful for your frankness i shall remember and reward you for it too many avtokrators have gone down to ruin i think because no one had the courage to tell them a simple but painful truth likinios would still be avtokrator today and we would have no need of rebellion had someone only warned him he was mad to order troops to winter north of the astris domentziolos glanced over at thrax again and then with dawning wonder at maniakes your majesty he said may i also speak plainly you had better maniakes answered all right then domentziolos said but even after maniakes urging he hesitated before going on truth of it is your majesty i was bound and determined to back any man with the stomach to rise against genesios for i think its as plain as his ugly face on our goldpieces these days that hes dragging the empire straight down to skotos ice but hearing you talk now i begin to hope youre not just someone whos better than genesiosthere are as many men answering to that as grains of sand by the seabut someone who may turn out to be good in his own right if you take my meaning phos grant it be so maniakes said and sketched the good gods sunsign over his heart you had better be good in your own right thrax said for if youre not sharbaraz king of kings wont leave much of videssos for you to rule i know maniakes answered i know that all too well he was vigorous half a dozen years ago when my father and i helped restore him to his throne hes grown since then i hope i have too now domentziolos murmured phos grant it be so whats worst is that i cant yet worry about sharbaraz maniakes said till genesios is out of the way the king of kings and i dont impinge on each other not directly he shook his head funny to think of genesios as sharbarazs buffer against me but thats what he is among other things he unlaced the mouth of a leather pouch he wore on his belt and fumbled in it till he found a goldpiece of genesios the current ruler in videssos the city had a triangular face wide at the forehead and narrow at the chin with a long nose and a thin fringe of beard so the coin proclaimed at any rate maniakes had never met the man it pictured but he was willing to believe it gave an accurate portrayal of genesios it certainly looked nothing like the images on the goldpieces minted during the reign of likinios hes not that ugly maniakes said sliding the coin back into the pouch not on the outside anyhow if only he had some wit inside that head of his he sighed but he doesnt he rules by spies and murder nothing else and its not enough people fear him but they hate him too and wont always do his bidding even when a particular order isnt bad in and of itself someone should have cast him down long ago thrax growled no doubt maniakes answered but the soldiers werent the only ones who rejoiced to see likinios head go up on a pike hed taxed the peasants and merchants and artisans to pay for his wars so genesios got goodwill he wouldnt have had otherwise and then when people began to see what he was he put down the first few revolts so savagely that everyone had second thoughts about rebelling and they knew that if videssian fought videssian the only one who gained would be sharbaraz domentziolos suggested maniakes pursed his lips id like to believe that and i hope it does hold true every now and again but you know i have vaspurakaner blood and heritage and i sometimes see videssos from outside as it were i speak without intending offense but to my way of looking at things a whole great host of videssians care for themselves first their faction next and after that if they have any caring left over they think about the empire the lord with the great and good mind knows id like to say youre wrong your majesty but i fear youre right thrax said the civil war of a century and a half ago proves that twin boys born to the empress with neither one willing to admit he was the younger and so because neither would set aside the wearing of the red boots they tore the empire apart they almost put it in its grave too maniakes said savagely they were so busy fighting each other they emptied the frontier fortresses and the khamorth swarmed into our lands and even then ive heard it said both greedy fools hired the nomads as mercenaries to bolster their own forces domentziolos gave him a sly look are you saying your majesty that vaspurakaners dont have faction fights if that be so why is the princes land divided between videssos and makuran its not thrax said thanks to genesios blundering sharbaraz holds the whole of it these days we have faction fights aplenty clan against clan maniakes said thats often how warriors from vaspurakan come to videssos they lose to their rivals in the next valley and have to flee their homes but war inside a single clan no we see that but seldom thrax ran a hand through his silvery hair to bring things back to where they were if when we round the cape we find the fleet of the key awaiting us and if it still cleaves to genesios what then do we fight till were slaughtered or do we try to flee back to kalavria i see no other choices for us maniakes gnawed at his underlip but was again grateful to his admiral for framing things so starkly we fight he said at last if we flee theyd follow and lay kalavria waste and wed get cleaner ends dying in battle than we would were genesios to take us prisoner aye well youre not wrong about that domentziolos said i hear hes imported a torturer from mashiz there if nowhere else sharbaraz is willing to lend him aid that news hadnt got to kalavria maniakes said heavily i wish it hadnt got here either maniakes worked like a mule readying both the combined fleets of kalavria and opsikion and the cavalry rhegorios would command for their separate pushes on videssos the city that the fleet had no certainty of successand indeed was sure to fail if opposed by the full might of genesios navyonly made him work harder as if his efforts could of themselves magically transmute defeat into triumph in the few hours he grudged to his bed he slept like a corpse several of samosates serving women were young and pretty more than one intimated she might be persuaded to do more on that bed than change its linen he ignored all such offers partly out of respect for kourikos feelings but even more because he was simply too tired to take advantage of them after a while the serving women stopped dropping hints he caught them talking about him behind their hands evidently their regard for his masculinity had taken a beating that would have infuriated some men he found it laughable the womens mockery would not make his prowess suffer not long before the fleet was to sail south toward the cape he awoke in darkness he stared around certain someone had rapped at the door whos there he called reaching for his sword midnight visitors seldom brought good news no one answered maniakes frowned had one of his officers needed to report some catastrophe the man would have kept knocking a skulking assassin on the other hand he shook his head an assassin would not have knocked whom did that leave a serving woman perhaps bent on revenge for being spurned it came as close to making sense as anything he could think of then the rapping came again maniakes head whipped around for the sound was not at the door this time but at the window the shutters were open to let in cool night air if anyone or anything stood at that window he should have been able to see it he saw nothing and no one the hair prickled up at the back of his neck he sketched phos suncircle over his heart then clutched at the amulet bagdasares had given him he could guess what that rapping was likely to be magic from the capital probing at the defenses the vaspurakaner mage had set up around him and if it found a weak spothe wanted to rise from his bed and flee the chamber reason though told him that was the worst thing he could do here he lay in the center of all of bagdasares wards if he ran from the sorcery prying at those wards he would but leave himself more vulnerable to it but holding still while being hunted came no easier for him than it did for a hare crouching in a thicket as hounds howled outside another round of rapping began this time on the ceiling maniakes remembered the hole bagdasares had found and hoped he hadnt missed any when nothing dreadful happened he decided bagdasares hadnt before he could begin to relax though a mouse burst out of its hole and ran squeaking across the floor its little nails ticking over boards maniakes had forgotten about the mouseholes bagdasares he remembered had not his respect for the wizard grew so did his fear some stronger magic had forced the mouse through the wards and into his room the rapping sound came from each mousehole in turn like the rest of the openings into maniakes chamber the mouseholes proved well and truly sealed maniakes pulled up the blankets and got ready to go back to sleep certain now that genesios mage had been thwarted reflecting later on what was liable to happen to a mage of genesios who failed in his task he realized he had been naive a shape appeared in the window how much of that shape sprung from his own imagination and how much from the sending out of videssos the city he never knew any which way it was quite frightening enough he could see the night sky through it most of it in fact seemed thin as gossamer all but the mouth and the eyes they were plenty to make up for the rest every so often fishermen brought sharks into kastavala along with mackerel and tunny and squid and anchovies their jaws fascinated maniakes two curved saws of perfectly meshing sharpedged teeth any shark that swam in the sea would have envied this creature floating weightlessly outside his window now the things mouth was not very large or rather not open very far for some reason he got the idea it could stretch quite a waysand be lined with teeth from end to end no matter how far it stretched he was glad to take his eyes off that mouth but doing so almost cost him his life when his eyes met those of the creature they were held fast try as he would he could not pull them away in the westlands and in makuran they had lions and even tigers he had hunted lions a time or two and noted their lordly golden stare but a lion with such powers of fascination in its gaze would have drawn in so much prey as to make it too fat even to waddle about caught by a will not his own maniakes rose from his bed and walked toward the window he understood the creature floating out in the darkness had not the power to enter while bagdasares charm remained in place but if he were to sweep that charm aside nothing would keep the creature from coming in and showing him just how wide its jaws could open each step closer to the window came more slowly than the one before as he struggled against the will that fought to turn him to its purpose but each step was made when he reached the windowsill he knew he would brush away the protection bagdasares had set there the lengths of twine or their sorcerous residuum he knew what would happen afterward too but could not bring himself to care a mouse undoubtedly the one disturbed by the prior sorcery of genesios mage ran over his bare foot that broke the spell and startled him just enough for him to tear his eyes away from the creature he staggered back from the window throwing up an arm to shield himself against the deadly gaze outside he heard or thought he heard a bestial shriek of rage it should have brought men running swords and bows in their hands but samosates residence remained quiet and still maybe he hadnt truly heard the rapping that tested his sorcerous defenses either maybe all that like the creature existed only in his mind if so he was convinced his mind had just done its level best to kill him ever so cautiously he glanced toward the window the creature was still out there its eyes probed at him again now though he had its measure he felt the urge to let it into the chamber but the compulsion that had tried to force him to action was gone if naming the mouse a noble would have helped the little creature in any way he would have done it on the spot had genesios wizard not probed at his sorcerous protections before attacking the attack surely would have succeeded maniakes savored the irony of that but he was not safe yet when the creature hanging outside the window realized it could no longer force him to go tamely to destruction it cried out again even louder and more savagely than before it drew back for a moment he thought that meant it was returning to the mage who had sent it forth then it darted toward the window swift as a falcon intent on battering its way through bagdasares wards if it could go no other way when it reached the pane of the window where the vaspurakaner wizard had crossed his pieces of twine blue and gold lightning flared maniakes eyes were briefly blinded a clap of thunder smote his ears he thought the light and noise if not the anguished wail that came from the creature plenty to rouse not just the folk of samosates residence but half the people of opsikion with them but the night remained still and serene maniakes vision cleared without the blinks he would have needed to recover from a veritable lightning bolt as cautious as he had been before he looked toward the window ready to avert his gaze if the creature tried to lure him forward once more he saw no sign of it now of his own volition he advanced to the window he peered out over opsikion in the sky to the west he thought he sensed a fading trail of light that might have led back toward videssos the city although it faded before he was sure hed seen it a dog or two began to bark off in the distance they might have sensed the magic that had sizzled around samosates residence on the other hand they might have smelled or seen a cat maniakes had no way to know all at once he stopped worrying about the dogs a new and urgent question filled his mind was that the end of genesios sorcerous attacks or only the beginning his breath came quick and short as fear filled him from many miles that first assault had nearly breached bagdasares defenses what could another more heartily prepared stroke do he clutched the amulet alvinos bagdasares had given him it did not seem unduly warm which meant the wards had not been penetrated if the wards did fail it was his last line of defense he did not like operating from his last line of defense in war and cared for the idea no more in magecraft nothing happened a gentle night breeze blew into the room carrying the sweet heavy scent of jasmine along with the seaside city stinks of ordure and old fish the ground did not open and swallow samosates residence the sky did not crack and release a horde of winged demons each one fiercer and uglier than the thing that had almost seized him thanks to a mousethats the only reason im here he said wonderingly a mouse he wondered how many great events turned on similar small unrecorded circumstances more than anyone guessed he suspected he gradually began to believe that there would be only one attack in the night of course that might have been a ploy to lull him into a false sense of ease before the next sorcerous storm struck but somehow he did not think soand in any case he was too sleepy to stay on his feet much longer he got back into bed if something comes in and eats me i hope it doesnt wake me first this time he muttered pulling the covers up over his head next thing he knew the cool light of dawn came sliding through the window he yawned stretched and got to his feet at first he saw nothing at all out of the ordinary then he noticed four small charred patches on the window frame at just about the spots where bagdasares had sorcerously attached his vertical and horizontal lengths of twine he hadnt seen those places there before if the wards had indeed flared to protect him against magical attack something of the sort might have resulted lucky the building didnt catch fire he said and decided he hadnt imagined the ghostly fanged visitor after all he splashed water from the pitcher over his hands and face and spluttering a little went downstairs to his breakfast after he had eaten his fill he cut a large chunk off the round of cheese samosates had set out and headed upstairs with it youve made friends with your mice the hypasteos asked chuckling at his own wit with one of them anyhow maniakes said from the foot of the steps samosates stared after him as he climbed them the hills above opsikion dropped away to the north rhegorios had led horsemen and rattling squeaking supply wagons west toward videssos the city two days earlier with luck his forces would reach the capital at about the same time as the fleet without luck maniakes would never see his cousin again summer laid a heavier hand on the mainland than it ever did on kalavria the offshore wind blew the pungent fragrance of citrus orchards out to the ships that sailed south along the coast no great mariner himself maniakes was just as glad when his captains stayed well within sight of land and beached their ships each night he hadnt cared for the passage across the open sea that had brought him from kastavala to opsikion every so often the fleet would pass fishing boats bobbing in the light chop each with a fisherman and perhaps a couple of sons or nephews working the nets sometimes the renewal approached so close that maniakes could see tanned staring faces turned his way he wondered what went through the fishermens minds probably the same thing that goes through an anchovys mind when a shark swims by after bigger prey he thought the weather grew ever warmer as they sailed farther south maniakes came to understand why so many sailors often went about in nothing more than a loincloth had he not been mindful of his dignity he might have done the same as it was he sweated in his robes feeling rather like a loaf of bread trapped inside its oven then one day the lookout in the crows nest shouted and pointed southwest maniakes heart sprang into his mouth had the fellow spied genesios fleet if he had the chroniclers would write briefly of yet another failed rebellion during the reign of genesios but the lookouts shout had words in it the cape theres the cape ahead sure enough before long maniakes too could see how the land dwindled away to a single point washed by endless creamy waves to the south the sea stretched on forever or at least to the distant seldomvisited hot lands home of elephants and other strange halflegendary beasts as the fleet sailed past the point of the cape thrax and the other captains bawled orders sailors capered this way and that water muttered against steering oars that guided ships on a new course ropes creaked as the men swung the sails to catch the wind at a different angle the masts themselves made small groaning noises bent so long one way they now were pushed another the fleet swung northwest sailing directly toward the imperial city the key maniakes muttered he didnt know he had spoken aloud till kourikos who stood close by nodded the logothete of the treasury said indeed your majesty that island and the fleets based thereon shall be the key to whether we stand or fall i prefer to think of it as the key to videssos the city and to hope it will turn smoothly in my hand maniakes said phos grant it be so your majesty kourikos answered he hesitated slightly each time he spoke maniakes title he had had no trouble bringing it out when he addressed the elder maniakes but to acknowledge someone years younger than he as a superior had to rankle in kourikos sandals maniakes would have been thinking about having experience earn its proper reward he wouldnt have been a bit surprised to learn that the same thoughts ran through kourikos head one more thing to worry about that had occurred to him a great many times lately thrax visibly relaxed when the fleet rounded the cape without being assailed now we have a chance he declared if they meet us anywhere else on our way to videssos the city therell be doubt in some of their hearts and well be able to put it to good use but they could have smashed us like a man setting his boot on a cockroach and they didnt do it i begin to think im not throwing my life away to no purpose if you thought that why did you sail with me maniakes asked because there was always the chance id be wrong his captain answered and because if i do live ill do well for myself and ill do well by videssos and both those things matter to me maniakes wondered which mattered more thrax had put his own ambition ahead of his concern for the empire maniakes judged that probably honest he shrugged as well ask men to give up food and wine as ask them to set anything ahead of their interests every time the fleet put into shore he had alvinos bagdasares renew the protective spells around him since that first attack in opsikion genesios had not assailed him with magic he wondered if that meant genesios thought him dead or if the mages at the capital concluded his shielding was too strong for them to penetrate neither supposition left him permanently secure if genesios thought him dead sooner or later he would learn he was wrong and maniakes was closer to videssos the city now than he had been in opsikion wards that had sufficed then might fail now every morning he woke relieved to have got through another night unmolested maybe he thought every wizard genesios controlled had fled away from the detested sovereign leaving the man who called himself avtokrator no way to strike across the long leagues of ocean maybe that was sobut maniakes did not count on it when he said as much to bagdasares the sorcerer nodded you are wise your majesty never rely on what a wizard may or may not do we are tricksy the lot of us he tugged at his beard i wonder if i was wise to include myself in that ah well had i not doubtless you would have attended to the matter for me doubtless maniakes said dryly he had the fleet of the key to worry about too it should have occupied all his thoughts instead he had to spend time wondering whether he would wake up himself or as an earwig he liked being himself gaining a couple of extra legs and a pincer on his backside did not strike him as a worthwhile exchange the fleet kept sailing north and west the only sails the lookouts saw belonged to fishing boats like those that had bobbed in the chop outside kastavala and opsikion maniakes began to wonder where the fleet from the key was he certainly had not wanted to make its acquaintance as his own vessels were rounding the cape not seeing it then had been nothing but a relief not seeing it now made him fret what in skotos cursed name were the captains based at the key plotting whatever it was they didnt have long to put their plot into effect in another couple of days his fleet would sail between the key and the mainland and make for videssos the city was genesios plan to have the ships on the key fall in behind his vessels and cut off their escape that had risks even if they did their job perfectlyif his fleet and land forces took the capital they wouldnt need to escape the next morning a fine bright day with the sun quickly burning off the light sea mist the watchman in the crows nest of the renewal cried out sail ho to northward a moment later he corrected himself sails ho to northward after another few minutes he declared those arent fishing boatssails are the wrong shape and too big to boot theyre coming on fast thrax cupped his hands into a trumpet ready all for battle horns blared the word to ships behind the leaders through their brazen cries maniakes heard other captains relay orders and other lookouts report sighting the oncoming vessels then he saw them for himself no they were not fishing boats they were warships like his own spread across a good stretch of sea ahead he looked from them to thrax to his own fleet trying to gauge numbers he couldnt not with any confidence he keenly felt how much he was a landlubber afloat at last he turned and asked thrax how the opposing forces matched up the captain ran a hand through his silvery hair unless theres a whole lot of sail still under the horizon thats not the whole of the fleet from the key nor even any great part of it we can take em your majesty likely without hurting ourselves too bad in the doing he yelled orders to his trumpeter pass word to widen the line well sweep out beyond em to right and left maniakes watched the ships obey the order he could see they were not as smooth as they might have been that did not much matter now in some closefought engagement though it might make the difference between victory and defeat their lead ship is showing shield of truce the lookout bawled thrax peered ahead so did maniakes they both wanted to make sure the lookout was right before doing anything else when they had satisfied themselves of that thrax turned to maniakes a question in his eyes maniakes said well show shield of truce ourselves but have our ships go on with their maneuver aye your majesty thraxs voice throbbed with approval and relief at his command a sailor ran forward with a whitepainted shield hung on a spearshaft maniakes looked east and west on both wings now his fleet overlapped that from the key we wont start a fight he said but if they start one well finish it by phos well said your majesty again thrax appeared imperfectly trusting of any captains who chose to serve under genesios the fleets continued to approach each other that from the key did nothing to keep itself from being flanked which worried maniakes in land combat passions among soldiers ran so high as to make battle magic chancy at best and more often than not futile he wasnt sure the same obtained in naval warfare it seemed a more precise more artisanly way of fighting than the melees into which land battles generally developed ships reminded him more of pieces in the videssian board game he smiled when that thought crossed his mind with luck he would capture these ships and put them back on the board as part of his own force but would he have luck no way to tell not yet as the fleets drew within hailing distance of each other a leatherlunged sailor aboard the nearest ship from the key bellowed across the greenblue water why do you continue to move against us while still showing sign of truce because we dont trust you maniakes answered bluntly and his own herald shouted back at the oncoming dromon he went on genesios the usurper has tried to slay me once so i have no good reason to trust him or his but so long as you do not strike at us we shall not strike at you the next question amused him which maniakes are you the younger as i hope youd see he answered genesios hadnt even known at whom he was striking then opponent was label enough maniakes asked a question of his own who seeks to know after a moment the reply came back you speak with tiverhios ypodrungarios of the fleet of the key permission to come alongside to parley wait maniakes told him he turned to kourikos and triphylles does either of you know this man triphylles was practically hopping up and down on the deck in excitement his brother is married to a cousin of mine your majesty i was a groomsman at the wedding kourikos also had a connection with tiverhios in a way perhaps even more intimate than that of triphylles your majesty he owes me seven hundred goldpieces as well as a years interest on them mm maniakes was not sure what to make of that would he be more interestedforgive me i did that by accidentin repaying you in having you forgive his debt or in slaughtering you so the matter becomes moot oh the indebtedness would not become moot were i to die suddenly kourikos assured him it is quite well documented let me tell you and would pass down to my heirs and assigns niphone receiving her fair portion from any eventual collection you really mean that maniakes said in tones of wonder even after the six bloody anarchic years of genesios reign kourikos remained confident the law would in the end exact payment from a recalcitrant debtor indeed remained confident was an understatement to the logothete of the treasury no other result seemed conceivable maniakes wondered if he should enlighten his prospective fatherinlaw about the persuasive power of sharpened iron a moment later he wondered if kourikos wasnt trying to enlighten him he tried a different course for the sake of bringing him to our side would you be willing to forgive his debt i suppose so kourikos said sounding vaguely surprised it is one way of conveying advantage after all well enough then to his own herald maniakes said tell him he may come alongside his calculation was not based solely upon the likelihood of tiverhios switching sides he had taken the measure of the dromon in which the ypodrungarios of the fleet from the key sailed and concluded the renewal should have no trouble sinking it or winning any sort of boarding battle that was reckoning as coldblooded as any kourikos made over whether to grant a loan but made with lives rather than goldpieces tiverhios ship drew near it had eyes painted on either side of the bow to help it see over the waves some fishing boats followed that custom as did some of the dromons in maniakes fleet he wondered if it was magic or merely superstitionthen he wondered if those two differed in any meaningful way if he ever found some leisure which looked unlikely he would have to put both questions to bagdasares like every longtime seaman whose acquaintance maniakes had made tiverhios was baked brown as an overdone loaf by the sun his fancy robe and his arrogant stance made him easy to spy as if they were not enough he also shaved his cheeks and chin bare but wore a bushy mustache to prove his masculinity an eccentric style by videssian standards greetings maniakes in the name of the lord with the great and good mind he said his voice all at once oddly formal maniakes started to ask him about greetings in genesios name but hesitated with the sardonic question still unspoken a great many videssian officers probably most were pious and prayerful men but few put their piety into that kind of salutation tiverhios must have meant something special by it even if maniakes could not tell precisely what his voice cautious he replied excellent sir i return your greeting also in the name of the lord with the great and good mind may phos sun long shine upon you tiverhios nearly naked face split into a wide grin the good god bless you sir youre not the misbeliever they said you were sir was not your majesty it wasnt even as much courtesy as maniakes had tendered the ypodrungarios but coupled with the grin it struck maniakes as a good sign he asked who are they and what lies have they been spreading about me genesios men sir tiverhios answered they came to the key excellent sir and said you were a rebel eminent sir which i see is true begging your pardon your highness but they also said of you that you were a heretic and a misbeliever and a disbeliever which i see isnt true at all your majesty maniakes stared at him he felt like some pious layman chosen by an emperor as ecumenical patriarch and rushed through the grades of the ecclesiastical hierarchy so he would be juridically fit to hold the office to which he had been named in such promotions though a man spent a day at each rung of the ladder tiverhios had rushed him to his highest possible title in the space of a sentence it was dizzying unless im altogether mistaken they will also have said of me that im a cursed rugpeddler of a vaspurakaner doomed to skotos ice on account of my blood if for no other reason maniakes said they will have said something about vaspurakaners always being heretics too wont they tiverhios head bobbed up and down it hardly seemed a voluntary motion on his part more as if the waves that slapped against his ship were making him nod they did say something like that i think but i didnt pay it any mind not me that would do for a round thumping lie until a bigger one came along had it been truth tiverhios wouldnt have readied his loaded greeting and sprung it like a trap but maniakes was willing to overlook it to win the ypodrungarios firmly to his side sketching the suncircle over his heart he said true my ancestors came out of vaspurakan but i am of orthodox faith he hadnt been not altogether but the videssians would pull him down from the throne and burn him alive if he were mad enough to try to impose his ancestral dogmas on them somehow that didnt always stop them from trying to impose theirs on vaspurakan when they had the chance but they saw nothing unusual in that disparity tiverhios didnt go down on his belly in a full proskynesis but he did bow himself almost double your majesty i had hopedi had prayedthat would be what you said when it is seen to be true all through the empire the crown and red boots will be yours so long as he be orthodox any man alive is better on the throne than genesios maniakes had to work to keep his face straight at such backhanded praise he worried only slightly about what the empire as a whole thought of his religious views at the moment what the fleet thought of them was of paramount importance later if he won his way so far what the ecumenical patriarch and the people of videssos the city thought would also matter so would the opinion of the army though it was leavened with a good many unconverted vaspurakaners what do you intend to do now excellent sir he asked tiverhios will all your ships join me will all the keys ships join me he turned his head and in a lowered voice asked thrax what part of the keys fleet has he here perhaps a third thrax answered a cautious strategy coming out to meet us with so few he sniffed in a civil war caution is mostly wasted tiverhios was also speaking since i did not fully know your views your majesty before setting out i promisedindeed i sworeno harm would come to captains and crews either willing or unwilling to follow you that depending on what you turned out to be he looked anxious you will not make me violate my oath i hope maniakes wondered how he had expected to be able to fight after giving an oath like that he shrugged the scent of heresy might have united the captains behind genesios as nothing else could he said no those who prefer a bloodstained bungling butcher who aims to feed videssos to sharbaraz king of kings piece by piece are welcome to go to him having such fools as his commanders will but weaken him tiverhios thought that over and then rather more slowly than maniakes would have hoped for got the point and laughed well said now that you are shown to be orthodox few from among my captains here will seek to desert your cause from among your captains here maniakes echoed what of the men still back at the key more of them i fear will incline toward your enemy tiverhios said i took with me mostly ships whose captains i thought leaned your way kourikos stepped up beside maniakes at the starboard rail tiverhios eyes widened when he recognized the logothete of the treasury aye i favor maniakes kourikos said so do many from among the powerful at videssos the city that you do too in this hour of videssos need makes me set aside your debt to me in recognition of the debt the empire owes to you yourevery kind eminent sir and very generous tiverhios bowed almost as low to kourikos as he had to maniakes the logothete asked is erinakios still drungarios of the fleet at the key aye eminent sir he is tiverhios answered genesios hes slaughtered the generals till theres hardly a one that can tell north from sausage if you know what i mean but he hasnt much messed with us sailors he doesnt trust himself to find better to take our place unless im wrong he hasnt found better to take the place of the generals hes murdered either maniakes said lowering his voice he said to kourikos tell me about this erinakios we vaspurakaners dont know much about this business of fighting on the sea either hes a sharptempered manall over prickles you might say kourikos replied hes not broken with genesios this past six years not formally but he didnt molest our merchantmen when we sailed by the key nor pursue us once we were past though he might easily have done either where hell stand now i do not know maniakes plucked at his beard what connections do our assembled nobles here have with him he borrowed money from me three years ago about the same time tiverhios did the logothete answered he paid me back ahead of schedule kourikos sounded as if that were an affront not something to be proud of from his point of view maybe it was erinakios had deprived him of some accrued interest he went on i shall have to inquire offhand i know of no close connections between any of my party and the drungarios well well see what we can do maniakes did his best to keep his voice easy in fact he felt like pitching kourikos and all his prominent companions into the sea here they had been boasting of all the important people they knew but the first time he really needed them they let him down he called across the water to tiverhios does erinakios know why you chose the captains for the part of the fleet you led out to seek me cant be sure the ypodrungarios answered we didnt talk about itnothing like that but if he thinks about whos there and whos gone hes going to figure it out erinakios he may be spiny but hes sharp the other way too that he is it was maniakes suspected with a hint of sadness more than could be said for tiverhios maniakes asked thrax with these ships here added to ours can we beat whats left of the force the key has obviously unaware of what he was doing the captain of the renewal made several strange thoughtfilled faces before answering your majesty i think we can provided the fleet from videssos the city doesnt come down to aid erinakios but if he fights with all he has well not get away from the key with enough to challenge the fleet that anchors at the capital thrax had a way of sounding discouraged whether the situation truly warranted it or not maniakes was getting used to that and included it in his calculations he asked how likely is erinakios to fight with everything he has if youre asking me your majesty my guess is that hes not likely to do that thrax said if hed intended fighting with everything he had hed have met us with his whole fleet a long way south of here but im only guessing if you really want to know ask tiverhios there youre right maniakes called the question across the gap of ocean tiverhios tugged at one end of his mustache as he considered your majesty i just dont know some days hed be cursing genesios up one side and down the other the sort of curses that were he a wizard would slay a man in short order and leave him glad he was dead on account of the pain of his dying but other times hed curse rebels every bit as hard i dont think he knows himself what hell do till the time comes to do it that time is coming soon maniakes said the key had two central mountain peaks they loomed up from the sea green on their lower slopes the graybrown of bare rock interspersed above neither was tall enough to hold snow in summer maniakes cared nothing for the peaks save that they marked where in the sea the island lay his interest centered on the ports particularly the southern one gavdos the fleet still under erinakios command had put to sea and awaited him well out from the port he would not catch the dromons tied up at the docks or beached nearby erinakios gave every appearance of being ready to fight tiverhios galley lay alongside the renewal so the ypodrungarios could tell maniakes what he needed to know about captains and vessels of the opposing fleet maniakes called to him which ship does erinakios command tiverhios scanned the oncoming dromons itd be easier to pick out under sail he said a little peevishly but hes brailed up his canvas and stowed the mast for battle same as everybody else i thinkthere off to port a bit the one with the red eyes painted by the ram i see the one you mean maniakes said the rowers on erinakios ship powered it through the water with swift steady strokes maniakes couldnt remember seeing such polished efficiency before it was as if a single hand worked all the oars as the ship came up and over the waves he got glimpses of its ram the bronze turned green by the sea but the point cruelly sharp that crew would make sure it did all the harm it could steer toward him maniakes said well show the shield of truce but if he sprints at us i want to be ready to fight on the instant wed better be thrax said otherwise well be dead he had also noted what erinakios rowers could doand that the ship in which the drungarios sailed was larger and more formidable than the renewal erinakios dromon drew closer appallingly fast maniakes saw no sign of a shield of truceonly the point of the ram aimed always at a point just to port of his own bow the enemys oars rose and fell rose and fell a touch to port thrax called to the steersmen at the stern by phos he wont take the angle on us the renewal made the slight course adjustment but erinakios and his rowers countered within moments the green bronze ram aimed for the same point as before thrax bit his lip theyre good theyre very good the two dromons were hardly a bowshot apart when a sailor in erinakios ship held up a whitepainted shield sheer off maniakes shouted what are you mad thrax stared wildly its a trick your majesty give him your flank and well be on the bottom in nothing flat sheer off maniakes repeated now if he was right erinakios was seeing what kind of stomach he had for a tight place if he was wrong if he was wrong the little fish and the urchins and the whelks that crawled across the bottom of the sea would feed well hard to starboard thrax cried raw pain coming from his throat with the words they were so close to erinakios galley now that even sheering off was risky if both ships dodged in the same direction they might still collide just for an instant the flagship from the key started to follow the renewals movement fear turned maniakes bowels to water if erinakios truly was committed to genesios he had the chance to do his sovereign a great service but then the drungarios dromon spun to starboard itself and slid past the renewal on a parallel track the tips of its oars almost brushing against those of the ship in which maniakes sailed across the narrow stretch of water a hoarse voice bawled you want to see how close you can cut it dont you if that was erinakios by the port rail he looked as prickly as kourikos had described him a hawkfeatured man with a red angry face and a wolfgray beard to him maniakes called back isnt that what you had in mind to find out eminent sir erinakios laugh sounded like the sharp coughing bark of a wolf too aye thats what i had in mind whats it to you maniakes remembered the sudden liquid terror he had known a rush of anger all but burned it away the first thing he thought of was revenge against erinakios for reminding him of his mortality shame followed extinguishing rage erinakios had a right to be concerned about what sort of sovereign he might get if he abandoned genesios do i pass your test eminent sir maniakes asked the distance between the two dromons had lengthened erinakios had to raise his voice to answer youll do after a moment almost as an afterthought he added your majesty maniakes nearly missed the offhand recognition of his sovereignty he was looking out toward the wings of the two fleets in the center where captains on both sides saw their commanders parleying they too had held back from fighting out on the wings they had gone for each other a couple of dromons had been rammed and were sinking men splashed in the water grabbing for oars and planks and other floating wreckage more than one fire blazed upon the water which could not extinguish the liquid incendiary the videssian navy used will your trumpeter blow truce maniakes asked in civil war hurts cost the empire double for it bleeds when a man from either side dies for that all on its lonesome id blow truce erinakios said genesios hasnt figured it out to this day and wont if he lives to be a thousand he turned to his trumpeter the sweet notes of the truce call rang across the water maniakes nudged thrax who called to his own hornplayer in a moment the call to leave off fighting blared from both flagships not all the captains obeyed the call not at once some of the leaders of the fleet from the key genuinely favored genesios no matter what their drungarios had to say and some of maniakes captains already engaged in battle when they heard the truce call did not care to leave off fights they were winning erinakios and maniakes sorted things out together maniakes dromons disengaged from battle as they could where they still fought genesios loyalists they suddenly discovered allies among erinakios ships most of the dromons whose leaders backed genesios soon sank or surrendered on a couple mutinies from the crew impelled such surrender but a few warships broke free and sprinted northwest toward videssos the city oars churning water white as they fled desperation lent them speed their foes could not match genesios will be muttering into his mustache tomorrow when word reaches him of rout and defection erinakios said he bared his teeth i like the idea and i maniakes said but that also means well have to look more to our safety from tomorrow on have you a wizard whose work you trust the tyrant has already tried once to slay me by sorcery erinakios made an impatient disparaging gesture every line of his body shouted contempt im a fighting man he said i dont clutter my head worrying about magecraft have it as you will maniakes said though he did not share the drungarios scorn of sorcery after the night in opsikion he hardly could aye magic was hard to come by difficult to execute properly and of little use in time of battle all that granted it remained real and could be deadly dangerous dyou trust him your majesty thrax whispered urgently even without tiverhios ships that fleet is a match for ours if you add them into the bargain we could be swamped if erinakios wanted to swamp us he could have done it without this mimeshow maniakes answered having his ships waiting just past the cape would have taken care of the job nicely we want people to rally to our banner thrax weve wanted that from the start if it hadnt happened we never could have come this far i understand all that thrax stuck out his chin and looked stubborn but the thing of it is weve come this far with people we know are loyalmost of em anyhow but if we take up this fleet and sail with it alongside ours or mixed together with ours against videssos the city and erinakios turns on us then why itd be like a man walking along on two legs and having one of em fall off theres a pretty picture maniakes said but if we go against the city without the fleet from the key were like a onelegged man setting out thrax winced but then nodded something to that too i suppose but watch yourself your majesty i shall maniakes promised he raised his voice and called to erinakios have you space at your docks for our ships aye we can take em all in gavdos or sykeota around on the north coast the drungarios of the key answered i suppose youll want more of my ships to go to one harbor and more of yours to the other so you can surround yourself with armed men you trust he couldnt possibly have heard maniakes and thrax talking together a glance at the distance between the renewal and erinakios ship told maniakes as much he hadnt thought to give erinakios any tests for wits but the drungarios seemed to be setting his ownand passing them handily maniakes said if you think i wont take you up on that eminent sir you may think again erinakios let out a couple of barking grunts of laughter youd be a fool to say no till i prove my worth will you take gavdos or sykeota the northern harbors a trifle larger but the southerns easier to get in and out of either which way i suppose youll want me for hostage he phrased it as a question but his voice held certainty now that you mention ityes maniakes answered which drew another of those wolfish chuckles from erinakios turning to thrax maniakes asked which harbor do you prefer gavdos thrax answered without hesitation the drungarios is rightits the easier of the two and not all our captains and crews have been here before kastavala had a good harbor opsikion had a good harbor videssos the city had three splendid harbors north south and west only those last could stand comparison to the anchorage on the southern shore of the key it was as if phos had scooped out threefourths of a circle from an otherwise smooth coastline giving a relatively small entrance to a wide secure anchorage even storms would have their force muted before they smote with wind and wave the ships tied up there had videssos the city not stood at a crossroads of both land and sea routes and had the imperial capital not kept itself rich by making potential rivals poor the empire might have been ruled from the key maniakes wondered how the world might have looked had the islanders spread out and begun to rule the mainland instead of being ruled from it as it was the town of gavdos was far smaller than kastavala let alone opsikion let alone videssos the city most of it seemed to be barracks and storehouses and taverns and brothels but for the fleet the place had no life is it the same at sykeota in the north maniakes asked thrax did not need to have him explain himself just the same your majesty from time out of mind this islands been given over to the navy and not much else they dont grow enough grain here to feed all the sailors and a city cant live on fish alone so thats the way of it maniakes said thoughtfully if ever a drungarios of the fleet here decided to rebel his men would get hungry by and byprovided they didnt win first that is triphylles came up and examined gavdos with a jaundiced eye what a dreadful hole he said adding a shudder redolent of distaste i shall be ever so glad when this campaign is over and done and i can return to my villa in the city life anywhere else has proved altogether dreary i fear it would have been dreary to stay in videssos the city after your head went up on the milestone i suppose maniakes remarked deadpan well yes but even so triphylles began then he realized he was being made sport of with a sniff he took himself elsewhere thrax suffered a coughing fit of epic proportions but valiantly managed to hold back from laughing out loud erinakios flagship tied up just behind the renewal maniakes walked up the gangplank to the dock after so many days spent mostly at sea dry land felt wobbly sailors with swords and shields came up onto the dock with him in case erinakios intended treachery even now but the drungarios though he also got up on the dock as fast as he couldand though he swayed to and fro more than maniakesprostrated himself on the rough timbers before the man he had named his sovereign get up get up maniakes said impatiently we have a lot of planning to do and not much time in which to do it erinakios rose seen close up he looked even tougher and grimmer than kourikos had made him out to be and than he had seemed while aboard his dromon maniakes had twenty years fewer than he but would not have cared to encounter him sword to sword or hand to hand but his fierce visage suddenly lightened into a smile as if the sun had come out from behind thick clouds i am already seeing i made the right choice he said genesios knows nothing of planning something happens to him happens to the empire and he goes and does the first thing that pops into his vicious head is it any wonder were in our present state that were in it is no wonder but getting out wont be easy maniakes answered falling down a hill is easier than slogging back up it once youve fallen and straightforward viciousness has one thing in its favor whoever gets in his way once isnt apt to be around to do it twice which is the only reason genesios is still on the throne erinakios said but if he doesnt manage to murder you i think youll beat him you can thinki can see that already most of the others who rose against him were just reacting he could deal with them his mind works the same way and he had the advantages of already wearing the red boots and sitting in videssos the city like a spider in the center of its web youll be tougher may i ask you something maniakes waited for erinakios gruff nod then put his question why didnt you go after the crown yourself i thought about it erinakios said a dangerously honest answera man with imperial ambitions might be reckoned untrustworthy for that very reason aye i thought about it but with only the fleet from the key i was too likely to lose and i couldnt count on help from anyone else ive made too many enemies over the years for that why do you suppose genesios kept me on here hes shortsighted but hes not blind maniakes pursed his lips the drungarios comment made considerable sense genesios had left the elder maniakes alone on kalavria knowing that replacing him would cause more trouble and he had retained an able but unpopular officer here lest his replacement prove able to forge alliances with other soldiers and sailors no that wasnt stupid if only he had used more of his wits for the empires good going to have to put you up in the barracks erinakios said pointing to a weathered wooden building hope you dont mindits where i sleep its all right with me maniakes answered cheerfully next to some of the places ive slept on campaign it looks like the imperial palace he glanced back toward the renewal how the excellent triphylles and the eminent kourikos will take it is another matter though and ive another double handful of nobles from videssos the city scattered through the rest of my ships well if they want to get rid of genesios theyll have to take a bit of the rough so as they can have the smooth back erinakios said and if they dont fancy a couple of nights of hard beds and salt fish to the ice with em maniakes wouldnt have put it so bluntly but the drungarios assessment marched with his own some of the grandees seemed ready to make the best of their unprepossessing quarters while others grumbled and fussed erinakios spat scornfully when he saw that pack of halfweaned brats whining on account of mama wont give em the tit let them be maniakes said which got him a dirty look from the drungarios he didnt care the nobles from the capital might have been discontented with their lodgings but they were finally doing what he had hoped they would he watched them going around mugs of rough wine in hand to one of erinakios ship captains after another whether through kinship or marriage or acquaintance or gold they seemed to know most of the fleets leading officers the more they talked with those men the stronger the bond they wove that bound the fleet of the key to maniakes by tomorrow erinakios said in an appraising tone of voice genesios will know youre here and hell know ive gone over to you i dont think hell be what youd call happy about that then we should sail for the city tomorrow maniakes answered the faster we move the less chance hell have to figure out where we are and what were up to erinakios raised his cup of wine in salute spoken like a soldier your majesty he drank again then studied maniakes the more i hear you talking your majesty the more i like what i hear videssos wont prosperby the good god videssos wont survive the way things are these dayswith a slugabed in the red boots if i dont keep moving im liable to be the one who doesnt survive maniakes said genesios has already tried once to slay me by sorcery as ive said thats why i asked if you had a wizard warding you and i told you i have no truck with wizards if sorcery hasnt slain me in all these years i dont think it will bite on me now the logic behind that escaped maniakes but he held his tongue if erinakios wanted to substitute bravado for brains that was his affair and genesios was in any case more likely to attack his rival emperor than an underling however high his rank do you mind if i send a boat around to sykeota maniakes asked erinakios i want to make sure my men and ships there are getting on well and also to make sure fleets from both ports will sail against videssos the city on the same day yes that would be a good thing wouldnt it erinakios gave one of his barking chuckles he waved a hand in maniakes direction perhaps mocking the delicate gestures of the grandees from the city go right ahead your majesty in your boots id do all the checking i could too maniakes went over to one of his officers and gave the necessary orders the captain saluted with clenched fist over heart and went off to do his bidding maniakes was confident the fellow would find everything all right the question had been more intended to find out how erinakios would react had the drungarios tried to talk him out of seeing how things were going at the harbor where his ships were in the minority he would have had something to worry about since erinakios didnt mind odds were he wasnt intending to try anything hostile over there i hope alls going well with rhegorios maniakes murmured half to himself erinakios overheard him thats your cousin with the horsemen i hope its well with him too your majesty the thinner genesios has to spread his menand his fears and his hatredthe less he can concentrate on any one thing just what i was thinking maniakes said and so it was but only in part the chief idea in his mind was that in rhegorios he had a comrade he could trust without reservation with all the new chieftains with all the nobles from videssos the city he was constantly looking over his shoulder to make sure the hand patting him on the back hadnt first palmed a dagger erinakios said do i rightly remember hearing you also have a couple of brothers ayetatoules and parsmanios both younger than i theyre officers in the westlands of no great rank i pray to the lord with the great and good mind that theyre well no word of them has come to kastavala for a long time with sharbaraz rampaging through our lands there anything might have happened to them too trueand you say nothing of all the revolts spawned in the westlands but they wont have heard of your own rising i dont think so no maniakes answered not unless genesios has sent for them to take vengeance for my move against him but i dont think he can do that either not with the chaos there from what ive heard these days the videssian armies in the westlands are fighting for themselves and for survival nothing more they dont much worry about orders from the capital there youve heard true your majesty erinakios rolled his eyes to show how true it was but they dont work with one another either and so come off worse over and over against the makuraners videssians do love factionfighting maniakes observed he couldnt have stated anything more obvious save perhaps that air was needed for breathing but several ship captains and three or four of the grandees from the capital looked askance at him nonetheless he needed a moment to figure out why he had publicly reminded them of his own vaspurakaner blood many of them had been doing their best to forget about it so they could back him in good conscience erinakios said youre sure youll be able to sleep here in safety tonight your majesty it might have been real concern about maniakes safety then again it might have been a taunt with the drungarios every sentence came out so drenched in vinegar that it was hard to tell maniakes chose to think of it as real concern it should be all right genesios wont know tonight where i am and in any case my wizard alvinos is with me his spells warded me in opsikion and should protect me here as well alvinos eh erinakios glanced over to the mage who certainly looked more as if the vaspurakaner appellation bagdasares belonged to him than the bland acceptable videssian moniker he sometimes wore maniakes usually called him bagdasares too this time he hadnt precisely so he wouldnt bring up vaspurakan in the minds of those who heard him sensing that people were watching him bagdasares turned away from the captain with whom he had been talking bowed raised his wine cup in salute and went back to the interrupted conversation maniakes smiled the mage had a certain style of his own servants lit torches to keep the gathering going after sunset maniakes stayed on his feet chatting until the man he had sent out to sykeota returned with assurances all was well then maniakes let out a couple of yawns so perfect a mime at a midwinters day festival would not have been ashamed to claim them for his own when you were avtokrator of the videssians or even a claimant to the throne such theatrics got results within minutes dozens of captains yawning themselves set aside wine cups went outside to use the slit trenches in back of the barracks and flopped down on cots maniakes didnt expect his cot to be comfortable and it wasnt he slept like a log even so breakfast was a rockhard roll a couple of little fried squid hot enough to scorch the fingers and a mug of sour wine to maniakes thinking it was a naval variation on campaign food to the grandees from videssos the city it might have been just this side of poisonous even kourikos who usually seemed the most reasonable of the bunch didnt eat much what are we to do triphylles asked mournfully he had nibbled a tiny piece off the roll sipped the wine and set it down with a grimace of distaste and turned up his sizable nose at the squid although street vendors sold them in every quarter of videssos the city to maniakes erinakios remarked you know your majesty im a grandfather now but i remember when my oldest son was a little boy he was what they call a fussy eater i guess when he didnt fancy something that was set before him id say well son its up to you you can eat that or you can starve like i say im a grandfather now so i guess he didnt starve triphylles let out a loud indignant sniff a couple of the other nobles attacked their breakfasts with fresh vigor maniakes even saw one of them take a second helping of fried squid so did erinakios his shoulders shook with suppressed mirth kourikos came up to maniakes and said your majesty i dont think it proper that we should be made sport of for no better reason than our being unaccustomed to the rough fare of the military diet give me a chance eminent sir and i expect i could come up with some better reasons than that to make sport of you erinakios said with a maliciously gleeful grin kourikos spluttered indignantly he was used to twisting other peoples words not to having his own twisted maniakes held up a hand he said eminent sir so far as i can tell no one was making sport of anyone the eminent drungarios happened to choose that moment to explain to me how he raised his son that may prove useful when niphone and i have children now kourikos sounded exasperated really your majesty you know perfectly well that what i know perfectly well eminent sir maniakes interrupted is that on the key there seems to be no food suitable for your delicate palate and those of your companions either you will have to take what the cooks dish out for you or youll go hungry when we win the war and the lot of you go back to your villas and manors you can stuff yourselves with dainties to your hearts content till then you ought to remember the circumstances in which you find yourselvesand remember that had you stayed in the city you might be trying to eat through slit throats angrily kourikos stomped away sulkily he took a fried squid from a tray defiantly he bit into itthe squid werent hot any more his eyebrows shot up in surprise maniakes wondered why he was surprised squid bread crumbs olive oil minced garlicnothing wrong with any of that neither maniakes nor erinakios wanted to waste time the sooner they were sailing for videssos the city the happier each would be but sailing into battle without a plan was asking for trouble erinakios led maniakes to a chart of the capital with the harbors prominently displayed maniakes hadnt much worried about them when he had lived in videssos the city even when he had taken ship they had been just places from which to enter or leave he hadnt thought about them in the military sense youll know the neorhesian harbor on the north coast of the city is the one the navy mostly uses erinakios said pointing to the chart maniakes nodded he did know that much erinakios went on now the harbor of kontoskalion in the south is every bit as good mind you if not as large law and custom say trading ships go there and the dromons to the neorhesian harbor but in a civil war nobody listens to what law and customs say anyhow are you with me so far aye youve been very clear when does it start getting complicated erinakios snorted have no fear your majesty were getting there he jabbed a thumb at the third harbor this one at the blunt westernmost extremity of videssos the city this anchorage is in the palace district of course most of the time theres not much tied up here customs boats a yacht if the avtokrator happens to like sailing a few fishing boats to help keep the palaces supplied things like that but the place will hold almost as much as the harbor of kontoskalion when an army goes over the cattle crossing to the westlands for instance some of it will go from there because its closest and most convenient still because its not used much theres a chance the defenders will leave it out of their calculations and if we can force a landing there we can seize the palaces and flush genesios like a partridge from the gorse maniakes finished for him thats how itd work if everything goes the way it should erinakios agreed of course well never see the day when everything goes as it should but the least making a move on the palaces will do is to force genesios to shuffle his men all around and thats part of the idea if he spreads himself thin enough we may be able to get men up and over the sea wall and move into the city that way maniakes said its lower than the land wall after all and single not double it could happen erinakios said judiciously but i wouldnt count on it if we do pull it off itll show that nobody in genesios force is standing by him not his sailors or his soldiers either if thats so we have him if i understand the hints youve thrown around you want us to make for the harbor of kontoskalion and the one by the palaces in the hope that theyll be less heavily defended than the neorhesian maniakes said thats what im thinking all right erinakios said we may have a big sea fight before we can get up to the city then again we may not depends on how confident genesios and his captains are feeling when they find out were on our way if they hang back theyre afraid of us what would you do in genesios sandals maniakes asked if i knew erinakios was coming after me you mean the drungarios puffed out his chest your majesty id be afraid maniakes was getting used to priests giving him sour looks as they blessed his cause they mistrusted his orthodoxy but six years of genesios had been enough to prove to almost everyone that orthodoxy alone did not guarantee a decent ruler may the lord with the great and good mind watch over and protect you and your cause and our sacred orthodox faith the priest said to maniakes making it clear that in his mind at least you could not be a decent ruler without orthodoxy either may he grant peace tranquility and victory to videssos so may it be so may it be maniakes echoed thank you holy sir as far as he was concerned the bluerobe had got the order backward without victory videssos would know neither tranquility nor peace this was however neither time nor place nor occasion for quarreling with a cleric thank you your majesty the priest replied after your triumph i pray you shall worship at the high temple in videssos the city with its beauty and holiness truly it seems the veritable home of phos on earth he sighed ah were it granted me to serve the good god in such a place maniakes had all he could do to keep his face straight the priest might mislike his doctrine but was still angling to be translated from the key to the capital videssians looked out for themselves first last and always he said when i win my way to videssos the city i shall indeed reward those who helped me get there beaming the priest blessed the ships so fulsomely that maniakes marveled when they didnt close their painted eyes in embarrassment at the praise well about time thats over and done with erinakios said when the cleric finally fell silent the drungarios while undoubtedly a believer had a distinctly pragmatic attitude toward matters religious now lets get on with the business of putting genesios head up on the milestone and flinging his body onto a dung heapnot that i have anything personal against dung heaps you understand everyone in videssos has something personal against genesios i think maniakes said in fact the only man i know of who doesnt is sharbaraz king of kings genesios has given away so much of the empire to him that hes been an even greater benefactor than likinios wasand all likinios did through my father and me was to set sharbaraz back on his throne your majesty youre wrong erinakios said genesios has also made a whole host of executioners all through the empire very happy men there you have me maniakes said now we need to he broke off his right hand went to his chest the amulet that rested against his skin there was suddenly burning hot magic the priest who had just blessed the fleet turned and fled blue robe flapping around his ankles shaved skull gleaming in the sun maniakes wished him dead and spending an eternity in skotos ice in spite of the wish the priest kept running maybe he wouldnt go to the ice at least not for this but one thing was certain he would never ever come to videssos the city bagdasares on the other hand ran toward trouble not away from it he shouted something in the vaspurakaner tongue that maniakes didnt quite catch his hands twisted in quick passes all at once faster than metal and stone had any business doing the amulet cooled again never mind me maniakes said im all right look to erinakios youre all right now your majesty bagdasares answered panting how you would have been in another moment but with that offhand remark he turned his attention and his sorcerous skill to the drungarios erinakios stood swaying his eyes wide and staring lips pulled back from his teeth in a fearsome grimace hands clenched into fists as maniakes watched in dismay the naval officers back began to arch so that he resembled nothing so much as a drawn bow do something maniakes wanted to scream to bagdasares but if anyone had screamed at him in the middle of a battle he might well have let the air out of the meddler with a wellplaced sword thrust and so not feeling himself in any immediate danger he simply stood and watched bagdasares struggle against the onslaught of genesios mage why wouldnt you ward yourself against wizardry he demanded of erinakios the drungarios did not could not answer every muscle every tendon in his face and neck hands and forearmsall maniakes could see of his fleshstood out sharply defined his back bent more and more if it bent much further it would snap bagdasares incanted like a man possessed he chanted charms in both vaspurakaner and videssian sometimes in what sounded like the two languages commingled his hands moved faster and more cleverly than those of a man playing a clavier greasy sweat ran down his face and dripped to the wood of the dock still erinakios back bent when it came the snap reminded maniakes of nothing so much as a goodsized stick being broken across a mans knee erinakios fell as limp as he had been rigid the latrine smell of death filled the air with a groan bagdasares collapsed beside the drungarios suddenly instead of being helped by the mage maniakes was helping him he rolled bagdasares onto his back made sure he was breathing felt for a pulse to his vast relief he found one firm and strong phos be praised he said shakily hes just fainted i think someone flip water in his face for all the water that surrounded the key getting some in a bucket and splashing bagdasares with it seemed to maniakes to take an unconscionably long time when the mage was finally splashed he choked and spluttered his eyes flew open at first only horror filled them reason slowly returned phos be praised he said sitting up your majesty yet lives so i do and glad of it maniakes said poor erinakios though wasnt so lucky bagdasares fleshy nostrils twitched as if to pick up the death stench and confirm maniakes words the wizard turned around and peered at the drungarios corpse im sorry your majesty he said bowing his head i fought with all i had in me but i could not save him maniakes reached out a hand pulled the mage to his feet partly erinakios own fault for disregarding sorcery of all sorts he said partly too that genesios mage had time to prepare his attack while i had to improvise the defense bagdasares said i understand that but failure is never pleasant to contemplate and genesios mage is very strong to reach so far and to kill in my despite how strong will he seem when we get closer maniakes asked worriedly stronger than this unless i miss my guess bagdasares face glistened with sweat as if hed been running for miles magecraft was not easy especially magecraft of the desperate sort hed just been using in a shaken voice he went on the capital by the nature of things draws the best from every art how good that best can be he shook his head better than i had imagined i can tell you so much and we are now without the man who was plainly the best choice to lead our ships against the fleet from the city maniakes said the captains who had been staring at erinakios body returned with that to the world of the living the world of rank and preferment tiverhios the ypodrungarios took half a step forward as if to say that someone with appropriate qualifications might not be overhard to find but even though tiverhios had declared for him right away maniakes was not keen to name the ypodrungarios his supreme commander on the sea he strongly suspected an admixture of expedience in tiverhios choice besides choosing tiverhios would make the rest of the captains from the key jealous and so maniakes said thrax youll command against genesios fleet tiverhios youll stay on as ypodrungarios but ypodrungarios now of my whole fleet not just the ships from the key to help show thats so ill raise your pay half a goldpiece a day effective right now your majesty is gracious tiverhios said enthusiastically bowing almost double if he resented being passed over for command of the whole fleet he hid it very well on brief acquaintance maniakes doubted he was a good enough actor to dissemble so well and if he had got in debt to kourikos the extra money had to look good to him one problem solved maniakes thought had tiverhios proved difficult everything might have unraveled right there we have to go on maniakes said only by casting down genesios can we be sure outrages like this wont happen all across the empire at a vicious brutes whim by the good god excellent sirs my brave captains i am a man and i own to faults aplenty only phos and his sun are perfect things but you will not need to fearthis he pointed to erinakios body while i am on the throne they cheered him louder than he had expected perhaps they were venting the fear they had felt when erinakios fell before their eyes at maniakes wave captains and sailors filed aboard their ships after maniakes stood once more on the deck of the renewal he asked bagdasares how do we protect ourselves if genesios looses this murderous mage upon us once more i think we have a few days grace before we need worry about that your majesty bagdasares said i stumble with weariness merely from having tried to withstand his sorcery having instigated it he will be the next thing to dead this moment and will need some days to recover before he next thinks about casting a spell maniakes pondered that it explained the long interval between the attack on him in opsikion and this one now he said does that not suggest genesios is down to a single wizard if he had more he would have been continually harassing us it may well be so bagdasares answered if it is though the one he has is very powerful i wonder what became of the others maniakes mused would their heads have gone up on the milestone when they failed to satisfy him with genesios i find that very likely bagdasares said so do i maniakes said tell me how it is that an avtokrator who is no magician himself save perhaps in the sense of magically creating disaster for videssos can dominate sorcerers with great power the main reason your majesty is that most magic requires slow preparation if a man has a knife to his throat or if his family is threatened he is likely to obey a man who commands such immediate power bagdasares chuckle sounded nervous wizards do not widely broadcast this unfortunate fact yes and i can see why maniakes said well genesios sorcerer even if he succeeded against erinakios has twice failed to slay me now phos willing genesios will see that and act on it and solve our problem for us may it be so bagdasares sketched the suncircle over his heart thrax came up to maniakes and said your pardon your majesty but shall we sail maniakes nodded thraxs trumpeter relayed the call to the fleet lines were cast off oars churned the sea the ships left the harbor of gavdos and swung north against videssos the city the city the city the lookout in the crows nest cried he was a kalavrian lad and so far as maniakes knew had never before set eyes on the imperial capital but when any videssian spoke of the city no one could doubt what he meant within a few minutes maniakes too made out the sparkle of the sun off the gilded globes topping the hundreds of temples dedicated to phos in videssos the city kourikos and triphylles sighed like lovers returning to their beloved home at last triphylles said as if he had spent the time since he left the capital among the wild khamorth of the pardrayan plain rather than merely in the empires outlying provinces then the lookout shouted ship ho fast as lightning the cry ran through maniakes fleet thraxs trumpeter began blowing like a man possessed relaying the drungarios commands to the rest of the captains most of the dromons from the key moved out to the flanks a few of the larger stouter vessels stayed in the center with the ships that had come from kalavria stiffening that force against the onslaught fast approaching maniakes had picked the captains whose galleys would go into battle close by his he had done his best to make sure they were loyal to him but he did not know the men from the key as he did those who had been in the rebellion from the beginning if any of those captains turned on him the sea fight could be lost all at once or of course it could be lost in more conventional fashion the dromons ahead had already stowed their masts they were ready to fight maniakes captains did not wait for orders from thrax to prepare their own vessels erinakios was ready for war too or so he seemed at any rate but he and his fleet went over to me maniakes said hopefully thrax answered true your majesty but if those bearing down on us are about to abandon genesios theyre running a bluff that puts erinakios to shame well go straight through them and make for the harbor of kontoskalion maniakes said once we get armed men inside the city genesios will have to flee or fall into our hands he peered east out past the capitals great double land wall and clapped his hands with delight at the tents and pavilions that sprouted on the grass there like mushrooms rhegorios has come by the good god hell keep genesios soldiers at play while we overwhelm the tyrants fleet if we overwhelm the tyrants fleet thrax said imperfectly optimistic his eyes scanned the sea from horizon to horizon they have a lot of ships and i see no sign of before he could finish his sentence a dromon bearing down on the renewal let fly with its catapult the dart half as long as a man hissed between thrax and maniakes and fell with a splash into the sea the crew that served the dartthrower loaded another missile into it and began winching back its flexion arms to shoot again so much for the notion of their giving up without a fight maniakes said thrax did not dignify that with a reply he said your pardon your majesty but i have to fight this ship now and ran back to the stern there the men at the steering oars and the oarmaster could most clearly hear him as he shouted the commands that would keep the renewal fightingor send her to the bottom or see her smashed to kindling maniakes had never given much thought to sea battles when he had campaigned in the westlands ships had sometimes brought supplies and reinforcements to videssian ports whence they had come to his army far faster than if they had made the whole journey by land kalavria kept up its fleet against pirates from out of the north but that fleet hadnt been severely tested since he came to the islandand in any case he hadnt been aboard any of its vessels when they did see action the fight was in its own way an aweinspiring spectacle at first it struck him as cleaner than a land battle catapults aboard the larger dromons hurled their great darts archers shot again and again whenever opposing vessels drew within range all the same the endless chorus of screams and groans that went with a battle of cavalry and infantry was missing here men shouted aye but in excitement and fear not torment after a while maniakes realized that a sea battle was not man against man as it was on land here ship against ship was what counted most he cried out in exultation as one of his galleys rammed a vessel whose crew was shouting for genesios then backed oars to let foaming water pour into the hole the dromons bronzeshod beak had torn men screamed then some were thrown into the sea where they bobbed and began to sinknot all of them nor even most could swim some of the rowers seized oars and leapt off the stricken galley others fought sailors and officers for space aboard the ships boat that struck maniakes as a more savage struggle than the larger battle of which it was a part one of genesios ships flung from its catapult not a dart but a large pot from which smoke trailed as it flew through the air it crashed down onto the deck of a galley burning oil and pitch and sulfur started a fire on the planking that could not be put out with cries of despair men leapt into the sea drowning was better than burning thick black smoke rose from the crackling flames that consumed the dromon a firepot from another of genesios ships flew wide of a vessel loyal to maniakes he cheered out loud when he saw the miss but the firepot broke as it smacked into the sea and spread a coating of flame over the water it clung to men floundering in the ocean so they burned and drowned at the same time few of maniakes ships from kalavria could throw fire in that terrifying fashion provincial fleets were seldom entrusted with the burning mixture lest it fall into the hands of foreign foes but the galleys from the key answered genesios ships firepot for firepot horror for horror every ship that burns is one more we wont have when we need them against makuran or even kubrat maniakes groaned beside him kourikos said if too many of our ships burn we shall not be the ones who worry about makuranor even kubrat the logothete of the treasury looked as if he would rather have been anywhere else than on the deck of a galley in the middle of a sea fight but having no choice in the matter he was doing his best to keep up a bold front despite qualms maniakes admired him for that the pitching deck of a dromon was not maniakes familiar haunt either he peered this way and that trying to figure out which side was winning in a land battle but for blowing dust it would have been relatively easy even for a blind man the changing cries of friend and foe told who advanced who gave ground here no dust intervened but the line of battle extended much farther to either side than it would have on land and the warships became so intermingled that maniakes could not tell who was crying out in triumph who shrieking in terror as his vessel was holed instead of up and down the battle line then maniakes looked ahead toward videssos the city the temples and hills and mansions seemed closer than they had when hed looked before with that in mind he did glance at the line once more as best he could tell his fleet was moving forward with the renewal he went back to the stern with thrax we drive them he said does that mean were winning were not losing at any rate thrax answered abstractedly his eyes swung every which way two points to port he called to the steersmen and the dromon swung leftward toward one of genesios galleys the archers aboard it sent a volley that hit a couple of the renewals oarsmen that fouled the rowers stroke slowed the renewal and let the smaller enemy vessel escape ramming not far away a dromon crewed by men shouting for genesios rammed one of maniakes ships when it tried to pull free though it stuck fast sailors and rowers from maniakes galley armed with knives belaying pins and every other sort of makeshift weapon scrambled onto genesios ship and began battling the crew for a platform that would stay afloat before maniakes could see how the fight turned out other warships surged between it and the renewal there thrax yelled right in maniakes ear loud and unexpectedly enough to make him jump the captain pointed to port those are our ships your majesty a whole goodsized flotilla of them theyve broken free and it looks like theyre making for the harbor in the palace quarter maniakes gaze followed thraxs outthrust finger sure enough a score of dromons had outflanked their foes and were streaking toward the city their oars churning the ocean to creamy foam as the oarmasters demandedand gotthe best from their rowers faint across the wide stretch of water the crews cheers floated back to the renewal attack thrax shouted all along the line everything we have the trumpeter blared the command to those ships near enough to hear it maniakes clapped his hands in excitement as other dromons hornplayers relayed the order to more of his vessels and then very suddenly what had been a hardfought struggle became a rout maybe that was because genesios captains saw their position turned and realized they could not keep maniakes fleet from reaching the harbors maybe too those captains saw in the determination of maniakes attack a warning of what might happen to them if they kept resisting and lost anyhow and maybe as some of them loudly proclaimed once the fight was through they found themselves unable to stomach serving genesios any longer that impressed maniakes until he remembered how long those captains had served his rival explanations came later out there on the ocean south of videssos the city what he knew was that some enemy galleys were raising all their oars high out of the water in token of surrender others turned their sterns to his fleet and fled some back toward the city others toward more distant coastal towns or out to the open sea still others stubborn or loyal fought on but more and more of them were overwhelmed as maniakes captains concentrated several dromons against each one phos be praised triphylles exclaimed soon ill be able to enjoy octopus in hot vinegar as it should be prepared maniakes had other reasons to be pleased at the victory but he was willing to let the noble find his own on to the harbor of kontoskalion he cried well enter the city and rout genesios from whatever hole he hides in beside him alvinos bagdasares murmured what might have been a prayer or a spell or a little of both the vaspurakaner mage who sometimes used a videssian name sketched the suncircle over his heart a prayer then maniakes whispered phos creed too he knew bagdasares was also worrying about genesios ferocious mage they werent in opsikion any more or on the key they were coming to videssos the city where genesios wizard would be almost as close to maniakes as the mage who protected him the harbor swiftly drew nearer people stared out toward the approaching dromons pointing and exclaiming maniakes wished he knew what they were saying if they were cursing him as a usurper surely bound for skotos ice he was going to have trouble fighting his way through the streets of the capital against an angry city mob was the last thing he wanted closer and closer the renewal came maniakes hurried to the bow of the galley and craned his neck toward the docks and the people on them he scowled in frustration all he could hear at first was a confused babbling with no distinct words then someone unmistakably yelled maniakes avtokrator maniakes waved to the crowd to show them who he was some of the men and women waved back as they might have for any incoming sailor but others got the idea a great cheer with his name in it rose from the people he felt he had gulped half a jar of wine all at once along with his name though people were also shouting that of genesios he wondered why that didnt touch off curses and fights and stabbings between the backers of the avtokrator in the city and those who favored the man just entering it all at once though a clear shouted sentence pierced the unintelligible racket genesios avtokrator is trying to flee the city phos maniakes whispered now triumph was a brew more heady than any squeezed from the grape he had known a moment even close to this only once before when his forces and his fathers had helped sharbaraz beat smerdis and take back the throne of the king of kings of makuran but even that did not compare not truly then he had been fighting for someone elses benefit now the gain could he but seize that which so nearly lay in his hands would belong to him alone dont let him get away he called to the shore five hundred goldpieces to the man who brings him to me alive or dead that stirred up the crowd round the docks some of them cheered what looked like the fall of a hated ruler others more pragmatic or perhaps just greedier pushed away to start emperorhunting maniakes nodded in satisfaction the thinner the press of people at the shore the more easily he could disembark his men and take control of the city back oars the oarmaster cried the renewal slowed sliding to a stop alongside an outthrust dock sailors sprang up and roped the dromon fast when the gangplank went out from ship to land maniakes rushed toward it wanting to be first ashore but for those sailors other men however held him back one of them said you wait your majesty let us make sure its safe up there brandishing knives and bludgeons a dozen sailors swarmed up the gangplank make way for maniakes avtokrator curse you they shouted the crowd of gawkers fell back before them though some in that crowd were as well armed as they only after the sailors had cleared some open space on the tarsmeared timbers of the pier did they wave for maniakes to follow them when he stepped off the gangplank he drew his sword and said i shall not sheath this blade until genesios the tyrant is captured as he had hoped that drew loud cheers from the crowd several men waved weapons of their own that took a certain amount of courage or at least bravado the penalty for using a sword in a street brawl in videssos the city was amputation of the thumbs kourikos and triphylles came across the gangplank after maniakes triphylles got down on his knees not to prostrate himself before the avtokrator but fervently to kiss the timbers on which he stood tar and white streaks of sea gull droppings deterring him not a bit phos be praised im home at last he cried which in its manifest sincerity drew a cheer almost as loud as the one maniakes had got maniakes pointed to a nearby man who looked reasonably bright and asked how long have the soldiers under my cousin rhegorios been outside the city since day before yesterday lord uh your majesty the fellow answered adding the guards at the wall havent attacked em but theyve held em off and not let em in they will now maniakes declared theyd better he thought or im still in trouble here please stand aside my friends and let me come take my rightful place in the city the throne wasnt exactly his rightful place he had no blood claim to it he did have though a great many armed men who were of the opinion he belonged on it he also had as his foe genesios which in and of itself went a long way toward cementing his claim more ships were tying up behind the renewal and at the quays nearby sailors swarmed ashore a cry went up where now lord to the palaces maniakes answered once we take them to the high temple to give thanks to phos for letting this day come to pass getting the ecumenical patriarchs blessing would start him off on the right foot if he didnt get the patriarchs blessing he told himself he would soon get a new ecumenical patriarch some of the sailors now on the docks bore the shields and swords dromons carried so their men could repel boarders they pushed the civilians back shouting way make way for the avtokrator i wish i had a horse maniakes said as they made their way up into the twisting maze of little streets north of the harbor of kontoskalion a cavalry officer he didnt feel as if he could see enough from ground level well get you one by phos his escorts said the first mounted man they came upon they unceremoniously dragged from the saddle had the fellow said a word of protest had he raised a hand to defend himself they would have done worse than that maniakes hadnt wanted to acquire a mount in such fashion but didnt see how he could check his men eitherhe wanted them enthusiastic on his behalf to the unhorsed rider he said come to the palaces after ive driven genesios from the throne for good youll have your beast back and gold for my use of him phos bless you then your majesty the man cried and people in the street took up the call that eased maniakes mind too having the fickle city populace on his side while he seized power could only help him from his seat atop the newly acquired horsea sedate and elderly mare with a very comfortable gait provided you werent in any hurry to get where you were goinghe could see over the heads of his men and the swarms of locals in the streets that helped him less than it would have on the battlefield for the streets themselves twisted too much to let him see far he worried about that his sailors could easily overpower any civilians who might try to stand against them but if the imperial guards or any other troops in the city decided genesios was worth fighting for his men would be up against more than they could handle they wore no armor they carried only a few spears and bows and they had no idea how to fight save as individuals disciplined soldiers would have massacred them but no soldiers appeared to try to bar his way well go north toward middle street he called to his men the main eastwest highway of videssos the city would give him a long straight stretch on which he could take his bearings finding and then keeping to north in that warren wasnt as easy as when sailing by sun and stars many buildings were tall enough to hide the sun from sight sometimes balconies almost met overhead above the streets that was supposed to be against the law but genesios had ignored laws far more important so maniakes had no reason to think he would have paid any attention to this one he had just reached middle street and was started down it toward the plaza of palamas and the palace quarter beyond when a rumor coming from farther east overtook him from behind the gates are opening people said nothe gates are open we have him maniakes said to nobody in particular if his own soldiers were in the city nothing genesios could do would stop it from falling and genesios did not seem able to do much in any case his supporters had abandoned him outside the capital and now the same looked to be happening within the only ways maniakes could see losing now were a lone assassin and genesios wizard against an assassin he could take precautions against the wizardbagdasares was tramping along beside him he didnt know if bagdasares would be good enough but he was the best available he rode past the red granite pile of the government offices he had always thought the building squat and ugly when he had been in the capital before then his opinions on architecture had mattered to no one but himself now if he wanted he could change the way videssos the city would look for generations yet to come he laughed at himself he had more urgent things to worry about people stood under the covered colonnades that ran along both sides of middle street some cheered some stared some went about their business a few people gaped from atop the colonnade too he thought that merely a curiosity until he realized it also made an ideal hiding place for a killer past clearing everyone off which would have made him look foolish he didnt know what he could do about it he reached the plaza of palamas unassassinated and stared across the broad stretch of cobbles to the lawns and splendid buildings of the palace quarter beyond the plaza was crowded with people chaffering with merchants at stalls or booths or wagons or handheld trays buying everything from cloth to jewels to octopus tentacles maniakes glanced over at triphylles other folk even on a day when the crown of the empire of videssos changed hands were out for a stroll either to take the air or simply to see and be seen the vast bulk of the amphitheater marked the southern boundary of the plaza of palamas to the west just at the edge of the palace quarter stood the milestone the granite obelisk from which all distances in the empire were measured heads in great number were affixed to it not just at the base as was usual but for some distance up toward its pointed top placards too distant to read across the square set forth the alleged crimes of each victim unless maniakes missed his guess most of those boiled down to nothing more than falling foul of genesios beside the milestone waited a small bald graybearded man in a robe of shimmering blue samite even with that fancy robe maniakes would have paid him no special attention had he not been surrounded by several soldiers in chainmail they were very nearly the first soldiers not his own he had seen in the imperial capital he turned to kourikos who is that fellow there he asked pointing the logothete of the treasury squinted that is the honor guard of the eparch of the city your majesty unless i am mistaken but i do not recognize the man whose honor they find themselves guarding whoever he is he thinks hes important maniakes said lets go over there and find out if hes right getting across the plaza of palamas wasnt easy not even with the sailors from the fleet doing their best to clear the crowds out of the way some videssians were intent on getting a close look at the man who was in the process of becoming their new avtokrator others on finishing the business for which they had come to the plaza in the first place no one wanted to get out of the way at last the sailors went from shoving and shouting to hitting people with belaying pins that touched off a few fights but did eventually persuade the crowd to move back and make way the little bald man stared anxiously as maniakes approached are yyou the man i believe you to be he asked stammering a little that depends maniakes said but if you believe im maniakes son of maniakes then youre right and who may i ask are you eminent sir the fancy robe and the armed retinue made the title a sure bet he had to wait for his answer the little man promptly prostrated himself on the cobbles of the square the delay made maniakes notice the stench from the grisly collection of heads genesios had on display at the milestone some had been packed in salt like poor hosios to keep them recognizable longer but they still smelled like a butchers shop much too long forgotten by its proprietor at last the little man arose and said your majesty i am doulikhios i have the honor to be eparch of the city at least until you make a different appointment to that position as is of course your privilege your majesty when my comrades and i left the city the eparch was a certain goulaion kourikos said doulikhios pointed to the milestone there is goulaions head he was accused of conspiring against the avtokrator uh the tyrant genesios and there below it is the head of goulaions successor evdokimos and there right at the base of the column is the head of evdokimos successor levkates evdokimos was put to the sword for the same reason as goulaion i do not know how levkates ended up displeasing genesios but he did no wonder the poor sod is nervous maniakes thought the job he was holding did not seem one where the incumbent got much chance to learn from experience well eminent doulikhios in your place i do believe id have fled to a monastery he said i tried that the eparch of the city answered bleakly genesios dragged me out and forced me into this blue robe rather than the other maniakes did not care to hear that if genesios had gone into a monastery after doulikhios he might have gone into a convent after niphone he forced himself not to think about that am i to assume eminent doulikhios that even though you are genesios appointee you do not favor him as avtokrator at the question doulikhios drew himself up with the first pride he had shown your majesty the mistake goulaion made and evdokimos and maybe levkates too for all i know was in plotting against genesios and getting caught me i plotted with abasgios the secondincommand of the imperial guardsand instead of reinforcing the troops on the land wall against your men out there they moved on the tyrant this morning you may just stay on as eparch of the city after all maniakes exclaimed we botched it doulikhios said genesios was to have been slain but he killed one of our men wounded the other and fled to the imperial harbor i fear he got away in some small boat or another well catch him or at least i hope we will maniakes said weve had ships heading that way since they broke free of the sea battle may it be so doulikhios said fervently kourikos held up a hand a moment if i may eminent doulikhios he sounded so dubious about the title it might have been an insult i have spent my entire adult life among the nobility here at the capital and i must confess i do not recall your being numbered among us may i ask from what station genesios elevated you to the eparchate well if you must know eminent sir i ran a fish market and pleased his i hope former majesty with my wares doulikhios answered your majesty kourikos cried to maniakes surely you will not allow such a high office to be filled surely you will not allow the ranks of the nobility to be polluted by this this fishseller spittle flew from his lips with the last word if he can do the job i dont see why not maniakes said kourikos goggled maniakes went on hes done me one great service already and deserves a reward for that anyhow i have no time to worry about niceties of rank right now he turned back to doulikhios leaving his prospective fatherinlaw gaping in dismay tell me at once eminent sir do you know whats become of genesios chief mage can we find him at the sorcerers collegium he heard the hot eagerness in his own voice genesios had put far too many heads up on the milestone but the wizards was one that deserved to be there i know the man you mean your majesty but no hes never had anything to do with the sorcerers collegium doulikhios answered hes never had much to do with me either for which i give thanks to the lord with the great and good mind he sketched the suncircle above his heart then shuddered he frightens me and ill not deny it hes a tall man and thin as a lath and by the look of him he was born before your greatgrandfather but they say hes strong as a soldier in first flush of youth sounds like a hard man to miss at any rate maniakes said well know him when we catch him thats certain eminent sir when kourikos spoke to doulikhios now he had scrubbed the scorn from his voice that surprised maniakes until the logothete of the treasury went on have you any news of the fate of my wife and daughter who took refuge in the convent of the holy phostina this affects more than me alone for niphone is affianced to his majesty here i dont know what to tell you eminent sir doulikhios said slowly i never heard genesios mention that name or any like it but that doesnt necessarily signify and who knows what crazy orders he might have given since we tried to kill him but didnt do it or who might have listened to them where is this convent maniakes demanded of kourikos in the northwestern corner of the city north of the makuraner district well send men there maniakes said he told off a couple of dozen sailors and to guide them found a local who knew where the convent was that done he went on as for the rest of us well secure the palace quarter eminent doulikhios you come with us if any of the soldiers there decide theyre still on genesios side maybe you can explain hes fled the fewer we have to fight the better as you say your majesty doulikhios did not prostrate himself again but he bowed almost double as maniakes was about to enter the palace quarter unrest broke out on the eastern side of the plaza of palamas the side that fronted on the rest of videssos the city he looked back over his shoulder horsemen in bright chainmail were trying to force their way through the crowd that had reformed after maniakes made his way to doulikhios at the head of those horsemen rode someone he recognized even across the broad stretch of the plaza from atop his own horse he waved vigorously rhegorios he shouted cousin to me he didnt know whether rhegorios heard him through the rack or spied him waving but his cousin waved in return and booted his horse ahead cheering the men he led followed the folk of the capital did make way for them it was that or be trampled maniakes rode back into the crowd both men were grinning from ear to ear when they finally met rhegorios sheathed the sword he carried cousin he cried and then your majesty he thrust out the hand that had held the blade maniakes clasped it genesios men are giving up and coming over to us wherever we find them he said the only true fight they showed for him was on the sea south of the city but even there once we began to turn their position they folded up videssos the city is ours that it is by the good god rhegorios said the men on the walls held us out till you came up with your fleet though they didnt fight much doing it he looked awed you dont have to do much fighting when you hold those walls and towers and gates theyd stand off the whole world so long as the soldiers atop them keep breathing the soldiers neednt do much more than that let me tell you im glad you and your riders are here maniakes said if we find holdouts anywhere theyll be in the palace quarter and you can do a better job of overawing them than a ragtag and bobtail of sailors rhegorios grin stretched wider yet do you know what cousin of mine when your brothers finally find out what weve been doing theyll want to piss themselves out of sheer jealousy i just hope theyre alive and well maniakes answered thats first second is finding them enough important things to doand rank to give them the power to do those thingsto take away the sting the state the empire is in these days that should be easy too true by the way rhegorios sat slightly straighter in the saddle and did his best to look capable and impressive he was also looking for both rank and duties that pleased maniakes rather than alarming him as he had said the empire had more than enough troubles to share out among all those who were trying to set them right come on maniakes said lets take the palaces i was about to do that when you rode up here the company is better now he turned back to his sailors onward the men cheered some of them bayed like hungry wolves maniakes went on i dont mind you coming away with a trinket or three the good god knows youve earned that but i will not stand still for murder you try killing to get your loot and your head goes up on the milestone beside genesios he did not add i mean what i say the men already knew as muchor if they didnt they would soon find out the palace quarter was a world altogether different from the hustle and bustle of the plaza of palamas the generality of city folk were not allowed to disturb the calm quiet of those lanes set amid lawns and gardens and magnificent buildings only a few bureaucrats and beardless eunuchs strolled on them when maniakes forces brought the outside world crashing in the bureaucrats fled with cries of horror so did most of the eunuchs one of them though came up to the party of horsemen who led the advance in a grave voice somewhere halfway between contralto and tenor he asked who among you is maniakes son of maniakes when maniakes walked his mare up a couple of paces the eunuch prostrated himself before him forehead still pressed to the cobbles he said on behalf of all the palace servitors your majesty i welcome you to this your new home may your years be many and your line never fail he had probably said the same thing maybe in the same words to genesios after likinios and his sons met the headsman maniakes did not hold that against him the weak were well advised to keep clear of the quarrels of those more powerful than they he said thank you esteemed sir eunuchs had their own honorifics from which he chose the highest rise please and give me your name i am called kameas your majesty and have the honor to be vestiarios at the imperial residence kameas deserved that high honorific then he headed all the avtokrators servants if the avtokrator was weak the vestiarios might become the most important man in the empire maniakes did not intend to let that happen he said when genesios fled the palaces did he take with him whatever family he has no your majesty kameas answered gravely his wife and his young son and daughter remain in the imperial residence awaiting your pleasure he licked his lips if maniakes had a taste for blood he would learn of it right now i dont want to see them maniakes said if the woman and girl go into a convent and the boy to a monastery that will satisfy me take them that message from me but tell them also that if they ever try to come out or meddle in politics their heads will answer for it i do not want them to confuse mercy for weaknesstell them that too i shall carry your words exactly as you have spoken them after a moment kameas added it will be good to have in the palaces once more an avtokrator who understands the meaning of the word mercy with a bow he set off for the imperial residence maniakes went on more slowly he rode past the hall of the nineteen couches where fancy banquets were held the buildings great bronze doors stood open as if inviting him in he was hardly more eager to dine there than to see genesios family the couches were for reclining while one ate an antique style of feasting that had passed away everywhere save the palace quarter he felt sure he would make a hash of it the first time he tried it he turned aside from the straight road to the imperial residence so he could examine the grand courtroom it too had portals of bronze these ones worked with reliefs so perfectly realistic they almost seemed to move large wings swept out to either side from the courtroom itself bureaucrats peered out from windows in those wings as long as maniakes men did not harm them in this moment of transition the change of rulers would affect them but little if they were massacred who would administer the empire in their stead to one of them maniakes called whats behind that grove of trees there off to the southwest thats a chapel to phos sir the man answered not realizing he was speaking to his sovereign its been there many years but seldom used of late most emperors have preferred to worship at the high temple instead i can understand that maniakes answered he had trouble seeing how any man given a choice would worship anywhere save at the high temple he stayed there a while chatting with the functionary both to learn more about the buildings of the palace quarter and to give kameas a chance to get genesios family out of the imperial residence without his officially having to notice them when shouts and cries came from the west he feared genesios wife and children were raising such a fuss that he would have to let them come to his attention but these were yells of joy and excitement all in mens deep voices before long he caught one rising above the rest weve got him he dug his knees into the sides of the mare he was riding the horse snorted indignantly at such treatment how dare a rider try to rouse her to speed maniakes dared and forced her into a reluctant trot youve got whom he called as his men streamed after him have you laid hold of genesios when someone answered aye by phos his heart leapt within him genesios would not get away to stir up yet another round of civil war his men loosed a torrent of cheers that soon formed words of their own thou conquerest maniakes avtokrator sailors came capering toward him from the direction of the harbor for the palace quarter the imperial residence also lay in that direction again he hoped kameas had got genesios wife and children away he wanted to spare them this but whether they were off to convent and monastery or not he gave the order he had to give fetch genesios here before me at once the sailors peeled back toward the anchorage shouting his words ahead of them he rode on after the men before long they came in his direction again shoving along a man whose hands were tied behind his back maniakes recognized genesios at once the engraver at the imperial mint had accurately portrayed the mans features wide forehead narrow chin a short thin fringe of beard long straight nose now though genesios did not wear the crown and rich robes that marked an avtokrator of the videssians he was bareheadedand maniakes noted with a touch of malice going baldand wore a plain linen tunic that came down to his knees garb a fisherman might don before going out to work his nets blood soaked the tunic now genesios must have fought before he was captured he had a deep gash in his left arm and a cut across his forehead more blood dripped from the slate on which he stood a trail of it led back toward the harbor genesios maniakes thought had left a trail of blood through the empire ever since he murdered his way into the red boots he looked up at maniakes his face showed pain but not much fear maniakes remembered he had been a combat soldier all right you have me he said his voice was deep with the accent of a peasant from the westlands he didnt ask what maniakes was going to do with himhe had to have figured that out for himself aye i have you maniakes said how could you have let videssos come to such a pass he hadnt intended to ask that it came out almost as a cry of pain murky defiance lit in genesios eyes youre on top now and you think youre such a great lord he said but will you do any better by phos i hope so maniakes exclaimed he looked around to the men who crowded close to see genesios he raised the sword he had carried ever since he set foot in videssos the city now that the moment was come though he gulped he had done plenty of fighting but he had never been an executioner before kneel he told genesios when genesios wouldnt he spoke to the men who had frogmarched the defeated avtokrator through the palace quarter make him kneel they forced genesios to his knees he cursed them and maniakes and videssos all together a torrent of vileness that had men making the sunsign to turn aside words of evil omen maniakes clasped his blade twohanded brought it up and swung it with all his strength it bit into genesios neck with a meaty chunnk his curses cut off in midword blood spurted impossibly red in the bright sun his body convulsed his bowels and bladder let go maniakes swung the sword again to sever his head completely take it through the city he told his cheering followers let everyone see genesios is dead then it will go up on the milestone the cheers grew louder fiercer he held up a hand but that will be the end of it we wont stop his slaughter to start our own what shall we do with the body your majesty someone asked it was still twitching feebly burn it maniakes answered which prompted fresh cheers he hadnt intended that he had only wanted to get rid of a piece of carrion but now that it was done he wouldnt turn aside the acclaim either he rode on toward the imperial residence like the chapel it was screened by trees cherries here they would be beautiful in springtime when they blossomed the rest of the year they were just there the residence itself was as unprepossessing a structure as any in the palace quarter unlike most of the other buildings it looked like a place where a man might actually live rather than be put on display some of the soldiers who guarded the imperial residence were videssians others big blond halogai who made maniakes think of rotrude kameas must have already come and gone for as soon as maniakes finished winding his way down the path through the cherry grove all the guardsmen shouted thou conquerest maniakes avtokrator they went to their knees and then their bellies honoring him with a full proskynesis get up get up he said not wanting to make them resent himafter all they would be protecting him now you served genesios better than he deserved i hope youll serve me bravely too thou conquerest the guards cried again which he took for assent he swung down off his horse he wanted to see what the imperial residence looked like on the inside ill be living here the rest of my days he thought whether those be long or short from the shade of the doorway pale smooth eunuch faces stared out at him like the guards the servitors had to be wondering what sort of new master they would have maniakes had just set his foot on the low broad marble stairs that led up to the entrance when a breathless voice from behind him called your majesty come quick theres fighting in the northwest he spun round to face the panting messengers cant my officers handle it he snapped if they cant what do i have them for then a possible answer occurred to him and urgency replaced anger in his voice is it at the convent dedicated to the holy phostina aye your majesty the messenger said a company of soldiers loyal to genesios was trying to force their way in the nuns had shut up the convent against them they were doing their best to smash down the door when your men came up but you didnt send enough to check them they may be inside by now and the good god only knows what outrages theyll work kourikos groaned maybe only phos knew what outrages genesios men might commit but he could imagine my daughter he cried piteously and then a moment slower than he should have my wife maniakes sprang back onto the mare im on my way he said rhegorios you and all your horses with me that would leave the palace quarter to the doubtful mercy of the sailors but it couldnt be helped horsemen would reach the convent in half the time folk on foot required the mare didnt want to trot let alone gallop maniakes was in no mood to heed an animals whims lacking spurs he whacked it with the flat of the blade he had used to take genesios head once her attention was gained the mare proved to have a fair turn of speed after all from behind kourikos called wait but maniakes would not wait gangway he shouted as he and his men neared the plaza of palamas for a moment after that he glimpsed a sea of startled faces all staring toward him then with cries of alarm people scattered every which way some of them trampling others to keep the onrushing horses from trampling them he didnt think his mount ran over anyone horses didnt care to step on the soft wiggling things people became when they fell to the ground but from the screams that rose in back of him some of the animals of his riders had been imperfectly careful about where they set their feet he had thundered out onto middle street before he realized he didnt know exactly where in the northwestern quadrant of the city the convent dedicated to the holy phostina lay he shouted the question back over his shoulder i can find it your majesty one of his men said i grew up not far from there come forward then maniakes said and slowed his mare to let the city man take the lead the mare snorted indignantly as if asking him to make up his mind first hed called for more speed so how dared he check her now the animal complained again when he booted it in the ribs to make it keep up with the horse his guide was riding once they swung north off middle street the journey through the city became a nightmare for maniakes the streets were narrow and winding he couldnt gallop full tilt no matter how much he wanted to and if a muledrawn wagon or donkey cart blocked the way not all his curses or threats would clear the road for him until the driver could find a corner and turn at last he heard shouts of alarm and fury ahead that seemed to have nothing to do with the panic his own passage was causing he muttered a quick prayer to phos that they meant he was coming to the convent a moment later he burst out into the open space of a small square and found his prayer had been granted blood splashed the cobbles of the square a lot of the sailors he had sent were down some dead others thrashing with wounds others were down with them men whose chainmail proclaimed them genuine soldiers a good many more of them were trying to break into the convent dedicated to the holy phostina they werent having an easy time of it beneath the whitewash the walls of the convent were solid stone the windows mere slits too narrow to let a man through the door was the only vulnerable pointand it didnt seem any too vulnerable either genesios men here were all videssiansthey had no axewielding halogai to make short work of the stout timbers they had found a long thick board to use as a ram but just as maniakes rode into the square the nuns poured a large tub of hot water down onto their attackers the soldiers staggered back from the door howling with pain yield or die maniakes shouted at them and at the rest of the guardsmen trying to find other ways into the convent the soldiers who had followed genesios toand pastthe end stared in horrified dismay as cavalrymen some with swords some with light lances but most with bows filled the open space in front of the building a couple of genesios men stepped away from the convent and toward maniakes and his followers with weapons still in hand bowstrings twanged the guardsmen fell screaming and twisting on the cobblestones that was plenty to give their comrades the idea swords clattered as men threw them down maniakes waved some of his soldiers forward to take charge of the prisoners glumly they let their hands be tied behind their backs and filed off into captivity maniakes rode closer to the convent wallbut not too close to the nuns at the secondstory window he called i am maniakes son of maniakes now avtokrator of the videssians genesios the tyrant is dead may i approach and confer with your abbess without fear of being boiled like a capon in a holiday stew the nuns disappeared from the window without answering after a couple of minutes another older woman appeared there i am nikaia abbess of the convent dedicated to the memory of the holy phostina she said and maniakes believed her at once her voice held authority any general would have been glad to own she looked him over from beneath the blue headscarf that concealed her hair then went on how may i serve you your majesty by the hesitation she remained imperfectly convinced he was who he claimed to be he said i am told by the eminent kourikos logothete of the treasury that you have taking refuge within your walls his wife and daughter as you will probably know i am betrothed to niphone now that i am returned to videssos the city now that the eminent kourikos has accompanied me here i would have you tell the noble ladies they are free and safe to come forth into the world once more should they so desire we have no noble ladies here only those who serve the lord with the great and good mind nikaia answered sternly wait there if you will as the nuns had before her the abbess left the window she returned in a little while with another nun and pointed out at maniakes he heard her ask is that the man was that niphone there maniakes stared up at the window as the nun stared down at him she was young he could see that much but her head scarf robbed her of much of her individuality and he discovered the picture of his fiancee he had carried in his mind these past six years of exile had faded over time he remembered niphone as having a long rather thin face with delicate features and large eyes that could have been she at the window but he would not have dared take oath on it whoever the woman was she seemed similarly troubled she said mistress i believe that is the younger maniakes buti have trouble being certain her voice was not far from what maniakes remembered niphones sounding like yet again he could not be sure he called her name she waved and nodded he waited for a great surge of love and affection to pour from his heart and warm him from head to toe he had been waiting to see her again for six years after all the surge didnt quite come or rather did come but wasnt nearly so large as he had expected he carried on as if it had been saying to nikaia holy abbess i ask you again will you release this woman and her mother from the vows they took more to protect themselves from genesios evil designs than to resign from the world forever not that they are not pious of course he added hastily niphone retreated nikaia came forward i have seen their piety these past months your majesty the abbess said and it is far from inconsiderable but in any case i have not the power to release them from vows they took of their own free will here in videssos the city that power rests only in the hands of the most holy ecumenical patriarch agathios if he so orders and if the women be willing i shall in obedience let them come forth from my convent until that time i reckon them nuns no different from any others maniakes admired her courage and rectitude however much of a nuisance he found them if he tried to disregard the abbess wishes and take niphone from the convent dedicated to the holy phostina without patriarchal leave he had no doubt boiling water would come rain down on him he told nikaia ill see the most holy agathios then to rhegorios he said leave a third of your men here to make sure we have no more problems with diehardsoh and send a rider back to the eminent kourikos so he knows his wife and daughter are safe and well you and the rest of your men will come with me to the high temple though both the convent and the high temple lay in the northern part of videssos the city the fastest way to go from one to the other was to drop back down to middle street ride west along it to the avenue that led up to the chief shrine of the videssian faith and then travel north along that avenue from the outside the high temple was massive rather than magnificent the stout walls of golden stone needed to support the great central dome bore no special ornament as with most videssian homes the treasures were on the inside hidden from external view maniakes called to a priest ascending the low broad stairs that led up to the entrance holy sir is the most holy patriarch at his devotions within the priest needed no more than a heartbeat to realize who would approach the high temple with hundreds of armed men at his back bowing he replied no your majesty i believe he is at present in the patriarchal residence nearby he pointed the high temple dwarfed the residence though anywhere else in the city it would have been reckoned a house of respectable size a number of cypresses gnarled and hoary with age grew around it with a word of thanks maniakes led his troopers to the patriarchal residence he dismounted and rhegorios at his side walked up to the entrance and rapped on the door the priest who answered was not an old man as he knew agathios to be nor decked in the magnificent patriarchal vestments and the skyblue boots that were as much a prerogative of videssos chief prelates as red ones were for the avtokrator as a lot of people had done over the past few hours the priest asked you are his majesty the avtokrator maniakes maniakes wondered if he should make a sign and hang it around his neck he contented himself with saying yes here with me is my cousin rhegorios and you holy sir my name is skombros your majesty the priest replied i have the honor to be synkellos to the most holy agathios that meant he was agathios secretary assistant and at need keeper and watchdog for the avtokrator i am pleased to meet you holy sir take me to the ecumenical patriarch at once bowing skombros turned and obeyed maniakes followed him with rhegorios another pace behind the patriarchal residence struck maniakes as pleasant without being splendid prelates were sworn to poverty though not all of them took their vows seriously oaths aside a greater display of luxury would not have surprised maniakes skombros rapped on a closed door a soft voice answered the synkellos worked the latch the most holy agathios ecumenical patriarch of the videssians awaits you your majestyand you eminent sir he tacked on the last four words for rhegorios benefit maniakes went into the chamber only to be met by agathios pointing finger which the patriarch wielded as if it were a spear will you presume to make alterations in videssos pure and holy and orthodox faith he thundered his voice soft no more his eyes flashed his long white beard seemed to crackle and stand away from his face as if lightning had struck nearby his beaky nose had the curve of a kubrati scimitar he was in short a most alarmingly holy old man he had however chosen a question maniakes could answer without qualm of conscience no most holy sir he said and watched agathios deflate like a punctured pigs bladder oh thats very good the ecumenical patriarch said his eyes stopped blazing even his beard seemed to relax sounding much more like a grandfather than a righteous wrathful cleric he said i was concerned because of your vaspurakaner blood your majesty heresy on the throne is a dreadful thing you need have no fears on that account maniakes answered he wondered what his father would say upon learning he had opted for unabashed orthodoxy something interesting and memorable he had no doubt but he was also sure the elder maniakes would recognize the need thats excellent excellent now agathios was beaming his sudden swings put maniakes in mind of a weathervanehe seemed liable to blow in any direction and to swing from one to another without warning the patriarch said would you have me crown you now then your majesty later today will do nicely i would ask something else of you first maniakes said agathios bushy white eyebrows rose what could be more important than an imperial coronation maniakes explained what the abbess nikaia had demanded of him this is truly the wish of these women the patriarch demanded most holy sir would i lie about such a matter causing a rift with my own prelate before he has even set the crown on my head if you are wise you would not agathios said but who can tell yet whether you are wise meaning no disrespect to you your majestyphos forbidwe have seen our share and more of stupidity these past halfdozen years and more maniakes agreed before he could again ask the ecumenical patriarch to relieve his fiancee and her mother from the vows they had taken at the convent agathios called skombros fetch me pen parchment and sealing waxat once certainly most holy sir the synkellos replied from the hall hovering near agathios was part of his job he soon returned with the articles the patriarch had asked of him agathios inked the pen and wrote rapidly when he was done he showed the note to maniakes it was the release he had requested couched in florid ecclesiastical style nodding he returned it to the patriarch agathios rolled up the parchment tied a ribbon around it and then picked up a lamp he used the flame from the wick to melt several drops of his special skyblue sealing wax so they fell onto the parchment and the ribbon while the wax was still soft he pressed his signet ring into it when he lifted the ring the mark of his monogram remained in the wax with a flourish he handed maniakes the completed document thank you most holy sir maniakes said he turned to rhegorios take this back to the convent dedicated to the holy phostina fast as you can ride then if she will bring niphone here to me the most holy agathios will wed us and then proclaim us avtokrator and empress i like that by the good god rhegorios exclaimed his eyes sparkling youll put on two different crowns the same day maniakes laughed true enough videssian custom was for a man and woman who joined together to don wreaths called crowns of marriage it must be phos will your majesty agathios said to see you revealed as bridegroom and avtokrator on the same day i pray it proves a good omen maniakes said soberly he slapped rhegorios on the back while youre at it bring niphones mother the lady phevronia as well and send riders to the palaces too kameas will know where the true imperial crown is id sooner have the most holy patriarch set it on my head than have him use some substitute the same goes for the empress crown and well need to bring the eminent kourikos here as well to watch his daughter wed rhegorios frowned in concentration let me make sure i have all that he said and repeated it back maniakes listened then nodded pleased with his cousin independent command seemed to have made rhegorios more responsible than he had been he saluted with a clenched fist over his heart then left the patriarchs chamber at a run he almost ran over skombros in the hallway maniakes listened to them exchanging apologies then rhegorios footsteps receded rapidly that made agathios snap his fingers in annoyance at himself here i sit forgetting my manners i crave pardon your majesty he raised his voice skombros fetch cakes and wine for the avtokrator he shook his head these should have come before business not after most holy sir ceremony is all very well in its place but sometimes business has such urgency that it must lead maniakes replied the ecumenical patriarch looked doubtful maniakes wondered if here unwittingly he had spoken heresy for the first time skombros returned with food and drink on a silver tray the cakes left maniakes fingers so sticky he had to lick them clean honey and chopped nuts between layers of thin flaky pastry the wine came golden from the jar into the silver cups that stood on the tray maniakes was no great connoisseur of such things but he knew a noble vintage when he tasted one when agathios emptied his cup skombros poured it full againand a little while later again then yet again and once more the ecumenical patriarch seemed little affected by all he drank but maniakes noted how much that was he wondered if skombros had wanted him to note it a synkellos loyalty was liable to lie as much with the avtokrator as with the patriarch i shall pray for your success against the troubles besetting us from every side your majesty agathios said only slightly slow speech showing the wine he had taken on how shall you drive the makuraners forth from the westlands while the heathen kubratoi oppress us from the north that was a good question it was in fact the very question maniakes had been pondering since hed rebelled against genesios most holy sir the one thing i know for certain is that we cant fight them both at once given the parlous state to which the empire had descended he wasnt altogether sure videssos could fight either one of its principal foes but he did not tell that to agathios it was not the sort of thought he wanted noised about and he was not sure how far he could trust either patriarch or synkellos will you make peace with one so that you may pursue war against the other agathios persisted it could be so maniakes held up a hand till now ive worried more about casting genesios down from the throne he stole than what i would do once i held the throne myself that wasnt strictly true but it gave him an excuse not to go into details about his plans skombros said since you were benefactor to sharbaraz king of kings perhaps he will give over his war against videssos when he hears you have become avtokrator phos grant it be so anyhow perhaps maniakes said though he didnt believe it as custom requires i shall send him an embassy announcing my accession as soon as i can then well see and against the kubratoi skombros asked he was so long used to keeping track of what the patriarch said and did and planned he automatically assumed he had the same right with the avtokrator right now holy sir i dont know what ill do maniakes replied and in that he was completely truthful when i have an answer be sure you will know along with the rest of the videssos skombros bowed his head recognizing he had just been reminded of his place in the world heard dimly down the hall the racket outside the patriarchal residence suddenly swelled agathios said to skombros go see if that betokens the arrival of his majestys bride or that of her father the synkellos returned with kourikos and with kameas as well the vestiarios was bearing not only the bejeweled dome of the imperial crown but also a pair of red boots and a stout shield on which the soldiers would raise maniakes symbolizing their acceptance of him as commander he could no more rule without their blessing than without the patriarchs we would not want the ceremony celebrated imperfectly kameas said with great seriousness maniakes nodded stories said eunuchs were often fussily precise stories said a good many things though here for once they did not seem far wrong maniakes resolved to find ways in which kameas character could best serve him kourikos said thank you your majesty for sending me word my daughter and wife are safe it was something you needed to know maniakes cocked his head the noise outside was rising again he smiled and unless im much mistaken here they are now he turned to agathios most holy sir were ready for you morning sun sneaking in through the shutters stabbed maniakes in the eye and woke him he yawned stretched sat up in bed the motion disturbed niphone who also opened her eyes he didnt know whether she was a naturally light sleeper or simply unused to sharing her bed with a man she smiled at him and made no effort to pull up the sheets to cover herself as she had on the morning after they were wed hed laughed then perhaps too loudly he hadnt wanted to embarrass her he had wanted a modest bride and by all indications had got one modesty should have limits though or so he thought he wasnt sure she agreed i hope you slept well your majesty she said formal as well as modest he had thought well of that too till he found himself faced with the prospect of being yoked to it for as long as they both should live truth was he missed rotrude missed her openness her easygoing acceptance and the mind of her own that she most definitely had the next opinion niphone expressed about anything more profound than the state of the weather would be her first very softly maniakes sighed to himself he missed rotrude for other reasons too niphones approach to the marriage bed was dutiful little more he had grown used to a partner who enjoyed what she was doing he didnt think that was just because niphone was only now passing from maidenhood either it sprang from a basic bit of who she was he sighed again sometimes you had to make do with what you found in life niphone tugged on a bell pull down the hall a chime sounded in a maidservants room the serving woman came in to help the empress dress when she was done maniakes rang for kameas with a different bell pull the vestiarios slept in the room next to the imperial bedchamber good morning your majesty the eunuch said which robe shall it be today the red perhaps or the light blue with the golden embroidery the plain dark blue will do fine maniakes answered as you wish of course although the light blue would go better with the gown your lovely empress has chosen kameas said gently inflexible he nodded politely to niphone she returned the gesture she was modest around kameas and maniakes approved of that he had watched the way the eunuch eyed women all longing with no possibility of satisfying it having kameas in the bedchamber while niphone robed herself would just have reminded the vestiarios the more strongly of his condition and how will you break your fast your majesty kameas asked once maniakes robethe dark blue one he had got his own waywas draped in a fashion of which he approved the cook has some fine young squab if i may offer a suggestion yes theyd do nicely i think maniakes said tell him to broil me a couple and to bring them to me with bread and honey and a cup of wine he glanced over at niphone what about you my dear just bread and honey i think she answered these past few days ive not had much of an appetite by maniakes standards she had never had much of an appetite maybe you got used to short commons in the convent of the holy phostina he said it could be so niphone said indifferently the food here is far better though kameas bowed to her i shall tell the cook as much and tell him of your requirementsand yours your majesty he added for maniakes benefit before he went out the door after breakfast maniakes and rhegorios put their heads together his cousin was serving as his sevastoshis chief ministerfor the time being he had sent a letter summoning the elder maniakes and symvatios to the capital but it was still on the way to kalavria he had also sent letters to the westlands after his brothers but only the lord with the great and good mind knew whenor ifthose letters would get to them for now maniakes used the man upon whom he could most rely he flapped a parchment in front of rhegorios face look at this he exclaimedrhetorically for rhegorios had already seen the despatch imbros sacked by the kubratoi half the wall pulled down half the town burned more than half the people run off to kubrat so they can grow crops for the nomads how am i supposed to fight off the makuraners if the kubratoi send everything to the ice up in the north rhegorios sighed your majesty you cant maniakes nodded id pretty much decided the same thing for myself but i wanted to hear someone else say it too he also sighed that means ill have to buy off the khagan of the kubratoi i hate it but i dont see any other choice i just pray old etzilios wont want too much how much is in the treasury rhegorios asked he managed a wry grin if you dont know ill ask your fatherinlaw hed tell me right down to the last copper the last copper is about whats there maniakes laughed bitterly no i take that back there are rats nests and spiderwebs too not much in the way of gold though nor even silver i hope skotos makes genesios eat gold and silver down there in the ice he paused to spit on the floor in rejection of the dark god then went on for all i know genesios was eating them up here too for he certainly pissed them away maybe phos knows what he spent his gold on but i dont whatever it was he got no good from it and of course with the makuraners raging through the westlands and the kubratoi raiding down almost to the walls of the city here a lot of taxes have gone uncollected rhegorios said that doesnt help the treasury either too right it doesnt maniakes said im worried etzilios will decide he can steal more than im able to give him or he might decide to take what youve given him and then go on stealing rhegorios put in youre a cheerful soul arent you maniakes said so he might ill offer him forty thousand goldpieces the first year of a truce fifty thousand the second year and sixty the third thatll give him good reason to keep an agreement all the way through to the end so it will rhegorios said it will also give you more time to scrape together the bigger sums youre reading my mind maniakes said i even went over to the sorcerers collegium to see if they could conjure up gold for me if i hadnt been avtokrator theyd have laughed in my face now that i think on it that makes sense if they could conjure up gold whenever they wanted it theyd be rich no theyd be richer than rich so they would rhegorios said but tell me you didnt go there for another reason too to see if theyd had any luck tracking down genesios pet wizard for you cant do it maniakes admitted i wish id had some luck but theyve seen no sign of him and their sorcery cant find him either they dont want to say it out loud but i get the feeling theyre scared of him that terrible old man one of their wizards called him and no one knows what his name was if hes so old maybe he dropped dead while you were taking the city or maybe genesios took his head for not finishing you but never got the chance to hang it up on the milestone rhegorios said maybe maniakes said though he remained unconvincedsuch endings for villains were more the stuff of romance than real life i just hope videssos never sees him again in earnest of that hope he sketched the suncircle above his heart triphylles rose from the proskynesis he had gone into after kameas led him to the chamber in the imperial residence maniakes used for private audiences how may i serve you your majesty he murmured as he took a chair normally that was but a polite formality now maniakes intended to ask important service of triphylles i have a mission in mind for you excellent sir he answered complete it satisfactorily and i shall enroll you among those reckoned eminent in the empire command me your majesty triphylles cried striking a dramatic pose while seated wasnt easy but he managed to serve the empire is my only purpose in existing being promoted to the highest level of videssian nobility might never have entered his mind all videssos is indebted to your intrepid spirit maniakes said which made triphylles preen even more the avtokrator went on i knew i could not have chosen a better bolder man to take my words to etzilios the khagan of kubrat with you as my envoy i am confident my embassy to him will succeed triphylles opened his mouth but whatever he had started to say seemed stuck in his throat his florid fleshy face turned even redder than usual then pale at last he managed to reply you do me too much honor your majesty i am unworthy to bring your word to the fearsome barbarian maniakes got the idea that triphylles was more worried by etzilios fearsomeness than his own unworthiness he said i am sure you will do splendidly excellent sir after all you so bravely endured the privations at kastavala and on our return journey to the capital that i am sure youll have no trouble withstanding a few more as you journey up into kubrat no sooner had he said that than he realized triphylles might not have to travel to kubrat for all he knew etzilios might still be on videssian soil after sacking imbros triphylles said i endured these hardships in the expectation of returning here to the capital if i beard the vicious nomad in his den what hope have i of faring home again its not so bad as that excellent sir maniakes said soothingly the kubratoi havent murdered an envoy of ours in close to thirty years for some reason that left triphylles inadequately heartened maniakes went on besides youll be going up there to offer etzilios gold hes not likely to kill you because then he wouldnt get paid ah your majesty you dont know how that relieves my mind triphylles said maniakes stared at the noble he had not suspected triphylles had such sarcasm in him when the grandee didnt say anything more maniakes kept looking at him at last triphylles wilted under that steadfast gaze very well your majesty i shall do as you request he muttered sullenly thank you and may the lord with the great and good mind watch over you and decide the test in your favor maniakes said when triphylles still looked glum he went on im not asking you to do anything i wont do myself when the agreement is made etzilios and i will have to meet face to face to ratify it aye your majesty if the agreement is made triphylles said if he chooses to slice me in strips and roast me over a horsedung fire though you wont be coming after me to share my fate i will come after you if that happens maniakes said ill come after you with the whole weight of the army of videssos behind me to avenge the outrage or as much of the videssian army as i can afford to commit what with the makuraners rampaging through the westlands he thought he did not share the qualification with triphylles having yielded triphylles got up to go as he headed for the door he muttered again this time to himself maniakes did not catch all of it but what he did hear angered him triphylles was complaining about having to go off to discomfort again after enduring so much of it in putting maniakes on the throne halt maniakes snapped as if to an insubordinate cavalry trooper triphylles peered back over his shoulder in alarm maniakes said if you worked to set me on the throne for no better reason than to let yourself come back to the fleshpots of the capital you made a mistake i thought you wanted me to rule to set videssos problems to rights that is what i propose doing and to do it i will seize any tool that comes to handincluding you triphylles bit his lip nodded and took his leave before maniakes could find any other reason to give him assignments he did not want maniakes plucked at his beard wondering if he should have pretended to turn a deaf ear toward the grandees grumbles on reflection he decided he probably should have but it was too late to change his mind now he could only go forward from what he had already done when you got down to it that was all videssos could do too but he was trying to take the empire forward from what genesios had done and so far as he could tell genesios had done everything wrong meeting a returning envoy in the grand courtroom meant donning red boots heavy ceremonial robe and the even heavier imperial crown in the hot muggy weather of videssos the city in summer that was a torment maniakes would just as soon have evaded but kameas politely insisted an emissary returning from the court of the king of kings could not with propriety be met in the imperial residence maniakes was discovering that while he ruled the empire his vestiarios was in charge of the palaces fuming and sweating maniakes perched himself on the imperial throne and waited for his ambassador to make the long slow advance between rows of marble columns sphrantzes was a man of an old noble family one of the bureaucrats who did their best to keep the empire on course even with a genesios on the throne maniakes had sent him to sharbaraz because he was both persuasive and honest no more common a combination in videssos the city than anywhere else he prostrated himself before maniakes turning what was for most people an awkward gesture of respect into one as flowing and graceful as part of a dance then rose with the same fluid ease he was about fifty with a gray beard and a long handsome thoughtful face one capable of expressing every shade of emotion he felt how did you fare eminent sir maniakes asked the logothetes and courtiers and functionaries who lined the way from the entrance to the throne leaned forward to hear better sphrantzes face grew longer yet your majesty i regret i must tell you i failed in every particular he said his voice was deep and vibrant a fit vehicle for the energy that filled him say on maniakes answered confessing failure before the avtokrator and his court took courage most men would have claimed at least partial success before admitting such failures as they could not possibly deny the ambassador ticked off points on his fingers as he spoke item sharbaraz does not recognize you as avtokrator of the videssians he continues the mimeshow of believing and claiming that the videssian in fancy robes he keeps by himself is hosios son of likinios i knew hosios your majesty and this lout is no hosios i knew him myself and recognized his head when it came to kastavala maniakes said so i know you are right about that go on item he will not give over the war he is waging against videssos he says until he sets the false hosios on the throne you now occupy your majesty this he terms obtaining vengeance for likinios his benefactor he conveniently forgets the maniakai his benefactors maniakes said my father and i led the men who fought and bled to set him back on his own throne and by the good god i wish wed never done it item he claims all videssian territory his armies have overrun to be annexed to makuran his claim is that he shall hold it in trust for hosios until the pretenders accession to the imperial throne sphrantzes raised an eyebrow in an elegant display of wellbred skepticism maniakes translated without effort hell keep it forever he means he wasnt arrogant when he knew he needed our help amazing what half a dozen years with nobody to tell him no have done every word maniakes said was true he also felt those words as a warning to himself who here in videssos the city would tell him when he was being cruel or arrogant or foolish rhegorios might the elder maniakes would when he got to the city past them though everyone knew currying favor with the avtokrator was the way to rise nobody had told genesios no that was certain like a sad bell sphrantzes tolled on item he proclaims all vaspurakan annexed to makuran in perpetuity under other circumstances that would have infuriated maniakes as it was it seemed only to add insult to injury laughing he said let him proclaim or simply claim whatever he likes videssos and the princes of vaspurakan will have more to say about that than he does as you say your majesty sphrantzes replied maniakes thought he heard approval in the diplomats voice no less than sharbaraz maniakes own officials were taking his measure in the early days of his reign he said did the king of kings show any interest in my offer of tribute videssos could not really afford to pay tribute to makuran and kubrat at the same time but could afford war with either let alone both even less if he could get a breathing spell no other way maniakes was willing to buy one but sphrantzes mournfully shook his head your majesty he says that since you are not the legitimate ruler of the empire of videssosi hasten to add that these are his words not mineyou have no right even to propose tribute to him he adds that once his hosios is installed on your throne he will regulate such matters to suit his own convenience and he adds further that you need not pay him tribute since he takes whatever he wants from videssos as things stand now that made the assembled courtiers mutter angrily among themselves it angered maniakes too sighing he said the wretch is revealed to be a man without gratitude my father and i set him on his throne now he begrudges me my place on this one by the good god eminent sir if he wants war so badly war he shall have the courtiers cried thou conquerest maniakes their acclamations came echoing back from the domed ceiling of the grand courtroom maniakes though knew he had only echoes of the videssian army that had preserved the balance against makuran for so long as far as he could tell only two reliable regiments remained in the westlands when he finally did go forth to confront sharbaraz he would have to build up his forces from scratch to sphrantzes he added eminent sir i am grateful for your courage and tact you have served the empire well not so well as i should have liked your majesty sphrantzes answered well spokena model we can all look up to maniakes said in these times though the empire is in such a state that no one can do as much as he would like if everyone does his best that will have to be enoughand if everyone does his best i do not see how we shall fail of victory the courtiers cheered again with apparently sincere enthusiasm maniakes had already learned to be wary of that but trying truly to fire them was part of doing his best he hoped he could be good enough delicious maniakes said the chef had done something interesting with mullet sauteeing it in white wine and serving it up with a sauce of liquamen and garlic cloves baked in goose fat till they were soft and brown and tender the garlic and fermented tunny were a perfect complement to the mullets firm tender flesh or so maniakes thought at any rate but while he was devouring his portion and soaking a heel of bread in the sauce left on his plate niphone picked at her supper and pushed it aside after two or three bites are you feeling well he asked it was hard to be sure in ruddy lamplight but he thought she looked pale she hadnt eaten much at supper for several days now that he thought back on it or at breakfast either i think so she said listlessly fanning the air with her hand its close in here isnt it maniakes stared at her the window to the small dining room was open and admitted a cool breeze from off the cattle crossing are you feeling well he repeated his voice sharper this time like army camps cities were breeding grounds for illnesses of all sorts videssos the city had the finest sorcerous healers in the worldand needed them instead of answering him in words niphone yawned covering her mouth with her hand i dont know whats come over me she said lately i want to go to bed as soon as the sun goes down and then sleep till noon theres more to life than a mattressor so i would have thought till now she certainly hadnt had much interest in matters of the mattress other than sleeping maniakes had to clamp his jaw shut to keep from saying something sardonic the last time he had made love to her she had complained his caresses made her breasts sore though he didnt think he was doing anything different from the way he had stroked her since the day they became both man and wife and emperor and empress with that sarcastic retort still sizzling inside him he wondered if he could find a discreet way to bring rotrude to the imperial capital she had never grumbled about his technique except for a couple of months when by the good god maniakes said softly he pointed a forefinger at niphone as if she were the key bit of evidence in a case he had to decide and so in a way she was still quietly he asked could it be youre carrying a child the way she gaped at him said the idea hadnt crossed her mind till now i dont know she said which annoyed him a little a precise man himself he preferred precise people around him but even if she didnt keep mental track of things as well as she might she was not a fool she started counting on her fingers by the time she was done an internal glow lit her face more brightly than the lamps could why i think i am she exclaimed my courses should have come ten days ago maniakes hadnt noticed their failure either for which he reproached himself he got up from the table and wrapped his arms around niphone i wont pester you about eating any more he said not for a while i know youll be doing the best you can a shadow crossed his wifes face so fast he could hardly be sure he saw it but he was niphone knew how he knew she knew about rotrude and about atalarikhos he hadnt spoken of them himself on the assumption that what he had done before he married her was his business but she had mentioned them a couple of times casually in passing he didnt know whether kourikos had told her himself or mentioned them to his wife who passed the news to niphone however it had happened he was less than overjoyed about it by what seemed a distinct effort of will niphone made her features smooth and serene she said i shall pray to the lord with the great and good mind that i give you a son and heir may it be so maniakes said and then musingly in makuran i think the wizards have ways to tell whether a child yet unborn will be a boy or a girl if our videssian mages cant do as well ill be surprised and disappointed he chuckled the wizards wont want to disappoint the avtokrator not after living through genesios reign they wont niphone said more spiritedly than she usually spoke anyone who got on his wrong side went up on the milestone without ever getting the chance to make amends she shuddered everyone in videssos the city had memories of horror from the halfdozen years just past i am not the sort of man nor that sort of avtokrator maniakes replied with a touch of injured pride then he laughed again of course if they dont fully realize that and strive especially hard to please me i wont be altogether unhappy niphone smiled after a moment the smile reached her eyes as well as her lips that gladdened maniakes he didnt want her thinking about rotrude even if he had been doing the same thing himself he raised his wine cup in salute to our child he said loudly and drank after that toast niphones smile showed more than polite happiness she lifted her own cup murmured phos creed and spat on the floor in rejection of skotos to our child she echoed and drank with maniakes he didnt recall her having been so pious before he had to sail for kalavria he wondered if he had failed to notice beforesomething an assotted young man might well door if her stay in the convent dedicated to the holy phostina had brought out that side of her character as far as he was concerned the way you lived made a better proof of piety than ostentatious displays but he knew not everyone in the empire agreed videssians he sometimes thought got drunk on theology as easily as on wine so what he thought trying to change the nature of the empire was the fastest way he could imagine to make a whole host of rebels spring up against him and if niphone had found happiness in a close embrace of phos that was her concern she had certainly embraced him tooeven if he had found more joy in the arms of anotheror she would not be pregnant now to our child he said again if it proved a son he would be overjoyed if a daughter he would give her all the affection he could and try again as soon as the midwife gave him leave octopus in hot vinegar triphylles exclaimed when a eunuch servitor brought in the supper maniakes had ordered to celebrate his ambassadors return from kubrat how kind of you to remember your majesty after your weeks in the hinterlands and then in the plainsmens country eminent sir i thought you would like something to remind you that youd returned to civilization maniakes answered he nodded to himself pleased he had remembered to address triphylles by the higher honorific he had promised him for going to kubrat amazing what men would do for a change of title your majesty you know not what truth you speak triphylles ate octopus with every appearance of rapture remind me to kidnap your cookalthough after some little while of elderly mutton without garlic i doubt my palate is at its most discriminating right now since his own mouth was full maniakes did not have to reply he ate his octopus too though without feeling the ecstasies it inspired in triphylles he found the delicacy overrated not only was the octopus a queerlooking beast a man could die of old age trying to chew up each resilient not particularly flavorful bite when supper was done and he and triphylles were sipping on white wine from the north coast of the westlands maniakes said i gather from the despatch the couriers brought to me day before yesterday that your dicker with etzilios went well fairly well id say triphylles answered judiciously he is eager to receive tribute a great deal more eager than i am to pay it i have no doubt maniakes said as to that i should not be surprised in the least triphylles said nodding but the mighty khaganand if you wonder about that just ask etzilios opinion of himselfis mm imperfectly trustful of promises from an avtokrator of the videssians who overthrew his great friend genesios of course he reckons genesios his friendgenesios was his lifesaver maniakes said likinios was on the point of putting paid to the kubratoi once and for all when genesios overthrew him and genesios wasnt any good at fighting people who knew how to fight back so he left kubrat alone etzilios must feel hes lost the best friend he ever had that was the impression he left with me your majesty triphylles agreed accordingly he set conditions on his agreement with you what sort of conditions maniakes asked if triphylles had taken revenge for being sent off to a barbarous land by acquiescing to onerous terms maniakes would think about feeding him to the octopi instead of the other way round perhaps after first dunking him in hot vinegar but his envoy replied to assure himself of your goodwill toward him your majesty he insists that you personally bring the first years tribute to him at a spot to be agreed upon by future negotiation i gather he has in mind somewhere not far from the border between videssos and kubrat on our side of it i assume maniakes said sourly he felt no goodwill toward etzilios he wished likinios had succeeded in crushing kubrat and pushing the videssian frontier back up to the astris river where to his mind it belonged but he had thought the khagan might demand something like that etzilios was a smaller menace than sharbaraz and so had to be accommodated until the threat from makuran was gone he sighed very well let that be as pleases the khagan what else that was the chiefest point triphylles said he also requires that your retinue include no more than five hundred soldiers and swore by his sword to bring no more than that number with him among the kubratoi no stronger oath holds which means we either believe him or take precautions maniakes said i aim to take precautions i shall swear to bring no more than five hundred men with me to the meeting with etzilios but ill have others standing by not far away in case his strongest oath proves not strong enough for a moment he thought about treachery of his own if he managed to slay etzilios the benefits now might well repay any damage to his soul later he would have plenty of time to do good works and found monasteries in expiation of the sin but if he tried to kill the khagan and failed the kubratoi would have plenty of reason to ravage his land and sack his towns from all he had seen etzilios was wily enough to have a good chance of escaping any plot with pragmatism and moral scruples pulling him in the same direction maniakes decided against breaking a pledge once made triphylles said may it please your majesty here you shall have a fine opportunity to overawe the barbarian with the splendor of videssian court life when he sees such a magnificent display he will desire nothing more than to continue gaining the bounty you condescend to grant him that would be good maniakes agreed he found court life more nearly stupefying than aweinspiring but then he was stuck in the middle of itlike a fly stuck in honey he sometimes thought but indeed to a sheepraising nomad the goldencrusted robes censerswinging priests and slow stately eunuchs might be impressive unquestionably etzilios would never have seen anything like them the last item the khagan demands your majesty is twenty pounds of peppercorns a year in addition to the tribute of gold triphylles made a face the lord with the great and good mind alone knows what he purposes doing with the pepper for he seemed utterly ignorant of its use in cookery we shall survive that maniakes said we can give him his spice excellent your majesty triphylles beamed for a moment then suddenly looked anxious uh your majestyi trust you wont need me to hammer out the details of your forthcoming visit to the borders of kubrat i think the services you have already rendered the empire will suffice for the time being eminent sir maniakes said and triphylles fleshy face filled with relief high time now for you to enjoy the comforts of videssos the city as you have indeed labored so long and hard to keep them safe phos bless you your majesty triphylles said his mobile features bore a different message its about time not every day did an ordinary rather battered galley pull up to the quays of the little harbor in the palace quarter but then not every day did the father and uncle of the avtokrator return to videssos the city after years of exile when word the ship was approaching came to the palaces maniakes set aside the tax register he had been studying and hurried down to the waters edge had anyone asked him he would have admitted he was glad for an excuse to set aside the cadaster no one presumed to ask that was one of the nice things about being avtokrator waves sloshed through one another and slapped against the sea wall the sound of the ocean pervaded videssos the city surrounded by water on three sides as it was these days maniakes often had to make a conscious effort to hear it time in the capital and before that in seaside kastavala had dulled his awareness rhegorios came hurrying down to the docks are they here yet he said oh no i see them another few minutes look theres father in the bowand your father too he waved after a moment so did maniakes as often happened his more spontaneous cousin got him moving the elder maniakes waved back symvatios did too rhegorios had sharp eyes to tell them apart so readily at such a distance maniakes had to squint to be sure who was who standing beside symvatios was his daughter lysia she also waved toward maniakes and rhegorios that made maniakes wave harder rhegorios though put his hands down by his sides maniakes poked him in the ribs with an elbow arent you going to welcome your sister he demanded what and give her the chance to put on airs rhegorios said in mock horror shed never let me forget it maniakes snorted he listened to the oarmaster calling the stroke and then ordering back oars as the galley came alongside a quay lines snaked out from the ship servitors ashore tied them fast sailors and servitors wrestled the gangplank into place the elder maniakes crossed to the wharf before anyone else had anybody tried to precede him his son thought he would have drawn the sword he wore on his belt and sent the presumptuous soul along the bridge it would either cross to reach phos heaven or fall from to descend to skotos ice with great dignity the elder maniakes bowed before the younger your majesty he said and then with even greater pride prostrated himself before the avtokrator who happened to be his son get up sir please maniakes said this business of being avtokrator kept having implications he didnt see till they upped and bit him he stared around in no small alarm what were people thinking of a father who had to perform a proskynesis before his son to his amazement the servants and courtiers watching the elder maniakes looked pleased and proud themselves a couple softly clapped their hands at the spectacle whatever maniakes had expected that wasnt it still bent on the dock the elder maniakes said just let me finish my business here son if you please and touched his forehead to the timbers then he did rise grunting a little at the effort it cost him once he was back on his feet he added now that thats over and done i can go back to clouting you when you do something stupid where abject servility had brought nothing but approval from servitors and men of the court that threat obvious joke though it was drew gasps maniakes rolled his eyes in wonder did they suppose he was going to punish his father for lese majesty by the way they kept staring from one of the maniakai to the other maybe they did maniakes walked over to his father embraced him and kissed him on both cheeks that seemed to ease the minds of some of the spectators but only made others more nervous symvatios performed the proskynesis next after he rose he went on one knee before rhegorios your highness he said as was proper in greeting the sevastos of the videssian empire oh father get up for phos sake rhegorios said impatiently seeing the sevastos imitate the avtokrators informality the spectators sighedthings werent going to be as they had been in the reign of the traditionalist likinios how things had been during genesios reign they carefully chose not to remember after symvatios had presented himself to his nephew and son it was lysias turn as before maniakes felt more embarrassed than exalted at having her prostrate herself he got the strong feeling though that ordering her not to would have insulted her instead of making her happy he shrugged as he had seen with the way triphylles lusted after an otherwise altogether unimportant title ceremony was a strange business almost a magic of its own im glad youre here cousin of mine he said giving lysia a hug after she had greeted her brother when we left each other in kastavala we didnt know whether wed ever see each other again i knew lysia said showing more confidence now than she had that day on the distant island she said nothing about the embrace they had given each other then though he would have bet it was in her mind as it was in his the one they had just exchanged was decorously chaste the elder maniakes said sonyour majestyhave you had any word of your brothers no maniakes said it worries me the westlands have been anything but safe for soldiers these past few years that was an understatement not only had the armies of the westlands had to withstand a great onslaught from out of makuran they had also battered one another in endless fruitless rounds of civil war i pray the good god has not let my boys fall for nothing the elder maniakes said his voice heavy with worry the good god grant that my line shall not fail now at its greatest moment of triumph the good god has already taken care of that or so i hope maniakes replied with a grin well know for certain come spring so youll make me a grandfather eh the elder maniakes said his chuckle was too bawdy to seem quite fitting at a ceremonial occasion you didnt waste much time did you eh good for you will you dine with me tonight father maniakes said i shall be holding a feast in the hall of the nineteen couches uncle i bid you join us too and you lysia the hall of the nineteen couches the elder maniakes rolled his eyes up toward the heavens were going to have to eat reclining arent we to think my own son would do such a thing to me and at the same time make it impossible to say no maniakes refused to let that halfpiteous halfsardonic appeal sway him if i can do it you can do it and if i spill fish sauce and wine down the front of my robe with you there ill have some reason to hope i shant be the only one see what an ungrateful child it is the elder maniakes shouted out to whomever would hear him but he spoiled the effect of his indignation by throwing back his head and laughing till he had to hold his sides the nineteen couches sat in a large horseshoe in the hall to which they had given their name yours of course shall be at the center in the keystone position your majesty kameas said pointing to the one in question you shall have three times three on either side of you we could invite many more than that if youd only set out tables and chairs the way they do it in every other dining hall in the empire maniakes said testily if elsewhere they forget the past we should pity rather than emulate them the vestiarios replied here we recline the last bastion of true elegance in a world gone shoddy and uncaring i ought to start a new custom maniakes grumbled kameas stared at him in horror that was maniakes realized perfectly genuine no your majesty i beg you the vestiarios cried in this hall stavrakios reclined after his great victories against makuran as did yermanos before civil war tore the empire to bits upon his death would you have your practices differ from theirs maniakes had his doubts about stavrakios reclining after his victories from all he had ever read the great soldieravtokrator had been more comfortable in the field than in the palaces but that was not the point kameas was trying to make precedent is meant to guide not to strangle maniakes said kameas did not reply not in words he just stared at maniakes with large sorrowful eyes your commands shall of course be obeyed your majesty he said sounding as if one of those commands were that he take poison maniakes ended up eating on that central couch he reclined on his left side freeing his right hand for feeding himself not only did he find it a most awkward way to go about the business of supper but before long his left arm on which he leaned seemed dead from elbow to fingertip kameas beamed so did the other servants who carried food and wine into the hall of the nineteen couches and empty platters and goblets away from it maniakes wondered if keeping his servitors happy was worth this discomfort his sole consolation was that he wasnt alone in having trouble at the feast of all the guests there only kourikos his wife phevronia and triphylles seemed at ease they had eaten this way in likinios day niphone might have been familiar with the arrangements too but at the moment she found facing food far more unpleasant a prospect than leaning on one elbow if anything for her the awkward position was an advantage it meant she couldnt be expected to eat much thrax the drungarios was the first person to dribble garum down his chin and onto his robe he expressed his opinion of having to eat on couches so forcefully that several women turned their heads aside in embarrassment disgraceful niphone murmured a few couches down from maniakes lysia giggled then tried to pretend she hadnt maniakes caught her eye she looked apprehensive till she saw him smile but relieved after that moments later symvatios spilled sauce on himself lysia laughed out loud go ahead mock your own father symvatios said but his severity was as insincere as the elder maniakes had been earlier in the day at the harbor in the palace quarter after the blueberries candied in honey had been taken away after the last toasts to the new avtokrator and his family were drunkmostly by the new avtokrator and his familythe feasters began rising one by one and leaving the hall of the nineteen couches kameas came hurrying up to maniakes worry on his smooth eunuchs face i trust you enjoyed yourself your majesty he sounded anxious more than i expected yes maniakes admitted kameas sketched phos suncircle over his breast the good god be praised he murmured to the heavens above before returning his attention to maniakes then you will not mind my scheduling further such entertainments lets not get carried away maniakes said hastily kameas face which had begun to shine crumpled again maniakes knew he would have to deal with a grumpy disappointed vestiarios in the days ahead he preferred that to the prospect of dealing with any of the nineteen couches any time soon one thing maniakes hadnt anticipated before he donned the crown and the red boots how much parchment an avtokrator had to cope with every day letting clerks and logothetes take the burden could go only so far if you didnt know what was going on inside videssos how could you be said to rule the empire to maniakes mind you couldnt genesios had let everything slip except matters that touched on his own hold on the thronethere he had been both wary and ruthless but he hadnt delegated responsibility to anyone else things he didnt personally decide just got ignored thats how videssos got into the state its in maniakes declared to anyone who would listen since he was avtokrator people had an incentive to listen to him the flood of parchment that came to the imperial residence all but inundated him most of the missives were in one way or another cries for help towns wanting gold and artisans to rebuild walls provinces wanting relief from taxes because their farmlands had been ravagedhe had no idea how to meet both those requests at the same timegenerals wanting men and horses and weapons he wished he had some to send them he had managed to scrape together a couple of regiments of veteran troops but didnt know where he could find more here was a letter from another general tzikas commanding west of amorion to maniakes avtokrator greetings i have the honor to report your majesty that your brother tatoules formerly served with my command this past spring the makuraners sent a column eastward past the southern edge of the territory within my assigned area of responsibility i dispatched a force of my own southward to attempt to check the enemy column my move was successful but because my colleague the excellent provatos showed the spirit of a sheep and did not similarly commit a detachment of his own after promising to do so the makuraners were able to fall back rather than being destroyed our casualties were moderate but i regret to inform you that your brother tatoules did not return with the rest of the force he is not certainly known to be slain i regret i cannot convey more definite news as to his fate maniakes regretted it too he had no way of knowing whether tatoules was dead or alive and if alive whether he was wounded or in makuraner captivity he didnt think sharbaraz would harm his brother if he knew he had him they were enemies yes but because makuran and videssos were enemies it wasnt personal at least not as far as maniakes was concerned but the men of makuran might have captured tatoules without knowing he was brother to the avtokratorby all indications he didnt know it himself the lot of ordinary prisoners could betoo often washarsh and yet that ambiguous letter from tzikas gave him far more knowledge of tatoules actions and whereabouts than he had for parsmanios his other brother might have been swallowed by the earth for all the report of him that came back from the westlands he noted that tzikas had done his best to raise imperial wrath against provatos his fellow general in the westlands since he didnt know the circumstances under which the two men were supposed to have cooperated he couldnt decide which of them was in the right here that troubled him he knew he needed to take firmer control over his officers if the army was ever to become effective against either makuran or kubrat but he could not simply leap atop the army and ride it as if it were a placid mare the generals especially in the westlands had got used to taking matters into their own hands for the good and simple reason that genesios had given them no choicehe led not at all having gained powereven if not enough to hold back sharbarazthey were reluctant to surrender it to videssos the city to the ice with them all maniakes raged to rhegorios they act like a herd of virgins fit for nothing but the convent and want me to waste my time seducing them one by one the truth is theyre just a pack of whores rhegorios said while maniakes agreed with that it didnt help him find a way to deal with his independenceminded generals he took the question to his father the elder maniakes plucked at his beard and said having a goodsized army under your command in the westlands will bring them to heel soon enough would bring them to heel you mean the younger maniakes said as things are now the only way ill be able to put troops in the westlands is buying off the kubratoi so i can free up some of the men who are trying to hold them back i hate that but what choice have i none i can see his father answered what you have to do though is make sure etzilios cant find any way to cheat you ive been doing my best there my commissioners and the khagans cronies have been dickering for weeks about where well meet who we can bring with us and other small details maniakes smile showed his sardonic streak he went on the only trouble is while were dickering etzilios men keep raiding us as best i can tell he thinks thats part of the way negotiating gets done the elder maniakes sighed he has gained our attention hasnt he the only way i can think of to make him stop is to threaten to go to war without limit against him if he doesnt give over and that that will just make him laugh the younger maniakes finished his father nodded he went on he may be a barbarian but hes no fool worse luck he knows the only way we can fight a big war with him is to quit fighting makuran and we cant afford to do that even if we did we might get another mutiny out of itthe troops remember how likinios tried to make them winter north of the astris and what happened afterward ah but would they mutiny for fear of having to spend the winter on the frozen steppe or in hope of casting you down and setting another in your place the elder maniakes spread his hands that wasnt a question i intended you to answer son the why doesnt much matter anyway the younger maniakes said one more civil war and we pretty much hand videssos over to sharbaraz anyhow then hed have to try and rule it seeing him struggle with that is the one reason i can think of for losing before his father could speak he added quickly im joking by the good god i know you are i wasnt going to twit you about that but i can make a pretty good guess i think about when etzilios will rein in his raiders and graciously consent to accept the gold you want to give him if i have enough gold to pay the tribute the younger maniakes said gloomily all right father if you feel like foretelling tell me when etzilios will leave us in peace right about the time the harvest is done the elder maniakes answered hell steal all he can up till then and take away as much grain as his horses can carry nomads often live right on the edge of starving and make up for what they cant raise themselves by robbing their neighbors this way etzilios will have our farmers working for him the ones he leaves alive anyway the younger maniakes said he considered you may well be right that means another couple of months of attacks though and not much time after the harvest season to meet with etzilios and pay him off before the fall rains turn the roads to muck maybe we should hope they start early his father said the kubratoi wont be able to do much in fall or winter either come spring youd be able to pay the khagan and buy peace through the campaigning season id like that the younger maniakes replied i see only one thing wrong with it his father waited expectantly he explained it would be convenient for us and etzilios wont let that happen the elder maniakes barked a few syllables of wheezy laughter and clapped him on the shoulder i wish i could say you were wrong but i dont think you are bagdasares rose from his prostration with a quizzical look on his face you do me great honor your majesty the wizard said speaking videssian with the throaty vaspurakaner accent that put maniakes in mind of his grandparents but truly the mages of the sorcerers collegium can do this as well as i better he added in a burst of candor that made maniakes like him very much that may be so but you can do it well enough maniakes answered and i trust you which is more than i can say for the sorcerers of the collegium they were here through genesios reign who knows what some of them may have done he used that skinny old man for the worst of his conjurations bagdasares said so everyone tells meand that skinny old man is now conveniently vanished maniakes said as i say i dont know what those others did and its too late now for me to worry about it without evidence but if i want to find out whats likely to come of my meeting with etzilios ill ask you not them very well your majesty bagdasares said i shall do my best not to disappoint you although i must say as with any effort to look ahead to what will be i can give you no guarantee that all will transpire as now appears most likely yes yes i understand that maniakes said impatiently just get on with it if youd be so kind unless the barbarian should yet again change what passes for his mind ill be departing to meet him before long i shall attempt to learn what may be learned bagdasares replied bowing i should also warn you that the kubrati shamans may cloud what i see either because they are also peering at what may be or because they are deliberately trying to keep me from seeing ahead maniakes gesture was so peremptory he regretted it a moment later however rude it was though it got bagdasares moving which was what maniakes had intended the vaspurakaner mage emptied out his carpetbag on the polished top of a marble table rummaging in the pile of oddments he selected a small jar of wine a mirror of polished bronze and a tiny intricately carved cinnabar jar that held a glob of quicksilver in the mirror we shall see what we shall see he explained we can touch the future only through the law of contagion for it is metaphorically speaking in contact with the present the spirits of the wine will give us the link between present and future while the quicksilver he flicked it with his finger to break it into several shining drops symbolizes the mutability of all that lies ahead and has not yet been accomplished carry on maniakes said wizardry and its techniques often fascinated him but not today all he cared for were results as you say your majesty bagdasares spent the next couple of minutes fussily gathering back into a single globule the quicksilver he had scattered then slid a scrap of parchment under it so he could pick it up later whistling tunelessly between his teeth he poured some of the wine into a small cup with a white shiny glaze he left a fingers breadth of rim showing when he set aside the wine jar some of that margin disappeared when he let the quicksilver fall down into the wine a couple of wine drops splashed out of the cup and onto the table he wiped them up with a rag no one should drink of this wine he remarked its been used in these rituals before and had quicksilver in it many times quicksilvers not the strongest poison i know but its not the weakest either well he spread his hands over the wine cup and began a slow sonorous chant some of it in the vaspurakaner tongue the rest in videssian so archaic that maniakes had trouble following it he thought he understood that bagdasares was using the spirits in the wine to harness the quicksilvers constant changes and turn them toward what would pass from the meeting with etzilios sweat rolled down bagdasares forehead and across his fleshy cheeks this is hard he said i can feel resistance between me and my goal i shall be the stronger though i shall prevailphos surely favors a man from among his firstborn maniakes wondered what agathios would have to say about that he himself however was more interested in what bagdasares could tell him than in rooting out heresy wherever he found it when his incantation was complete bagdasares picked up a brightly polished silver spoon and filled it from the cup slowly and carefully he brought it over to the mirror which lay flat on the table he poured the quicksilverladen wine onto the smooth bronze surface now you shall see what you shall see he whispered to maniakes at first maniakes saw only red wine spread over the surface of the mirror then the smeared wine became a filmy curtain and blew aside it was as if he were peering through the mirror into infinite space filled neither with phos light nor skotos darkness he wanted to blinkit was not something he thought man was meant to perceivebut found he could not after what might have been a heartbeat or some endlessly longer time the mirror once more began to show an image no longer did it reflect the ceiling or maniakes face though instead he saw the neck and head of a horse as if he were riding on it he thought the hands holding its reins his own in the near distance were the walls of videssos the city the sun glinted from the globes of phos temples inside just as it had when he approached by sea he wondered what lay behind him but the image faded from his sight before he could find out the mirror once more became its normal self he looked away from it scratching his head did you learn what you sought your majesty bagdasares asked maniakes glanced over to him in surprise why do you ask didnt you see what i saw in the mirror no your majesty the wizard shook his head the spell was created to enlighten you not me i know the sort of thing you experienced as ive sometimes used that magic for my own purposes but i did not share this particular vision with you so thats the way of it eh maniakes was still bemused i dont know whether i saw what i needed to see or not your mirror showed that i will come back from my meeting with etzilios which is indeed a piece of news worth having but it did not show anything of the meeting itself as i said your majesty i fear i was being impeded in my efforts by the kubrati shamans bagdasares answered whether they were trying to hinder me or simply creating uncertainty because of their own foreseeing attempts i cannot tell you i will say it is not impossible or even improbable that i have interfered with their magic as well good maniakes thought of two stones being tossed into a calm pond at the same time and of ripples spreading out from each until those ripples met each other and either flattened out or pushed each other higher in neither case would the water be as it had been before the waves ran through it he went on so etzilios will be as much in the dark as i will over what the meeting may bring from a sorcerous point of view yes i think so bagdasares said sorcery of course may not be a decisive factor on whatever plans he has yes there is that maniakes plucked at his beard as he often did while thinking when he got down to it he had very little choice ill treat with the barbarian if he and i do not come to terms how can we wage war against makuran bagdasares did not answer he did not have to answer without a truce with kubrat maniakes would fight in the westlands like a man with one arm tied behind his back bagdasares fished the glob of quicksilver out of the cup into which he had dropped it then put it back in the cinnabar jar he poured the wine back into its jar too and tightly stoppered it he dried and polished the bronze mirror before returning it and the rest of his sorcerous paraphernalia to the carpetbag in which he had carried them i thank you for your help maniakes told him the help hadnt been as complete as he might have hoped but the more he had to do with magic the more he realized it was a highly ambiguous business attempts to foresee the future might also influence it if that was so would it mean that what you had seen could no longer come to pass but if what you had seen was false how could it influence the true future with a deliberate effort of will he set aside that train of thought before it made him dizzy after bagdasares left the imperial residence maniakes wanted to talk with someone about what he had seen he discovered his father cousin and uncle had gone riding into the city while he was closeted with the mage since he hadnt gotten into the habit of confiding in kameasand since he wasnt sure getting into that habit was a good ideahe went looking for niphone he found her in the imperial bedchamber she was down on all fours on the floor throwing up into a basin since she was an empress of the videssians the basin was of solid silver with lowrelief images of holy men and their miracles ornamenting the outside that didnt make being sick into it any more pleasant maniakes stooped beside niphone and held her hair back from her face till she was done thank you she said in a muffled voice theres a jar of wine on that chest there could you bring me a cup and let me rinse my mouth of course maniakes said while he was pouring it niphone rang for a maidservant the woman came in and carried the basin away after niphone had drunk some of the wine she said thats a little better im so tired of throwing up every day i dont know how to begin to tell you i believe that maniakes said as sympathetically as he could i just had alvinos here when talking with niphone he used the videssian name the wizard had given himself niphone didnt care to be reminded of the vaspurakaners as a separate people he explained what he had seen in the mirror and what he hadnt as well so long as you come back to the city safe niphone said and that was the end of her interest in bagdasares magic maniakes told himself he wouldnt have been at his best just after being violently ill that was true but he had the feeling she would have been as indifferent were she perfectly well she didnt care muchno the truth she didnt care at allabout how the videssian empire was run though she was annoyed that the running of it kept him away from her more than she would have wanted seeing he might as well have been talking to the wall he left and wandered aimlessly through the halls of the imperial residence had he run into kameas he probably would have unburdened himself to him not only did the vestiarios position oblige him to listen he had a good head for detail and might have had something useful to say but instead of kameas maniakes found lysia his cousin was looking at some of the treasures stored up here not all of them were worth great piles of goldpieces the battered iron helmet by which she stood for instance was nothing out of the ordinary to the eye but it had once covered the head of a makuraner king of kings who had fallen to videssian arms in mashiz lysia looked up at the sound of maniakes footsteps in the hallway and smiled to recognize him the ceiling of the hall was set with thin alabaster panels that let in a pale shimmering light lysia happened to be standing under one of them she seemed ethereal not quite of this world but there was nothing ethereal about what she said may you add sharbarazs helmet to go with the one we already have here that would be fine he said nodding as he came up to her i cant even think about driving the makuraners from our soil yet though let alone moving on mashiz not when i still have kubrat to worry about as he had with niphone he told of what bagdasares magic had shown him you dont know what will happen before you come riding back to videssos the city lysia asked no and thats what worries me maniakes said it could be anything from the agreement i hope for to just this side of being killed i suppose i dont blame you for worrying she answered you ought to post troops close by over and above the five hundred to which youve agreed so they can come to your aid if etzilios does prove to have treachery in mind the trick of it lysia went on seriously will be finding places where theyre near enough to do you some good but not so near as to make the kubrati khagan think they endanger himespecially since hell have his own men hanging about for the same reason maniakes stared at her my dear cousin he exclaimed youre as clever as you are pretty which says a good deal just what i aim to do i dont think any of my generals or courtiers could have summed that up so neatly under his intent gaze lysia looked down at the mosaicwork floor your majesty is too kind to me she murmured he frowned along with everyone else in the empire of videssos she was his subject and protocol required that she remember it but as far as ceremony went the crown still sat lightly on him and he was used to her as a frankspoken cousin as near an equal as a woman was likely to become in videssos maledominated societyalthough from what he had seen the makuraners granted their women far fewer privileges than videssians did he took a cousinly privilege and poked her in the ribs she squeaked started to poke him right back and then checked herself no youd say i was guilty of lese majesty or some such and cast me in a dungeon she said her eyes sparkling to show she was teasing him aye no doubt and youd deserve it but i need to keep you free so you can give me good advice he answered that could have been teasing too but it had enough of an earnest undercurrent to make her pause before she snapped back at him again for that moment at least they liked each other very much maniakes rode at the head of the procession that left videssos the city through the silver gate bound for the northern frontier and a meeting with etzilios the khagan after he had gone a couple of hundred yards he reined in and turned to look back at everyone who was joining him in this effort to overawe the kubrati ruler we have a bit of everything here dont we he said to bagdasares who had stopped his own horse at the same time that we do your majesty the wizard agreed soberly he patted the side of his mounts neck the mare let out a quiet pleased snort behind the avtokrator and the mage rode the five hundred men who would serve as maniakes honor guard when he confronted etzilios half of them wore blue surcoats over their chainmail the other half gold blue and gold streamers fluttered from their lances they gave the impression of being only for show but every one was a firstrate fighting man next after them came the baggage train horses and mules and oxen and wagons with canvas tops that could be stretched over them in case of rain the baggage for the avtokrators pavilion was separate from the rest marked off by blue banners with gold sunbursts on them kameas and other imperial servitors accompanied it ready to do their best to make the avtokrator feel as if he had never left the palaces the treasure maniakes would give to etzilios was also in that part of the baggage train guarded by half a hundred hardfaced men who made no effort to seem anything but deadly dangerous after the baggage train rolled wagons of a different sort these carried the members of a couple of the leading mime troupes in videssos the city the performers were veterans of many a midwinters day skit in the amphitheater but they had never gone up before a more demanding audience if the khagan didnt care for the shows they put on he had blunteror rather sharperways to express his disapproval than flinging a rotten pumpkin i wish we had a giant serpent to give etzilios maniakes said suddenly id like to see what hed do with one by phos give it back unless i miss my guesseither that or feed his enemies to it such serpents seldom enough come from the hot lands to videssos the city kameas said i daresay no plainsman has ever had to deal with one since there were no serpents a couple of dozen of the swiftest horses in the city followed the mime troupes wagons maniakes aimed to put on horse races for the khagan if etzilios wanted to run his steppe ponies against these beasts the avtokrator wouldnt complain and if etzilios wanted to bet on the outcome maniakes figured he would win back some of the gold he was paying last of all rode another fifteen hundred cavalrymen unlike the formal guard regiment they lacked matching gear if all went well etzilios would never see them they accompanied the avtokrator in case all failed to go well when the partywith so many noncombatants along maniakes had trouble thinking of it as a forcereached the long walls the fortifications that protected the area surrounding videssos the city from barbarian raids he sent out his troops to check the nearby woods and copses to make sure no kubratoi were lurking there they found none of the nomads that helped set maniakes mind at ease etzilios seemed to be living up to the agreements he had made on the road up to imbros maniakes had no trouble sleeping in the elaborate pavilion of scarlet silk his servitors erected for him each night he had had far worse beds on campaign the servitors themselves though were used to life in the palaces and had trouble adjusting to being away from videssos the city they complained about the travel about the food about the noise at night and about how drafty their tents were kameas shelter stood beside that of the avtokrator and was the next most elaborate after it alone yet the vestiarios kept saying over and over again most unsatisfactory whats wrong esteemed sir maniakes asked in honest bewilderment seeing that were traveling i cant imagine doing it with any more luxury it is inadequate kameas insisted the avtokrator of the videssians should not dine on rabbit stew and if by chance he should the dish should not be lacking in mushrooms to give it at least a hint of piquancy maniakes ticked off points on his fingers first of all i like rabbit stew second i didnt so much as notice it came without mushrooms third if this were a real campaign id be eating out of the same pots as my men thats the best way i know for a general to be sure their food is as good as it can be kameas turned a delicate shade of greenor perhaps it was only a trick of the torchlight it strikes me as the best way for an avtokrator to be sure his own food is as bad as it can be barley porridge hard rolls onions crumbly cheese salted olives garlicky smoked sausage of pork or mutton wine sometimes halfway to vinegar maniakes decided he would be wiser not to admit a fondness for the food armies ate on the march lest he bring a fit of apoplexy down on his vestiarios but fond of such fare he was no doubt because he had eaten it so often when he was young how long shall we be away from the palaces your majesty kameas asked two weeks three at the most maniakes answered kameas rolled his eyes as if the avtokrator had announced a separation of as many years his sigh made his jowls wobble perhaps we shall survive it he said though his tone implied he had his doubts imbros was the nearest town of any size to the frontier with kubrat which also meant it was the town most exposed to kubrati raiders the farmland around it had brought in a lean harvest this year if any company by company regiment by regiment the extra cavalrymen maniakes had brought with him peeled off from the main body moving toward imbros and took up concealed positions in the woods south of the city riders could easily summon them to come to the avtokrators aid or at need to avenge him given the vision bagdasares had shown him maniakes did not think it would reach that point as the walls of imbros came into sight he realized he was betting his life on that vision those walls had known better days he had heard as much but seeing it with his own eyes was a shock the kubratoi had torn great gaps in the stonework not during a siege but after they got into the town till the fortifications were repaired the barbarians could force their way into imbros any time they chose maniakes resolved to rebuild the walls as soon as he could how soon that would be he couldnt guess a horseman on a shaggy brown plains pony approached the avtokrators party from the north he carried a whitepainted shield hung from the end of a lance as he drew near maniakes saw he was wearing trousers of stained and faded leather a wolfskin cap and a jacket of marten fur unfastened to show off the clothofgold beneath it the last a sure bit of loot from videssian soil maniakes ordered his own shield of truce displayed at that the rider who had reined in came forward once more i moundioukh greets you your majesty in the names of the great and fearsome khagans of the kubratoi etzilios the magnifolent he called in understandable but mangled videssian i greet you and your khagan in return etzilios your ruler is indeed most magnifolent maniakes said gravely holding in a smile by main force a couple of men behind him snickered but moundioukh luckily did not notice he sat straight in the saddle beaming with pride to hear the avtokrator as he thought honor the khagan etzilios bewails for youse moundioukh said where does youse wants to meets with him we need a stretch of flat open ground maniakes answered the better to show off our mimes from the amphitheater and the speed of our horses he waved a hand here where i am now would do well enough if it pleases the magnifolent etzilios he warned himself to be careful with that but liked it so well he had trouble heeding his own good sense this should pleases him yesly i will takes your words his way moundioukh wheeled his horse and rode back toward and then past imbros at a groundeating trot the animal looked able to keep up all day off in the distance horns brayed like donkeys with throats of bronze a cry more like a challenge than a fanfare maniakes tried making a joke of it either thats etzilios coming or were about to be attacked then he listened to himself just on the off chance he made sure his sword was loose in its scabbard but etzilios and his guardsmen advanced peaceably enough maniakes had no trouble picking out the khagan of the kubratoi his horse had trappings ornamented with gold and he wore a gold circlet on his fur cap as he got closer maniakes saw his sword also had a hilt covered with gold leaf the khagan was older than maniakes had expected his long unkempt beard well on the way toward going white he was stocky and wideshouldered even with those years on him maniakes would not have cared to meet him in a wrestling match he had only a stump for the little finger of his left hand his face was weathered and leathery his nose had a list to the left his eyes when maniakes saw those eyes under gray shaggy brows he understood how etzilios ruled his unruly people he lacked the schooling the formal training a man could acquire in the empire of videssos but if he didnt prove one of the two or three shrewdest men maniakes had ever seen the avtokrator would own himself mightily surprised after a moment maniakes realized why etzilios struck him so the khagan put him in mind of a barbarous version of his own father etzilios spoke a gruff word in his own language then held up his right hand the horsemen who had accompanied him halted at that word of command he rode out alone into the open space between his party and maniakes halfway across it he reined in and waited maniakes knew a challenge when he saw one he booted his horse in the ribs and advanced to meet the khagan do you speak videssian he called as he approached or shall we need an interpreter i speak videssian so i can understand you people etzilios answered using the imperial tongue far more accurately than moundioukh had when i want you to understand me i most often speak with this his right hand covered the swordhilt i know that speech too maniakes said at once he saw clearly that he dared not let etzilios intimidate him or take advantage of him in any way for if the khagan ever gained an edge he would never let it go you have but to begin it here and we shall go back to war you will not find me or my men easy meat for your taking i did not come here to fight etzilios said with the air of a man making a great concession you have said you will pay me gold to keep from fighting that is so maniakes agreed fear of the kubratoi i should tell you is not the only reason i am taking this course we can thrash you if we mustyou did not beat likinios army after all and what does that have to do with the price of a good horse the khagan asked we still hold our land and look what became of likiniosyes and of genesios too who threw him down the battles do not matter videssian avtokrator we won the warotherwise we would be paying you almost maniakes pulled out his sword then and there and attacked etzilios robbing the kubratoi of a man of such long sight would be a great good for videssos but if an assassination failed the barbarians would renew their assaults fueled by righteous fury not for the first time maniakes regretfully set aside the thought of murder he said i have brought the forty thousand gold pieces of the first years tribute to which you agreed with my envoy the excellent triphylles that man talks too much and thinks too well of himself etzilios said since maniakes had noted both those flaws in triphylles he found silence on them the better part of prudence instead he made a manful effort at returning to the subject at hand as i say i have with me the gold i will pay you in exchange for a years peace i will give it to you after the entertainments i have planned in your honor id just as soon have it now etzilios said what are these entertainments anyhow for your enjoyment i have brought from videssos the city two of our leading mime troupes whose antics will make you laugh maniakes said people hopping around without saying anything and pretending theyre funny etzilios spat on the ground ive seen the like in towns of yours ive taken i could live a long time without seeing it again why dont you just give me the gold and toss out the folderol then you can go home and worry about makuran thats what you have in mind isnt it maniakes opened his mouth then closed it again without saying anything he had never heard videssian civilization so cavalierly dismissed and etzilios couldnt have divined his purposes better had he been in the room when maniakes hammered them out with rhegorios triphylles and his own father at last after a deep breath and a pause for thought the avtokrator said weve also brought fine horses for racing you should have said that first etzilios told him ill put up with anything to see good horses run ill even watch your stupid mimes and i wont pick my nose to distract them while im doing it he chuckled maniakes wondered if he had really done such a thing if he had it probably would have served its purpose let us feast together and rest this evening your men and mine maniakes said and in the morning you can enjoy the mimesor notand we will hold horse races and then after we pray to the lord with the great and good mind to preserve the arrangement as we have made it i will convey to you the gold and we shall be at peace you pray to phos etzilios answered me i worship my sword alone its served me better than your god ever did maniakes stared at him he had never heard the lord with the great and good mind not just rejectedthe makuraners worshiped their deity the god instead of phosbut dismissed as unimportant etzilios was a resolute heathen and his people with him most in khatrish and thatagush followed phos these days but the kubratoi clung to the ways they had brought off the pardrayan steppe other than on the prayers are we agreed maniakes asked oh aye were agreed etzilios said if youll hold on a bit ill even have my men bring your cooks some sheep they can use for the feast generous of you maniakes said tonelessly he would have been more appreciative had he not been certain the sheep the kubratoi were contributing came from videssian flocks if etzilios noticed the irony he didnt show it with a vague wave to maniakes he turned his horse and rode back toward his waiting men maniakes did the same the cooks set some of his soldiers to work digging trenches and others cutting wood to fill those trenches and build racks above them for roasting meat the cooks also broke out great tuns of fermented fish sauce and jars of peeled garlic cloves kept fresh and flavorful in olive oil maniakes wondered what the kubratoi would make of the condiments if they didnt fancy them his own men would have more to eat he hoped just that would happen as promised the kubratoi drove a flock of sheep to the videssian cooks they did indeed look like videssian animals but for the sake of peace maniakes asked no questions the sheep bleated in desperation as they were butchered cattle lowed out a last futile protest before long the savory smoke that rose from the cooking trenches had maniakes mouth watering he picked some of his most trusted soldiers men who would not resent missing a chance to stuff themselves and sent them out to form a perimeter around the camp he also warned the goldpieces guards to be especially wary then satisfied he had done all he could to keep himself and the gold safe during the celebration he began to hope he would enjoy himself he went over to the chief cook an enormously fat man named ostrys and said be generous with the wine you give the barbarians the happier we make them the more theyre liable to reveal of what their master truly intends for tomorrow it shall be just as you say your majesty ostrys replied setting a pudgy finger by the side of his nose but for his dark heavy beard his looks would have inclined maniakes to guess him a eunuch he was round enough for any two of the palace servitors he knew though that ostrys had not only a wife but several sons who looked like him and shared his nearly spherical contours the smell of cooking meat drew the kubratoi in the same way it would have drawn hungry wolves from the forest they fraternized amiably enough with their videssian counterparts some of them had fought one another before most of the nomads spoke some videssian maniakes wondered how they had learned itmaybe from women they had stolen priests paraded with thuribles sending up clouds of sweetscented incense that mingled with the odors of firewood and roasting mutton and beef to make the feast flavorful to the nose the bluerobed clerics also sent up sonorous prayers for peace between videssos and kubrat beseeching phos to make both sides honest and righteous and to hold deceit away from them maniakes glanced over to see how etzilios would take that the khagans left hand twisted in a sign that looked like one of the gestures of aversion videssian peasants used by the good god theyre not trying to ensorcel you maniakes said etzilios looked down at his hand as if it had turned traitor i trust no magics but those of my shamans he said and smiled a carnivorous smile if they blunder i can punish them barbarian maniakes thought a clever barbarian but a barbarian all the same he sees what he wants now and he takes it now without worrying about what will happen later later is a different world what etzilios seemed to want now was meat he sat crosslegged on the grass a growing pile of bones around him he drank too though more moderately than maniakes had expected he nursed his wine well enough to wave on videssian servitors about every other time they came by with fresh jars that moderation did not keep him from belching cavernously maniakes was not offended among the nomads such rumblings signified approval of the fare offered you videssians should have done this years ago etzilios said beaming at the feast but noinstead you thought to chase me like dog after fox but no fox am ii am a wolf as you have seen he bared his teeth they were yellow as a wolfs in so much if no further he spoke the truth were making peace now we shouldnt worry about past quarrels maniakes said he wished his men were chasing the kubratoi right now had he not faced war on two fronts his men would have been doing just that saying as much to etzilios struck him as unwise the khagan frowned rubbed at his considerable belly you make this mutton too spicy i think he said climbing to his feet my guts gripe me maniakes remembered triphylles complaint about eating endless meals of mutton without garlic what seemed mildly seasoned meat to a videssian was liable to be too much for a kubrati to appreciate he was just glad etzilios hadnt accused him of putting poison in the sauce i will be back later etzilios said and lumbered off toward a stand of elms not far away maniakes hadnt been sure the nomads bothered to seek privacy for performing their basic bodily functions he hoped etzilios had nothing worse than a bellyache if he suddenly dropped dead now the kubratoi would think maniakes had slain himwhen in fact he had decided not to try maniakes sipped his own wine when he looked around at the feast he felt reasonably pleased with himself his men and the kubratoi seemed to be getting along well in spite of old enmity not far away a kubrati who didnt speak videssian was using vivid hand gestures to show how one of his peoples horses would leave all the videssian nags in the dust the imperials sitting by the nomad quite plainly disagreed but nobody hauled out a sword to back up his opinion if etzilios saw that maniakes hoped he would be pleased too the avtokrator frowned etzilios still hadnt come back from that stand of trees whatever call of nature he had had to answer he should have been done long since either he truly had been taken deathly ill in there ora couple of couriers sat nearby turning to them maniakes said mount and ride to our waiting horsemen tell them to be ready the couriers got to their feet above the friendly din of the feast maniakes heard a drumroll of hoofbeats no tell them to come run to your horses before the kubratoi here try to stop you is something amiss your majesty kameas asked as the couriers dashed away then he heard the approaching horses too his face went from sallow to white he sketched the suncircle over his heart hide maniakes told him urgently if you can pick someplace where they wont ever find you good luck esteemed sir that done maniakes had no more time to worry about the vestiarios he scrambled to his own feet cursing the insistence on ceremony that had made him deck himself out in the goldencrusted imperial robe rather than chain mail even his sword was a ceremonial blade not meant for real fighting here came a sentry riding as if skotos were at his horses heels it wasnt the dark god but it was the next worst thing a whole great swarm of kubratoi thundering forward with gleaming scimitars upraised seeing the blades gave maniakes an instant of relief the nomads would not loose a shower of arrows from their deadly bows not with their own men so intermingled with his he cherished that relief suspecting it was all he would be able to enjoy for a long time to come to arms men of videssos he shouted as loud as he could we are betrayed he drew his ridiculous toy of a sword and slashed at a kubrati noble sitting a few feet away the leather of the nomads sleeve was enough to armor his flesh against the dull edges bite in an instant peace exploded into pandemonium videssians and kubratoi who had been chatting snatched out blades and went at one another some of the videssians ran for their horses the better to resist the barbarians bearing down on them someone also had the presence of mind to run down the rows of the nomads mounts shouting slashing tethers and whacking the animals with his blade not many of the kubratoi from among the feasters got mounted themselves maniakes saw only disjointed fragments of the action the barbarian he had tried to cut down surged to his feet and drew his own curved blade which was no toy maniakes didnt want to try turning it with his gilded toothpick he snatched up a heavy silver wine cup and dashed its contents full in the kubratis face the fellow roared like a branded bull and clapped his hands to his eyes maniakes hit him over the head with the cup he crumpled maniakes threw away his ceremonial sword and grabbed the kubrati scimitar now he had a blade with which he could fight and none too soon the kubratoi were upon him and his men he slashed at a nomad horseman then sprang aside to keep from being trampled instead of going after the kubratoi themselves he cut at their horses all around him his blade bit again and again ponies squealed in pain that kept their riders too busy trying to keep control to have too much time to devote to murdering him as he fought for his life he wondered what sort of nonsense bagdasares had shown him in the magic mirror how was he supposed to break free of this murderous press and get back to videssos the city as he dodged and ducked and cut he knew he was lucky to be surviving from moment to moment a kubrati close by snatched at an arrow that suddenly sprouted above one eye a moment later the nomads hands relaxed and he slid dead from the saddle maniakes scrambled onto the little plains horse the kubrati had been riding like a lot of his fellows the kubrati had kept his stirrup leathers very short so he could rise in the saddle to shoot maniakes felt as if he were trying to touch his ears with his knees he didnt care on a horse the barbarians still might slaughter him like a sheep they couldnt mash him like a bug underfoot though he fought his way toward a knot of his own men who were still fighting with some kind of order he wondered how long till his own reinforcements arrived pressure on that knot of determined fighting men eased it wasnt videssians coming to the rescue not yet some of the kubratoi instead of finishing their foes were busy plundering the imperial pavilion and the rest of the camp a separate fight broke out when they overran the guards protecting the horses that carried the tribute and started quarreling over the goldpieces like a pack of dogs over a juicy bone videssos he shouted lest anyone see the pony and take him for a kubrati since he was wearing the gaudy imperial robe and the red boots that was highly unlikely but no one can think of everything in the midst of battle your majesty the soldiers toward whom he was fighting had no trouble recognizing him when at last he joined them he felt like a man who had managed to seize a spar after his ship sank in a sea fight the analogy had but one flaw the spar he had seized was in itself in danger of sinking the kubratoi both afoot and mounted raged against their outnumbered videssian foes they shouted to one another in their own guttural language captains urging their men away from the loot of the imperial tent away from the spilled goldpieces and into the fight the captains were wise enough to know the time for looting was after a triumph not before the men were harder to convince because of that maniakes and his guards though beleaguered had not been overwhelmed when horns rang out from the south videssos this time the cry rang from hundreds of throats videssos maniakes shouted again he waved the scimitar to show he still lived had he been on his own horse he would have urged it to rear on a beast he had acquired so irregularly though he took no chances as long as he was able to stay in the saddle that sufficed one thing the arrival of videssian reinforcements did it reminded the kubratoi they were in a fight not just a plundering expedition they had ignored their officers in the search for booty ignoring the prospect of being killed was something else again they snatched bows from their cases and plied the oncoming imperials with arrows the videssians shot back even more than he had before maniakes wished he had a shield he waved again to me to me he cried if the reinforcements could reach him what had been a chaotic struggle to keep from being ridden down and crushed could suddenly become a fight the videssians might win or might still lose maniakes looked about worriedly more kubratoi were still coming down from the north he had brought fifteen hundred men over and above those about whom he had agreed with etzilios he had the bad feeling the khagan had brought more no help for that he spurred southward fighting toward the imperials as they neared him squeezed between two forces the kubratoi who tried to bar his path gave wayand suddenly the spar maniakes had seized seemed a boat instead your majesty the men bawled here take this and this someone set a helmet on his head someone else thrust a shield at him since the trooper who offered it had a mailshirt while he wore no armor beneath his robes he gladly took it sometimes he thought phos did answer prayers he hadnt fought like a common trooper for years thinking of nothing past himself and staying alive from minute to minute he had led charges after he attained high rank but then even as he battled he had had the shape of the whole fight in his mind the struggle for survival brought him fresh awareness of what his soldiers went through but now he had a proper battle to run he waved men to left and right widening his line and trying to keep the kubratoi from outflanking the reinforcements as they had effortlessly done with his accepted force of guards he didnt care for the shape of this fight etzilios had too many men and they were pressing too hard presumably etzilios also had the priests and the mimes and the racehorses maniakes had brought up from videssos the city the racehorses he would undoubtedly treat well the kubratoi though had resisted all efforts to get them to accept phos faith the priests might become martyrs for the greater glory of the good god and phos would have to be the one who helped the mimes too a rider came hurrying up to maniakes and cried your majesty try as we will we cant hold them on the left they keep overlapping us and forcing us to fall back if we dont they get round us and then we are undone maniakes looked that way sure enough the line was sagging badly he looked eastward to the right the line sagged there too though no one had come to tell him about it blow retreat he called to the trumpeters theyll surround us if we dont give ground the melancholy horn calls rang out videssian military doctrine didnt represent retreat as anything to cause shame realistically no army could expect to win every fight if you didnt win staying to be slaughtered was stupider than drawing back because it lowered your chances of winning the next fight but regardless of whether retreat was shameful it was fraught with danger if soldiers gave way to panic they were just a mob and they would be massacred as surely as if they had let the enemy surround them hold together maniakes shouted over and over till his throat was raw if we hang together they cant drive us like wolves after deer sticking together as they drew back as the kubratoi poured arrows into them from both flanks and from ahead took almost superhuman discipline maniakes looked around for etzilios if he could kill the khagan the kubratoi might collapse he had had his chances earlier and passed them by now it was too late etzilios like any sensible general led his troops from behind with a manifest victory developing before their eyes they didnt need to see their ruler in action to be inspired more horns rang out the braying horns of the barbarians a quick charge at the right of maniakes crumbling line made him send men there to hold it but the charge proved a feint screaming like fiends the kubratoi staged another charge into the videssian centerand broke it the rout maniakes had dreaded was on with kubratoi in among them as well as on their flanks the imperials no longer even tried to hold firm giving up any thought of staying together they fled southward singly and in small bands no thought but escape in their minds the kubratoi pursued baying on the chase maniakes was swept along with the rest a group of about fifty men clung togethertoo large for the kubratoi to assail when so many smaller easier targets were there for the taking but then one of the nomads spotted the imperial raiment in among that band of videssians and after that they were never free of the foe again had etzilios been anywhere close by he no doubt would have urged his men to go after the avtokrator regardless of the casualties it cost them but the khagan was elsewhere on the field and none of the men dogging maniakes thought to ride off again and ask what to do next being barbarously selfsufficient they believed themselves able to make their own choices maniakes spied a stand of oaks ahead lets ride in among them he said aye why not one of the soldiers said the trees will keep them from raining arrows on us the way they have been wed go faster through open country another man said the closer we stick to the road the better the time well make how fast isnt everything maniakes answered how you go counts too come on he guided his horse toward the trees most of the men in the band went with him six or eight though struck off on their own in the hopes the road would give them a better chance to escape the nomads once in among the trees maniakes brought his blowing horse to a halt and dismounted here your majesty you can piss later a trooper said gruffly maniakes ignored him he undid the golden belt that held his robe closed and threw it on the ground then he pulled off the heavy robe with its precious metallic threads and draped it over a branch wearing only his thin linen undertunic and drawers he climbed back onto the kubrati pony now they wont hound us so much he said i dont look like the avtokrator any more his troopers nodded approvingly he himself felt low enough to walk under a mouse without ruffling its belly fur what could be more dishonorable and disgraceful than abandoning the imperial raiment to escape with your hide unpunctured only one thing occurred to him dying when you had a means of survival at hand even so he knew he would replay this scene in his nightmares as long as he lived whether he would live long enough to have more nightmares remained an open question more than forty men emerged from the south side of the stand of oaks maniakes was suddenly much less conspicuous than he had been now the kubratoi harassed his band no more than any other of like size he wondered if he should also have thrown away the red boots that would have made riding harder besides keeping them on let him cling to the notion that he had salvaged something of the imperial regalia where now your majesty a trooper asked back to videssos the city as best we can maniakes answered bagdasares magicand how was bagdasares now and kameas and the servitors and the mimes and everyone else maniakes had led on this disastrous jaunthad shown he would come back to the city but it hadnt shown him safe inside the walls now more than ever he wished he could have looked back over his shoulder and seen if anyone was gaining on him as the routed videssians fled south the pursuit grew more distant maniakes wanted to draw more consolation from that than he actually could it wasnt so much that he and his comrades had outrun the nomads though that was part of it but more maniakes knew all too well was that the kubratoi were busy plundering not only his camp with all its riches but also the surrounding countryside how many videssian peasants would they round up and herd north to labor for them where would he find other peasants to replace the ones the barbarians were kidnapping with the kubratoi in the north and the makuraners ranging as they pleased in the westlands videssos might have no people left in a few years time we have to be careful not to founder our horses maniakes warned his comrades in misfortune if they break down before we get home i expect were done for his own pony the one he had taken from the dead kubrati was still working magnificently it was an ugly little beast short and roughcoated but it could run every so often he paused to let it rest and pull up some grass and weeds from the ground it seemed happy enough with that after a while his own stomach started growling the eruption of the kubratoi had come before he got a chance to eat much at the feast he rummaged in the beasts saddlebags to see what its former owner had been carrying the first thing he found was a skin that when he untied it gave off the odor of sour milk he threw it away the kubratoi might live on such fare but videssians a moment after he had rejected the stuff he cursed himself for a fool no matter how nasty it smelled it was food of a sort and he was liable to be hungry by the time he got to videssos the city the nomad had also been carrying strips of sundried mutton and flat griddlecakes of barley the mutton was so hard he could hardly bite it as for the griddlecakes they came as close to having no flavor whatsoever as anything he had ever eaten he wolfed them down regardless they had kept the nomad going and they would do the same for him camp that night was a cold miserable affair no one dared light a fire for fear it would draw the kubratoi a raw wind blew out of the northwest it smelled of rain though none fell that night maniakes and his companions counted themselves lucky there they had only a few blankets among them and huddled together for warmth like the luckless sheep maniakes cooks had butchered for what should have been a celebration of peace with the kubratoi trying to find someplace comfortable on the ground trying to keep the rest of the videssians from kicking or elbowing him maniakes dreamed up a whole flock of grandiose vengeances to visit upon etzilios head the one he liked best involved loosing genesios wizard the old man who had almost killed him against the khagan setting that mage whoever and wherever he was on the foes of videssos for a change struck him as only fitting and proper he fell asleep still imagining revenge he woke several times in the night from people poking him or just because he was cold at last though the trees he saw the gray light of false dawn yawning he got to his feet a good many other men were already awake the morning looked as wretched as the night had been the soldiers shared what food they had by the time evening came again their supplies would be gone the horses let out snorts of complaint as the men clambered onto them maniakes steppe pony seemed fresher than most of the larger more elegant beasts around it they had just left the woods when a cold rain started falling though it soaked him to the skin maniakes was not altogether unhappy to see it lets see the kubratoi try to track us when everything turns to muck he said and punctuated the remark with a sneeze the sneeze notwithstanding that was the first even slightly optimistic thing he had said since etzilios proved more adept at treachery than he was at preparing for it one of the troopers promptly ruined his comment by saying they dont hardly need to track us long as they keep coming south theyre liable to run into us and they aint got nowheres to go but south sure enough not half an hour later they came upon a band of nomads riding on a track paralleling theirs the kubratoi were there in numbers about equal to those of the imperials but did not attack them that puzzled maniakes till he burst out they dont want to go at us sword to sword and the rain would get their bowstrings wet he sneezed again this time almost cheerfully as gloomy day darkened toward black night they came upon a peasant village the farmers there gave maniakes some baggy wool trousers and a tunic to put on instead of his soaked drawers while those dried in front of a fire and later over them they fed the soldiers bread and cheese and eggs and killed a few of the chickens that pecked on the dirt floors of their homes when maniakes tried to tell them who he was and to promise he would be grateful once he got back to videssos the city he found they didnt believe he was the avtokrator not even after he showed them the red boots that touched him to the heart at least until an old man said dont matter who ybe so long as ygot soldiers at your back farmers whats smart they dont say no to soldiers maniakes had enough soldiers to overawe them but not enough to protect them if the kubratoi attacked in any numbers and after his band left the village on the southbound road no one would be left to protect it at all as he was preparing to ride out the next morning the old man took him aside and said young feller all that talk about bein avtokrators fine and funny when you spin it afore the likes of us but if genesios avtokrator ever gets wind of it hell have your guts for garters likely tell hes one hard man genesios is by all they say and not much for joking ill remember that maniakes said and left it there he wondered if any isolated villages off in the hinterlands thought likinios was still avtokrator if you didnt go to town and traders didnt come to you how would you find out what the truth was he and his men worked their way southward adding other bands of fugitives as they went until by the time they reached the long walls they numbered two or three hundred they scared off a troop of kubratoi not far from their own size and were beginning to feel like soldiers again two more days and were back in the city maniakes said trying to hearten them further well get reinforcements and well have our revenge a few of the men raised a cheer that made maniakes feel worse not better where would he come up with reinforcements with so much of videssos in turmoil if he did come up with them where would he get the goldpieces to pay them those were conjurations he would gladly have assigned to the mages of the sorcerers collegium if only he had thought they had some hope of success then all thoughts of what might happen and what probably wouldnt happen were swept away by a cry of despair from the rearguard the kubratoi the kubratoi are on our heels maniakes looked back over his shoulder he had some hope of driving the barbarians offtill he saw their numbers those offered but one remedy fly he shouted theyll ride us into the mud if we dont he no longer thought etzilios was following him in particular it seemed far more likely the kubratoi were just taking advantage of videssian weakness to plunder as far south as close to the imperial city as they could the cause didnt matter the result didand it was quite as bad as deliberate pursuit the horses were worn to shadows of themselves what should have been gallops were exhausted trots had the kubratoi pursued harder they might have overhauled and overwhelmed the videssian stragglers but their horses were frazzled too it made for a strange sort of chase maniakes was reminded of a mime troupe he had once seen at a midwinters day celebration where everyone moved as if half frozen drawing out each action to preposterous lengths for the sake of a laugh from the crowd even the memory might have been funny had he not been fleeing for his life and had he not also remembered the kubratoi sweeping down on the two mime troupes he had brought from the capital in hopes of amusing them rain started coming down again hard and cold road and fields alike turned to mire which made both pursued and pursuers slower still normally the downpour would have helped maniakes shake the kubratoi off his trail now though they knew he was heading for videssos the city they didnt need to see him to follow him he thought about breaking off and making for some provincial town instead but the kubratoi had already sacked imbros one of the more strongly fortified cities in their path that meant no provincial town was safe from them if he could get behind the indomitable walls of videssos the city the barbarians would storm against them in vain ifbagdasares mirror had shown him approaching the imperial city had he not knownor at least strongly believedhe would get that far he might have given way to despair as it was he kept riding hoping to meet a rescuing force coming out of the capital and turning the tables on the nomads who pursued him no rescuers came forth he was forced to conclude that he his comrades and worse luck the kubratoi had outridden news of their coming as far as anyone in videssos the city knew he had paid etzilios his tribute and bought three years peace in return i wish i only knew as far as they did he said when that thought crossed his mind at last he and those of his fellows whom the kubratoi had not taken came into sight of the imperial capital the sun had come out and was shining in a watery sort of way as if to warn that this stab at decent weather would not last long even watery sunlight though was enough to make the gilded globes that marked phos temples glitter and sparkle here was the view the magic mirror had given him from now on he realized he was on his own past this point he had no guarantee of his own safety he dug his heels into the barrel of the poor worn steppe pony the beast snorted in exhausted protest but somehow managed to shamble on a little faster maniakes and the riders with him began shouting toward the walls a rescue by the good god come to our aid an arrow whined past maniakes head some of the kubratoi still had shafts to shoot then perhaps twenty feet away a man cried out slumped in the saddle and slid from his horse how cruel to have escaped so much and yet to fall within sight of safety maniakes urged on his mount yet again he was not safe himself either and then at last a sound sweeter to him than the chorus of monks who hymned phos praises in the high temple catapults up on the wall and in the siege towers began to buck and thump throwing darts and great stones at the kubratoi chains rumbling an ironfaced portcullis lifted a regiment of mounted archers and javelin men rode out against the barbarians resentfully the kubratoi withdrew shooting over their shoulders at the videssians who had driven them back from the walls of the capital the imperials did not chase them far they had a way of turning and mauling pursuers who broke ranks thinking the foe was done for the videssians commander a handsome fellow on a handsome horse looked down his nose at the draggled men he had rescued who he asked scornfully is in charge of this ragtag and bobtail i am maniakes answered weary in every pore and hardly daring to believe he had won free to the capital at last he had forgotten what sort of spectacle he must have seemed filthy dressed in illfitting peasant clothes and riding a kubrati pony on its last legs the impressive officer set hands on hips and demanded and who sirrah are you worn as they were some of the men who had come down from imbros muttered back and forth and smiled a little waiting to see how he would respond to that i am maniakes son of maniakes he said who are you excellent sir the handsome officer started to laugh but was not quite altogether a fool he looked at maniakes face then at his boots which however mudspattered they had become were undeniably red beneath the grime forgive your servant ipokasios he cried suddenly solicitous rather than scornful i failed to recognize you your majesty a thousand pardons in his alarm he grew almost as flowery as a makuraner maniakes held up a hand to stem the tide of selfreproach excellent ipokasios for driving the kubratoi from my trail i would forgive you a great deal more than not knowing who i am though i hope youll greet the next ragged traveler with a touch more forbearance than you showed me ipokasios hung his handsome head it shall be just as you say your majesty maniakes wouldnt have risked a copper to win a pile of goldpieces that it would be as he had saidhe knew wellbred arrogance when he saw itbut perhaps the officer believed he was telling the truth and was properly apologetic any which way from behind ipokasios one of his men cried but your majesty what happened that was the question ipokasios should have come up with himself maniakes and his comrades explained variations on the theme of treachery the men from videssos the city cursed to hear what had happened to the imperial camp the priests the mimes and the gold to say nothing of all the peasants the kubratoi raped away from the northern marches after they routed us maniakes added glumly without enough peasants the rest of the empire would soon grind to a halt though city folk had trouble remembering it peasants ipokasios dismissed them with a short contemptuous wave which proved only that he had never paused to think about where the bread he ate every day came from enough chatter maniakes said making ipokasios understand that his view of the way the empire worked was too simple would have taken more time than maniakes had to spare and might have taken longer than winning the war would have done i need to get back to the palaces as fast as i can go i blundered into disaster now i have to start setting it to rights few people on the streets of videssos the city recognized him as he made his way across town toward the palace quarter that he found refreshing being the focus of everyones gaze had quickly come to seem a trial next time he achieved the present effect though he vowed not to use such drastic means few people recognized him in the palace quarter either the bureaucrats who deigned to notice him did so for his ragged clothes and scruffy horse what they were wondering very plainly was how such a ragged fellow had become part of a body of imperial soldiers at the imperial residence guards and eunuchs likewise failed to realize what he wasuntil one of the latter exclaimed in highpitched tones of horror phos preserve us it is the avtokrator returned in this rough guise the servitors fell on him like an army crying out the virtues of soaking and steaming and hot scented oil and clean linens and silk and squab stuffed with mushrooms and fine fragrant wine he held up a hand those all sound wonderful he said and as if to prove it his belly rumbled first though ill see my wife and my father and let them know im alive and whats happened to me your majesty one of the eunuchs quavered where is the esteemed kameas maniakes grimaced but that question like so many others had to be faced if hes lucky prominent sir the kubratoi have captured him if hes not lucky he didnt think he had to elaborate on that the eunuch looked down at the stairs of the imperial residence if being captured by the barbarians is good fortune phos ward us from the bad he said after dismissing the troops who had escorted him through the cityand praising those who had fought and fled with him from just outside imbrosmaniakes went into the imperial residence drawn by the commotion niphone waited just inside the entrance by the expression on her face maniakes gauged the state of his own decrepitude ill be all right he said im just hungry and tired and dirty and worn to a nub i wish the rest of my news were as good as what i can say about myself in a few gloomy sentences he told once more of etzilios assault niphones finger traced the suncircle above her heart so long as you are safe she whispered im safe maniakes said and for the first time began to believe it himself every moment of every day since the kubrati surprise had passed for him as if he were a hunted animal with the huntsman always about to fall on him only luck and watchfulness had saved him and that watchfulness had grown so ingrained in a few short days that lifting it took strong conscious effort after a moment he went on but so much and so many have been lost bagdasares kameas the treasure i was to give the khagan in exchange for peace the priests who would have blessed that peace the mimes and horses etzilios would have marveled to see all gone niphone sketched the suncircle again may the men safely walk the bridge of the separator and reach phos light as for the beasts and treasure you are the avtokrator of these things you can always get more would it were so easy maniakes said with a bitter laugh if only i could order them from a storeroom or conjure them up and have them appear when i commanded but i cannot do those things and i do not know where to lay my hands on more gold my father is logothete of the treasury niphone said as if reminding him of something he had forgotten speak to him he will get gold for you maniakes had spoken with kourikos more than once the main thing his fatherinlaw had told him was that not only the coffers but also the yearly tax revenues were disastrously low that was hardly surprising after years of invasion and civil war and with the makuraners in the westlands and the kubratoi not only working great destruction but also keeping tax collectors from even reaching huge tracts of land till some of the invaders were driven out the imperial government would have to run on shoestrings and cheese parings no point in burdening niphone with any of that though maniakes said well do what we can thats all thats all i want to do for myself right now bathe eat and sleep for a week rotrude would have looked at him out of the corner of her eye and said and then he could all but hear the words and the saucy flavor her haloga drawl would lend them niphone just nodded earnestly maniakes sighed a silent sigh well do all we can thats all he thought stragglers from maniakes journey up to imbros kept reaching videssos the city sometimes by ones and twos sometimes in larger groups a lot of them told terrible tales about what they had seen the kubratoi doing to the countryside as they made their way south none of what they said surprised maniakes who had seen some of that for himself and owned imagination enough to guess the rest five days after he returned to the capital bagdasares arrived aboard a horse that looked fit only for slaughter like maniakes he had trouble getting the guards to believe he was who he said he was you should have turned them into toads and let them sleep stupidly in the mud at the bottom of a pond till spring maniakes declared when the wizard finally gained admission to his presence speak to me not of spells of changing bagdasares answered with a shudder when i saw the nomads bearing down on the feast and the encampment i gave myself the seeming of a kubrati the spell was if anything too thorough for not only did i look like a barbarian i even thought like oneor rather i thought the way i thought a kubrati would think which proved quite sufficiently unpleasant i assure you in that case i expect im lucky you decided to make your way south instead of heading back toward the astris with the folk you imagined to be your tribesmates maniakes said it is no laughing matter i assure you bagdasares said though maniakes had not laughed in the confusion i got to the woods and hid there and for the life of me i could not be sure whether i was hiding from videssians or kubratoi fear for the most part makes magic fail my fear powered the spell to greater heights than it had any business reaching how did you decide who you truly were maniakes asked i had to skulk among the trees for a couple of days till i could get free and start moving south bagdasares answered during that time as the magic slowly waned i began to be afraid of the nomads once more im just glad you didnt ride off with them before your magic faded maniakes said not half so glad as i am bagdasares answered with great sincerity i wouldnt have cared to try to explain myself when the kubratoi suddenly saw my true appearance rather than the seeming i had placed on myself mind you im a much handsomer fellow than the barbarian i made myself appear to be but there is a time and a place for everything the wizards invincible selfimportance made maniakes smile but he quickly sobered magic is seldom as definite as it ought to be he said i saw myself coming back to videssos the city in your magic mirror but i didnt see the kubratoi riding after me and so thought id concluded the treaty with them and you wanted to seem a nomad not to be one be what you wish to seem is a good rule for life but not for magic bagdasares said magic confuses being and seeming too much as is maniakes clapped him on the shoulder well however you got here im glad you did he said ill need your help in the future and id have hated to break in a new wizard youre kind your majesty but there are swarms of sorcerers stronger than i am bagdasares hung his head had i been better at what i do you might have been properly warned that etzilios planned treachery for instance youve given me good service and my foibles dont seem to bother you maniakes said in my ledger those count for more than raw strength dont be absurd your majesty bagdasares raised an admonitory index finger avtokrators have no foibles his face was perfectly straight maniakes stared at him then burst out laughing i havent heard anything so funny in years likinios was a skinflint genesios murdered people for the sport of it and i yes your majesty bagdasares asked innocently im trying to save the empire considering the state its in right now if thats not a foible to the ice with me if i know what is without kameas the imperial household ran less smoothly than it had before the other eunuchs were willing and gracious but the vestiarios had known how everything worked and where everything was no one else attained to such omniscience maniakes caught a couple of servitors on the point of coming to blows over a crimson sash each of them claimed the other had mislaid such squabbles would not have happened with kameas supervising the staff or if they had maniakes would never have known of them that the eunuchs were jockeying to be named vestiarios did nothing to improve matters they all tried so hard to impress maniakes that they ended up irking him as often as not he kept putting off the decision none of them completely satisfied him a couple of weeks after he returned from the north the first snow fell maniakes watched the flakes swirl in the wind with something less than enthusiasm when the cold froze the ground the kubratoi would be able to sweep over the roads and fields and steal whatever they had missed on earlier raids sure enough a couple of days later a band of nomads rode down into sight of the walls of videssos the city maniakes went over to the wall to glare at them they werent doing much just sitting their horses and staring at the capitals fortifications maniakes understood that the great works were plenty to inspire awe even in a videssian shall we drive them off your majesty ipokasios asked we have force aplenty to do it maniakes was sure he wanted to perform well in front of the avtokrators eye after his earlier embarrassment but he answered no let them look all they like the more they see about videssos that impresses them the more theyll come to understand that once our present troubles are over we are not to be trifled with he almost made the suncircle as he replied he seemed even to himself to be speaking more in pious hope than from any knowledge of when if ever videssos troubles would end but the kubratoi after spending some time looking at the wall from beyond the range of its stone and dartthrowing engines rode away to the northall but one of them who was left behind on foot that one started slowly walking toward the wall as he drew nearer maniakes saw he wore no beard he plucked at his own whiskers he had never seen nor heard of a cleanshaven kubrati the fellow called up to the soldiers atop the wall open the gate i pray you that i may enter he spoke videssian like a cultured man of the city but was he a man the voice could as easily have been contralto as tenor kameas maniakes shouted is it you more or less your majesty the vestiarios answered i would be surer inside the city than i am out here i have seen more of the wide wild world than i ever expected to know let him in maniakes told the men on the wall he hurried down a stairway at the rear of the wall and embraced kameas when he came through the gateway they opened for him please your majesty such familiarity is improper kameas said youre not in the palaces esteemed sir not yet nor in my pavilion that means you dont tell me what to do i tell you and if i want to hug you i bloody well will very well under these circumstances i shall not be argumentative kameas said with the air of one making a great concession had he been his normal sprightly self he might have given the avtokrator more backtalk but he was thin and worn and pale even for a eunuch and though the kubratoi had dressed him in wool trousers and sheepskin jacket in place of his robes he looked half frozen concerned maniakes said come on esteemed sir well get you back to the palaces soak you in a warm pool and feed you hot spiced wine and candied figs and apricots can you ride a horse across the city or shall i have a litter brought for you i can ride a horse kameas rolled his eyes that is not a skill i ever thought i should acquire but acquire it i have from all i have seen among the kubratoi one either rides or is left behind for the delectation of the wolves he shuddered after the journeys i have made the trip to the palaces will be like a spring stroll through the cherry trees around the imperial residence when their blossoms fill the air with sweetness i couldnt muster up that much poetry when im perfectly well let alone after what youve been through maniakes told him here well get you a nice gentle animal not one of those steppe ponies with a mouth like iron and a will that comes straight from skotos he spat on the cobblestones youre familiar with the breed then kameas said when maniakes nodded the vestiarios went on i did wonder if the problems i was having were entirely due to my own ineptitude but the kubratoi had no trouble with their horses i suppose theyre as harsh as the beasts they ride he swung up onto the mare that was fetched for himthe prospect of getting him a gelding had struck the avtokrator as being in poor tasteand seemed capable enough in the saddle if not what maniakes would have called comfortable there how did they catch you he asked what happened to you then how did they catch me kameas echoed your majesty i shall always be grateful to you for your advice to hide had the nomads spotted me out in the open most likely they would have ridden me down and slaughtered me but the places for proper concealment were few i ran into a tent covered myself over with bedding and hoped for the best unfortunately for me the kubratoi soon proceeded to loot the tents one of the blankets under which i lay was a quilted one with a fine cover of crimson silk a barbarian pulled it awayand discovered me did he already know you were there maniakes asked delicately the vestiarios had been considerably bulkier on the day of the kubrati surprise well yes your majesty you might say so he had his breeches down around his ankles when he pulled the blanket off me i spoke none of the kubrati language then and have learned but few words most of them vile since still i had no trouble figuring out his disappointment that i was not a woman had i been a man of the ordinary sort i think he would have slain me out of sheer pique but he did not know what to make of me and in his curiosity decided i might be more interesting alive than dead he fetched me out and showed me to someone of higher rank than himself who in turn took me to a barbarian of still more exalted rankfrom excellent to eminent you might sayand shortly thereafter i was fetched before etzilios he had seen me attending you your majesty and knew i had to be one of your eunuchs but he did not know what a eunuch was at least not in detail he kept insisting they must have made me into a woman i denied this but refused to ah let him examine the evidence for himself clever maniakes said the more curious he was about you the less likely hed hurt you i thought of that only later kameas said your majesty you are a gentleman of finest quality you have never shown any unseemly interest in the nature of my mutilation this has not always been the case among the powerful in my experience the vestiarios voice was bleak maniakes wondered what indignities he had suffered during genesios reign kameas went on etzilios could have forced me to expose my nakedness of course but having me serve him amused him more he boasted how hed taken everything of yours from the imperial robewhich he wore over his furs and leathersto the imperial eunuch perhaps he thought i would poison him if i was sufficiently humiliated i wish i had indeed had the wherewithal to prove him right if he wanted you to serve him why didnt he take you back to kubrat with him maniakes asked eventually while attending to a call of nature i was discovered by some of the ruffians in what passes for etzilios court kameas answered what they saw so bemused them that they burst out of the bushes where they were hiding and dragged me forthwith before the khagan to exhibit me to him as if i were a twoheaded snake or some other freak of nature his sallow cheeks reddened with remembered indignation when he did not continue maniakes said and and etzilios having looked his fill immediately sent me back to you saying you were welcome to me kameas sniffed i consider his judgment a vindication so do i maniakes said reaching out to set a hand on his shoulder his loss is my great gain your majesty is gracious about a week after the midwinters day festivities had come and gone kameas interrupted maniakes as the avtokrator went over the accounts of revenue received from each province maniakes was glad to be interrupted the numbers added up to not enough to avoid that bleak contemplation he slammed shut the register in front of him and said how now esteemed sir your majesty a man awaits you at the entrance to the residence here he claims to be your brother parsmanios the vestiarios answered you of all people are best suited to judge the truth of this claim maniakes heart leapt within him he sprang to his feet exclaiming at last something goes my way ill see him at once and fetch my father there toohell want this news no less than i it shall be as you say your majesty heedless of his imperial dignity maniakes ran down the hall toward the entrance the closer he got the colder the air grew hypocaustsbricklined ducts under the floorbrought warmth from a central furnace to the rooms of the residence but that warmth could not compete with the winter wind whistling outside he didnt care the guardsmen out thereshivering videssians and halogai who looked far more comfortable now than they did in the muggy heat of midsummer at the capitalwere keeping a wary eye on a tall dark fellow in a cavalrymans cloak and boots one of the soldiers turned to maniakes and said well your majesty is he your brother or do we fill him full of holes the last time he had seen parsmanios not long before he went into exile and his brother off to fight in the westlands parsmanios beard had still been on the downy side with patches where the hair grew sparsely now it was full and thick with a gray streak in it that looked to follow a scar whose upper portion seamed his left cheek by the good god brother of mine youre a man maniakes said by the good god brother of mine youre avtokrator parsmanios replied how did that happen i heard of it by chance in a tavern out toward the border with vaspurakana merchant had managed to bring in a few donkeyloads of wine i almost fell off my chair many goodbyes to genesios and all but how did you end up wearing the red boots i suppose i should prostrate myself to you shouldnt i if you do ill kick you in the ribs maniakes promised he briefly told how he had come to the throne then went on so what of you you were near the border with vaspurakan you say why didnt news get there sooner ive sent letters out after you and tatoules but it was like shouting into a bottomless cavern no echo came back parsmanios spread his hands who brings news traders soldierstravelers anyhow havent seen many of those lately not in the little pisspot village where ive been stuckplace called vryetion the princes land is under the thumb of the king of kings these days and his general abivard led an army that sliced up and cut us off from getting any word out to the east if hed wanted to he could have smashed us up but he must have figured he had bigger fish to fry for all i know he may have been right it wouldnt surprise me maniakes agreed i got to know abivard when we were fighting to put sharbaraz back on his throne he knows his business no way around that hed strike toward the heart of videssos and leave detachments behind him to wither on the vine before his younger brother could answer the elder maniakes came out and folded parsmanios into a bearhug the more of this clan we have gathered in one place he said the more cause our foes have to fear any word at all of tatoules parsmanios asked maniakes told him of the short unsatisfying report he had had from tzikas i sent him a letter straightaway he added but ive heard nothing further hes been busy trying to hold amorion against the makuraners if they take it they can swarm straight down the valley of the arandos to the sea and cut the westlands in half from west to east when i got word of what had happened to you i thought of coming here by way of amorion and the river parsmanios said i figured id run into the boiler boys if i tried it though so i took the coast route instead that worked well enoughim talking with you anyway to the ice with the boiler boys maniakes said echoing his brothers use of the slangy videssian nickname for heavyarmored makuraner cavalry he pointed to the doorway here come inside well get some hot spiced wine inside you make you feel like a new man hot spiced wine is good even if you feel like an old man the elder maniakes said parsmanios laughed by phos father its good to see you and better still to hear you if you have hot wine anywhere handy ill gladly drink some over the wine which was steaming and fragrant with cloves and cinnamon the younger maniakes said well put you up in one of the apartments in the wings off to the side of the grand courtroom and he preened youre going to be an uncle again good news parsmanios said thumping him on the back little by little youre gathering in our whole clan his face clouded except tatoules we can but pray to the good god there maniakes said and his brother nodded if youll recall the elder maniakes said to parsmanios you were betrothed before you went off to the westlands evagria that was the girls name im not too far into my dotage to remember it i think genesios took her fathers head for something or other but thats old news now and ive forgotten what shes still here in the city odds are shell be glad to see you parsmanios coughed more from discretion than catarrh father weve been based in vryetion four or five years now summer before last i wed a local girl named zenonis i have a baby boy myself his name is maniakes the elder maniakes beamed you flatter me outrageously he said as for the other well if you wed her you wed her a settlement of gold on evagrias family will probably make them happy enough theyve been oh not poor but poorish since her father got put to the sword he turned to the younger maniakes youll take care of that ill take care of it some way or other maniakes said we dont have the gold for what really needs doing let alone for smaller things like this he frowned first in annoyance then in thought at last he beamed i have it ill promote them in the nobility not only wont that cost me anything i may even be able to make them pay for the privilege parsmanios stared at him the elder maniakes laughed uproariously damn me to the ice if i think youre wrong son he snorted drank and snorted again the good god save the poor makuraners when were finally able to face them not only will we beat em in the field well cheat em out of their armor and their boots and if theyre not careful their drawers too kameas poked his head into the study where maniakes was trying to figure out how to stretch his gold as far as it would go or with luck three steps farther your majesty the empress has pangs she believes to be labor pains she just asked me to send for the midwife and arrange the red room for the birth of phos willing the heir esteemed sir you dont need my permission to attend to such matters maniakes answered as far as birth is concerned niphones serving women have made it quite clear that i am in their words a large stupid man and not to be trusted with anything of greater weight than staying out of the way and not getting underfoot i was not seeking permission your majesty merely informing you of what i was about to do the vestiarios said this notification i trust will enable you to succeed at the tasks the maidservants set you maniakes considered that then said have a care with that wit of yours lest you pierce someone with it by accident as always i obey your majesty kameas said maniakes had the satisfaction of winning a rare smile from the eunuch before kameas hurried off to do as niphone had asked the midwife was a plump middleaged woman named zoile by the way she strode confidently through the halls of the imperial residence she had come here before perhaps she had helped genesios wife give birth or perhaps she had aided servants at their confinements maniakes didnt have the nerve to ask she was the ruler of a province where he could not go and carried herself with a rulers pride now you just sit yourself down your majestyfind someplace comfortable let them fetch you some wine and settle yourself down to wait she said echoing consciously or unconsciously the maidservants advice it may take a while but ill make sure you get yourself a fine baby and a healthy lady too thank you maniakes said large stupid man though he was he knew zoile could not make the guarantee she claimed women died in childbirth and afterward from fever in spite of everything midwives could do if fever took niphone he had a healerpriest ready to summon but even healers could do only so much and their art told cruelly on them he prayed he would not have to make the call for which he was prepared after a while kameas came into the chamber where he sat worrying the vestiarios said under zoiles direction we have transferred her majesty to the red room the heir if such the birth should produce shall come into the world in the chamber set aside for the confinements of empresses maniakes had been born by the side of the road so had his father he remembered his grandmother talking about it however steeped in ceremony videssos was being born in the red room wasnt required for imperial rank kameas surely knew as much bluntly pointing it out however struck maniakes as impolitic the vestiarios asked does your majesty require anything nothing i can think of esteemed sir thank you maniakes answered just come in and dust me off occasionally as you need to the process should not take so long as that kameas said with a hint of reproof in his voice in my admittedly limited experience he left it there undoubtedly because part of his limited experience did involve genesios wife and he was too polite to make much of that in maniakes presence periodically reports came to maniakes of what genesios survivors were doing in the monastery and convents where they lived out their days the reports always boiled down to nothing much so long as they kept boiling down to that maniakes was content at least there kameas went off to put the finishing touches on the feast that would celebrate the birth of maniakes first child so it was described anyhow though the vestiarios knew he had a bastard son he wondered how atalarikhos was doing these days if niphone gave him legitimate children as fine as the son rotrude had borne he would be a lucky man with nothing to do but wait he did that as well as he could every so often his kinsfolk would come in to pat him on the shoulder and wish him and niphone luck i know what youre going through son the elder maniakes said its never easy though if you listen to the women theyd gladly trade places with you a little while after his father left lysia peered into the chamber where maniakes sat the good god grant everything goes well in the red room she said he sketched the suncircle over his heart may it be so he said and then shes been in there a long time hasnt she lysia smiled at that it seems so to you and no doubt it seems so to niphone but its not really these things do take a while you know i suppose so he said vaguely i ought to be getting some work done not just hiding myself away but ive tried i cant id worry about you if you could his cousin replied the empire wont crumble to pieces because youre not watching it for a few hours if you want to give the stack of parchments to rhegorios im sure hed make short work of them her eyes twinkled the work your brother would give them is too short to suit me maniakes answered with a snort hes a clever chap and im glad to have him for my sevastos even with father here but he sees the whole mosaic and doesnt pay enough attention to any one tessera in it of the two of us i got that lysias mouth twisted it does less good in me than it might in him me being a woman if i were to make you sevastos or rather sevaste dont mock me lysia said more sharply than she was in the habit of speaking we both know that cannot be maniakes looked at her as if he had never seen her before im sorry he said slowly till this moment it never occurred to me that you might want the job why does that not surprise me she said and then sighed i know why of course it could be worse i know that too even after i got done explaining myself you still might not have had any idea what i was talking about im glad you did figure it out though cousin much as i love you maniakes began if you loved me you would take me seriously lysia broke in take you seriously i do i always have maniakes spread his hands if we ever find peace maybe ill get the chance to prove it to you but if im fighting the kubratoi and the makuraners both i cant set men and women in videssos against each other and if i appoint you to the rank youd likenot that you wouldnt fill it wellthats what id do we cant afford it i have to find a better way i know she answered realistically i know sometimes though being kept for a brood mare and valued only for the marriage i might make and the sons i might bear is hard to stand whatever happens youll have a place with me maniakes said you always need to remember that lysia sighed again you mean that well and i thank you for it its far more than almost any woman in the empire has i hope you wont think me ungrateful if i say its not enough she turned and walked out before he could find an answer he had the feeling she might have waited a long time before he came up with a good one but she did not have to wait now he did the waiting went on for what became by anyones standards a long time kameas brought him supperhe ate without noticing what was on the plate in front of himput him to bed and then when he woke served him breakfast no word came from the red room theyve been in there most of the day now he said how much longer can it be i have spoken with zoile the vestiarios answered from what she says the lady your wife is doing as well as can be expected for a first birth but proceeding more slowly than is often the case a lot more slowly maniakes said would a midwife tell a chamberlain all she knewor feared would kameas shade whatever he did hear from the midwife the answers that formed in maniakes mind were not necessarily and very likely respectively when he tried to go to the door of the red room himself all his servants reacted with such dismay that he never got the chance to ask any questions of zoile herself her majesty is very tired was as much as anyone would tell him since she had been in there more than a day by then it wasnt anything he hadnt been able to figure out for himself he stalked down the hall scowling at everybody he saw he had been worried since niphone went into labor it was more than worry now it was alarm what if he lost her to his own embarrassment he had never been able to call up more than a fraction of the feeling he had had for her before he was forced to sail off to kalavria that was a long way from saying he would have been happier without her he drank more wine than he should have and felt hazy and stupid and belligerent all afternoon he headed back to the red room the wine fueling his determination to get answers one way or another but before he got to the door though a cry from within the chamber froze him in his tracks niphones voice was high and thin and rather breathy he had never imagined such a piercing sound passing her lips he heard torment and exhaustion there but something else too something he had a harder time naming effort wasnt the word he wanted but it came closer than any other he could find the cry faded maniakes needed a moment before he could nerve himself to go on he had just taken another step toward the closed door when niphone cried out again thisshriek moan waillasted even longer than the one before it had and sounded far more dire zoiles voice came through the door too he couldnt hear what the midwife said only her tone of voice after a moment he recognized it it was the same one he had used to urge on his failing kubrati pony as it neared the walls of videssos the city was niphone failing too his nails bit into the palms of his hands niphone let out yet another cry it cut off in the middle maniakes heart leapt into his mouth rotrude had never made noises like these she had been grimly silent through the whole business of childbirth till six or eight hours after she began she presented him with a baby boy was niphone in greater pain was she just more sensitive to whatever pain she felt or was she truly at the point of failing for fear of evil omen maniakes did not let dying cross his mind silence followed he reached for the latch as his hand fell on it a new cry came through the door new in the most literal sense of the word the high thin wail could only have sprung from the throat of a newborn maniakes sagged where he stood he had a living child that was something now he needed to find out about niphone the door to the red room opened zoile came out and almost ran headlong into maniakes your majesty the midwife exclaimed she looked exhausted herself drawn and sweaty with dark circles under her eyes she drew back half a pace from the avtokrator your majesty you have a daughter bagdasares had thought it more likely he would have a son he would twit the mage about that another time how is niphone he demanded i wont lie to you your majesty zoile answered it was touch and go there for a while i thought i might have to summon a surgeon to cut her open and try to get the baby out aye and a healerpriest to see if he could fix the wounds afterward before she bled to death phos maniakes drew a quick suncircle over his heart he knew a woman lay down with death in childbed but he had never expected to be so brutally reminded of it not even the luxuries of the palaces could hold all dangers at bay zoile went on from somewhere though she found enough strength to bring forth the babe at last she has courage your lady ive seen women give up and die who worked less hard than she did may i see her maniakes asked he didnt really want to go into the red room now it had a sickroom stink of stale sweat and slops and even blood that repelled him but after what niphone had been through what he wanted and what he liked seemed small things still he was not altogether sorry when zoile shook her head she wouldnt know you your majesty not yet as soon as she passed the afterbirth she fell asleepor passed out whichever youd rather either way id sooner you let her rest the midwife looked worried i hope shes not bleeding inside i dont think she isher pulse has been strong all through thisbut its hard to know for certain maniakes hands folded into fists even now with the delivery done niphone still was not safe he had to trust zoile that she would be all rightand zoile sounded none too sure he found another question may i see my daughter now the midwife gave him a smile that pierced her worry like a sunbeam lancing through a break in dark clouds that you can your majesty you wait here a moment and ill fetch her she opened the door to the red room more of the sickroom smell wafted out maniakes got a glimpse of his wife lying still and pale on the bed where she had given birth he wished he could rush to her but sensed zoile was rightfor now rest would do her the most good but standing out here alone in the hall was hard the midwife came out again carrying a small swaddled bundle maniakes held out his hands to take his daughter she seemed to weigh nothing at all her skin was astonishingly thin and fine not a parchmentmaker in the empire could do work like that her eyes a dark blue were open she looked up at himor perhaps through him he had no idea what she was seeing she looks like you your majesty the midwife said does she maniakes couldnt see it to his inexperienced eyes she looked like a baby nothing else what will you name her zoile asked he and niphone hadnt talked much about names for a girl well call her evtropia i think he answered after niphones grandmother that would make her side of the family happy and he didnt mind the name evtropia zoile tasted it in her mouth and nodded not bad the midwife paused then went on when she found out the baby was a girl your majesty the empress asked me to apologize to you this was just before exhaustion took her maniakes shook his head foolishness a girl babys a long way from the end of the world when i learned she was pregnant this time i told her as much well try again after she gets her strength back thats all zoile didnt say anything but he saw her frown and asked whats wrong your majesty this was a hard birth if the empress has another one like it even with a healerpriest standing by shed be taking a great risk a risk of her life maniakes stared first at zoile and then down at his newborn daughter would she be the only fruit of his loins what would happen to the throne then would he pass it to a soninlaw to his brother to a nephew to rhegorios or whatever heirs he might have with a couple of sentences the midwife had made his life more complicated she saw that and said im sorry but youd best know the truth yes he shook his head again this time to clear it do you think her next birth would be as difficult as this one was no way to know that for certain not till the day comes but a woman whos had a hard time in childbed once shes more likely to have one again i dont think any midwife would tell you different no i suppose not maniakes sighed thank you for your honesty youve given me a great deal to think about he looked down at evtropia again would she be his only legitimate heir she stared up at him through him past him her tiny features held no answers she was trying to do nothing more than figure out the strange new world in which she found herself at the moment so was he kourikos looked apprehensive your majesty he said i am not a mage i cannot make gold magically appear where there is none to be had i understand that eminent sir maniakes answered but without gold the empire is hamstrung soon ill be at the point where i cant pay my soldiersisnt that what the accountants say if i cant pay them either theyll mutiny which will be a disasteror theyll up and go homewhich will be a disaster how many more disasters do you think videssos can stand he didnt expect the logothete of the treasury to give him an exact answer but they both understood the number was not very large licking his lips kourikos said revenue enhancements from the merchants in the city and other towns could bring in a certain amount of new gold aye but not enough maniakes said for one thing we dont have enough merchants to let what we gain from them offset what we lose from the peasants who are nine parts in ten maybe nineteen parts in twenty of all our folk for another thanks to all the enemy onslaughts trade has sunk like a ship in a storm too the merchants can afford to give but little in all this you speak truth your majesty kourikos agreed mournfully you have set your finger on the reasons why the treasury is in its present state knowing why is easy doing something about it is another matter altogether maniakes voice turned pleading eminent kourikos fatherinlaw of mine how can i lay my hands on more gold you are the acknowledged expert here if you know no way what am i to do the logothete of the treasury licked his lips again one way to stretch what gold we have comes to mind he stared down at the cup of wine on the table in front of him and said no more speak maniakes urged him give forth how can i judge what you say unless you say it very well then kourikos looked like a man about to repeat an obscenity if we put less gold in each coin and make up the weight with silver or copper we can mint more goldpieces for the same amount of metal maniakes stared at him how long has it been since an avtokrator tampered with the currency about three hundred years your majesty maybe more kourikos answered unhappily the avtokrator gordianos cheapened his goldpieces to help restore the amphitheater after an earthquake and you want me to break that string eh i never stated nor do i feel any such desire kourikos said you asked me how gold might go further that is one way maniakes gnawed on his underlip videssian gold coins passed current all over the world precisely because of their long tradition of purity still how much can we debase our goldpieces without drawing much notice one part in ten should cause no problem of that sort your majesty the logothete of the treasury answered maniakes wondered what sort of experiments he had run to come back with that quick and confident reply one part it is then maniakes aimed a stern forefinger at kourikos but only during this emergency mind you as soon as the worst of the crisis is past we go back to full value for the weight is that understood his fatherinlaw nodded maniakes felt as if he had just bathed in mudbut if he didnt get the gold he needed now having it later might do him no good half to himself he went on one part in ten isnt enough not when were short by so much more than that we dont need only to stretch the gold we have we need more as well i dont know where to get it kourikos coughed your majesty i know one place where theres gold and silver aplenty waiting to be stamped into coins aye no doubt and roast pigs lie around in the streets waiting to be eaten too maniakes said if gold and silver lay ready to hand dont you think i would have seized them that would depend on whether you saw them kourikos shook his head a quick nervous gesture no not whether you saw them for you see them every day say rather on whether you realized what you saw eminent sir dont play at riddles with me i havent the time for it now if you know where i can get gold tell me if you dont and youre trying to show how clever you are be thankful im married to your daughter the state the empires in even that may not save you speak up if you have anything to say kourikos looked as if he wished he had never raised the subject he went to the doorway of the little chamber in the imperial residence and peered up and down the hall to make sure no servants were in earshot when he came back he dropped his voice to a hoarse whisper your majesty if you need it badly enough there is gold and silver aplenty in the temples no sooner had the words passed his lips than he jumped up to reassure himself he hadnt been overheard maniakes didnt blame him rob the temples he exclaimed also in a whisper agathios would scream like a branded bullock and so would every other priest and prelate in the empire by the good god eminent sir it might touch off another round of civil war on top of the makuraners and the kubratoi i never said the gold would be easy to take kourikos reminded him i said it was there and it is he was right about that aside from the vast sums that had gone into building the high temple the ornaments and the great altar at which the patriarch presided were massy lumps of precious metal other temples throughout videssos though less lavish than the chief shrine also had riches stored away inside with more regret than he would have imagined a moment before maniakes shook his head ah eminent sir you frustrate me worse than you know for youre right the gold is there and that its there never once crossed my mind but i dont know if i can lay hold of it not if i want to hold the throne too your majesty must be the judge of that kourikos said bowing his head it cannot be maniakes said and then i dont think it can be he could order the ecclesiastical hierarchy about as he wished so long as he did not lapse into heresy he could depose the ecumenical patriarch and have a synod choose a successor from among three candidates he had picked himself but take gold from the temples maybe avtokrators had dreamt of it but no one not even genesios had dared try a man would have to be desperate even to contemplate it seriously maniakes learned how desperate he was by one simple fact the idea once lodged in his mind would not go away with a sort of cautious passion niphone wrapped her arms around maniakes it was the first time they had joined since evtropia was born maniakes did his best to be gentle with her and remembering what zoile had said when the moment came when he could hold back no more he pulled out of her and spurted his seed onto her belly she stared up at him only one lamp was lit in the imperial bedchamber but the dim light it threw was plenty to show her expression of rebuke why did you do that she demanded how are we to get an heir if you dont make me pregnant again he had never heard her speak so sharply it was all the more surprising because her thighs still clasped him the midwife said you might die if you tried to bear another child he said to the ice with the midwife niphone said for one thing how can she possibly know the time you had bearing evtropia was warning enough for her maniakes said it ought to be warning enough for you too she ignored him from the moment agathios wed them she had been as modest and submissive a wife as he had ever imagined to a fault if anything now all at once she made a lie out of everything he had thought she was continuing for another come what may my son will sit on the throne of the empire of videssos after you will you cheat my family of its place he hadnt thought of it like that he had plenty of relatives of one sort or another to succeed him he would have preferred a son certainly but his familys line would not fail if he didnt produce one but if a nephew or cousin or even brother of his donned the red boots niphones kin would lose their place in the sun with no way to get it back she went on my husbandyour majestywe shall have an heir of your body and of mine she reached down to restore his wilted vigor plainly intending to start trying to conceive that heir on the instant he took hold of her wrist easy there i cant go again quite as fast as i could ten years ago and even if i could i told you already the price of a boy child is more than i care to risk you care to risk niphone said the risk is mine to make not yours life is risk for men and women men go off to war women lie down in childbed when men win they bring themselves home alive no more but women now women lie down as one and get up as two you have no right to say i may not do this maniakes opened his mouth then closed it again if he held parsmanios say out of a battle with the makuraners for fear of what might happen to him his brother would have reason to be furious with him women though were supposed to be protected from such risk what if a woman didnt want to be protected what then till this moment he hadnt imagined such a thing he was trying to keep her alive she should have been grateful since she seemed anything but he took his most imperious and imperial tone and declared i am your husband i have the right to tell you what we shall doand what we shall not for a moment he had hopes the ploy would work niphone was a girl conservatively reared even by the conservative standards of her family her attitude toward her husbands decrees should have approached that of a makuraner wife locked away in the womens quarters of her noble husbands stronghold should have niphone looked at him in the dim lamplight he could not make out the expression on her face then she reached out and took hold of him again she wasnt usually so bold one of the things that makes you my husband is this she said squeezing gently if you deny it to me is that not grounds for making our marriage as if it had never been the videssian military knew retreat could be a virtue maniakes decided this was a time he would have to retreatespecially since inside her hand part of him was advancing he took her in his arms kissed her mouth and her neck and the hollow of her shoulder and her breasts when the time came for them to join he rolled onto his backnot only was that easier for his second round but also for her not long out of childbed she carefully lowered herself onto him you win he said in a voice that was all breath no she said raising up and then filling herself with him again we do maniakes stared at the messenger who had come hotfoot from the walls of videssos the city theres a what out there he demanded digging a finger into his ear i cant have heard you rightly may it please your majesty you did the messenger said theres a band of kubratoi out there just past dartthrower range the fellow who sounds like hes in chargei misremember his name but he speaks videssian like it was an egg hes beating in a bowl is he called moundioukh by any chance maniakes asked thats it your majesty the messenger agreed you know of him i know of him maniakes said grimly very well admit him to the city surround his force however large it may be with armed men be particularly careful not to give him any promise of safeconduct whatsoever i will meet with himand him alonein the grand courtroom in two hours time separate him from his men and make sure they are treated well unless you hear otherwise from me have you got all that would your majesty be kind enough to repeat it the man said maniakes did the messenger gave it back to his satisfaction nodding he sent the fellow back to the wall then shouted for kameas two hours later he sat on the imperial throne in raiment almost as splendid as that which he had had to discard after the kubrati surprise hastily assembled dignitaries took their places to either side of the colonnaded aisle down which moundioukh would walk but for the sounds of moundioukhs footfalls the grand courtroom was altogether silent as the kubrati advanced toward the throne at the prescribed distance from it he prostrated himself before maniakes with a skreek of gearing servitors behind the far wall raised the imperial throne several feet in the air when moundioukh started to get up afterward the avtokrator snapped i did not give you leave to rise moundioukh flattened himself against the marble once more he turned his head to glance up at the avtokrator his eyes blazed he did not seem impressed by the rising throne youse gets smarts with me your majesties and the magnifolent etzilios he will pull the empires down around your heads he said what will he do worse than he has already maniakes said much worser your majestive there will be a slaughtering the likes of which the world has never seen the likes of moundioukh declared rise maniakes said moundioukh climbed to his feet looking smug then he saw the expression on maniakes face and his own confidence leaked away maniakes said take this message back to etzilios the cheat etzilios the robber etzilios the traitor if his ravages go on i will pull all my forces from the westlands settle him once for all and then go back to fighting makuran youse is bluffing moundioukh said why on earth do you think so maniakes said the king of kings cant hurt me worse in the west than etzilios does in the northand if i beat etzilios once he may stay beaten while makuran wont moundioukh exclaimed youse will be sorry for these but he sounded dismayed not fierce and threatening he went on i did not come here for insulteds i earned to offer my magnifolent khagans mercies to youse youse gives him golds he will goes away and not bothers the towns of youse maniakes laughed in his face a long bitter laugh he said that last year and look what we got for it does he want me to come to imbros again uh no your majesties barbarian though moundioukh was he did not seem immune to embarrassment well then maniakes folded his arms across his chest and stared down at the kubrati emissary tell him the choice is his he may have peace or he may have war without limits videssos was here long before you kubratoi came off the pardrayan steppe videssos will be here long after you are forgotten look around you moundioukh you are in a real city now moundioukh looked and looked uncomfortable phos high temple would have been the best place in videssos the city for him to see the difference between what his people could do and what the videssians had accomplished over the centuries but the grand courtroom ran a strong second yet the kubratoi had their talents too as he reminded maniakes youse videssians youse makes pretties but youse cants fight for nothings bring on soldiers us slaughters they he paused unless youse pays we not to maniakes did not want to pay the kubratoi tribute he wanted it even less now than he had when he had agreed to the threeyear truce the autumn before but he knew he could not bring the entire videssian armysuch as it wasout of the westlands even if he beat the kubratoi with those forces makuran would make sure he got no profit from it freighting his voice with all the scorn he could muster he said i might give you fifteen thousand goldpieces simply to be rid of you they would all be cheapened ones too he resolved to himself we takes moundioukh answered at once a one years of pieces youse gets maniakes stared at him you mean that he blurted in amazement moundioukh nodded still startled maniakes went on the magnifolent etzilios is a fool he could have had better than three times as much for this year if he hadnt attacked me up by imbros i tells him not to does it moundioukh answered but him do not listens him are magnifolent like youse says him listen only to himsownself him say catch avtokrators not have tributes have videssos hell never get another chance maniakes ground out the khagan had certainly had a point if he had captured or killed maniakes all of videssos down to the imperial city might have been his for the taking he had done enough damage to the empire without getting hold of the avtokrator maniakes continued why does etzilios think i can trust him to keep the peace now when he broke it before i have better things to do with my gold than throw it away for nothing moundioukh let out a long heartfelt sigh him give hostages he answered unwillingly men of kubrat we breaks the pieces youse does what youse wants to hostages and what sort of hostages will he give knowing etzilios wiles maniakes would not have been surprised to get either men of no account or outright rivals to the khagan who would then have no trouble restraining his grief if they were executed in reprisal for his own treachery but sounding unhappier still moundioukh answered him gives i an all him send down with i him breaks bargains youse breaks we etzilios had used moundioukh as an emissary before he had attacked maniakes that argued the khagan had a reasonably high opinion of him we shall see who these other men are maniakes said if they prove suitable perhaps we have a bargain if i can scrape together fifteen thousand goldpieces even cheapened ones he scowled down at moundioukh for now you are dismissed this audience is ended you will be housed as fits your station moundioukh knew court etiquette perhaps he had visited videssos the city during genesios reign he prostrated himself again then rose and backed away from the throne till he had gone far enough to turn his back without committing lese majesty the housing maniakes would have liked to give him was a deep but narrow hole in the ground but he didnt need more trouble with etzilios than he already had having kubrati hostages went some way toward restoring his pride after the humiliation of the previous autumn he frowned thoughtfully as the throne descended and he got down off it his courtiers were shouting thou conquerest maniakes avtokrator but he wondered whether he had gained a victory or simply given etzilios what he wanted once more he shrugged the way things were he had very little choice but to accept the khagans offer he still had a long road ahead of him before he could think about having many choices when it came to dealing with the empires foes agathios performed a proskynesis before maniakes rise most holy sir by all means rise maniakes told the ecumenical patriarch as he finished the prostration here take this couch my vestiarios will be fetching us refreshments directlyah here he is now right on cue kameas brought in a silver tray that held a jar of wine two cups of cut and faceted crystal and a bowl full of boiled baby squid in a sauce of wine vinegar agathios beamed when he saw the squid my favorite delicacy he exclaimed what a lucky choice your majesty im fond of them too maniakes said about a twothirds truth to bolster it he ate one the choice had not been luck a few discreet questions from kameas to skombros yielded the secrets of the patriarchs taste the synkellos knew them as well as agathios did himself and was not shy about telling them to the vestiarios had he been shy in that way agathios would soon have found himself with a new synkellos maniakes made small talk with the ecumenical patriarch till agathios wine cup had been refilled once and the bowl of lightly pickled squid almost emptied then he said most holy sir i hope the temples have income adequate to all the tasks they undertake ah your majesty we never have as much as we would like agathios answered solemnly our charitable enterprises have stretched very thin because of the ravages of the barbarians in the north and the makuraners in the westlands generous as imperial contributions have been in the past we could always put more gold to good use maniakes stifled a giggle agathios had come to the imperial residence ready to put the bite on him for more funds considering the purpose for which he had summoned the patriarch the irony there was worth savoring im sure you could mostly holy sir he said when the time comes that we may give you more gold from the fisc be assured we shall gladly do so your majesty is generous agathios said my majesty is nothing of the sort maniakes thought aloud he said the pity of it is we cant do that now the invaders inroads have taken a deep bite out of the tax revenues that would normally come into the treasury i sympathize with your plight agathios murmured that gave maniakes the opening for which he had hoped he took advantage of it saying i was sure you would most holy sir i know the temples will do everything they can to aid videssos in our hour of need had agathios been a naively pious cleric he would have said something like whatever the empire requires your majestymost likely in ringing tones full of selfsacrifice he understood though that he was a political as well as a religious figure cautiously he replied with our own funds strapped as i noted your majesty how could we do more i know the high temple has vessels and censers and candelabra and other ornaments of gold and silver where bronze or glass or clay would serve as well maniakes said this is also true of other temples in videssos the city and all around the empire though in lesser measure the treasury is in desperate need of gold and silver most holy sir i should like to requisition some of this holy gear to aid us in our time of trouble and pay it back weight for weight measure for measure when the crisis is past agathios stared at him you would have us give up our holy vessels so the metal in them can be put to secular use your majesty forgive me but i fear this cannot be why not maniakes said agathios hadnt started screaming anathemas at him as he had feared might happen if videssos goes down in ruin the temples fall with the rest the kubratoi are heathens the makuraners reverence the god not the lord with the great and good mind the ecumenical patriarch was a political animal his protest came out in terms of legalisms rather than theology but your majesty such confiscations have never been heard of in all the history of the empire you would be setting a potentially disastrous precedent having the empire collapse also sets a bad precedent maniakes pointed out and one much harder to mend emboldened by agathios cautious response he went on most holy sir i regret the need that drives me to ask this of you without gold without silver we cannot pay our soldiers and without soldiers we cannot fight either kubrat or makuran let alone both i will give you my pledge in writing to restore what we have taken as soon as we have gold from anywhere else so you say now agathios answered suspiciously but what will you say come the day redemption is due i hope ill say most holy sir here is the full weight of gold and silver the fisc borrowed from the temples my thanks for helping videssos get through its hour of danger maniakes told him if i dont say that i expect youll anathematize me from the pulpit of the high temple he had fearedhe had expectedagathios wouldnt wait so long the patriarch licked his lips a bold prelate could indeed do such a thing it was liable to touch off riots and could get a man kicked off the patriarchal throne but it was an available weapon agathios had never struck maniakes as a man overly concerned with the spiritual side of his job administering the temples and enjoying the perquisites of office seemed to rank higher with him the wealth the temples held though touched him there and he might use the spiritual power if it was not repaid to the last silver coin let it be as you require your majesty he said now bowing his head i shall send the sakellarios of the high temple to confer with the logothete of the treasury on the best way to make sure we have an exact record of how much gold and silver is borrowed from each shrine we control im sure your treasurer and mine will quickly agree on those procedures maniakes said by giving up some of your wealth for a little while you help preserve phos faith on earth i hope what you say is true agathios answered heavily should it prove otherwise you will have a great deal for which to answer not merely to mei am after all but a manbut to the lord with the great and good mind by your leave robes swirling about him he swept out of the imperial residence a couple of days later a messenger brought maniakes a note sealed with the treasurys signet kourikos to maniakes avtokrator greetings may your boldness against foreign foes be rewarded with victories no less splendidand no less startling maniakes read the note twice then folded the scrap of parchment on which it was written if phos grants me that he said ill take it not long after midwinters day you say maniakes stared at niphone and shook his head i thought youd have more time to recover from your last birth before you had to start thinking abouta euphemism for worrying aboutanother one it is as the good god wills niphone sketched the suncircle over her heart i am in phos hands now as i have been all my life he will do with me as he thinks best i cannot believe he would deny you the heir videssos needs an heir is all very well maniakes said but he didnt go on how were you supposed to tell your wife but im afraid this birth will be the death of you you couldnt besides she knew the risks as well as he did she had been the one who wanted to press ahead where he would have protected her if she had let him evtropia was almost two months old but niphone still looked worn from the struggle she had had bringing her daughter into the world could she gather enough strength to go through labor again so soon well have a healerpriest standing by outside the red room maniakes declared niphone nodded obediently well have a surgeon there too in case we have to take the babe maniakes thought that he kept to himself everything will be all right niphone said but then as if she wasnt quite convinced of that herself she added and if not ill dwell in phos eternal light forevermore well have no more talk of that sort maniakes said firmly he might have been dressing down a young soldier who wasnt shaping quite as well as he had hoped niphone nodded accepting the rebuke maniakes hugged her to show he wasnt really angry then walked into the hall he almost bumped into rhegorios have a care there my cousin your majesty the sevastos said with a grin then he got a look at maniakes face oh by the good god whats gone wrong now eh nothing very much the opposite as a matter of fact maniakes steered rhegorios down the hall so he could talk without his wifes overhearing niphones going to have another baby thats good news for a change rhegorios agreed why do you look as if the makuraners just showed up at the cattle crossing then his eyes widened youre that worried about her i am maniakes answered the midwife as much as told me that if she got pregnant again he stopped not wanting to speak words of evil omen and went on at a tangent but niphone was the one who wanted to try again as soon as might be and so he stopped again rhegorios sketched the suncircle over his heart may the lord with the great and good mind look after her and the babe both now i understand why your face was so long well have to see how things go thats all maniakes scowled i wish that somewhere in the empire i could make things happen not wait for what happens and have to react to it well if the kubratoi stay quiet youll be able to take the field against the makuraners this summer rhegorios said that looks to be fifteen thousand goldpieces well spent if the kubratoi stay quiet maniakes said and if i can find any soldiers with whom to fight abivard and the rest of sharbarazs generals and if i can find officers who wont run away and if i can find the money to pay themno robbing the temples will take care of that i admit but it gives me more troubles further down the line parsmanios wont run away from the makuraners rhegorios said and he wont be sorry to get out of the city and take a command either maniakes started to answer then paused it was his turn to study rhegorios face you wont be sorry to see him go will you well no his cousin answered hes beentestybecause you didnt make him sevastos in my place i know maniakes said but i couldnt see the justice in taking you out of the post when youve done well in it maybe father can make him see the sense of that i own i havent had much luck but then i havent had much luck in anything since the crown landed on my head rhegorios opened his mouth probably to deny that then stopped and thought about everything that had happened since maniakes took the throne what went through his mind was easy to read on his face he hadnt fully learned the courtiers art of dissimulation after a pause just short of awkward he said the good god grant things get better may it be so maniakes agreed when i meet abivard again i want to face him on something like even terms he sighed we might be friends he and i did we not spring from different lands we got on well when we worked together to put sharbaraz back on his throne yes and look at the gratitude hes shown since rhegorios said bitterly he did claim to be avenging likinios when he invaded us maniakes answered maybe he even partway believed it at the time of course he still makes the same claim now but i dont know of anyone on either side of the border who takes it seriously these days on the other hand the borders not where it was when he started the invasions either rhegorios said its moved a lot farther east thats one of the things i shall have to attend toif i can maniakes sighed again the way things have gone wrong here at the empires heart i sometimes wonder if i wouldnt be better off sailing away to kastavala and carrying on the fight from a land i could really control rhegorios looked alarmed if youre wise my cousin your majesty youll never say that where anyone but i can hear it i cant think of a better way to start panic here and if you dont keep a tight grip on videssos the city you wont hold your grip on videssos the empire either maniakes weighed that mm youre probably right but i miss being able to operate from a place where i neednt fear treachery if i stir out of the imperial residence and defeat if i go beyond the city walls it will get better your majesty rhegorios said loyally i hope youre right maniakes said but damn me to the ice if i see how maniakes how could you lysia demanded he could have been angry at her for forgetting protocol but when even his wife called him your majesty he rather relished being treated like a mere human being i dont know how could i he asked and then how could i what now his cousin hesitated not out of deference to him he judged but from reluctance to mention matters out of the usual ken of unmarried videssian women at last visibly gathering her nerve she went on how could you get your wife with child knowing what might happen at the end of the confinement he gave her an ironic bow that is an excellent question cousin of mine as a matter of fact i asked it of myself and came up with no good answer lysia set hands on hips well then i thought i knew you better than to imagine youd do such a thing i wouldnt have were it up to me alone maniakes answered as with a lot of things though more than one person had a say here when niphone insisted she wanted to take the risk how was i to tell her no youd have to be wiser than i was to find a way that might work she wanted to oh lysia said in a small voice men being what they are when i heard the news i assumed she looked down at the hunting mosaic on the floor i think i owe you an apology cousin of mine maybe for that men being what they are maniakes said have you seen me dragging serving maids off behind the cherry trees lysia looked down at the floor again he had embarrassed her but she managed a mischievous smile as she answered no but then i wouldnt would i what with them being in full leaf and flower he stared at her then started to laugh a point a distinct point but i had all winter too and the grove was bare then so it was lysia dipped her head to him i am sorry i thought you were more worried about the dynasty than you were about your wife niphones the one whos more worried about the dynasty than she is about herself maniakes replied even if i have no children the crown will stay in my family but if she dies without bearing an heir her clan is cut off from the throne forever she doesnt want that shes made it very plain i cant say that i blame her and and she is your wife lysia finished for him as things are i would have understood if you were taking up with serving maids now and again but if niphone is so dead set on having a boy child her fingers writhed in a sign that turned aside words of evil omen it will be all right maniakes said as much to convince himself as to reassure her after a moment he went on im lucky in my family too you thought i was in the wrong and you up and told me nice to know people still think they can tell me the truth even if i wont like it but what i told you wasnt the truth lysia said i thought it was but thats what i meant maniakes broke in do you think anyone ever told genesios he was making a mistake maybe one or two people did right at the beginning of his reign after their heads went up on the milestone do you suppose anyone had the nerve to try that again youre not genesios his cousin said phos be praised for that maniakes exclaimed im just glad everyone understands it if people didnt understand it you would have lost the civil war lysia said genesios had videssos the city he had most of the army he had most of the fleet but no one would fight for him and so you won and so i won maniakes smile was crooked and so instead of the army and the fleet against me i have my cousina much more dangerous foe lysia scowled at him i dont ever want to be your foe or a danger to youand you ought to know that perfectly well he started to assure her that he did but she overrode him but that doesnt mean i cant worry about what you do and why you do it and i worry about niphone after so hard a time with her first birth and then to be expecting another so soon women dont have an easy time of it i suppose not maniakes saiduneasily now he stared down at the shining glass tiles set into the floor but for all of me you may ask niphone if this wasnt her idea and none of mine how would i say such a thing lysia put up her hands as if to push away the very idea and why would i i believe you even if i think shes foolish but ifphos prevent itall should not go as she hopes what would you do she links our clan to the bureaucratic families of the city we need their support we need them quiet at any rate maniakes said one thing about having so many enemies outside the empire sometimes it keeps even videssians from fighting among themselves and sometimes it doesnt if youll remember what happened all through genesios reign lysia retorted true maniakes sighed too true these videssians he started to laugh he was of pure vaspurakaner blood but his parents had been born in the empire and he himself thought more like a videssian than like a man newly come from the princes land he might say these videssians but he felt at home among them what would you do lysia said i mean if she didnt go on but she didnt need to either she had a point what with zoiles warnings niphones health was something about which he did have to worry thinking aloud he said i suppose i could bring rotrude here from kalavria lysias lip curled again she didnt say anything again she didnt need to he couldnt marry rotrude not as avtokrator she not only too obviously wasnt of videssian blood but she also didntand didnt want tothink like a videssian he would have a hard time legitimating atalarikhos too for the same reasons if he did make his bastard son legitimate the boy would be a weak heir open to challenge from ambitious generals and the men of his own clan both better atalarikhos stayed far from the city maniakes spread his hands what would you have me do then he said marry only for the sake of the girls family and not care whether i feel anything for her ive done that once by the good god and once is plenty or maybe i should put on a blue robe with the red boots and be avtokrator and monk at the same time i havent the temper for that i fear please lysia whispered im sorry he answered i shouldnt say those things i shouldnt even think them i know that i should be thinking everything with niphone will be fine phos grant it be so thats what you get for being my dear cousin you know im used to talking things over with you and when you ask me a question i do my best to answer it its all right lysia said and might halfway have meant it its just that you startled mei hadnt expected so much to come welling up even if you wear the red boots youre still a man you need someplace to go with your troubles if i can help there im glad to do it you did maniakes said and slipped an arm around her shoulder for a moment in a musing voice more to himself than to her he went on you know should the occasion arisewhich phos prevent as we both saidi could do much worse for myself than to marry you our fathers are brothers she said he cocked his head to one side trying to make sure of her tone of voice he didnt think she sounded shocked as she very well might have it was he thought more as if she was reminding him of a certain practical difficulty that would have to be met he was shocked himself but less than he might have been he and lysia had always got on well and he thought the spark of something more might be there he had felt it when they said farewell back at kastavala and he thought she had too his laugh sounded nervous even to himself i cant think of a better way to make the most holy ecumenical patriarch agathios have kittens then he laughed again this time with real humor no i take that back borrowing gold from the temples probably outraged him more than anything two people even two cousins could do dont be too sure lysia answered if we werent cousins she shook her head and didnt go on just as well maniakes thought all this is moonshine and foolishness anyhow zoile is a good midwife none better shell bring niphone through without any trouble and if there is trouble shell have a healerpriest standing by shes said as much with any luck at all well have an heir if phos is kind hell live to grow up and come after me and the two of us can forget what weve said here no not forget but pretend it didnt happen that may be the wisest thing to do lysia turned and walked down the hall he watched her go and wondered was he relieved or disappointed or both at once he sketched phos suncircle above his heart if the good god was kind he would never have to find out when an avtokrator sailed over the narrow strait of the cattle crossing to campaign against the king of kings of makuran it was often an occasion of great ceremony the patriarch would bless the emperor and the grand and glorious host he had with him the people of videssos the city would cheer the soldiers as they filed onto the troopships in flush times palace servitors would hand out largess to the crowd sometimes as kameas reminded maniakes a chorus would sing of the victories the great stavrakios had won in the west to inspire those who came after him to do likewise but for having agathios the patriarch present when he sailed maniakes broke with most of those traditions he was leading only a couple of regiments out from the capital if he was to keep the walls garrisoned he had no more to lead he did not want the people of the city to gawp at his little force lest the makuraners learn how small it was he couldnt afford to dole out largess he could barely afford to pay his troops as for the triumphal chorus videssian soldiers had gained so little glory against the armies of the king of kings lately that he feared they would take stavrakios triumphs more as reproach than inspiration agathios spat on the planks of the pier in rejection of skotos then raised his hands toward phos sun as he said may the lord with the great and good mind bless our armament here and instill in maniakes avtokrator his viceregent on earth the courage and steadfastness to persist even in the face of the many troubles that lie before us may he keep our brave men safe from harm and may they restore the empire and its temples to the grandeur that once was theirs so may it be so may it be the response went up from maniakes from his brother parsmanios and from the men who would accompany them into the west maniakes tried to ignore the sour look agathios sent him when the ecumenical patriarch talked about restoring the temples to the grandeur that once was theirs he meant not only liberating those in land under makuraner occupation he also had in mind getting back the gold and silver that had gone from the temples to the imperial mints thank you for the prayer wishing us success most holy sir maniakes said youre wise to pray for our victory for if we fail you assuredly shall not not be repaid i promise you your majesty such mundane considerations were far from my thoughts agathios murmured he sounded most sincere but sounding sincere was part of the patriarchs job maniakes wondered how agathios would have sounded had he mentioned that he and his first cousin were drawn to each other no doubt his outraged indignation would have been most sincere in lieu of that confrontationone that he hoped never to have to bring upmaniakes turned to his father and rhegorios im going to trust the two of you not to give this half of the empire to etzilios while im busy in the westlands he said he intended it as a joke but it came out sounding more like a plea he seems quiet now the elder maniakes said phos grant that he stay so rhegorios added have a care in the westlands too my cousin your majesty remember dont get too bold too fast the makuraners have been winning for a long time and our side losing dont take on a lot of battles you havent much chance of winning or youll give our men the notion they cant beat makuran no matter what ill remember that maniakes answered if headstrong rhegorios was advising him to be careful he had to think that was a good idea and yet if he did not go out and try to drive the armies of the king of kings from the westlands he might as well hand them over to makuran youll have to remember it son the elder maniakes said you havent any large army here and the ones in the westlands have been battered to bits in the past sixno seven nowyears if you want to do anything worthwhile youll have to train up some soldiers who arent used to getting trounced thats one of the things i intend to do maniakes said nodding then he grimaced of course what i intend to do and what abivard lets me do arent likely to be one and the same thing on that imperfectly optimistic note he embraced first the elder maniakes and then his cousin that done he boarded the renewal for the short trip over the cattle crossing the suburb on the western shore of the strait was simply called across in reference to its position in relation to that of videssos the city the renewal beached there the rowers driving it well up onto the sand sailors let down the gangplank so maniakes could descend first he had thought about making a speech pointing out his presence in the westlands genesios hadnt fared forth to fight the makuraners in all his years on the throne while likinios though far more able an avtokrator than the man who had stolen his throne had not been a soldier and seldom took the field at the head of his own troops in the end though maniakes said lets go and let it go at that speeches a long way from the battlefield did nothing to win wars and making great claims after suffering great defeats struck him as an easy way to get a name as either a brainless braggart or a desperate man he was a desperate man but didnt care to advertise it the rest of the fleet beached itself videssian law banned the suburbs of the imperial capital from improving their harbors with docks assuring that the greatest proportion of commerce went through videssos the city sailors troopers and grooms coaxed horses off bulky beamy transports the animals kicked up sand on the beach obviously glad to be off the rolling shifting sea maniakes had seen that with every sea journey a cavalry force had ever undertaken horses were marvelous beasts on dry land but hated travel by water maniakes turned to parsmanios who had descended from the renewal after him youll head up our vanguard he said youve been through this country more recently than anyone else here i expect youll know where we can safely go and where wed best avoid i hope so his brother answered when i was making my way to the city tzikas still held amorion which meant the whole valley of the arandos was under our sway if amorion falls were in even more trouble than we thought we were maniakes finished for him by the good god were in so much already how much harm could a little more do he laughed parsmanios gave him an odd look if you were avtokrator though not even your brother could get away with telling the world at large you had softening of the brain forming up on the beach helmets and javelin points glittering in the morning sun baggy surcoats flapping in the breeze the regiments maniakes had brought with him from videssos the city made a fine martial display he had no doubt they could crush an equal number of makuraners the trouble was far more makuraners than two regiments could hope to handle were loose in the westlands parsmanios went up to take his place at the van maniakes looked around for someone with whom he could talk he waved to bagdasares joining up with whatever forces we already have here wont be enough well have to form a whole new army if we expect to beat back the makuraners that wont be easy your majesty not with the enemy roaming as he would through the countryside the wizard answered were liable to be too busy fighting to do much in the way of recruiting the same thoughts running through my mind and im not what youd call happy with it either maniakes said gloomily but if we dont have enough veteran troops and we cant raise new ones what does that leave us not much i can seeoutside of losing the war i mean your reasoning is so straightforward only a lawyer or a theologian could be displeased with it bagdasares said which drew a snort from his sovereign still if the arandos valley remains in our hands it should prove a fertile recruiting ground in more ways than one maniakes snorted again i wish that were true but its not it might be if wed won a few victories as is though the only thing men of fighting age will have heard for the past seven years is how the makuraner heavy cavalry has chewed to rags everything weve sent against it hardly anyone volunteers for the privilege of dying messily in a losing war bagdasares dipped his head your majesty is wiser than i really if im so clever why did i want to be avtokrator in the first place maniakes rolled his eyes what wearing the red boots will do to you is make you distrust every noblesounding scheme youve ever heard from anyone you start wondering what the fellow thinks he stands to gain from it if you keep looking at the world that way youll bagdasares stopped talking if the avtokrator learned cynicism those around him learned caution say it whatever it is maniakes said he knew that too well if i dont know what people are thinking im going to make more mistakes than i would otherwise whatever you were going to tell me i want to hear it of course i obey your majesty the mage said with a sigh that argued he was unhappy about said obedience i was going to say if you look for the worst in people youll surely find it and end up as sour as poor dead likinios mm maniakes said judiciously i remember the way likinios was toward the end of his reignwouldnt trust his own shadow if it got behind his back where he couldnt watch it no i dont care to have that happen to me but i dont care to ignore trouble ahead either you walk a fine line bagdasares said and so do all the people around me maniakes thought theyve seen im not a brainless bloodthirsty beast like genesios which has to ease their minds but they have to wonder if ill turn cold and distant the way likinios did i wonder about that myself to keep from having to think about it maniakes walked over to the nearest transport that was unloading horses he climbed aboard the black gelding he had been riding since he returned from the disastrous meeting with etzilios since he had got back to videssos the city he hadnt been on the steppe pony he had managed to seize in the fighting he was thinking about breeding it to some of the mares in the imperial stables in the hopes of adding its phenomenal endurance to the bloodlines of his beasts looking at the ugly roughcoated little animal his grooms had been uniformly aghast at the idea he hadnt had time to persuade them before he set out on campaign after he got back if he remembered despite the ruin that had overtaken so much of the westlands the farmers of the coastal lowlands still lived contented almost untroubled lives the warm moist air and rich soil let them bring in two crops a year and left them enough after they paid their taxes that famine was no more to be imagined than say an invasion from the armies of the king of kings men dressed in no more than loincloths and women in calflength shifts of thin linen the farmers labored in green fields and black earth the soldiers making their way down the paths through those fields might have come from another world one that did not impinge on the peasants maniakes sent riders ahead of his little army and off to either side of its route crying out for men to join the struggle and help cast the invaders from the empire of videssos only a tiny trickle of wouldbe warriors presented themselves at each nights campsite though maniakes had horses weapons and armor for all of them and would have had mounts and gear for five times their number on the third night out from videssos the city he looked at the latest handful of new recruits and asked if i sent you men back to your villages to bring in your fellows do you think you could do a better job of it than my troopers have managed as he spoke he sent up a silent prayer to phos that the answer would be yes but to a man the new soldiers shook their heads one of them slapped his belly and said begging your pardon your majesty but we eat well in these parts most of your soldiers now theyre hungry men that was true maniakes had seen it often enough the men likeliest to take up fighting for their trade were those whose farms had failed or who hadnt managed to make a go of it for themselves in the city he spoke to the fellow who had answered him if you have a full stomach what are you doing here if i dont fight the makuraners somewheres else looks like id have to fight em on my own land the farmer told him trouble is most people they cant see far enough to worry that kind of way you dont know how right you are maniakes said feelingly what i ought to do is i ought to send you back to videssos the city and make you into a logothete i have the feeling youd be wasted as a common soldier whats your name im himerios your majesty the peasant said his eyes wide dyou really mean that have to tell you in case you do i cant read nor write my name that would help i admit maniakes said youd best stay in the army after all himerios i will keep my eye on you though i just wish youand all your comrades herehad brought your brothers and cousins with you when you decided to join us my cousin said good riddance is what he said himerios answered spitting on the ground to show what he thought of that hes got an eye on my plot of ground he does hisd be better if he took more time tending it the fat lazy son of a donkey he chuckled hes on my mothers side of the family you gather one of the men who evidently knew himerios dug an elbow into his ribs and said hey if you could fight as good as you talk the makuraners theyd be running back to their own country already amid general laughter himerios cursed his friend up and down back and forth inside and out maniakes laughed too but the mirth slipped from his face after he left the campfire around which the new recruits sat better than having himerios fight like five men would have been his bringing five men with him that hadnt happened because it hadnt maniakes would have an even harder time against the makuraners than he had expected the arandos flowed lazily through the coastal lowlands its waters turbid with sediment and downstream from villages sometimes foulsmelling from the wastes dumped into it maniakes made it a point never to camp where the water did smell bad he had seen armies melt away like snow in the early days of spring when a flux of the bowels ran through them some men died some who didnt got too sick to be worth anything as fighters and some who got only a touch of the disease took off for home anyhow to parsmanios he said if men start coming down with the flux were ruined because itll spread faster than the healerpriests can hope to stop it youre not telling me anything i dont know brother of mineer your majesty parsmanios answered the one good thing i can say about vryetion where i was stuck for so long is that the water was always pure there now that i think on it its likely one of the reasons we based ourselves there the one good thing you can say about the town maniakes asked slyly ill have to remember that come the day i meet your wife i wonder what shed have to say about it something interesting and memorable i have no doubt parsmanios answered no one ever wonders where zenonis stands about anything shed need to be headstrong to stay with one of us maniakes said anyone who thinks our clan shy and retiring hasnt met us yet he spoke with more than a little pride having a reputation for being cantankerous wasnt the worst thing in the world parsmanios smiled and nodded but then said what of niphone not that i know her well but she seems quiet enough willing to stand in your shadow you probably know better than i that what outsiders see of husband and wife isnt everything thats there maniakes answered his brother nodded again he didnt go on to explain that had niphone truly been as modest and selfeffacing as she seemed she wouldnt have had a new baby growing in her belly now parsmanios said and what of our cousin rhegorios when do you aim to marry him off he spoke carefully doing his best to conceal his resentment at the place rhegorios held at court his own father will have a good deal to say about that maniakes answered uncle symvatios is hardly one to curl up and pretend hes not there either though he is betternatured about going after what he wants than some blood kin i could name if parsmanios thought that applied to him he didnt show it the final word will be yours of course he said in his persistence unwittingly proving his brothers point youre the avtokrator after all i suppose youll settle on a girl from one of the high bureaucratic families to bind it to us you wont want to pick anyone from too prominent a clan though or with backing like that rhegorios might decide to see how his feet look in the red boots if you already know all the answers brother of mine why ask the questions maniakes said actually i dont worry too much about rhegorios trying to steal the throne this past year hes seen how much the avtokrator has to do by all the signs its more than he cares for maybe so parsmanios said darkly but you never can tell since videssos recent history proved how true that waswho would have expected a noaccount captain like genesios to murder his way to the thronemaniakes had to nod parsmanios went on and youll be thinking about the same sorts of things for lysia no doubt whoever marries her may get ideas because hes so close to the throne youll have to keep an eye on that so i will thinking about a husband for lysia made maniakes uncomfortable recognizing that made him even more uncomfortable he breathed a silent prayer that niphone would be safely delivered of a son parsmanios didnt notice the short reply he was building a chain of logic and as intent on his work as any shavenskulled theologian shed long since have been wed if the lot of you hadnt been sent to kalavria he said i dont suppose our uncle was able to find a suitable match for her there well no he couldnt maniakes said and then changed the subject by main force well be getting into kyzikos tomorrow i expect ill want you to use some of the vanguardmen you can count on mind youto surround the mint there and make sure its not plundered i dont know how much gold well be able to draw from it but the one thing we cant do is get in arrears on the soldiers pay i shall attend to it parsmanios promised ill speak to my captains tonight let them help me pick out a good reliable company maniakes frowned his brother should already have had a good idea of which companies under his command were good ones which not so good till he came to videssos the city he hadnt enjoyed high rank if you were to deserve high rank though you couldnt just enjoy it you also had to meet the demands it set on you maniakes hoped parsmanios would learn that he didnt have much time as maniakes little force headed west along the north bank of the arandos the land began to rise toward the central plateau at first so slowly it was hard to notice then more rapidly the arandos itself seemed to shake off age as the avtokrator moved farther from its mouth it flowed more rapidly and in a straighter course giving up on looping back on itself as it bumped over a series of rapids as the plateau drew near garsavra lay at the very edge of the westlands central plateau at the confluence of the arandos and the eriza which came down from the north had it not been for the rapids that hindered trade coming up from the east garsavra might have grown into a great city even as things stood it was the chief trading town for the eastern part of the plateau it also had stout fortifications in excellent repair when the hypasteos a plump importantlooking little fellow named rhousas came out of the city to prostrate himself before maniakes the avtokrator complimented him on that oh i thank you very much your majesty rhousas answered as he rose i do my best to keep this city ready to hold out as long as may be against the attacks of the fearsome makuraners who know not phos by the way he strutted in place he might have been personally responsible for every stone that had gone into the wall maniakes had heard that sort of selfaggrandizement too often in his nearly a year on the throne to let it impress him i suppose your garrison commander had nothing to do with getting your city ready to defend itself he had seen officials deflate like popped pigs bladders when he made that sort of remark to them he glanced over to the garrison commander a graybearded weatherbeaten man who seemed half asleep rhousas said oh yes the excellent byzakios did lend a hand but the garrison numbers only a couple of hundred and he was so busy seeking to form a city militia that he and his men played but a small role in the recent reconstruction a couple of hundred for a town this large and important in a time when were invaded maniakes turned to byzakios surely you had more men once what happened to the rest of them bout what youd expect your majesty byzakios answered his voice full of an upcountry twang some of em got killed in this fight or that and others well they were just stolen you ask me every time a rebel came through hed pull away a few more i sent tzikas a draft of three hundred i reckoned hed need em worsen i did i think youre right maniakes answered i think you did very well indeed to train up a militia to take the place of your departed soldiers too in a pinch will they fight you never know till the day comes byzakios said maybe so maybe not best guess is theyll do all right up on the wall but phos light take their souls if the makuraners break in despite em aye that sounds likely maniakes agreed when amateurs like that get into handtohand with professional soldiers theyll come off second best every time he sighed youre stripped down to a couple of hundred regulars i cant take many away from you then may i talk frank your majesty byzakios asked when maniakes nodded the commandant studied him then muttered half to himself well he was a soldier his own self to maniakes he said you better not take any not if you want this town to have any chance of holding you want my head because the mouth in its too big youve got your excuse to take it it seems to be doing a good enough job up there on your shoulders excellent sir maniakes said well leave it there for now a look passed between byzakios and rhousas maniakes had seen that look before when he dealt for the first time with officials who didnt know him personally it said hes not genesios and pleased and saddened him at the same time true it was a compliment but one that should have been superfluous genesios had a great deal for which to answer maniakes suspected he would be answering to skotos for all eternity rhousas said i am sorry your majesty but we have little revenue for the fisc commerce these past few years has been very bad goods come in down the arandos and the eriza but not much goes out especially to westward in good years wed send caravan after caravan to the panegyris the trade fair at amorion this year he spread his hands in regret not much point going on to amorion when you know you cant go further without likely getting robbed and murdered byzakios said too true maniakes said mournfully for that matter theres the risk of getting robbed and murdered inside amorion what news have you from there are the makuraners pressing against the city and what force has tzikas inside it to hold them at bay they are moving there west of amorion byzakios answered we dont know all we ought to from out there have to rely on spies and such in what by rights is our very own land he shook his head indignantly terrible thing anyways tzikas has several thousand soldiers along with whatever hes done about getting the townsfolk ready to fight theyll fight hard i reckon they know nothing goodll happen to em if they yield themselves up thats sure prisoners go to digging underground its said can tzikas hold if abivard throws everything he has against the place maniakes asked byzakios and rhousas looked at each other again this time the unspoken question was how much truth can we tell at last byzakios answered a question with another question your majesty when the makuraners throw everything these days what holds something had better start holding maniakes said kicking at the dirt or the whole empire will come crashing down curse it we can beat the makuraners in battle my father and i did it at the end of likinios reign by the good god stavrakios sacked mashiz ah your majesty but that was a long time ago rhousas answered sadly maniakes couldnt tell whether the city governor meant stavrakios exploits or his own garsavra gave every sign of being a town with a prosperous history the local shrine like a lot of such centers all through the empire was modeled after the high temple in videssos the city a lot of such imitations deserved the name more by intent than by its execution but from garsavras shrine one could get at least a feeling for what the original was like the local temple fronted on the market square in the center of town that expanse of cobbles was almost as big as the plaza of palamas back in the capital everyone from rhousas down to the apprentice grooms in the stables spoke of how that square had been packed with merchants from the capital from opsikion and even kalavria in the east from amorion and vaspurakan and mashiz in the west it was not packed now a couple of potters had set up forlorn booths in one corner displaying earthenware made from the grayishyellow local clay a herder had half a dozen lambs to sell a couple of weavers displayed bolts of wool at a portable desk a scribe wrote a letter for a patron who could not over most of the square though pigeons strutted in search of crumbs with scrawny cats prowling after them when maniakes came out of the hypasteos residence to walk across to the temple to pray the merchants abandoned their stalls and ran up to him crying mercy your majesty how can we pay the hearth tax and the head tax let alone that on our profits we have no profits by the good god mercy mercy he wondered how many merchants in how many cities would have sung the same tune had he appeared before them too many he knew that much ill do what i can for you he said and felt how inadequate the words were the best thing he could do to help the merchantsthe best thing he could do to help the empirewould be to drive the makuraners out of videssian territory once and for all he had never had any trouble figuring out what wanted doing how to do it was something else again after a couple of days rest and resupply maniakes and his little army made for amorion once they were up on the plateau the weather got less muggy though it continued blazing hot grain and fruit trees grew close by the arandos and along the banks of its small tributaries away from water the land was baked dusty with only scrubby grass and brush growing on it cattle and sheep grazed on the scrub well be able to keep the army fed and watered even if the supply lines fail parsmanios observed at camp one evening my little force in vryetion lived off the local herds a good deal of the time id like to be able to pay for any animals i end up having to take maniakes said of course what id like to do and what i can do are liable to be two different beasts wearing the red boots has taught me that any command will parsmanios agreed the bigger the command i suppose the harder the lesson maniakes listened carefully to his brothers tone another thing sitting on the imperial throne had taught him was that you couldnt trust anybody he hated having to try to gauge how sour parsmanios sounded at any given moment but couldnt see what choice he had he said another three or four days and well be in amorion then we can stop worrying about our supply lines for a whileand start worrying about whether abivard is going to try storming the place with us inside it his laugh was anything but jolly another thing you learn is that youre always worrying about something the day you think everything is fine is the day you havent noticed the plot against you just starting to bubble i expect youre right parsmanios rose and sketched a salute im going to see to my men and then turn in good enough brother of mine maniakes liked the way parsmanios assumed the responsibility that went with commanding the vanguard it was a far bigger command than he had ever had before but he was shaping well in itmaniakes had not had any complaints about his diligence since that evening outside of kyzikos if he ever scraped together enough troops to operate with two armies at the same time parsmanios might well make a capable commander for one of them the avtokrator rubbed his chin tzikas was already commanding an army and had been doing so as a virtually independent lord for several years now promoting parsmanios over his head would not please him would it touch off a revolt maniakes would have to think about that too wearing the red boots also teaches you life is much more complicated than youd ever imagined he told the silk walls of his tent unlike his livelier subjects they did not argue with him the scout who came galloping back to maniakes kicked up a plume of dust maniakes spied it long before the scout himself became visible the fellow reined in his horse was lathered and blowing after saluting maniakes with clenched right fist over his heart he said weve spotted dust ahead your majestylots of it and getting closer fast maniakes frowned any idea whos kicking it up no your majesty the scout said could be reinforcements maniakes said hopefully but even he didnt think that was likely reinforcements hereabouts should be heading straight for amorion not for us thats so your majesty the rider agreed whatever that is its heading dead away from amorion no two ways about it no maniakes shaded his eyes with his left hand and peered westward he clicked his tongue between his teeth i dont see anythingyet but if a lot of men are coming from amorion odds are theyre either our troopers fleeing the placeor makuraners whove taken it ride back to your place be ready if parsmanios needs you to carry more messages aye the horseman saluted again and set spurs to his mount urging the animal up into a gallop as fast as he could maniakes turned to the trumpeters who were never far from his person on campaign order the army into battle array he said the musicians saluted raised the long straight brass horns to their lips and blared out the signal that would take maniakes little force out of column and into line well anchor our left on the arandos he shouted each regiment broke in two half of one regiment stayed back to protect the baggage train and form a reserve the other half and the whole regiment deployed in three elements the center onethe one maniakes ledforward it was a flexible formation well prepared to deal with anything except overwhelming numbers the force had practiced going from column into line of battle many times and moved now without undue fuss or wasted motion even so by the time they were ready to fight maniakes could clearly see the dust the men of the vanguard had already spotted he clamped his jaw down hard to help keep from showing his worry as the scout had said somebody out there was kicking up a lot of dust then horsemen in mail shirts emerged from out of the dust he recognized some of their surcoats and bannershis own vanguard was mixed in among them a shout rose above the drumming of the horses hooves amorion is fallen when he understood that cry he grunted as if he had taken a blow to the belly in truth the empire of videssos had taken the blow for years the fortress at amorion had kept the makuraners from overrunning the arandos valley and perhaps from reaching the sailors sea if abivard had at last forced his way into amorionyou there maniakes shouted pointing to a fleeing horseman who did not belong to his own vanguard tell me at once what happened off to the west for a moment he thought the soldier would ride on by without stopping or answering he hadnt been part of a rout till etzilios ambushed him outside imbros but now he knew how to recognize one at the last instant though the fellow reined in and shouted amorion is fallen it might have been a cry of lamentation like those in phos sacred scriptures wherein the lord with the great and good mind nearly despaired over the wicked way of mankind the fugitives took it up again and again amorion is fallen is fallen is fallen is fallen as the cry echoed and reechoed maniakes men cried out too in anger and alarm they knewhe had taken pains to impress upon themhow important the city at the west end of the arandos was and unschooled in formal logic though they were they could reason out the misfortune its fall implied does tzikas still live maniakes called to the man who had stopped aye so he does the cavalryman answered and then recognizing maniakes regalia added your majesty he wiped sweat from his forehead with the sleeve of his surcoat before going on he commands the rear guards phos bless him and keep him safe hes still trying to hold the boiler boys away from the rest of us get into line with us maniakes said not just to him but to all the fugitives within earshot well ride forward to tzikas aid and the good god willing surprise the makuraners and steal a victory from them his calm and the good order of the force he led persuaded some of the soldiers who had abandoned amorion to try fighting again others though kept on going thinking flight their only refuge maniakes did not have enough men to hold them in line by force and their fear infected some of the warriors who had been with him since videssos the city so that they wheeled their horses and fled with the fugitives their companions tried to stop them but too often in vain another scout rode back to maniakes from the vanguard saluting the fellow said your majesty the most eminent sir your brother bids me warn you his force is cracking to pieces like the ice on a stream at the start of springtime his very words tell him he may fall back on the main body here but maniakes waved an arm to show the chaos all around him were in the same boat and i fear the boat is sinking the scout saluted and rode back toward the vanguard the scores of men coming the other way stared at him and shouted out warnings one or two took courage from his example and stayed to fight alongside the avtokrator most though just shook their heads and kept on fleeing along with the vanguard parsmanios commanded a new group of warriors approached maniakes and his men among them was a standard bearer still holding the videssian banner gold sunburst on blue on high next to him rode a graybearded fellow in gilded chain mail on a fine gray horse eminent tzikas maniakes shouted loud as he could the graybearded mans head came up maniakes waved to him he started to wave back then seemed to recognize maniakes and changed the gesture to a salute your majesty he called and rode toward the avtokrator maniakes waved at the chaos all around them what happened he asked after holding so long tzikas shrugged as if to deny that any of the sorry spectacle was his fault we lost your majesty he answered thats what happens when every makuraner in the world comes at you when none of the other generals in the westlands will lend you a counterfeit coppers worth of aid when all we hear from videssos the city is that theres no help to be had there either or else that your head is forfeit if you ever take a pace away from the soldiers who protect you he made a disgusted gesture i could go on but whats the use to the ice with it to the ice with everything amorions gone to the ice seems like maniakes said he remembered that tzikas had blamed the failings of one of his fellow generals for the defeat in which tatoules disappeared and wondered if the man knew how to take responsibility for his own actions do you think youd have done better your majesty tzikas growledalmost the same question genesios had put to maniakes when he was captured who can say maniakes looked tzikas up and down splendid footgear you have there eminent sir he remarked but for a couple of narrow black stripes tzikas boots were of imperial crimson at any distance they would have looked like the red boots reserved for the avtokrator alone the general shrugged again the way things have been all the videssian authority around these parts has been invested in menothing much coming from the capital but trouble as i said i thought i ought to look the part or come as close to it as i could in law and custom he was on this side of both law and custombarely on this side but inarguably so maniakes wondered if one fine day he might have pulled on boots without any black stripes the avtokrator wouldnt have been a bit surprised taking tzikas to task though would have to wait are you pursued he asked the eversopunctilious general were not riding east to settle our supper your majesty tzikas answered aye the boiler boys are on our trail great droves of em he peered north then south gauging the forces maniakes had with him no point even standing in their way theyll go through you like a knife through fat bacon mm not necessarily maniakes answered after a moments thought theyre chasing what they think is a broken band of fugitives after all if we hit the ones out in front of the pursuit and hit them hard we may be able to knock their whole army back on its heels phos willing well save the arandos valley for this year or most of it anyhow tzikas face was pinched and narrow not one for showing joy under the best of circumstances now that circumstances were far from the best he all but radiated gloom your majesty if you press forward and see the numbers arrayed against us you will know resistance is hopeless until i see them for myself i dont know anything of the kind maniakes answered eminent sir if you and as many of your men as you can bring want to ride with us youll be welcome and you can give useful aid if not then kindly keep running east dont stay around infecting us with the notion that everything is lost he waited to see how tzikas would take that the general scowled he wasnt used to taking orders or to being dismissed so peremptorily after a moment he said you are the avtokrator it shall be as you command his voice was flat empty of any feeling whatsoever for good or ill maniakes could not fault him when he started shouting to his men to rally he had a bigger voice than his slim frame suggested and used it to good effect some of the horsemen fleeing the fall of amorion kept right on fleeing but others reined in and began adding themselves to maniakes regiments maniakes troopers seemed to gain fresh heart too seeing that not everything was falling to pieces before their eyes forward maniakes shouted the trumpeters sent the command to the whole force as if the men were ships spread across the sea they advanced at a trot they could quickly kick up to a gallop at need here and there they passed videssians leading lame horses and men on foot whose horses must have foundered altogether or been killed those soldiers stared in disbelief at the spectacle of a strong force from their own side heading toward the oncoming makuraners rather than away from them they also passed dead horses and dead menfreshly dead not yet bloated and stinking those would have been wounded when they fled amorion and its environs but they hadnt made it to safety maniakes mouth was a thin bitter line so many men thrown away these past seven years genesios couldnt have done a better job of gutting the empire if he had set out to accomplish exactly that then maniakes spied another body of soldiery riding east at first from a distance he thought they were more imperials trying to break free from the makuraners after a moment he realized they were the makuraners from whom the garrison at amorion had been trying to get free they rode big strong horses with their style of fighting they needed such sturdy beasts too the riders wore full armor of chain and splints with lamellae protecting their arms and legs chainmail veils of iron rings hung from their helmets to ward their faces only their eyes and hands showed and iron halfgauntlets held weapons away from the backs of those hands even their horses wore iron scales mounted on leather an armor that reached back to the animals flanks the riders carried long heavy spears with swords slung in scabbards on their left sides so they could protect themselves if their spearshafts broke in battle ply them with arrows maniakes shouted stay at long range and scattereddont come to close quarters with them those were standard tactics for videssians fighting their western neighbors videssian cavalrymen wore mail shirt and helmet only and never rode armored horses the makuraner horsemen and their mounts had to be sweltering in the heat which was why the videssians had given them the scornful boiler boy nickname the makuraners lances came down to point straight at their foes the sun sparkled off sharpedged iron sharbaraz king of kings the heavyarmored cavalrymen shouted in their own language maniakes spoke it not with any great fluency but enough to make himself understood the makuraners had other cries too abivard and hosios avtokrator maniakes looked around for abivard but did not see him the enemy who had been his friend must not have been with his foremost troops his own men yelled videssos and maniakes avtokrator back at the makuraners a few videssians also yelled tzikas they all sounded fierce and spirited which made maniakes heart leap videssians had lost so many fights lately that any show of courage had to come as a surprise to their foes his troopers reached back over their shoulders to pluck arrows from their quivers then nocked them drew bows back to their eyes and let fly a couple of hundred years before such horse archery would have been much more difficult but stirrups let a rider control his mount well enough that he could without hesitation use both hands to shoot stirrups also let the makuraners charge with the lance without fear of being unseated videssos and makuran had taken the same notion and gone in different directions with it not all of maniakes troops were archers for closerin work javelin men nipped toward the enemy flung their darts and then tried to make off before the makuraners could draw near enough to spear them out of the saddle not all of them escaped as they would have hoped at close quarters an armored makuraner boiler boy was more than a match for any one videssian horseman the trick though was not to let the makuraners use their superior power to full advantage maniakes men outnumbered their foes no armor covered every part of a mans body no armor kept every shaft from penetrating after a short sharp combat the makuraners broke off and tried to escape that wasnt easy their horses still had to carry the extra weight of iron they bore and the horses wore no armor behind the videssians plied their vulnerable haunches with arrows the horses screamed in pain and terror their harassed riders fought hard to master them maniakes troopers cheered like wild men at the startling sight of makuraners showing their backs they galloped after the boiler boys with more spirit and excitement than videssian troops had shown in the westlands for years how far will you let them go tzikas asked adding your majesty half a beat late before long either the makuraners will rally or theyll find more of their kind and punish us for our presumption he was very possibly right biting his lip maniakes acknowledged that with a grudged nod but with fussy caution such as tzikas had shown no wonder the makuraners had run wild through the westlands if you assumed taking the initiative against them was presumption you wouldnt take the initiative tzikas might well be a genius of a defensive fighter he probably was to have held amorion so long still while lack of defense could make you lose a war having it was no guarantee you would win maniakes realized he hadnt answered the generals question which phrased differently had also been in his own mind well go a little farther he said having the men know they can beat the boiler boys may be worth more to us than goldpieces having them think they can beat the makuraners only to discover theyre wrong may cost us more than goldpieces tzikas answered dolorously again maniakes nodded he waved on his horsemen nonetheless it occurred to him that he might need to worry less than he had thought about tzikas trying to usurp the throne by all signs the man was too cautious to go squat behind a bush at night without shining a torch there to make sure he wouldnt meet a bear maniakes drew his sword so did tzikas his face stayed set in disapproving lines but he did not lack animal courage together they joined the videssian cavalry in pursuit of the makuraners the leaders from among maniakes men had got well ahead of the avtokrator and the general maniakes urged his gelding after them just before he caught them up fresh horn calls came up ahead horn calls different from those videssos used straighten up there maniakes shouted to the horsemen in front of him form line of battle dont pelt after them like a herd of sheep gone mad on crazyweed there are a lot of makuraners up there tzikas remarked it wasnt i told you so but it might as well have been along with the horn calls shouts and screams rang out all at once maniakes horsemen were no longer pursuers but pursued they came galloping back toward him riding harder than they had after the fleeing makuraner heavy cavalry horses barrels ran with blood from frantic spurring animals flanks showed lines from the whip close behind them in no better order coursed more makuraner riders these were not boiler boys but the light cavalry the king of kings used to bulk up his forces they were armed with bows and swords and armored for the most part with nothing more than iron pots for their heads and heavy leather jerkins maniakes knew their kind wild and fierce when they had the advantage and as quick to panic if things went wrong or they were checked but how to check them stand fast maniakes cried individually his men enjoyed the same advantage over the makuraner light horsemen as the heavy cavalry did over the videssians but the imperials would not stand fast not when they saw enemy horsemen sliding round their flanks in a fury maniakes spurred toward the makuraners they scattered before him they had no taste for handtohand combat with a man both well protected and bold tzikas stayed at his right hand slashing with his sword a few other imperials rode with them doing their best to stem the building rout maniakes traded sword strokes with a makuraner too hemmed in to evade him whatever words the fellow shouted were lost in the general din of combat sweat carved canyons through the pale dust covering the soldiers swarthy skin his face was long rectangular solemn with large dark deepset eyes that could show soulful seriousness but now blazed with blood lust with a cunning stroke maniakes knocked the sword from his hand it flew spinning into the dirt but before the avtokrator could finish him another makuraner made straight for him he had to twist awkwardly to meet the new onslaught and knew a moments stark fear that he would not be able to twist in time then tzikas attacked the oncoming horseman forcing him to sheer off before he could strike at the avtokrator my thanks maniakes said he turned back toward the makuraner he had disarmed but the fellow had taken advantage of his moment of distraction to get away i am privileged to serve your majesty tzikas said maniakes had trouble reading anything into his tone was that simple statement of fact submissiveness or irony the avtokrator could not tell he got no time to worry about it either more makuraner horns were winded he had a brief glimpse of more horsemen riding to the growing fight from out of the west grimacing he nodded toward tzikas seems you were right eminent sir he said now lets see how we can get ourselves out of this mess aye your majesty tzikas hesitated then went on do you know neither likinios nor genesios so far as i remember ever admitted he was wrong maybe im just new on the throne maniakes said his voice dry tzikas sent him a sharp look then decided it was a joke and laughed maniakes continued admitting i made the mistake doesnt much help me put it to rights now no not this time tzikas agreed but that may not be so on some other occasionprovided we live to see other occasions yes provided maniakes said given the number of makuraners who swarmed forward to shoot arrows at his men that was by no means obvious the tactical solution presenting itselfthat was all too obvious with headlong retreat the only possible choice to escape catastrophe though videssian doctrine dealt matteroffactly with retreat maniakes bared his teeth in an anguished scowl his own willingness to push forward to meet etzilios had led to disaster outside of imbros now he had been impetuous again and was again paying the price for it i wish i were a turtle he said to no one in particular id go into my shell and never come out this can have its advantages tzikas said with a grave nod thus amorion remained in our hands throughout genesios unhappy reign and thus it was lost in mine maniakes answered a proud record isnt it but you may be right more often than notyou certainly are this time i cant help thinking though that sometimes the cure for too much boldness is more not less tzikas dark mournful eyes did all the contradicting he couldnt speak aloud for now though boldness in attack was simply out of the question avtokrator and general rode side by side righting when they had to and doing their best to hold the retreat in check rally rally someone cried in videssian parsmanios when he spied his brother he said heres a fine mixedup day where the leader of the main force gets ahead of the leader of the van heres a fine dreadful day maniakes said then he added his own voice to parsmanios trying to persuade his cavalrymen and those who had originally ridden with tzikas to hold fast now and again he thought he would succeed but then either more makuraners would come up or the videssians would begin to melt away and he would have to fall back and try again at last not long before sunset his forces succeeded not in halting the makuraners but in breaking free of them and being able to set up camp without getting attacked while they were going about it a miserable camp it was too wounded men groaned and cursed here and there healerpriests labored to bring forth their curative magic and restore to health some warriors who had been grievously wounded as always maniakes watched the bluerobes with more than a little awe when one of them laid hands on a man even someone as blind to magic as the avtokrator could sense the current of healing passing to the one who was hurt and when the priest took his hands away the healed wound would look as if it had been suffered years before but the cost on the healerpriests was high after each man they treated they would emerge from their healing trance like men awakening from some killing labor after not enough rest they would gulp food and swill down wine then lurch on to the next desperate case and after they had healed two or perhaps three men each they would fall asleep so deeply that even kicking at them did no more than make them stir and mutter men whose hurts were not bad enough to require such drastic intervention made do with surgeons who drew arrows and sewed up gashes and poured wine over wounds to keep them from rotting so the surgeons said at any rate maniakes often wondered if they helped as many men as they hurt he strode through the camp doing his best to keep up the soldiers spirits he found bagdasares sitting on the ground with his head in his hands as if afraid it would fall off if he didnt keep tight hold on it magical sir have you any skill in healing maniakes asked bagdasares looked up whats that he said blankly oh your majesty no im sorry i fear i have none whatever even among mages healers are a special breed their gift can be trained if it is present but it must be inborn i know of no man without that innate talent who ever succeeded in relieving anothers misery maniakes sighed i thought you would say something of the sort else you would have been laboring with the priests as best you could by the good god though i wish it were otherwise if you cannot heal what can you accomplish for us in this joyless place not even as much as a fighting man could bagdasares answered with a guilty frown all im good for is eating up food that might instead go to someone who has a chance of keeping both himself and me alive how do we change that in the future maniakes asked wizards should not have so many limits on their sorcerous powers we do better than we once did bagdasares said in the days of stavrakios the great the healing art was but newly born and as likely to kill a healerpriest as to cure the poor chap he was trying to save we know more of other arts than they did in his day too maniakes said i was thinking about that not so long agoyou read the accounts of his campaigns and youll see he and his followers didnt know the use of stirrups i wouldnt like to try riding without them i tell you that he rubbed his chin thinking how strange it was to be talking about changes from longago days after a lost battle even thinking about changes from longago days felt strange he hadnt noted any changes in the way he lived through his whole lifetime save those that went with his own change in age and station he didnt ever remember his father talking about such changes either if they had gone on they had done so at a pace too slow for any one man to notice but go on they had a river would eventually shift its bed with the passing years so too when you looked far enough the course of human knowledge and endeavor shifted he supposed that accumulation of slow steady but in the end significant changes had been growing since the day when phos created vaspur firstborn of all mankind he let out a snort if he was to be properly orthodox by videssian standards he could not let himself believe in the tale of vaspur and other doctrinal matters the most holy agathios would no doubt term heretical he shook his head nohe could not let himself be seen to believe in the tale of vaspur and the rest your majesty bagdasares asked wondering what the snort and the headshake meant never mind maniakes said fuzz on the brain thats all amazing the notions i can come up with to keep from thinking about the mess were in ah yes bagdasares answered the mess were in what do we do about it what can we do about it nothing i can see maniakes said the words bitter as alum in his mouth come morning the makuraners are going to attack us again theyll have more men than we will and theyll have their peckers up because theyve beaten us once theyve beaten us more than once bagdasares said incautiously too true maniakes said so long as they keep it in mindas we have to as wellitll be worth extra men to their side not that theyll need extra men tomorrow theyll attack us theyll beat us and well have to retreat again pretty soon well be back in garsavra at the edge of the plateau he scowled by the good god pretty soon well be back in videssos the city with all the westlands lost surely it wont be so bad as that bagdasares said youre right maniakes said glumly its liable to be worse scouts from the rear guard came galloping into maniakes miserable camp not long after dawn began painting the eastern sky with pink and gold the makuraners are moving they shouted in tones that could have been no more horrorstricken were they announcing the end of the world as far as the empire of videssos went they might as well have been announcing the end of the world maniakes had hoped to mount a defense maybe even a counterattack against the men from makuran one look at his armys reaction to the news that the enemy was on the way drove that thought from his head men cried out in alarm some fled on foot others made as if to rush the guards who were keeping watch on the long lines of tethered horses no one showed the slightest eagerness to fight what now your majesty tzikas asked he still wasnt saying i told you so but by his expression he was thinking it very loudly now we fall back maniakes answered bleakly what else can we do while videssian military doctrine did not necessarily condemn retreat after a while you got to the point where you had no room left in which to retreat his situation in the westlands was rapidly approaching that point tzikas sighed with more resignation than maniakes could make himself feel ah well your majesty he said evidently trying to console had we not run into them yesterday they would have come upon us in short order which doesnt make our predicament here any better maniakes raised his voice to a shout that carried through the camp parsmanios his brother hurried up to his tent a couple of minutes later aye your majesty he asked as formally polite as if unrelated to the avtokrator youll go from vanguard commander to rear guard today maniakes said i dont expect miracles just try to keep em off us as best you can ill do whatever im able to parsmanios answered he hurried away command me your majesty tzikas said maniakes was reluctant to do that he gauged tzikas obedience as springing more from policy than from conviction but without any choice he said stay by me well fight side by side as we did yesterday let it be as you say tzikas replied even as he spoke the sound of makuraner horns blown in excitement and triumph came faintly to maniakes ear across a rapidly shrinking stretch of ground fall back the avtokrator ordered and his own hornplayers relayed the dolorous call to everyone within earshot it wasnt a complete rout not quite maniakes soldiers hung together as a unit instead of wildly riding off every which way in search of safety maniakes hoped that was because of the discipline he had helped instill in them on their way to the encounter with the makuraners he was however realistic enough to suspect that the troopers stuck together only because they thought they were likelier to survive by doing so the running fight lasted from dawn till late afternoon then maniakes set an ambush in a grove of almond trees not far from the arandos the only way he could get his men to stay there and await the makuraners was to lead the ambush party himself even then he had to growl at one nervous horseman you try and run off on me and ill kill you myself before long the makuraners came up a few boiler boys mixed with a larger band of light horsemen they rode in loose order laughing and joking and plainly not looking for any trouble why should they maniakes thought bitterly we havent given them any up till now he drew his sword videssos he shouted and spurred his horse out of its hiding place for a hideous instant he thought the men he had gathered would let him ride to his doom all alone then more shouts of videssos and some of maniakes split the air the thunder of hoofbeats behind him was some of the sweetest music he had ever heard the makuraners looked almost comically horrified as he and his men barreled toward them the fight was over bare moments after it began the videssians rode through and over their foes plying bow javelin and sword with a will a few makuraners managed to break out of the engagement their cries of terror loud and lovely in maniakes ears more though either died at once or were overtaken and slain from behind a victory a great victory yelled the man maniakes had threatened to kill he was bold now even if he hadnt been then and the avtokrator did not begrudge him his sudden access of spirit seeing maniakes he asked what does our victory bring us your majesty maniakes wished he would have picked almost any other question he didnt answer aloud but all he had won by routing the makuraners advance party was the chance to camp for the night without being attacked and then when morning came to resume the retreat tzikas undoubtedly would have thought he was lucky to get even that much maybe tzikas was right in his stand at amorion he had shown himself a master of defensive fighting but maniakes remained convinced he could not win by merely defending as soon as he could he aimed to take the offensive as soon as he could though wouldnt be any time soon and moreovertake the offensive where he said try as he would he found no answer from the little harbor in the palace quarter maniakes glumly peered west over the cattle crossing at the smoke rising in great fat columns above the suburb called across only that narrow stretch of waterand the dromons that unceasingly patrolled itheld the armies of the king of kings away from videssos the city in all the wars weve ever fought with the makuraners theyve never reached the cattle crossing before he said morosely his father sighed and clapped him on the shoulder so long as they dont get across the strait you still have the chance to go down in history as the great hero who drove them back from the very brink of victory the elder maniakes said what brink maniakes said they have their victory right there and how am i supposed to drive them back theyve cut me off from the westlands and we draw most of our tax revenues from that part of the empire how will i pay my soldiers phos father they arent even ravaging across and letting it go at that from what the sailors say theyre settling in to winter there i would in their sandals the elder maniakes answered calmly still just because theyre at across doesnt mean they hold all the westlands i know that maniakes said were still strong in the hill country of the southeast and not far from the border with vaspurakan and we still hold a good many towns but with abivards army plugging the way against us we cant do much to support the forces we still have there and we cant do anything at all to get revenue out of the western provinces i wish i could tell you youre wrong his father said but youre not one good thing i can see is that abivards men have done such a fine job burning out the croplands all around across that theyll have a hard time keeping themselves fed through the winter especially if our horsemen can nip in and pinch off their supply lines maniakes grunted when you had to look at the worst part of a disaster and figure out how it mighteventuallyredound to your advantage you were hard up indeed as a matter of fact the empire of videssos was hard up indeed the wind began to rise it had a nip to it before long the fall rains would start and then the winter snows he couldnt do anything much about solving the empires problems now no matter how much he wanted to come spring if he was wise enoughand lucky enoughhe might improve the situation niphone seems to be doing well the elder maniakes said sketching the sunsign to take his words straight up to phos and your daughter has a squawk that would make her a fine herald if she were a man all very well maniakes answered and the lord with the great and good mind knows im grateful for what he chooses to give me but when set against that he waved toward the makuraners on the far side of the cattle crossing my personal affairs seem like coppers set against goldpieces his father shook his head never belittle your personal affairs if youre miserable at home youll go and do stupid things when you take the field more stupid things than you would otherwise i mean ha maniakes clapped a hand to his forehead i was enough of an idiot out there for any eight miserable men you could name do you know what genesios asked me just before i cut off his head he asked if id rule the empire any better than he had from what happened my first year id have to say the answer is no dont take it too much to heart the elder maniakes said youre still trying to muck out the stables he left youand he left a lot of muck in them too oh by the good god didnt he maniakes sighed you make me feel bettera little better but even if the muck isnt all my fault i can still smell its stink well have to move it farther from the castle he gestured again toward the smoke rising from across they cant spend the winter there his father said they cant after a while theyll see they cant cross the strait to menace the city either and theyll pull back but the makuraners didnt kameas came into the chamber where maniakes was fighting a losing battle against the provincial tax registers if no gold came in how was he supposed to keep doling it out could he robor to put it more politely borrow fromthe temples again did they have enough gold and silver left to make that worthwhile he looked up in the hope the vestiarios would bear news interesting enough to distract him from his worries kameas did may it please your majesty a messenger has come from the palace harbor he reports that the makuraner general abivard over in across has sent word to one of your ship captains that he would have speech with you would he maniakes eyebrows shot up aye your majesty he would answered kameas who could be quite literalminded he went on further he pledges your safe return if you go over the cattle crossing to across maniakes laughed long and bitterly at that does he indeed etzilios made me the same pledge and see how well that turned out i may be a fool but i can learn no matter how generous abivard is with pledges i shall not put my head inside the makuraners jaws and invite them to bite down then you will not meet with him the vestiarios sounded disappointed which made maniakes thoughtful kameas went on any chance to compose our differences is most unlikely maniakes interrupted kameas looked as if the avtokrator had just kicked his puppy maniakes held out a hand you neednt pout esteemed sir ill talk with him if he wants to talk with me but i dont expect miracles and were hardly in a position to demand concessions from abivard are we no your majesty though i wish we were kameas said i shall convey your words to the messenger who in turn can pass them on to the makuraner general thank you esteemed sir tell the messenger to tell abivard that i will meet with him at the fourth hour of the day tomorrow videssosand makuran toodivided day and night into twelve hours each beginning at sunrise and sunset respectively let him put his standard on the shore and i will come and speak to him from a boat my war galleys will be close by to prevent any treachery it shall be as you say kameas answered and waddled out to pass on the conditions to the messenger maniakes lowered his eyes to the cadaster he had been studying when the vestiarios came in the numbers refused to mean anything to him he shut the tax register and thought about seeing abivard again as he had told kameas it wasnt likely anything would come of talking with him but hope like any other hearty weed was hard to root out altogether there your majesty the officer in command of the boat in which maniakes rode pointed you see the red lion banner flapping on the beach aye i see it maniakes answered by the good god i hope its never seen on a videssian beach again he glanced back over his shoulder there on the eastern shore of the cattle crossing he was still avtokrator his word obeyedby those outside his immediate householdas if he were incarnate law in the land he was approaching though sharbarazs word not his was law there beside the makuraner banner stood a tall man in a fancy striped caftan of fine soft wool the fellow wore a sword on his belt and a conical helmet with a feathered crest and a bar nasal on his head at first maniakes did not think he could be abivard for he had streaks of gray in his beard as the boat drew closer though maniakes recognized the grandee who had stayed with sharbaraz even when his cause looked blackest he waved abivard waved back take us well inside arrow range maniakes told the boat captain i want to be able to talk without screaming my lungs out the fellow gave him a dubious look very well your majesty he said at last but warned the rowers be ready to get us out of here as fast as you can work the oars since maniakes found that a sensible precaution he nodded without comment in the makuraner language abivard called i greet you maniakes no respectful title went with the name the men of makuran did not recognize maniakes as legitimate avtokrator of the videssians i greet you abivard maniakes replied in videssian abivard had mastered some of the empires tongue when he and maniakes campaigned together against smerdis the makuraner usurper since he had spent so much time in videssian territory since those days he probably had more now maniakes expected him either to get on with what he had come to say or to launch into a florid makuraner harangue about videssian iniquity he did neither instead he said have you or your guardsmen any silver shields is he daft the captain of the small boat murmured i dont know maniakes murmured back by abivards intense tone by the way he stared intently across the water at maniakes he meant the question to be taken seriously maniakes raised his voice no abivard silver shields are not part of my guards ceremonial dress nor of my own why do you ask the no made abivards shoulder slump maniakes could see as much even across the water that separated them but the makuraner general rallied and said maniakes the king of kings and the avtokrator should not be at odds with each other but should govern their states like true brothers for there is no other empire like these abivard i would better like hearing that from you if we were not at war and if you called me majesty instead of the fraud and pretender whom sharbaraz king of kingsyou see i recognize him he would not be king of kings if videssos had not recognized himraised up in my place sharbaraz wants to be videssos big brother to watch over us and tell us what to do if you speak of brotherhood go back to your proper border and do it there not here at the cattle crossing if you will come to an understanding with sharbaraz king of kings may his years be many and his realm increase the states of makuran and videssos will not let their thoughts drift apart from each other they should be eager to become friendly and to agree abivard answered florid makuraner harangue indeed maniakes thought aloud he replied when you say we should become friendly and agree you mean i should become sharbarazs slave if you acknowledge his supremacy he will grant you a treaty admitting your place on the videssian throne abivard said so he has told me swearing by the god and the four prophets the greatness of this treaty will endure for when goodwill and friendship toward each other prevail by our using concern and good counsel it would be unholy to raise arms against each other and unjustly distress and harass our subjects does that mean youll be leaving across this afternoon or will you wait till tomorrow maniakes asked sweetly abivard ignored him he had his speech set and he was going to finish it what will come of this if you acknowledge the authority of sharbaraz king of kings may his years be many and his realm increase you will be more fortunate than other men and throughout your life you will be admirable and deserve emulation but if you let this chance go and decline to make a great and good peaceif you do not figure out what is to your advantageyou will see instead hostility and enmity you will cause allout discordant impossible warfare and it is only too likely that you will be choosing great toil and exertion and will spend many lives you will spend your treasures but will create only the maximum of destruction in general the wars end will result only in great evil for you you can see this from what has happened since i invaded videssian territory and from the terrible things it has seen and suffered but with peace the condition of your state will stop being so very pitiful and wretched frankly abivard i dont believe a word of it maniakes said if you want peace if sharbaraz king of kings wants peace you may have it any time you like all you need do is pack up your soldiers and go back to makuran leave videssian soil and we shall have peace abivard shook his head maniakes would have been astonished had he done anything else the makuraner general said peace can be yours if you want it send envoys dealing with that matter to sharbaraz king of kings he will be persuaded by me i am sure and will come around to your point of view make peace now secure and pure for all time to come in and of itself that was more of a concession than maniakes had thought to get from abivard but he answered from all i have seen sharbaraz king of kings is persuaded by no man these days he does as he pleases and if it pleases him to outrage my envoys he will with no one to let or hinder him his principal wife is my sister abivard said speaking with rather than at maniakes for the first time since his odd question about silver shields if he heeds anyone he heeds me maniakes studied him how often does he heed anyone but seldom or i miss my guess the king of kings is his own judge as a man who calls himself avtokrator should know abivard said that is true but a man who listens only to himself will sooner or later hear the words of a fool with no one to tell him so maniakes answered how can you weigh the proper course when you dont know all the choices consider where we are talking maniakes abivard said and think whether this king of kings or the avtokrator has planned more wisely if we were speaking outside mashiz i might think your point better taken i said sooner or later maniakes replied that something has not happened yet doesnt mean it can never happen do you play at dice he waited for abivards nod before going on then you know that just because no one has rolled the double ones of phos little suns for a long time doesnt mean they cant come up on the next throw with us a double two is the winning throwwe call it the prophets four abivard said one and three ranks next some of us call that fraortish and the rest others the lady shivini and the men he kicked at the sand of the beach but i did not ask you here to talk about dice i take it you will not yield even if reason calls on you to do so i will not i cannot maniakes said stavrakios took mashiz but you makuraners went on and now you have won a triumph you will not take videssos the city and we too shall rise from the ruins videssos the city cries out to be sacked abivard said it may yet happen maniakes and sooner than you think say what you will maniakes answered but if you so much as dip a toe into the waters of the cattle crossing a dromon will row up and slice it off abivard scowled maniakes knew he had angered him that bothered the avtokrator not at all the makuraners were fine horsemen and clever artificers in close combat on land and in siege operations they were a match for their videssian neighbors one thing they were not though was sailors they could look over the cattle crossing at videssos the city but the imperial navy kept them from getting to the other side of that little strip of water i have no more to say to you maniakes abivard said when we meet again we shall be at war once more be it so then maniakes turned to the captain of the light boat it is over it accomplished nothing take me back to the docks in the palace quarter as you say your majesty the officer answered and gave the oarsmen their orders the light boat pulled away from the beach by across maniakes looked back over his shoulder abivard stood on the sand watching him go the makuraner general took a couple of steps toward the cattle crossing but did not try to get his feet wet alvinos bagdasares plucked at his thick black beard let me make sure i understand you correctly your majesty he said you want me to learn why abivard was so interested in finding out whether you or your retinue had along a silver shield when you spoke with him the other day thats right maniakes said it meant something important to him and he was disappointed when i told him no if i know why it may tell me something i can use to help drive the makuraners back where they belong can you learn for me what it is i dont know bagdasares answered if the answer is in some way connected with sorcery other sorcery may be able to uncover it but if it springs from something that happened to abivard on campaign say odds are long against our ever knowing what was in his question do everything you can maniakes said if you dont find the answer were no worse off than we would have been had you not tried this is not something i can accomplish overnight the wizard warned him it will take research into the spell most likely to be effective and more time perhaps to gather the materials to complement the symbolic portion of the enchantment take your time maniakes mouth twisted why not by all the signs abivard is going to winter in across after all i dont know what he gains by it except humiliating us but he certainly does that still its not as if we havent been humiliated enough other ways lately im sure it could be worse your majesty bagdasares said maniakes fixed him with a baleful glare really sorcerous sir how he gave bagdasares credit instead of mumbling an apology the mage quite visibly thought about how things might be worse at last he said well the makuraners and kubratoi could make common cause against us phos forbid it maniakes burst out appalled youre right that would be worse the good god grant sharbaraz never thinks of it it wouldnt be easy to arrange not with our war galleys holding abivard off in the westlands a good thing they are toootherwise id have something new and dreadful to worry about alongside all the old dreadful things on my mind now bagdasares bowed i did not mean to trouble you your majesty i sought but to obey you succeeded all too well maniakes said go on now see how to go about finding what was in abivards mind and i he sighed and reached for a cadaster from the westlands he knew what revenues would be recorded inside none i shall set about making bronze without tinand without copper too come to that after a little while maniakes interest in seeing how little the empire would be able to spend in the year to come palled he got up from the table where he had been depressing himself and went wandering through the halls of the imperial residence those halls were chilly winter would soon be at hand maniakes glanced west he could not see the makuraners lording it over the suburbs of the imperial capital but he felt their presence the humiliation of which he had spoken to bagdasares burned at him like vinegar poured onto a wound the hallways of the residence held mementos of avtokrators past genesios fortunately had not tried to immortalize himself in that particular way if he had maniakes would have thrown whatever he had left behind onto the rubbish heap the best memorial genesios could have had was the pretense that he had never existed not wanting to think about genesios maniakes paused awhile in front of a portrait of stavrakios the avtokrator of old wore the red boots the heavy crown and the gilded chainmail that went with his office but in spite of those trappings resembled a veteran underofficer much more than anyones expectations of what an emperor should look like he was painted as squat and muscular with blunt battered features dark pouches under his eyes and an expression that warned the whole world to get out of his way not all of the world had listened so stavrakios spent most of his long reign forcibly moving it aside maniakes who now needed to salute no living manno matter what sharbaraz had demanded of himgave stavrakios a formal salute clenched right fist over his heart if you could beat the makuraners no reason i cant he said the old picture of course didnt answer if it had maniakes would have suspected either that he was losing his wits or that bagdasares was playing a sorcerous joke on him all the same he could almost hear what the great avtokrator of days gone by was thinking well if youre going to what are you waiting for in his minds ear stavrakios sounded a lot like his own father he studied the portrait a while longer wondering how stavrakios would have got out of this predicamentor how he would have kept from getting into it in the first place the best answer maniakes could come up with was that stavrakios wouldnt have gone into anything with an inadequate force maniakes had done that twice now first against the kubratoihe had anticipated treachery there but not on the scale etzilios had plannedand then against the makuraners again that hadnt been altogether his faulthow could he have anticipated amorion falling just before he got to itbut the results had been disastrously similar he nodded to stavrakios all right sir i was stupid twice which is once more than im entitled to but i promise you this next time i put troops into battle the numbers will be on my side theyd better be for a moment maniakes thought he was again imagining stavrakios reply then he realized he really had heard the words and whirled around in surprise his father grinned at him sorry to break in like that sonyour majestybut youd just said something that makes a good deal of sense i wanted to make sure youd remember it you managed that by the good god maniakes said now he set the palm of his hand over his heart which was still pounding in his chest to say nothing of scaring me out of six months growth his fathers grin got wider and rather unpleasant fair enoughwell say nothing of that but what you said was wise if youre going to hit the other fellow make sure you hit him so hard he cant get back up try and do things by halves and youll just end up throwing both halves away yes ive seen that maniakes agreed but the goldpiece has two faces if i charge ahead on one course with everything i have it had better be the right one or else i only make my mistake larger and juicier than it would have been juicier eh i like that the elder maniakes let out a wheezing chuckle well son youre rightno two faces on the goldpiece there youd better be right for videssos sake too were at the point now where being even a little wrong could sink us even bad luck might do you know that when i was a boy old men would talk about one year when they were children that was so cold the cattle crossing froze from here all the way over to across and you could go to and from the westlands dryshod if we get that kind of winter again our dromons wont be able to patrol the strait and the makuraners will be able to cross from the westlands and lay siege to us maniakes finished for him you do so relieve my mind every time it snows this winter now ill be looking up and wondering how long it will last and how bad it will be as if i didnt have enough things to worry about the elder maniakes chuckled again maybe now you understand why when the eminent kourikos tried to put the red boots on me i turned him down flat niphone got up out of bed to use the chamber pot the cold air that got in when she lifted up the quilts and sheepskins that held winter at bay woke maniakes he grunted and stretched im sorry niphone said i didnt mean to bother you its all right maniakes said as she slid back into bed theres already the beginning of light in the east so it cant be too early in fact since todays midwinters day its getting light as late as it does any time during the year thats true niphone cocked her head listening i think the snows given way to rain she shivered id rather have snow the rain will turn to ice as soon as it touches the ground and people and horses will be sliding everywhere it wont freeze on the cattle crossing which is all that matters to me almost all maniakes amended slipping a hand up under her wool nightdress so that his palm rested on her bulging belly as if to oblige him the baby she was carrying kicked he laughed in delight this one kicks harder than evtropia did i think niphone said maybe that means it will be a boy maybe it does maniakes said bagdasares thinks it will be a boybut then he thought evtropia would be a boy too hes not always as smart as he thinks he is that was one reason maniakes had not asked his wizard to try to learn how niphone would fare in her confinement another was that bagdasares hadnt yet figured out why abivard had been interested in a silver shield he had warned that would take time but maniakes hadnt expected it to stretch into months and if he couldnt manage the one how could the avtokrator rely on his answer to the other when does the mime show at the amphitheater begin today niphone asked weve spread word through the city that it will start in the third hour maniakes answered any which way though it wont start till were there we dont want to make the people angry niphone said nor to anger the lord with the great and good mind either the covers shifted as she sketched phos sunsign above her heart he nodded no not this year midwinters day marked the time when the sun was at its lowest ebb in the sky when skotos snatched most strongly at it trying to steal its light and leave the world in eternal frozen darkness as the days went by the sun would rise ever higher escaping the evil gods clutches but after this year of disasters did phos still care about videssos would the sun move higher in the sky once more priests and wizards would watch anxiously till they learned the answer niphone rode to the amphitheater in a litter borne by stalwart guardsmen maniakes walked alongside with more guardsmen to protect him from assassins and to force a way through the crowds that packed the plaza of palamas a dozen parasolbearers carrying bright silk canopies proclaimed his imperial status to the people bonfires blazed here and there across the square men and women queued up to leap over them shouting burn illluck as they jumped maniakes broke away from his guards to join one of the lines people greeted him by name and slapped him on the back as if he were a pig butcher popular with his neighbors on any other day of the year that would have been lese majesty today almost anything went maniakes reached the head of the line he ran jumped and shouted when he landed on the far side of the fire he stumbled as his booted foot hit a slushy bit of ground somebody grabbed his elbow to keep him from falling thanks he gasped any time his benefactor said here why dont you stay and see if you cant catch somebody too itd make a mans day or a ladys even more the fellow winked at him and they do say anything can happen on midwinters day because they said that if babies born about the time of the autumnal equinox didnt happen to look a great deal like their mothers husbands few people raised eyebrows one day of license a year helped keep you to the straight and narrow the rest of the time the next few people in the queue sailed over the bonfires without difficulty then a woman leapt short and almost landed in the flames maniakes ran forward to drag her away niphone he exclaimed what were you doing jumping there the same thing you were his wife answered defiantly lifting her chin making sure i start the new year without the bad luck piled up from the old one maniakes exhaled through his nose trying to hold on to patience i put you in the litter so you wouldnt tire yourself out walking or go into labor sooner than you should and you go and run and jump yes i do and what are you going to do about it niphone said this is midwinters day when everyone does as heor shepleases faced by open mutiny maniakes did the only thing he could he cut his losses now that you have jumped will you please get back into the litter so we can go on to the amphitheater of course your majesty niphone demurely cast her eyes down to the cobbles of the plaza of palamas i obey you in all things she walked back toward the bearers and other guardsmen leaving him staring after her i obey you in all things his mind translated except when i dont feel like it when the parasolbearers emerged through the avtokrators private entrance waves of cheers and clapping rolled down on maniakes like surf from a stormy sea he raised a hand to acknowledge them knowing they werent for him in particular but in anticipation of the mime show that now would soon begin he took his seat at the center of the long spine that ran down the middle of the amphitheaters floor most days the enormous structure was used for horse races the spine defined the inner margin of the course today thoughtoday maniakes said people of videssos and the crowd quieted at once a magic not of sorcery but of architecture let everyone in the amphitheater hear his voice when he spoke from that one spot people of videssos he repeated and then went on may phos be with youmay phos be with usall through the coming year as the sun rises higher in the sky from this day forward so may the fortunes of the empire of videssos rise from the low estate in which they now find themselves so may it be the multitude cried with one voice maniakes thought the top of his head would come off not only could everyone in the amphitheater hear him when he spoke from that one spot as long as he stayed there all the noise in the great tureen of a building poured right down on him he gestured to agathios who sat not far away the ecumenical patriarch led the tens of thousands of spectators in phos creed again the noise of the response dinned in the avtokrators ears maniakes said to sweeten the year to come i give you the mime troupes of videssos the city applause rocked him once more he sat down leaned back in the throne set on the spine for him and prepared to enjoy the mimes as best he couldand to endure what he could not enjoy everything save phos himself was fair game on midwinters day an avtokrator who could not take what the mimes dished out lost favor with the fickle populace of the city leaning over to agathios maniakes asked did genesios let himself be lampooned here he did your majesty the patriarch answered the one year he tried to check the mime troupes the people rioted and his guardsmen looked likely to go over to them instead of keeping them in check after that he sat quiet and did his best to pretend nothing was happening what a pity maniakes said i was hoping he would give me a precedent for massacring any troupe that didnt strike my fancy agathios stared at him then decided he was joking and started to laugh maniakes was jokingafter a fashion but worries about offending the avtokrator went out the window on midwinters day along with everything else mime troupes were supposed to mock the man who held the throneand he was supposed to take it in good part no matter how much he wanted to set his guardsmen on the impudent actors out came the first troupe most of them were dressed up as extravagant caricatures of makuraner boiler boys though they werent mounted one fellow though wore an even more exaggerated likeness of the imperial regalia maniakes had on the troupes act was of the utmost simplicity the boiler boys chased the fellow playing maniakes around and around the racetrack the crowd thought that was very funny had he been sitting up near the top of the amphitheater with no concerns past his own belly and perhaps his family maniakes might have found it funny too as it was he smiled and clapped his hands and did his best to hold his temper he had a long morning ahead of him one troupe had him and parsmanios out looking for tatoules and finding a horse apple instead another had made a huge parchment map of the empire of videssosit must have cost them a good many goldpiecesand proceeded to tear it in half and burn up the part that held the westlands still another had him running from first the kubratoi and then the makuraners and the two sets of videssos foes colliding with each other and getting into a brawl maniakes really did clap over that one then he realized that if the kubratoi and makuraners really did meet they would of necessity do so over the corpse of the empire he wondered if the mimesor the audiencefully understood that he hoped not at last the show ended maniakes rose and led the audience in a cheer for the performers who had entertained themand embarrassed him he hadnt been the least bit sorry when rotten fruit greeted a couple of troupes that lacked the saving grace of being funny had he had a basket of rotten apples at his feet he would have pelted most of the mimes as it was he took the mockery as best he could people filed out of the amphitheater off to revel through the rest of the short day and the long night maniakes walked back to the imperial residence beside niphones litter this time the empress stayed inside that relieved him as much as having the mime shows end no sooner had he returned to the residence though than kameas came up to him and said your majesty the wizard alvinos waits at the southern entrance he would have speech with you if you care to receive him for a moment maniakes failed to recognize the videssiansounding name bagdasares sometimes used when he did he said thank you esteemed sir yes ill see him perhaps hes had some success with his magic after all that would be a pleasant change bagdasares prostrated himself before maniakes the avtokrator hadnt always made him bother with a full proskynesis but did today he was less than pleased with the mage and wanted him to know it bagdasares did when maniakes finally gave him leave to rise he said your majesty i apologize for the long delay in learning what you required of me quite all right magical sir maniakes answered no doubt you had a more important client with more pressing business bagdasares stared then chuckled uneasily your majesty is pleased to jest with me i do wish id heard more from you sooner and thats a fact maniakes said here it is midwinters day by the good god and i set you the problem a few days after i met with abivard when i told you to take your time i own i didnt expect you to take all of it your majesty sometimes seeing the problem is easier than seeing the answer to it bagdasares replied im still not sure i have that answer only a way toward it but this is midwinters day as you said if you have it in mind to revel rather than worry about such things tell me and i shall return tomorrow no no never mind that maniakes said impatiently he could see all the problems genesios had left him but as bagdasares had said seeing how to surmount them was another matter its possible i owe you an apology say on sorcerous sir learning why someone does something is always tricky your majesty the wizard said sometimes even he does not know and sometimes the reasons he thinks he has are not the ones truly in his heart finding those reasons is like listening to the howl of yesterdays wind as you say maniakes answered and have you managed to capture the sound of yesterdays wind for todays ears i shall make the attempt to capture it at any rate bagdasares said i have tried this before with uniform lack of success but in my previous conjurations i always assumed abivards question arose from some connection with sharbaraz king of kings or with some mage from mashiz or both failure has forced me to abandon this belief however maniakes wondered if bagdasares was wrong or merely lacked the strength and skill to prove himself right he did not say that making a mage question his own ability weakened him further instead he asked what assumption do you set in its place then that abivard acquired this concern independently of the king of kings perhaps in opposition to himwould it not be fine to see mashiz rather than videssos engulfed in civil strifeor perhaps from before the time when he made sharbarazs acquaintance mm it could be so maniakes admitted if it is how do you go about demonstrating it you have indeed set your finger on the problem your majesty bagdasares said bowing recapturing ephemera especially longvanished ephemera is difficult in the extreme not least because the application of the laws of similarity and contagion often seems irrelevant seems irrelevant you say maniakes ear had been sensitized to subtle shades of meaning by more than a year on the throne you want me to understand that you have found a way around this difficulty i think i have at any rate bagdasares said ive not yet tested it i thought you might care to be present so i can see how clever youve been you mean maniakes said bagdasares looked injured but the avtokrator spoke without much malice he went on by all means sorcerous sir dazzle me with your brilliance if i can but give satisfaction your majesty that will be enough and to spare the mage answered he was not usually so selfeffacing but he didnt usually keep the avtokrator waiting a couple of months for a response either now he was all briskness if i may proceed your majesty without waiting for maniakes consent he drew from his carpetbag a lamp a clay jarat the moment tightly stopperedand a silver disk about as wide as the palm of his hand a rawhide cord ran from one side of the disk to the other to symbolize the support by which a soldier carried a shield bagdasares worked the stopper from the jar and poured water in a narrow stream on a tabletop this is seawater taken from the cattle crossing he said he set the silver disk close by it then made a few quick passes over the lamp not only did it light but with a flame far more brilliant than the usual so that maniakes had to squint and shield his eyes against it its as if you brought the summer sun into the imperial residence he said the effect does not last long but will be useful here bagdasares answered he picked up the disk and used it to reflect the sorcerously enhanced light into maniakes face the avtokrator blinked and squinted again nodding in satisfaction bagdasares said here we have a silver shield shining across a narrow sea not so exactly so maniakes agreed now to uncover the origins of the phrase bagdasares said and began to chant not in videssian but in the throaty vaspurakaner language after a moment maniakes recognized what he was chanting the story of how phos had created vaspur firstborn of all mankind between verses the mage murmured thus do we approach the problem of origins then he was chanting againverses agathios would surely have condemned as heretical agathios however wasnt here maniakes had grown up with these verses they didnt bother him suddenly out of the air a deep rich voice spoke maniakes habitually thought in videssian he had just been listening to a chant in the vaspurakaner tongue now he quickly had to adjust to yet another language for the words wherever they came fromand he could see no source for themwere in makuraner son of the dihqan i see a broad field that is not a field a tower on a hill where honor shall be won and lost and a silver shield shining across a narrow sea maniakes cocked his head to one side wondering if more would come but found only silence bagdasares his broad forehead glistening with sweat despite the chill of midwinters day staggered and almost fell he looked worn to exhaustion and sounded it too saying did you understand that your majesty it was not in a tongue i know i understood it yes maniakes answered and did his best to render it into videssian for the mage he went on it sounds to me as if you called back into being a prophecy from long ago so it would seem indeed shoulders bent gait halting bagdasares hobbled over to a chair and sank into it might i trouble you for some wine i find myself fordone maniakes called for a servitor response came slowly like so many others throughout videssos the city most of his household staff were out reveling on the holiday presently though a serving woman brought in a jar of wine and two cups bagdasares spat on the floor in rejection of skotos then drank down what the servant had poured him after a couple of slower sips of his own maniakes said when i campaigned with abivard and sharbaraz against smerdis the usurper abivard had with him a soothsayer named he hesitated trying to dredge up the memory tanshar thats what he called himself was it his voice we heard then bagdasares asked id not have thought so though i had scant dealings with him myself maniakes answered his beard was white not gray i can hardly imagine him sounding as as virile as did that voice you summoned from the deep if he was the one who gave the prophecy i recalled here who can say what power was speaking through him bagdasares sketched the sunsign not all such powers conform to our usual notions of fitness that much i can tell you id like to be surer than well this is possible maniakes said he ruefully shook his head what id like and what i get are apt to be two different things you neednt remind me of that magical sir for ive already learned it for myself still and all though abivard was responding to something in his past he reckoned important a broad field that is not a fieldi wonder what that meant other than that the soothsayer had a gift for obscurity abivard could tell usprovided the prophecy came true bagdasares said but then if some of it hadnt come true i dont suppose abivard would have been worrying about the restand i dont suppose we could have reconstructed it so readily my magic i think responded to magic already in the prophecy that sounds reasonable sorcerous sir maniakes agreed so now we have the answer to the question thats been troubling us since i met with abivard but even knowing the answer we still dont know why abivard wanted to see or would see that shining silver shield what conclusions do you draw from that two possibilities occur to me bagdasares answered one is that we were simply asking the wrong question the other is that the question was indeed the right one but the fullness of time for the answer has not yet come round maniakes nodded and theres no way to know which until the fullness of time does come roundif it ever does he sighed thank you sorcerous siri think triphylles puffed a little as he rose from his proskynesis your majesty you honor me beyond my worth by summoning me before your august presence this day how may i serve you command me his rather doughy face took on an expression intended to convey stern devotion to duty the last time maniakes had commanded himto fare north as envoy to the kubratoihe had also had to cajole him with the promise of a boost in rank he couldnt do that again eminent was the highest rung on the ladder he had to hope triphylles really did own a living breathing sense of duty eminent sir no doubt you will recall that last fall i met with the makuraner warlord abivard whose forces worse luck for us still occupy across of course your majesty triphylles looked westward though all he saw in that direction was a wall of the chamber in which maniakes had received him the smoke from their burnings is a stench in the nostrils of every rightthinking man of videssian blood so it is maniakes said hastily triphylles looked set to launch into an oration the avtokrator went on abivard suggested that one way in which the makuraners might possibly be persuaded to withdraw was through the good offices of an embassy sent to sharbaraz king of kings he got no further than that in a baritone scream triphylles bellowed and you want me to be that embassy your majesty how have i offended you to the point where you keep sending me off to loathsome places in the confident expectation i shall be killed there there maniakes said as soothingly as he could mashiz is not a loathsome place ive been there myself and sharbaraz isnt the cheerful sort of murderer etzilios is eitheror at least he wasnt back in the days when i knew him at any rate you will i trust forgive me for reminding you that in the years since then his disposition does not seem to have changed for the better triphylles was not normally a man of inspired sarcasm amazing what being a little bit unhappy can do maniakes thought aloud he said you will be an embassy eminent sir and the law of nations prohibits such from being assaulted in any way oh indeed your majesty just as the law of nations prevented etzilios from assailing you at what was claimed to be a peace party triphylles still looked frightened and defiant and was upset enough to be more imaginatively sardonic than maniakes had thought possible for him the avtokrator said i didnt have any reason to want to be rid of you eminent sir but youll give me one if you keep on with your complaints a paradox worthy of a theologian triphylles exclaimed if i am silent youll send me away thinking i consent whereas if i tell you i dont consent that will give you what you reckon good cause to send me away maniakes tried again i want to send you to speak to sharbaraz because i think you are the man best suited to the task youve shown yourself a gifted speaker again and againnot least here today if i truly were gifted i would have talked you out of sending me to etzilios triphylles said darkly and now mashiz no seafood date wine women locked away as if they were prisoners less so than they were before sharbaraz took the throne maniakes interrupted the king of kings and abivard both have strongwilled wivessharbaraz is married to abivards sister as a matter of fact and to a good many others by all accounts triphylles said but i was simply using that as an example of the reasons i shall be most distressed to travel to a far land yet again you had to listen carefully with triphylles as with most videssian courtiers he had said shall not should he didnt do such things by accident he meant he had resigned himself to going maniakes said thank you eminent sir i promise you wont be sorry when you return from mashiz a good thing too for i shall certainly be sorry on the journey thither and while im therevery likely on the way back too triphylles said but if i must leave the queen of cities what am i to say to the king of kings when i am ushered into his gloomy presence one of the reasons i send you forth is my confidence that you will know what to tell sharbaraz and how to say it when the time comes maniakes answered you know what videssos needs from him that he recognize me as avtokrator and pension off his false hosios and that his troops leave the westlands as soon as may be he scowled i will pay him tribute for as long as five years much as i hate doing it to give us the chance to get back on our feet how much per year will you give him despite complaints triphylles turned businesslike maniakes sighed whatever he demands more or less were in a worse position for hard bargaining than we were with etzilios indeed and look what i won for you with that negotiation triphylles said the chance to be captured and just as nearly killed ah but now youve had practice maniakes said blandly im sure youll do much better with sharbaraz i am sure youll do better eminent sir else id not send you out you flatter me beyond my worth triphylles said and what was usually a polite disclaimer and nothing more now sounded sour in his mouth he sighed too hard enough to make a lamp flicker very well your majesty i obey but by the good god i wish youd picked another man when do you aim to send me off into the makuraners maw as soon as may be i might have known maniakes went on as if triphylles had not spoken you make your preparations as quickly as you can ill arrange a safeconduct for you with abivard and perhaps an escort of makuraner horsemen as well to keep you safe on the road to mashiz he smacked a frustrated fist into his open palm eminent sir you have no notion how much it galls me to have to say that but i will do it for your sake and for the sake of your mission your majesty is gracious triphylles said maniakes thought he would leave it at that but he evidently took courage from having spoken freely before without anything dreadful happening to him so he added you might as well be honest and put the mission ahead of me as you surely do in your own mind if he hadnt been dead right maniakes would have felt insulted south and east of the wall of videssos the city lay a broad meadow on which soldiers were in the habit of exercising maniakes drilled his troops there all through the winter except on days when it was raining or snowing too hard for them to go out some of the men grumbled at having to work so hard when they did the avtokrator pointed west over the cattle crossing the smoke that goes up from across comes from the makuraners he said how many of you have your homes in the westlands he waited for some of the troopers to nod then told them if you ever want to see those homes again well have to drive the makuraners out of them we cant do that by fighting the way we have the past few years and sowe drill that didnt stop the grumblingsoldiers wouldnt have been soldiers if they didnt complain but it did ease things which was what maniakes had intended along with his father and rhegorios parsmanios and tzikas he worked hard to make the exercises as realistic as he could to give the men the taste of battle without actual dangeror with as little as possible at any rate they fought with sticks instead of swords with pointless javelins with arrows that had round wooden balls at their heads instead of sharp iron everyone went back to the barracks covered with bruises but only a few men got hurt worse than that one luckless fellow lost an eye when an arrow struck him just wrong he was only a trooper but maniakes promised him a captains pension you had to know when to spend what gold you had sometimes when the exercises were done maniakes would ride up to the edge of the cattle crossing and peer west at across every now and then when the day was sunny he saw moving glints he thought were makuraners in their heavy armor they too were readying themselves for the day when their army and his would come to grips with each other again i wish it werent so built up over there he complained to rhegorios one day wed have a better idea of what they were up to thats what we get for raising a city there his cousin answered with an impudent grin then growing thoughtful rhegorios waved back to the videssians practice field not much cover here if they have men with sharp eyes down by the shore they shouldnt have much trouble figuring out what we do true enough maniakes said but that shouldnt be any great surprise to them anyhow they must know we have to ready ourselves to fight them as best we can whether it will be good enough he set his jaw these past seven years it hasnt been the lord with the great and good mind bless our fleets rhegorios observed they cant fight our battles for us but they keep the makuraners from setting all the terms for the war its always a good idea to go on campaign with a shield maniakes agreed it will help keep you safe but if you go with only a shield you wont win your war you need a sword to strike with as well as the shield for protection the fleet could ascend a fair number of rivers in the westlands a good distance rhegorios said in the tones of a man thinking aloud that doesnt do us as much good as wed like though maniakes said the dromons cant interdict rivers the way they can the cattle crossing for one thing we dont have enough of them for that for another the rivers in the westlands are too narrow to keep the makuraners from bombarding them with catapults from the shore approaching hoofbeats made him look up the rider wasnt one of his troopers but a messenger news from the north your majesty he called holding out a boiledleather message tube to maniakes the avtokrator and rhegorios looked at each other in alarm urgent news from the north was liable to be bad news etzilios on the move was the first thing that crossed maniakes mind while he would have taken a certain grim pleasure in separating moundioukhs head from his shoulders that alone would not have compensated him for the damage a largescale kubrati raid would cause trapped between the steppe nomads and the makuraners the empire of videssos held little territory it could call its own these days maniakes unsealed the message tube with more than a little trepidation tarasios hypasteos of varna to maniakes avtokrator greetings maniakes had to pause a moment to remember where varna was a coastal town northwest of imbros his eyes swept down the parchment tarasios continued i regret to have to inform your majesty that the kubratoi raided our harbor two days before my writing of this dispatch they came by sea in the monoxyla they habitually use for such incursions boats made by hollowing out single large logs through fire and then equipping them with rowers low masts and leather sails such vessels cannot challenge dromons of course but are more formidable than the description would suggest not least because they are capable of accommodating a dismaying number of armed men varna unfortunately had no dromons present when the raiders descended upon us they plundered a couple of merchantmen tied up at the quays then threw fire onto those quays the merchantmen and the fishing boats nearby but the fire did not spread from the harbor to the town and the garrison repelled the barbarians upon their attempt to force entry into varna by scaling the sea wall that effort failing they returned to their monoxyla and sailed away northward the hypasteos went on to request aid for his beleaguered city from the imperial fisc the fisc was at least as beleaguered as varna but perhaps tarasios didnt know that maniakes resolved to do something for him although he knew that something wouldnt be much rhegorios said well my cousin your majesty whos gone and pissed in the soup pot now how do you think moundioukhs head would look hanging from the milestone maniakes asked dreamily the kubratoi have violated the truce i bought so i have the right to take it he passed his cousin the message from tarasios rhegorios went through it lips moving as he read isnt that peculiar he said when he was through it doesnt sound like a big raid i wonder if it wasnt some of the kubratoi going off on their own to see what they could steal maybe without etzilios even knowing about it it could be so maniakes agreed my guess is that etzilios will say its so whether it is or whether it isnt i wont take moundioukhs head right away however much i think hed be improved without it what i will do is send a message straight to etzilios asking him whats going on here if i dont get an answer i like that will be time enough to settle with moundioukh the messenger bearing maniakes query left videssos the city the next day two weeks after that he returned in the company of a small troop of kubratoi who rode under shield of truce the avtokrator met their leader a bearded barbarian named ghizat in the grand courtroom ghizat approached the throne with a large leather sack under one arm he set it down beside him while he performed a proskynesis rise maniakes said in a voice colder than the chilly air outside has your khagan forgotten the truce he made with us no him not forgets youse majesty said ghizat who seemed to have learned his videssian from moundioukh him sended i down to these city with presents about you what sort of present maniakes asked the size and shape of the leather sack made him hope he knew the answer but etzilios had taught him never to rely too much on hope ghizat fumbled with the rawhide lashing that held the mouth of the sack closed he turned it upside down and dumped a severed head out onto the polished marble floor of the courtroom in violation of every canon of court etiquette exclamations of shock and horror rose from the assembled bureaucrats and courtiers this thing ghizat said spurning the head with his foot this thing once upon a time it belongs to paghan this here paghan him leads monoxyla fleets what sails up along varna etzilios the magnumperous him not knows nothing about this fleets till too late the late paghan stared up toward maniakes with dull dead eyes the weather had remained wintry so his mortal fragment was neither badly bloated nor stinking maniakes said how do i know hes not some noaccount kubrati sacrificed to let your khagan claim hes keeping the peace couple kinds way ghizat answered first kind ways is we kubratoi never does nothing like these no ways nohow second kind ways is moundioukh and them other hostages personages them knows paghan them tells youse what him are them knows other six headses us brings too know they when they still on bodies yes sir maniakes clicked his tongue between his teeth he could indeed check that he wouldnt know for certain whether these particular barbarians had in fact led the attack on varna but he could learn whether they were prominent among their people fair enough he said give me the names and stations of these men whose heads youve brought if moundioukhs account of them tallies with yours i shall accept that etzilios is not to blame for this raid youse majesty the bargains you have ghizat said and told him the names of the other nomads now shorter by a head you does what you wants over they put headses up on big pointy stone prickwhat you call it the milestone maniakes answered dryly a couple of courtiers tittered and then did their best to pretend they hadnt it was a pretty good description ill do that with some i think and send the rest to varna so the people there know the raiders have been punished howsomever they yourses now ghizat said he prostrated himself again to show he had said everything he intended to say you will stay in the city until moundioukh confirms what you and etzilios have told me maniakes said ghizat knocked his head against the stone to show he understood maniakes turned to kameas he pointed to paghans head take charge of that eminent sir convey it first to moundioukh with the others and then to the milestone eryes your majesty looking anything but delighted the vestiarios approached the head and picked it up by the very tip of its tangled beard with his thumb and forefinger if his expression was any guide he would sooner have handled it with a long pair of smiths tongs he carried it away ghizat rose backed away from the throne till he had reached the distance protocol prescribed and then turned and left the grand courtroom from behind his bowlegged swagger was amusing to watch after the audience ended maniakes returned to the imperial residence kameas looking a bit green presently reported to him your majesty moundioukh applies the same names to the kubratoior rather the abridged selection from the kubratoias ghizat gave them the distinguished barbarous gentleman expressed forceful if ungrammatical surprise at discovering these individuals in their present state did he maniakes said well by the good god thats something i take it to mean etzilios will likely look for more tribute this year and also to mean hell keep his men quiet if we pay him enough may it be so kameas hesitated then decided to go on and may it please your majesty i should be indebted to you if i were spared such ah grisly duties in the future most ah disturbing maniakes reminded himself that the vestiarios sole experience of war and battle had been etzilios assault on the imperial camp by imbros ill do what i can to oblige you eminent sir i must remind you though that life comes with no guarantee i am aware of that your majesty i assure you kameas answered tonelessly maniakes cheeks heated a eunuch was aware of it in ways no entire man ever could be feeling foolish and flustered maniakes dismissed the vestiarios he hoped kameas would go have a mug of wine or maybe several if he ordered him to do something like that though kameas was liable to be touchy enough to disobey because he had just been commanded to do something else he didnt care for sometimes you got better results with a loose rein sometimes of course you didnt the makuraners were not going to leave the westlands unless videssos drove them out not unless triphylles worked a miracle bigger than most of the ones accomplished through thaumaturgy keeping peace with the kubratoi would help with the fight against makuran but as he had told kameas life came with no guarantee pretty soon niphone would bear their second child if it was a boy he would become heir to the throne maniakes wanted to be sure he had an empire left to inherit the soup was rich with mussels tunny crab meat mushrooms and onions niphone paused with silver spoon halfway to her mouth i dont think id better eat any more she said in a thoughtful voice maniakes stared across the table at her she sat some distance back from it her bulging belly made sure she could come no closer do you mean what i think you mean he asked he had spoken quietly she didnt answer for a little while so he wondered if she had heard him her gaze was searching inward but then she nodded with abrupt decision as if she were a captain ordering troops forward into a breach in enemy lines yes theres another pang she said once youve known labor once you dont confuse it with the tightenings you feel all through the last part of your confinement this baby will be born tonight or tomorrow were ready maniakes said everything will go exactly as it should phos willing he sketched the suncircle over his heart a shorthand prayer to the lord with the great and good mind then raising his voice he called for kameas when the vestiarios came into the dining room he spoke one word now kameas eyes widened as maniakes had before him he drew the suncircle above his left breast i shall send for the lady zoile directly he declared and make all other necessary preparations as well those necessary preparations had nothing to do with the red room the imperial birthing chamber had been ready for months what kameas meant was that he would summon along with zoile a healerpriest from the sorcerers collegium and a surgeon coming out and saying that in front of niphone would have reminded her of the risks she took maniakes was grateful for the vestiarios tact kameas bowed and hurried away maniakes got up from his seat went around the table and set his hands on niphones shoulders everything will go perfectly he repeated as if saying it could make it so of course it will his wife answered why she paused as another labor pain came and went shouldnt it no reason at all maniakes said heartily well have ourselves a fine boy by this time tomorrow he hesitated are the pains bad yet no not yet niphone said but i know what lies ahead she shrugged i endured it once i can do it again maniakes waited nervously for zoile to arrive when kameas escorted her into the dining room she did not bother prostrating herself before the avtokrator she ruled the domain niphone was reentering she went over to the empress looked into her eyes felt her pulse and finally nodded how does she seem maniakes asked pregnant zoile snapped whereupon the avtokrator shut up the midwife gave her attention back to niphone solicitude returned to her voice can you walk your majesty of course i can niphone said indignantly to prove it she got to her feet zoile beamed at her in that case your majesty why dont you take yourself to the red room and get as comfortable as you can ill be along shortly as youll remember much of the first part of labor can be boring i remember what comes afterward too niphone said the first sign of apprehension she had shown in all her pregnancy she turned back to maniakes i will give you a son come through safe thats all he told her he might as well not have spoken her head held high she waddled out through the door and down the hall toward the chamber where legitimate emperors who were the sons of emperors came into the world where dynasties in other words were born along with babies zoile looked out the door to see how far niphone had gone far enough evidently for zoile turned back to maniakes and said aye shes pregnant again your majesty and by the good god i wish she werent maniakes had no trouble interpreting the glare in the midwifes black eyes men it said in a hurt voice he remarked why does everyone think this is my fault are you telling me youre not the father zoile asked sweetly at which point the avtokrator threw his hands in the air and gave up on convincing her he wasnt a stupid lecherous brute if she wanted to think that she would and he didnt seem able to do anything about it do the best you can for her he said i would anyhow your majesty for my own sake the midwife replied with quiet pride her mouth thinned into a bloodless line and if i cant phos willing the healer and the surgeon can youve sent for them yes maniakes said i dont want them to come into the residence though till niphone goes inside the red room and you close the door if she saw them it would just make her worry more zoile considered that tasting the words one by one maybe theres hope for you yet she said and went down the hallway after the empress before maniakes could think of any fit reply a couple of minutes later kameas led two men into the dining room your majesty i present to you the healerpriest philetos and the surgeon osrhoenes both men prostrated themselves before maniakes philetos was tall and lean with a lined face dark freckles on his shaven crown and a beard white as clean snow he wore a plain blue robe its only ornamentation the clothofgold circle on his left breast that symbolized phos sun osrhoenes was also tall but heavyset he was some years younger than philetos gray rested lightly in his hair and beard he wore a black robe maniakes peered closely at it trying to see whether the somber color masked old bloodstains he couldnt tell osrhoenes carried a small leather case also black maniakes tried not to think about the sharp blades inside to osrhoenes he said sir and to philetos holy sir then went on to both of them together i trust you will forgive me when i say i hope your services wont be needed here today though of course i shall pay you for your time regardless part of the gold you give me shall go to the sakellarios at the high temple so as to swell the ecclesiastical treasure the rest to the upkeep of the sorcerers collegium philetos said healers like other priests were constrained by vows of poverty osrhoenes merely bowed to maniakes he was a secular man the fee he got from maniakes would go into his own belt pouch to kameas the avtokrator said if you would be so kind escort these gentlemen to their place opposite the doorway to the red room perhaps you will find them chairs so they may wait comfortably if they want food or wine or anything else see that they have it certainly your majesty kameas said maniakes was certain his instructions had been unnecessary to the vestiarios perfect service was a matter not only of pride but also of routine fortunately that perfect service included not showing up the avtokrator if maniakes was too nervous to let kameas do what was required without nagging kameas would condescend not to notice the eunuch led philetos and osrhoenes away that left maniakes alone with his worries which he would rather not have been zoiles warnings after niphones last confinement the midwifes worried look now niphones insistence on bearing an heir or dying in the attempt his own fear over his wifes safety mixed together they made a corrosive brew that griped his belly and made his heart pound as it would have before combat he jumped and spun around when someone tapped on the doorframe i didnt mean to startle you lysia said i just wanted to tell you that i pray the lord with the great and good mind will grant you a son and heirand that the empress comes through safe thank you cousin of mine maniakes said my prayers ride along the same path may phos heed them all as he had so often lately he sketched the suncircle over his heart so did lysia he waited for her to reassure him that everything would surely be all right instead she said i didnt think youd want to be here by yourself fretting because you cant do anything but fret thank you he said that was kind he made himself produce something that sounded a little like a laugh now i can be here with you fretting because i cant do anything but fret lysia smiled yes i suppose you will be but maybe not as much shall i call one of the servants and have him bring you a jar of wine that might take the edge off your worry another kind thought but no maniakes answered if i started drinking wine now i dont think id stop till i was sodden and that wouldnt do when niphone or the midwife hands me the baby and it wont do now nothing wrong with being worried when you have something to worry about before too long the reason will go away and everything will be fine phos grant it be so lysia took a breath as if to add something else then looked away and shook her head phos grant it be so she repeated softly maniakes thought about asking her what she had been on the point of saying then decided he would probably be better off not knowing he made awkward small talk for a couple of minutes then his father came into the chamber the elder maniakes seemed not in the least surprised to find lysia there before him i remember waiting and pacing while you were being born he told the avtokrator i thought it was taking forever though i daresay your mother thought it was taking a good deal longer than that he sighed nobody can tell me that was more than two or three years ago and look at you rhegorios joined them a little later and symvatios moments after his son parsmanios did not make his quarters in the imperial residence so he took longer to arrive kourikos home was outside the palace quarter altogether close to two hours went by before he and phevronia came to join the wait for their second grandchild from niphone by then maniakes had long since called for the wine he had turned down when lysia suggested it he even sipped at a cup nursing it savoring the flavor but not drinking enough to let it affect him much having family around him did make things easier to bearbut the burden remained on him and on his wife parsmanios thumped him on the shoulder it takes time brother of mine nothing to be done but wait i know maniakes replied abstractedly it had taken a very long time when evtropia was born he had hoped it would go faster this time womens second labors from what he had heard often did the sooner niphone gave birth and began to recover the happier he would be but no word came from the red room leaving his relatives behind he walked down the hall to the birthing chamber philetos and osrhoenes sat in their chairs a board for the war game set on a little table between them a quick glance showed maniakes that the healerpriest had the surgeon on the run inside the red room niphone groaned the sound made maniakes flinch do you know how she fares he asked the two men has zoile come out almost in unison the two men shook their heads no your majesty they said together philetos went on one lesson i have learned as a healerpriest and that is never to joggle a midwifes elbow the expression of most unclerical rue that passed over his face suggested he had learned the lesson the hard way by the way osrhoenes rolled his eyes he had had the same lesson and maybe the same teacher niphone groaned againor perhaps this cry was closer to a scream it wasnt quite like any of the sounds of agony maniakes had heard on the battlefield so he had trouble assigning it a proper name that didnt make it any less appalling especially since it came not from a wounded soldier but from his wife but while he winced osrhoenes and philetos went back to studying the game boardcovertly because he still stood by them but unmistakably he took that to mean they had heard such cries before which meantwhich he hoped meantsuch cries were a normal part of giving birth all the same he could not bear to listen to them he retreated back up the hall when he looked over his shoulder he saw that the physician and healerpriest had returned to their game his father clucked sympathetically on seeing his face going to be a while yet eh the elder maniakes said looks that way the avtokrator said he wore the red boots that marked him as ruler of all videssos but some things not even a ruler could command niphones cries painfully reminded him of the limits to his power he waited endlessly he made small talk and forgot what he had said the moment the words passed his lips kameas brought in a meal maniakes ate without tasting what was set before him it got dark outside servitors lit lamps presently kameas brought in more food and maniakes realized it was long enough since the last time for him to be hungry again by then parsmanios had fallen asleep in his chair and begun to snore symvatios face usually jolly was full of shadowfilled lines and wrinkles hard he said to maniakes who nodded kameas came into the chamber can i bring you anything your majesty he asked his voice low so as not to disturb parsmaniosor rhegorios who was also dozing the vestiarios face though smoother than symvatios showed no less concern esteemed sir what i want now you cant bring me maniakes answered that is so kameas said gravely may the good god grant that you receive it nonetheless he dipped his head and slipped out of the room his softsoled shoes flapped against the marble and tile of the floor lysia got up walked over to maniakes and set a hand on his shoulder without saying anything gratefully he put his own hand on top of hers symvatios head bobbed up and down like a fishing float in choppy water the elder maniakes face was shadowed the avtokrator could not make out his fathers expression someonenot kameascame running up the corridor your majesty your majesty zoile was shouting parsmanios awoke with a start rhegorios jerked out of his light sleep too i dont fancy the sound of that he said rubbing at his eyes maniakes didnt fancy it either he stepped out into the hallwayand recoiled in dismay at the sight of the midwife zoiles arms were red to the elbows with blood it soaked the front of her robe and dripped from her hands to the colored tiles of the floor mosaic come quick your majesty she said reaching out to grab at maniakes sleeve in spite of her gory fingers theres no hope to stop the bleedingive tried philetos has tried and its beyond what we can do but we still may get the baby out of her alive and with that done the healerpriest may yet have another chance a tiny one to save your ladys life the hotiron stink of blood filled the corridor it made thinking straighter all the harder for maniakes arousing as it did the panic of the battlefield at last he managed do as you must of course but why do you need me zoile looked at him as if he were an idiot why to give the knife into osrhoenes hands and show your assent to his cutting it would be for your lady but shes too far gone to do it seeing the state the midwife was in should have told maniakes as much maybe he was an idiot he also realized that if niphone was in such desperate straits philetos chances of saving her after the surgeon had done his work were forlorn indeed he moaned and shook his head wishing he could have kept the illusion of hope no time for that now no time for anything now he trotted down the hall toward the red room zoile at his elbow osrhoenes stood waiting outside the door seeing maniakes he reached into his bag and drew out a lancet the keen blade glittered in the lamplight had any of the avtokrators guardsmen seen him he might have died in the next instant for daring to draw a weapon in the presence of the emperor maniakes thought of that only later when osrhoenes held out the lancet to him it was not a threat but a gesture as formal as a proskynesis maniakes took the knife held it a moment and returned it to the surgeon do what you can he said you shall not be blamed come what may osrhoenes bowed to him then turned and went into the red room zoile followed him maniakes had a brief glimpse of niphone lying motionless on a bed in the center of the chamber her face slack and pale as death philetos his shoulders slumped stood beside her the midwife closed the door and he saw no more nails biting into his palm he waited for niphones shriek as the knife laid her belly open no shriek came for a moment he was relieved but then his heart sank further if she was silent it could only be because she was too nearly gone to feel anything he feared he would hear no sound from the red room but the frantic muffled talk from zoile osrhoenes and philetos that leaked through the thick doors of the chamber that would mean everything had been too late that the baby was gone along with its mother he tried to figure out what that would mean for videssos what he would have to do next if it was so he found his mind utterly stunned and blank he tried to flog it into action but had no luck past my wife is dead and my baby too nothing meant anything then after what seemed an eternity but could not have been more than a handful of minutes a newborns angry indignant wail pierced the portal of the red room maniakes needed a moment to recognize the sound for what it was he had been so certain he would not hear it he had trouble believing it when it came he stood rigid leaning toward the red room of itself his right hand sketched the sunsign above his heart if the baby lived why not niphone too please phos he whispered when zoile came out she carried a tiny bundle tightly swaddled in a lambswool blanket you have a son your majesty she said instead of being joyful her voice was numb with fatigue and grief she had torn the neck opening of her robe too a sign of mourning maniakes asked the question anyhow niphone tears ran down the midwifes cheeks she bowed her head theyweall of usdid everything we could to save her your majesty but even to get the babe out alive and well i think we thank the lord with the great and good mind for that much i wouldnt have guessed osrhoenes could do it and ive never seen anyone faster with a knife than he is give me the boy maniakes said he undid the blanket enough to make sure the baby had the proper number of fingers on each hand and toes on each foot and that it was indeed a boy child no doubt there its private parts were out of proportion to the rest of it are they supposed to be like that maniakes asked pointing that they are your majesty zoile answered seeming glad to talk about the baby rather than its mother every boy comes into the world so he would have guessed she followed that with a ribald joke after most births not tonight not here he wrapped his son in the blanket once more as he had when he had lost the fight east of amorion he made himself go on even in defeat philetos couldnt save her after the cuts he asked still trying to find out what had gone wrong its not like that not philetos fault zoile said a surgeon doesnt try to take a babe out of a mother unless shes on the point of dying anyhow the ones the healers save after that are the special miracles the ones priests talk of from before the altar to point out how we should never give up striving and hoping for the good but most of the time we lose the mother when the surgeon cuts what do i do now maniakes asked he wasnt really talking to the midwife maybe he wasnt talking to anyone maybe he spoke to phos maybe to himself the good god did not swoop miraculously out of the sky with answers if there were any he would have to find them zoile said the baby is all he should be your majesty he turned pink nice as you please when osrhoenes drew him forth and cut the cord phos willing hell do well have you chosen a name for him we were going to call him likarios maniakes answered we he stopped we didnt mean anything not any more tears rolled down his cheeks he might not have loved niphone with the passion he had felt for her after they were first betrothed but he cared for her admired her bravery and mourned her loss it left an empty place in his life and a bigger one than he had imagined till this moment when the event made imagination real well tend to things here your majesty prepare the body for the funeral zoile said gently maniakes head bobbed up and down as if on a spring he hadnt even thought about the funeral yet having a son and suddenly not having a wife had been all he could take in the midwife no doubt had seen that before she reminded him of what needed doing next why dont you take your sontake likariosand show him to your kinsfolk theyll be worried theyll need to know whats happened here yes of course maniakes said it all seemed very easy once someone took charge of you he started up the hallway toward the chamber where his relatives waited he thought he was doing fine till he walked past the corridor on which he was supposed to turn shaking his head he went back and did it right no one had presumed to come after him his father and lysia waited outside the chamber from which he had been summoned rhegorios stood inside but had his head out the door maniakes didnt see anyone else the rest of them must be inside he thought pleased with his talent for logical deduction in his arms likarios twitched and began to cry he rocked the baby back and forth he had had some practice doing that with evtropia before he had gone out on campaign the summer before she was bigger when he had gotten back holding her didnt feel the same any more they grow you stay the same from one day to the nextor you think you do with them theres no room to think that is it a boy youre holding there the elder maniakes called at the same time lysia asked niphonehow is she aye father a boy maniakes replied when he didnt answer lysia she groaned and covered her face with her hands she knew what that had to mean so did the elder maniakes he stepped forward to fold the avtokrator into an embracean awkward one because maniakes still held his newborn son in the crook of his elbow ah lad the elder maniakes said his voice heavy with grief i lost your mother in childbed i never dreamed the same illluck would strike you and your lady too i feared it maniakes said dully after she bore evtropia the midwife warned herwarned meshe shouldnt have another i would have been content to see the throne come down to a brother or a cousin or a nephew but niphone insisted that she try to bear a son to succeed me and so she did but the price kourikos and phevronia came out into the hallway the face of the logothete of the treasury was even more pinched and drawn than usual phevronia her hair all unpinned looked haggard and frightened kourikos stammered slightly as he spoke as if the words did not want to pass his lips your majesty i pray you tell me i have misunderstood your words to your father maniakes could hardly blame him behold your grandson fatherinlaw of mine he said and held likarios out to kourikos the logothete took the baby with a sure touch that said he hadnt forgotten everything he had once known about children maniakes went on more than anything i wish i could tell youtell you and your ladythat you have misunderstood me the truth is i cannot you have not niphone your daughter my wife he looked down at the floor the hunting mosaic blurred as his eyes filled with tears phevronia wailed kourikos put his free arm around her she buried her face in his shoulder and wept like a soul damned to the eternal ice gravely kameas said i share your sorrow your majesty i shall set in train arrangements for care of the young majesty here and with your permission shall also begin preparations for the empress funeral obsequies the weather remains cool so the matter is not so urgent as it might otherwise be but nevertheless phevronia wept harder yet kourikos started to bristle at the vestiarios suggestion then seemed to slump in on himself he nodded jerkily so did maniakes you have to go on he told himself and wondered how to make himself believe it as with anything else connected with the imperial household the funeral carried a heavy weight of ceremonial in this case melancholy ceremonial the limestone sarcophagus in which niphone was laid to rest bore carved scenes showing the bridge of the separator the narrow passage souls walked after death demons snatched those who failed phos stern judgment and fell from the bridge dragging them down to skotos ice the last panel of the relief though showed one soul intended to represent niphone winging upward toward phos eternal light deceased avtokrators and their kinsfolk were by ancient tradition interred beneath a temple in the western part of videssos the city not far from the forum of the ox the capitals ancient cattle market the temple dedicated to the memory of the holy phravitas an ecumenical patriarch from before the days of stavrakios was ancient too though not so ancient as the forum of the ox kameas produced for maniakes a robe of black silk shot through with silver threads the avtokrator had no idea of where the robe came from it certainly did not hang in the closet adjoining the imperial bedchamber it smelled strongly of camphor and its wrinkles and creases were as firmly set as if it were made of metal rather than fabric be gentle with it your majesty kameas said the cloth is fragile these days as you say maniakes answered how old is it anyhow the vestiarios shrug made his several chins wobble i apologize your majesty but i cannot tell you my predecessor at this post the esteemed isoes was himself ignorant of that and told me his predecessor did not know the answer either i also cannot tell you how long the answer has been lost that might have happened in the days of isoes predecessor or it might have been a hundred years before his time maniakes fingered the silk he doubted the mourning robe had been new in his grandfathers days but had no way to prove that kameas also brought him polished black leather covers for his boots strips cut in them let a little of the imperial crimson shine through even in mourning the avtokrator remained the avtokrator but looking down at himself maniakes saw that he made a somber spectacle indeed the other mourners in the funeral partykourikos and phevronia the elder maniakes parsmanios rhegorios lysia and symvatioswore unrelieved black the horses drawing the wagon on which the sarcophagus lay were also blackthough maniakes knew a groom of the imperial stables had carefully painted over a white blaze on one of the animals also in black surcoats with black streamers hanging from their spears were the guardsmen who marched with the mourners and the funeral wagon for the day the parasolbearers who preceded the avtokrator in all his public appearances carried black canopies rather than their usual colorful ones as the funeral party approached the plaza of palamas maniakes saw it was packed with people the folk of videssos the city were eager for any spectacle no matter how sorrowful some of the people wore black to show their sympathy for the avtokrator others had dressed in their holiday best for them one show was as good as another at the edge of the plaza nearest the palace quarter waited the ecumenical patriarch agathios his regalia had not changed he still wore the blue boots and a clothofgold robe encrusted with pearls and gems as he would have at a wedding or any joyous occasion but his face was somber as he prostrated himself before maniakes your majesty i beg you to accept my condolences for your tragic loss thank you most holy sir maniakes answered lets get on with it shall we as soon as the words were out of his mouth he regretted them agathios looked scandalized maniakes had not meant anything more than wanting to have the funeral over so he could grieve in private but anything an avtokrator said that could be misinterpreted probably would be and he knew too well he had left himself open to such misinterpretation without a word to maniakes agathios turned away and took his place at the head of the mournful procession he called in a great voice to the crowds filling the plaza of palamas stand aside people of videssos make way for the last journey of niphone once empress of the videssians now bathed in phos eternal light may it be so the people answered their voices rising and falling like the surf that beat against the seawall as best they could they did clear a path through the plaza where their own efforts were not enough the guards moved them aside with their spearshafts even as the people moved back to make way for the funeral procession they also pushed forward to speak a word of consolation to maniakes or to his family some of them also pressed forward to get a glimpse of niphone who lay pale and still and forever unmoving inside the sarcophagus i pray she knew she gave you a son a man said to maniakes he nodded though niphone had known nothing of the sort a few of the folk in the plaza kept their hands at the hems of their tunics ready to use the garments to help catch any largess the avtokrator might choose to dispense that thought had never entered his mind not for todays occasion he shook his head bemused at the vagaries of human nature to which his position exposed him though the plaza of palamas was far wider than middle street the procession had better going on the capitals main thoroughfare the crowds there stayed off the street itself and under the covered colonnades to either side when maniakes glanced up he saw a goodly number of people atop the colonnades as well peering down at him and at the woman who had given him two children in just over a year and a half and now would give no more ever again maniakes slowly walked past the government office buildings faces stared out at him from almost every window as clerks and bureaucrats escaped their scrolls and counting boards for a little while the farther he went the harder keeping up a dignified front before the people became in the forum of the ox the crowds grew thick and hard to manage once more the forum had once been the chief marketplace of videssos the city for cattle and all other goods a position long since usurped by the plaza of palamas now most of what was bought and sold here was not fine enough to succeed in the newer square close by the palaces the forum of the ox even packed as it was now seemed tired and sad and shabby and rundown again the ecumenical patriarch appealed to the crowd to stand back and let the funeral procession pass the people responded more slowly than they had in the plaza of palamas that was partly because the forum of the ox was even more crowded than the plaza had been and partly because the people who crowded it looked to be less inclined to listen to requests from anyone than were the more prosperous videssians who frequented the plaza of palamas little by little the procession inched its way across the square and back onto middle street after a couple of short blocks the parasolbearers followed agathios south down a narrow twisting lane that led toward the temple dedicated to the memory of the holy phravitas as was true on a lot of such lanes second and thirdstory balconies grew close to each other above the street until they all but cut off light and air from it maniakes remembered thinking when he first came back to videssos the city that the ordinance mandating balconies to keep a proper distance from one another had not been enforced during genesios reign it didnt look as if building inspectors were doing much better now that he wore the red boots he exhaled through his nose he had had a few more immediately urgent things to worry about than whether balconies conformed to law in all particulars legal or not the balconies were jammed full of people when maniakes looked up to the narrow strip of sky between them he saw dozens of faces staring down at him one of those faces a womans up on a thirdfloor balcony was not only staring but deathly pale pale as niphone pale enough to draw maniakes notice even in the midst of the crowd even in the midst of his sorrow the woman leaned over the wooden rail of the balcony her mouth opened wide maniakes thought she meant to call something to him although he would have had trouble hearing her through the noise of the crowd perhaps that was what she intended but it was not what happened she choked and gagged and vomited down onto the funeral procession the stinking stuff splashed the sarcophagus the funeral wagon and one of the guardsmen he leapt aside with a cry of disgust maniakes pointed a furious finger up at the woman afterward he regretted showing his anger so openly but that was afterward the guards was not the only disgusted cry to go up other cries rose too cries of shame and sacrilege and profanation and inevitably blasphemy those cries rang loudest from the balconies and loudest of all from the balcony where the luckless woman stood other people standing there with her seized her lifted her and while she screamed flung her down to the cobbles below the scream abruptly cut off maniakes whirled and stared in horror at the body of the woman who sprawled only a few feet behind him by the unnatural angle at which her head joined her body her neck was broken she would never rise from the street again maniakes hand drew the sunsign over his heart by the lord with the great and good mind he cried his voice full of anguish must even the funeral of my wife grow wrong but other shouts went up from the crowd shouts of fierce exhilaration death to defilers she got what she deserved we avenge you niphone and even thou conquerest empress niphone far from being ashamed at what they had done the men who had thrown the woman to her death raised their arms in triumph clenched fists pumping the air the cheers that echoed up and down the narrow street said not just they but also the city mob thought of them as heroes maniakes looked helplessly toward his father the elder maniakes spread his hands as if to ask what can you do the avtokrator knew the answer to that only too well not much if he sent his guardsmen into that building after the killers they would have to fight through the crowd to get inside fight their way upstairs and then come down with their prisoners to face the wrath of the mob again having the capital erupt in riots was not something he could afford not with all the other bitter troubles the empire had these days forward he shouted and then again forward let us grant niphone such dignity as we can such dignity as she deserves that reached the crowd their baying which had reminded him of nothing so much as a pack of wolves in full cry on a winters night eased still shaking his head in amazement and disbelief he hurried on toward the temple dedicated to the memory of the holy phravitas if that temple wasnt the oldest building in videssos the city it was among them in the high temple and shrines modeled after it the altar stood under a dome at the center of the worship area with pews approaching it from each of the cardinal directions the temple of the holy phravitas conformed to a more antique pattern it was a rectangular building of red brick the bricks themselves darkened and smoothed by age its entrance was at the west side all seats faced the east the direction from which phos sun rose each day agathios strode to the altar his gleaming robes swirling about him the senior priest normally responsible for the temple bowed low to his ecclesiastical superior and kissed his outstretched hand in token of submission maniakes guardsmen lifted niphones sarcophagus off the wagon that had borne it hither and carried it to a blackdraped bier by the side of the altar maniakes and his family took their places in the pews nearest the holy table when other mourners some nobles some simply townsfolk had filled the rest of the seats agathios raised his hands to the heavens not in triumph but in supplication that was the signal for those in the temple to rise once more we bless thee phos lord with the great and good mind agathios intoned by thy grace our protector watchful beforehand that the great test of life may be decided in our favor by its very familiarity repeating the creed helped steady maniakes not that his grief diminished but it was channeled into pathways where his mind regularly traveled the ecumenical patriarch gestured maniakes and his companions sat back down being in a templeeven if not the one where he usually prayedand listening to the patriarch also helped transmute anguish into routine which was easier for the mind to grasp and deal with agathios said we are gathered here today to commend to phos and his eternal light the soul of our sister niphone who died in the most noble way given to a woman that is to say in bringing new life into our world phevronia sobbed noisily kourikos patted his wifes shoulder doing his best to comfort her his best struck maniakes as ineffectual but then phevronia had a right to her sorrow losing parents was hard losing a spouse was harder losing a child especially a child in what should have been the prime of life turned the natural order of things on its head maniakes wondered if he ought to be angry with niphones mother and father for making her feel she had to bear him a son so as to keep alive her familys influence over the imperial line he had tried calling up that anger it would have made his grief easier to bear he hadnt managed it though many would have taken the same risk niphone had and she had done it of her own free will surely the good god will demonstrate his bounteous compassion and will suffer our sister niphone to cross the bridge of the separator unharried by the demons who mount up from the eternal ice agathios said surely she shall have no part of skotos and his devices the ecumenical patriarch spat in rejection of the dark god maniakes and the other mourners imitated him agathios went on for some time describing niphones manifest virtues he had spoken with maniakes about those and with kourikos and phevronia and with nikaia the abbess of the convent dedicated to the memory of the holy phostina so far as maniakes could tell every word he said was true if niphone had all those virtues why did she have to die so young that was a silent scream inside maniakes the way no doubt it had been a silent scream in every generation of mankind all the way back to vaspur the firstbornof whom agathios did not think in those terms if the ecumenical patriarch had any new light to shed on the question he did not show it to maniakes after praising niphone and reassuring everyone who heard him that phos had indeed taken her soul into the realm of eternal light after leading his listeners in phos creed once more agathios said and now let her discarded earthly remains be consigned to their final resting place that was the signal for maniakes kourikos and phevronia to come forward and stand by the sarcophagus before the guardsmen lifted it from the bier maniakes looked into it one last time niphone seemed at peace he had seen too many dead men on the battlefield to lie to himself by thinking she merely looked asleep but he could hope she had indeed passed over the bridge of the separator the priest who normally presided at the temple dedicated to the memory of the holy phravitas handed agathios a lighted torch murmuring the lamps in the memorial chamber below have been kindled most holy sir thank you holy sir the patriarch answered he gathered up niphones closest survivors and the guardsmen by eye then went down a stone staircase to the chamber below the temple when genesios toppled likinios he had thrown the dead avtokrators body and those of his sons into the sea and sent their heads far and wide to prove they were dead after maniakes cast down genesios in turn the tyrants head had gone up on the milestone and his body was burned the imperial tombs then had not had anyone inhumed in them for some years the chamber was very quiet the thick still air seemed to swallow the sound of footsteps lamplight played off marble and cast flickering shadows on inscriptions and reliefs of avtokrators and empresses who had been dead for decades centuries even a millennium on some of the oldest inscriptions the videssian was of so antique a mode that maniakes could hardly read it amid all the whiteness of the marble one space in the back of the chamber gaped black quietly grunting with the effort the guardsmen slid niphones sarcophagus into it agathios said in a years time your majesty you or the empress sadly bereaved parents may set a memorial tablet here one properly describing her courage and virtues please know that i share your sorrow and offer you my deepest and most sincere sympathy thank you most holy sir maniakes answered kourikos and phevronia echoed him even as he spoke though the avtokrator wondered how sincere agathios truly was he had said all the proper things but said them in a way that suggested duty more than piety maniakes sighed the patriarch was at least as much a political creature as he was a holy man its over phevronia said in a dazed wondering voice its over and theres nothing left of her not any more not ever again she was right it was over nothing was left feeling altogether empty inside maniakes started back toward the stairs agathios hurried to get in front of him to lead the upwardbound procession as he had the one going down the guardsmen came next more slowly kourikos and phevronia followed leaving the chamber under the temple dedicated to the memory of the holy phravitas empty until the next time someone from the royal house died kameas said may it please your majesty a messenger has just come bearing word from abivard the makuraner general what can he want of us now maniakes wondered he had trouble concentrating on the affairs of videssos he had laid niphone to rest only a few days before gamely he tried to bring his mind to the business at hand have him enter esteemed sir the messenger prostrated himself then handed maniakes a rolled parchment sealed with ribbon and wax as he broke the seal he wondered if he would be able to make sense of the letter inside he spoke makuraner fairly well but didnt read it abivard though must have had a local translate his thoughts for him for the missive was written in videssian abivard the general serving the mighty sharbaraz king of kings may his years be many and his realm increase to maniakes styling himself avtokrator greetings i learn with sadness of the death of your wife accept please my condolences on this your personal loss may the prophets four guide her to union with the god maniakes turned to kameas bring me sealing wax please esteemed sir as the vestiarios hurried off to get it maniakes inked a reed pen and wrote rapidly on a sheet of parchment maniakes avtokrator to the makuraner general abivard greetings my thanks for your kind personal wishes my own wish is that you and your army would withdraw from lands to which you have no right i speak there both as avtokrator of the videssians and in my own person it was for that purpose that i sent the eminent triphylles as ambassador to sharbaraz king of kings have you yet any word of the progress of his embassy he rolled up the parchment and tied it with one of the ribbons he normally used for decrees kameas returned with a stick of the crimson sealing wax reserved for the avtokrator alone the eunuch handed the wax to him then picked up a lamp maniakes held the lamp to the flame several drops fell onto the ribbon and parchment while they were still soft maniakes pressed his sunburst signet into them he withdrew the ring waved the sealed letter in the air to make sure it hardened properly and gave it to the messenger be sure this reaches abivard by whatever means you have of arranging such things he didnt need to know the details and so did not inquire after them the messenger took the parchment stuffed it into a waterproof tube of boiled waxed leather and after prostrating himself to maniakes once more hurried out of the imperial residence may i see what the makuraner general wrote your majesty kameas asked yes go ahead maniakes answered maybe stavrakios had been bold enough to keep his vestiarios from knowing everything that happened to him few avtokrators since had been maniakes certainly was not kameas said he speaks you fair no doubt of that one thing the makuraners have shown though is that their deeds dont commonly live up to the words they use to cloak them too true maniakes said the same holds true for the kubratoi the same held true for videssos too during the reign of my late and unlamented predecessor i of course am the very milestone of truthfulness of course your majesty kameas said so seriously that maniakes doubted whether he had caught the intended irony then the vestiarios let out the smallest most discreet snort imaginable go on esteemed sir maniakes told him starting to laugh take yourself elsewhere yes your majesty the vestiarios replied the good god grant that abivard give you good news concerning the eminent triphylles he turned and swept away leaving maniakes staring after him in astonishment he hadnt seen what the avtokrator had written he hadnt been in the chamber then how did you know maniakes asked but by then kameas was a long way down the hall if he heard he gave no sign great pillars of smoke rose from across as they had when abivards forces entered the suburb the autumn before now they were leaving giving maniakes easy access to the westlands if he wanted to try conclusions with the makuraners again this summer wondering whether he did was only part of what worried him he turned and put the other part to rhegorios if hes leaving there where in phos holy name is he going my cousin your majesty damn me to the ice if i know rhegorios spat on the ground in rejection of skotos all i can say is hes likely headed where he thinks he can do us the most harm he could have done worse staying right where he was maniakes said discontent in his voice across was like the stopper in the jar his holding it kept us out of the westlands now we can go back if we dare but what will happen to us if we do cant tell that till we try itif we try it rhegorios answered but i can tell you what happens if we dont the makuraners get to keep the countryside for another year and make it even harder for us to get it back when we do finally work up the nerve to try maniakes grimaced that his cousin was blunt did not mean he was wrong maniakes said i wish i thought our army was in better shape weve worked hard this winter but he let that hang you could take tzikas advice rhegorios said with a curl of his lip if you stay right here in videssos the city you know and only wait long enough why eventually every single fellow who opposes you now will die of old age and then videssos will be free to take back its own haha maniakes said in a hollow voice his cousin exaggerated tzikas cautious approach to war but only slightly we have to fight the makuraners we have to do it in the westlands and we have to do it on our own terms we cant afford any more fiascoes like the one last summer if we arent in a position to go out there and win we shouldnt fight how do you propose to guarantee that rhegorios asked just about every time theres a battle the bastards on the other side have a nasty habit of fighting back you cant simply count on them to lie down and die no matter how much you wish they would to the ice with you maniakes said laughing in spite of himself you know what i mean no matter how clumsily i say it i cant let myself get lured into situations where i dont have the advantage the more of whats ours we take the more men and resources we gather for the next step if we can start by taking back across that will be something rhegorios said take it back they did after the dromons on endless patrol in the cattle crossing reported that abivard and his horsemen had indeed abandoned the suburb soon after imperial soldiers reentered across maniakes sailed over the strait to the westlands to see what the makuraners had done to it his first impression was that what his men had taken was not worth having and that the makuraners had abandoned it only because nothing was left to wreck most of what could burn had been burned what hadnt been burned had been torn apart to get fuel for the fires made of the rest in evergrowing streams people emerged from the ruins to spin him tales of woe and horror he listened to them sympathetically but without much surprise he knew how armies treated a countryside populated by enemies the makuraners had done nothing out of the ordinary robberies and rapes were part of the long sad litany of mans inhumanity to manand to woman but your majesty said an aggrieved merchant whose stock of fine boots now adorned makuraner feet arent you going to chase after those thieving heathens and make em pay for what they done by his tone he expected maniakes to set a properly itemized bill before abivard the next time he saw him ill do everything i can maniakes said evasively he didnt care to answer that just being in the westlands this year was as much as he had hoped for consolidating my position here comes first though after all we dont want the makuraners back do we what we want and what we get arent always the same thing the merchant answered his voice sour only after the words were out of his mouth did he seem to realize they might be taken as criticism of maniakes a moment after that he had made himself scarce maniakes ruefully shook his head it wasnt as if the same thought hadnt crossed his mind a time or twelve engineers surveyed the ground west of across seeking the best line on which to establish field fortifications the suburbs on the far side of the cattle crossing from videssos the city had been unwalled for hundreds upon hundreds of years who could have imagined an enemy dangerous enough to penetrate to the very heart of the empire imagined or not the makuraners had been here the evidence of that was only too obvious the chief engineer a stocky dour man named stotzas said i can lay you out the sites for some fine works your majesty i see one trouble thoughno two he was the sort who saw more troubles the longer he looked at something maniakes had no trouble seeing these for himself he held up his thumb where am i going to find the men to build the works you lay out he stuck up his index finger beside thumb where am i going to find soldiers to put in the works even if you do manage to build them youve just rolled phos little suns stotzas said his big bluntfeatured head bobbed up and down as he nodded mind you your majesty ill do everything i can for you but his voice trailed away he didnt flee as the merchant had but he didnt look delighted about speaking the whole truth either but theres liable not to be much you can do what with manpower being the way it is maniakes suggested stotzas nodded glad for the respite he said at that ive got it easy brick and stone dont argue back the lord with the great and good mind may know what to do about the mess with the temples but im bound for the ice if i do nor i maniakes answered feeling a good deal less than impudent whoever came up with the idea of forcing priests in places the makuraners hold to adopt vaspurakaner usages was a fiendishly clever man some of the priests will have done it sincerely others to curry favor with the invaders others just to survive sorting out who did what for which reasons is liable to take years especially when everybodys busy calling everybody else a liar like i said bricks and stone they keep quiet stotzas replied shave a mans head and put a blue robe on him and it doesnt seem like hell ever shut up that wasnt altogether fair a great deal of the monastic life for instance was passed in prayerful silence but the chief engineer had a point in defending themselves and accusing their neighbors the clerics who jostled for audience with maniakes did the reputation of the temples no good after listening to one set of denunciations and counterdenunciations all of them backed with documentseach side insisting the documents of the other were forgeriesmaniakes burst out a pox take the lot of you holy sirs that wasnt the way a good and pious ruler was supposed to address his clerics but he was too fed up to care you may send this whole great mound of tripe to the most holy agathios to let him deal with it as he will until such times as he decides the case i command you to live at peace with one another and to respect one another as orthodox regardless of who may have done what to whom while the makuraners were here but your majesty one bluerobe cried these wretches reveled in their lapse into heresy glorying in the chance to bring the temples into disrepute a priest of the other faction shouted youre the ones who dragged the good name of the temples through the wineshops and bathhouses with your shameless pandering to the invaders the two sides started calling each other liars and apostates again just as they had when they first came before maniakes he slammed his open palm down on the table in front of him the small thunderclap of noise made clerics from both sides momentarily fall silent in surprise perhaps you misunderstood me holy sirs maniakes said into that brief silence you may respect one another as orthodox until the ecumenical patriarch renders his decision on your cases or you may call one another heretics to your hearts contentin gaol which will it be the clerics werent screaming at one another when they left his presence which represented progress of a sort when they were gone he slumped back in his chair and covered his face with his hands rhegorios came over and thumped him on the shoulder cheer up my cousin your majesty youll have cases like that in every town we reconquer from the makuraners no i wont by the good god maniakes burst out agathios will and well find out whatif anythingthe most holy sir is made of and what hes good for given what he had seen of agathios that wasnt apt to be much he screwed his face up as if he had tasted wine gone into vinegar youve given me the first decent argument ive heard for letting the makuraners keep the westlands rhegorios laughed as if he had made a joke from across videssian forces cautiously pushed south and west it was by no means a reconquest of the westlands but a slow wary reoccupation of territory abivard had for the time being abandoned in somewhat bolder style maniakes ordered a few bands of horsemen deeper into the westlands to see if they could nip in behind big makuraner forces and wreck the supply columns that kept them stocked with arrows and spearpoints and iron splints for their cuirasses he ordered his men not to attack the makuraner field armies not this year he said first we learn to hurt them in other ways once we know we can do that we think about facing them in open battle again meanwhile lets see how they like moving through a hostile countryside the short answer was the makuraners didnt like it they started burning villages to show they didnt like it maniakes didnt know whether to mourn or cheer when he got that news it would depend on whether the makuraners cowed the westlands or infuriated them in response he sent for more raiding parties many of them aboard ship to go to the northern and southern coasts of the westlands and strike inland from there maybe just maybe he told his father well be able to force the boiler boys off balance for a change the one place where they cant match us is on the sea thats so the elder maniakes agreed he plucked a long white hair from his beard and held it out at arms length so he could see it clearly after he let it fall to the ground he looked sidelong at his son and asked have you got a naval captain whose head you wouldnt mind seeing up on the block i could probably come up with one maniakes allowed why would i want to though his fathers eyes twinkled the kubratoi cant match us on the sea either those monoxyla of theirs are all very welluntil they run up against a dromon after that theyre wreckage with butchered meat inside i was just thinking you could send a captain up along the coast of kubrat to raid and then when etzilios screamed blue murder send him the fellows head and say it was his idea all along maniakes gaped then laughed till the tears came by the good god father now youve gone and tempted me every time i look north im going to think of doing just what you said it might not even make the khagan go back to war with us hes clever enough curse him to see the joke if you werent at war with makuran the elder maniakes said and if i had a ships captain i really wanted to be rid of the avtokrator added it would hardly be fair to an upandcoming officer thats true the elder maniakes said he wouldnt be upandcoming afterward hed be downandgoing or rather gone they both laughed then long and hard enough that kameas stuck his head into the chamber to find out what was going on after they had explainedeach more sheepish than the otherthe vestiarios said in times like these any cause for mirth no matter how foolish is to be cherished hes right maniakes said after kameas left between the way the war is going and losing niphone the imperial residence has been a gloomy place a man whos happy without reason is likely either a fool or a drunk or else both his father answered well get back down to business soon enough im sure of that his prophecy was fulfilled a couple of days later when a messenger delivered a dispatch from abivard brought to videssianheld territory behind a shield of truce maniakes drew it out of its boiledleather tube like the one the makuraner general had sent before it was written in videssian though not in the same hand as the earlier missive had been abivard general to sharbaraz king of kings may his years be many and his realm increase to maniakes styling himself avtokrator of the videssians greetings in reply to your recent communication regarding the status of the man triphylles whom you sent as embassy to the good pacific and benevolent sharbaraz favorite of the god beloved of the prophets four i am bidden by his puissant majesty to inform you that the aforesaid man triphylles in just punishment for his intolerable insolence has been confined to prison outside mashiz to ponder his folly the message stopped there maniakes eyes kept going for a couple of lines worth of blank parchment as if to force more meaning from the sheet he held he cant do that the avtokrator exclaimedto whom he could not have said your majesty the messenger hadnt the slightest idea what maniakes was talking about he cant do that maniakes repeated sharbaraz cant just throw an ambassador into jail because he doesnt fancy the way he talks if that were the only criterion moundioukh for instance would never see the outside of a cell again maniakes went on it violates every law of civilized conduct between empires why should sharbaraz care a fig about anything like that the messenger said for one thing hes a cursed makuraner for another hes winning the war so whos going to stop him from doing whatever he pleases maniakes stared at him without answering the fellow was right of course who wouldwho couldstop sharbaraz king of kings from doing whatever he pleased maniakes had proved singularly unable to pull off the trick is there a reply your majesty the messenger asked yes by the good god maniakes dipped a pen in a pot of ink and began to write on a sheet of parchment he had been about to use to authorize more expenditures for repairing the walls of imbros this was more urgentunless of course etzilios decided to break the truce for whose extension maniakes had just paid maniakes avtokrator of the videssians to abivard general of makuran greetings the pen scratched gently as it raced over the writing surface i am shocked and dismayed to learn that sharbaraz king of kings would so forget the law of nations as to imprison my ambassador the eminent triphylles i demand his immediate release how on pain of war his mind jeered youre already at warand losing i further demand proper compensation for the outrage he has suffered and his immediate return to videssos the city where he may recuperate from his travail i do not judge you guilty in this matter pass my letter on to your sovereign that he may act on it in all possible haste he called for sealing wax from kameas and closed the letter in on itself before giving it to the messenger how much good this will do phos alone knows the avtokrator said but phos also knows no good at all can come unless i do protest after the messenger departed maniakes spent a little while calling curses down on abivards head had the makuraner general not urged the course upon him he never would have sent triphylles off to sharbaraz he had assumed the king of kings would not mistreat an envoy and also that sharbaraz would be interested in extracting tribute money from videssos but sharbaraz was already extracting money from videssos with enough plunder coming in he cared nothing for tribute maniakes kicked at the floor for an angry moment he wished kourikos and triphylles had never come to kastavala niphone would still be alive if they had stayed in videssos the city and it was hard to see how the empire could have been in worse shape under genesios than it was now under his own rule and he himself would still have been back on the island of kalavria with his mistress and his bastard son and none of the catastrophes befalling his homeland would have been his fault he sighed some people are meant to start fires some are meant to put them out he said though no one was there to hear him genesios started this one and somehow or other i have to figure out how to pour water on it he sat down and thought hard things were better now than they had been the year before then he had tried to match the makuraners at their own game it hadnt worked videssos had beenand remainedin too much chaos for that now he was trying something new he didnt know how well his strategy of raids and pinpricks would work but it could hardly fare worse than what had gone before it with luck it would rock abivard back on his heels the makuraners in the westlands hadnt had even that much happen to them for a long time even if it works its not enough he muttered harassing abivards forces wouldnt drive them off videssian soil he couldnt think of anything within the empires capacity that would maniakes thrust a parchment at tzikas he wished he had the leather tube in which the message had reached videssos the city he would have hit his gloomy general over the head with it here eminent sir read this he said do you see tzikas took his own sweet time unrolling the parchment and scanning its contents any good news is always welcome your majesty he said politelyand infuriatinglyunimpressed but destroying a few makuraner wagons west of amorion doesnt strike me as reason enough for agathios to declare a day of thanksgiving by his tone he would not have been impressed had the message reported the capture of mashiz nothing maniakes could do would satisfy him save possibly to hand him the red boots had he not been such a good general maniakes would have had no qualms about forcing him into retirementbut his being such a good general was precisely what made him a threat now keeping a tight rein on his temper maniakes said eminent sir destroying the wagons is not the point the point is that we have warriors raiding deep into territory the makuraners have held since the early days of genesios reignand coming out safe again to tell the tale more than your warriors in amorion did he thought all the while knowing that was unfair tzikas had done well to hold out in the garrison town for as long as he had expecting him to have hit back too was asking too much the general handed the note back to him may we have many more such glorious successes your majesty was that sarcasm luckily for tzikas maniakes couldnt quite be sure may we indeed he answered taking the comment at face value if we cant win large fights by all means let us win the small ones if we win enough small ones perhaps the makuraners will have suffered too much damage to engage us in so many of the large ones did it come to pass that would be very good tzikas agreed but your majestyand i hope you will forgive me for speaking so plainlyi dont see it as likely they have too strong a grip on the westlands for even a swarm of fleabites to drive them out eminent sir if neither large fights nor small ones will get the makuraners out of the westlands isnt that the same as saying the westlands by rights belong to them these days i wouldnt go quite that far your majesty tzikas said cautious as usual maniakes by now had the distinct impression tzikas wouldnt go very far for anythinga more relentlessly moderate man would have been hard to imagine in a way that was a relief for maniakes could hope it meant tzikas wouldnt go far in trying to overthrow him either but it limited what he could do with the general send tzikas to lead what should have been a dashing cavalry pursuit and you would find he had decorously ridden after the foe for a few miles before deciding he had done enough for the day and breaking off no doubt he was a clever resourceful defensive strategist but a soldier who wouldnt go out and fight was worth less than he might have been otherwise maniakes gave it up and went to see how his children were doing evtropia greeted him with a squeal of glee and came toddling over to wrap her arms around his leg papapapa she said good she talked much more than he remembered atalarikhos doing at the same age all the serving women maintained she was astonishingly precocious since she seemed a clever child to him too he dared hope that wasnt the usual flattery an avtokrator heard a wet nurse was feeding likarios nodding to maniakes she said he is a hungry one your majesty odds are that means hell be a big man when he comes into his full growth well have to wait and see maniakes answered that was flattery nothing else but he quite favors you i think the wet nurse said trying again maniakes shrugged whenever he looked at his infant son he saw niphones still pale face in the sarcophagus it wasnt as if the baby had done that deliberately nor even that he felt anger at his son because of what had happened to niphone but the association would not go away maniakes walked over to look down at the boy likarios recognized him and tried to smile with the wet nurses nipple still in his mouth milk dribbled down his chin the wet nurse laughed so did maniakes in spite of everythinghis son looked very foolish hes a fine baby your majesty the wet nurse said he eats and eats and eats and hardly ever fusses he smiles almost all the time thats good maniakes said hearing his voice likarios did smile again maniakes found himself smiling back he remembered evtropia from the fall before when she had been a few months older than her little brother was now she had thrown her whole body into a smile wiggling and thrashing from sheer glee she hadnt cared thenshe still didnt carethat the makuraners had conquered the westlands and were sitting in across as long as someone had been there to smile at her she had stayed happy he envied that the wet nurse stuck a cloth up on her shoulder and transferred likarios from her breast she patted him on the back till he produced a belch and a little sour milk thats a good boy she said and then to maniakes hes a healthy baby too she quickly sketched the suncircle over her stillbare left breast he hasnt had many fevers or fluxes or anything of the sort he just goes on about his business is what he does thats what hes supposed to do maniakes answered also sketching the sunsign nice to see someone doing what hes supposed to do and not fouling up the job your majesty the wet nurse said politics wasnt her first worry either whatever happened outside her immediate circle of attention could have been off beyond makuran as far as she was concerned maniakes wished he could view matters the same way unfortunately he knew too well that what happened far away now could matter in videssos the city later if he and his father hadnt helped restore sharbaraz to his throne the westlands likely would have remained in videssian hands to this day papapapa evtropia wasnt going to let her brother keep all his attention she came over to maniakes and demanded pick up me how smart she is the wet nurse said as maniakes obeyed his daughter hardly any children that little make real sentences evtropia squealed with glee while maniakes swung her through the air then she got bored and said put down me so he did that she went off to play with a doll stuffed with feathers the wet nurse made no effort to put her dress to rights maniakes wondered whether that was because she thought likarios would want more to eat or so she could display herself for him even if he slept with her only once she could expect rich presents if he made her pregnant she would never want for anything and if as in a romance she swept him off his feet and he married her but he didnt want to marry her or even to take her to bed after a while she must have realized that for she slipped her arm back into the left sleeve of the dress the baby had fallen asleep she got up and put him in his cradle maniakes played with evtropia for a while then she started to get cranky one of the serving women said it will be time for her nap soon your majesty no nap evtropia said no nap the second repetition was loud enough to make everyone in the room flinchexcept her brother he never stirred even as she screamed though evtropia betrayed herself with a yawn maniakes and the serving woman exchanged knowing glances it wouldnt be long the avtokrator felt better after he left his children unlike most of the empire they were doing well yes and look at the price you paid but he hadnt paid the price poor niphone had he missed her more than he had thought he would not just waking up alone in the large bed in the imperial bedchamber but talking with her she had never been afraid to tell him what she thought for an avtokrator that was precious most people told him what they thought he wanted to hear nothing more only among his own blood kin could he hope to find honesty now slowly he walked down the hallway and out of the imperial residence the guards on the low broad stairs stiffened to attention he nodded to themletting your bodyguards think you took them for granted wasnt smart his real attention though was on the westlands rebuilding in across went on by fits and starts a few of the burned temples there had been restored the gilded domes that topped their spires glinted in the sunlight the makuraner army that had held the suburb was now ravaging its way across the westlands despite maniakes pinpricks he could not keep that army from going where it would wrecking what it would and if as they might abivard and his men chose to winter in across yet again could he hope to hold them away from the nearest approach to the capital he wondered whether he could get away with telling himself what he wanted to hear that the reconstituted videssian forces would surely drive the invaders far far away the only problem being its not true he muttered if abivard decided to come back to across he could and all the hopeful restorations would go up in flames like the buildings they were replacing he wondered if it was worthwhile to go out and fight the makuraners west or south of across regretfully he concluded it wasnt not till he could fight with some hope of winning videssos couldnt afford to throw men away in losing fights not any more yes the makuraners would go on ravaging the countryside if he didnt fight them but if he did they would smash up his army and then go on ravaging the countryside to the ice with choices between bad and worse he said but he had no means to consign those choices there summer advanced hot and muggy maniakes let moundioukh and his fellow hostages ride north from videssos the city toward kubrat not so much because he was convinced of etzilios goodwill as because holding hostages indefinitely was bad form and could create illwill even if none had existed before youse not regrets thises majesties moundioukh assured him maniakes already regretted it but found it impolitic to say so over in the westlands abivard took enough raids from the southeastern hill country that he finally hurled his mobile force against it to try to end the annoyance once and for all when word of that came to videssos the city maniakes felt like celebrating so did his father with an evil chuckle the elder maniakes said i dont think he knows what hes getting into that country is almost as hard for a big force to operate in as vaspurakan its all cut up into dales and valleys and badlands and if you take one of them that helps you not a bit with the next one just over the ridge with a little luck he may get stuck there like a fly in a spiderweb maniakes said that would be lovely wouldnt it wed have a chance to get back real chunks of the westlands then dont count your flies till youve sucked them dry his father warned going into the southeast was a mistake getting stuck there would be a worse one from what i recall of abivard were lucky hes made one mistake but wed be fools to count on two have to take all the advantage we can of the one maniakes said in a lot of places in the coastal lowlands they bring in two crops a year if abivard stays busy in the southeast we might even see a bit of revenue from them he scowled i wish i could lay siege to some of the towns hes garrisoned but i cant think of anything that would make him bring his main force back faster id sooner let him play his own games down there for as long as he likes yes thats wise the elder maniakes nodded we didnt get into this mess in one campaigning season and we wont get out of it in one either he coughed then wiped his mouth on his sleeve anybody who thinks there are quick easy answers to hard questions is a fool i suppose so maniakes let out a wistful sigh what do you call somebody who wishes there were quick easy answers to hard questions his father rumbled laughter i dont know boy a human being maybe as the weeks passed some revenue did reach videssos the city from the nearer regions of the westlands maniakes had to fight the temptation to tax them till their eyes popped just for the sake of immediate gold if you flayed the hide off the sheep this year what would you do for wool the next kourikos said but your majesty without significant revenue enhancements how can we continue our necessary activities to the ice with me if i know maniakes answered with what he hoped wasnt deathbed cheeriness as i read the numbers though eminent sir with this new gold coming in why were almost back to bankrupt we havent been that well off since likinios was still wearing his head the logothete of the treasury studied him he watched kourikos trying to decide whether he was seriousand not having the nerve to come right out and ask he hadnt seen a funnier spectacle since midwinters day joke eminent sir he said at last to put the logothete out of his misery kourikos tried a smile on for size it didnt fit well he hadnt smiled much since he had lost his daughter it might as easily have been simply a vivid metaphor for our present predicament maniakes thought that was what a joke was but knew he lacked the erudition to get into a literary discussion with kourikos i havent seen makuraners or even kubratoi swarming over the walls of the city eminent sir until i do im going to try to keep believing we have hope very well your majesty kourikos replied i have heard the patriarch say despair is the one sin that admits of no forgiveness have you maniakes looked at him in no small surprise i wouldnt have thought the most holy sir had so much wisdom hidden in him now kourikos looked thoroughly scandalized which was the very thing the avtokrator had in mind maniakes had hoped that when abivard decided he had had enough of grinding his army to bits in the hills and valleys and badlands of the southeastern part of the westlands he would pull back into the central plateau and rest and recuperate there he rejoiced when dispatch riders brought word that abivard had apparently had enough of the southeast hard on the heels of those men though came other riders warning that the makuraners instead of drawing back to lick their wounds were heading north with a large force north through the lowlands maniakes asked in dismay he clung to disbelief as long as he could which wasnt long by the way abivard was moving he did intend to pass the winter just over the cattle crossing from videssos the city as he had the year before maniakes examined a parchment map of the westlands hoping to find something different on it from what he had seen earlier in the year any chance of holding them at the line of the arandos there would be if we had a real army to match his instead of a scant few regiments we can count on not to run screaming the first time they set eyes on a boiler boy rhegorios answered glumly the avtokrator let out a long sigh if rhegorios aggressive as he was didnt think the makuraners could be held at the river then they couldnt be if we had forces south of the river to slow them down we might get more men into place to stop them he said and then sighed again the only forces videssos had south of the arandos were the hillmen of the southeast they were fine fighting where the terrain favored them but they lacked both numbers and skill to confront the makuraners on the flat ground of the lowlands and they wouldnt just be pursuing abivards army they would have to get in front of it thinking with his head rather than his heart maniakes knew the thing couldnt be done rhegorios said at least we have forces down almost as far as the arandos considering where we were last year after amorion fell thats progress of a sort we havent written off the whole of the westlands as id feared we might havent we maniakes asked his voice bitter if abivard can travel through them as he pleases and the most we can do is bother him a bit now and then do they belong to us or to him it was generous of him to let us use some of them a bit this summer but you cant say hes given them back you can pray for miracles your majesty cousin of mine but that doesnt always mean phos will grant them rhegorios said if the good god did grant them all the time they wouldnt be miracles any more would they one of maniakes eyebrows quirked upward shall we send for agathios to shave your head and give you a blue robe you argue like a priest i havent it in me to be a priest rhegorios answered his eyes twinkling i like pretty girls too well and id sooner have it in them when maniakes made as if to throw a punch at him he skipped back with a laugh but persisted was i right or wrong eh what about miracles or about pretty girls just making the quip sobered maniakes he had bedded a couple of serving maids since niphone died he had been ashamed after each time but like his cousin found himself even more miserable as a celibate somberly he went on yes youre right about miracles shall i go on and give the rest of your speech for you no as long as im here i may as well do it rhegorios said try as you would you couldnt keep him serious for long given the mess genesios left you doing anything worth speaking of in the first couple of years of your reign would have taken a miracle phos didnt give you one so what now you sound like my father maniakes replied but if the makuraners were shipbuilders the empire probably would go under thats so what the best we could hope for would be to stand siege here videssos the city will never fall to a siege rhegorios said confidently youre right it would probably take a miracle to make that happenbut suppose the god doled one out to the makuraners maniakes said deadpan rhegorios started to answer stopped stared at the avtokrator then tried again you almost caught me there do you know that for one thing the god is only a figment of the makuraners imaginations and for another i dont think weve been quite sinful enough for skotos to rise up and smite us that particular way if the sun turned north again after last midwinters day were good for a while longer or i miss my guess maniakes sketched the suncircle over his heart may you prove right he studied the map some more if we cant hold them at the arandos we certainly cant hold them anywhere between there and across can we hold them with the new works weve built outside across he wasnt asking rhegorios the question he was asking himself his cousin assumed the burden of answering it though doesnt seem likely does it no maniakes said and the word tasted like death in his mouth why did we waste our time and substance rebuilding then but it wasnt we he had given the orders he slammed his fist against the map pain shot up his arm i made the same mistake ive been making ever since i put on the red boots i thought we were stronger than we are its done now rhegorios said an epitaph for any number of unfortunate occurrences are you going to send an army into the westlands to try to defend what weve rebuilt youre trying to find out if ill make the same mistake one more time even now arent you maniakes asked rhegorios grinned at him utterly unabashed now that you mention it yes youre as bad as my father maniakes said hes had all those years land on him to make him so warped and devious whats your excuse but i havent answered your question have i no im not going to send an army over to across if abivard wants it so badly he can have it rhegorios nodded gave the map a thoughtful tap and left the chamber where it hung maniakes stared at the inked lines on the parchment provinces and roads where his word did not run all at once he strode to the door shouting for wine he got very drunk the renewal bounced in the chop of the cattle crossing makuraners stood on the western shore jeering at the dromon and calling in bad videssian for it to come beach itself on the golden inviting sand we hello you oh yes one of them shouted you never forget you meet us not never so long as you live his teeth flashed white in the midst of his black beard maniakes turned to thrax hurl a couple of darts at them he said well see if they jeer out of the other side of their mouths aye your majesty the drungarios of the fleet replied he turned to his sailors one of them set an ironheaded dart its shaft as long as an arm and thicker than a stout mans middle finger in the trough of the catapult others turned windlasses to draw back the engines casting arms which creaked and groaned under the strain thrax called orders to the oarsmen who turned the renewal so it bore on the knot of makuraners loose the drungarios shouted as a wave lifted the bow slightly the catapult snapped and bucked like a wild ass the dart hurtled across the water a scream went up from the shoreit had skewered someone yelling with glee the catapult crew loaded another missile into the engine and began readying it to shoot again maniakes had expected the makuraners to disperse instead all of them with bows shot back at the renewal their arrows raised little splashes as they plinked into the water well short of their target the sailors laughed at the foe loose thrax cried again another dart leapt forth this time the sailorsand maniakes with themcursed and groaned for it hit no one but the makuraners scattered like frightened birds even so that changed maniakes curses into cries of delight soldier against soldier the boiler boys were still more than the videssians could face with any hope of victory but when they came up against the imperial fleet the makuraners found foes they could not withstand we rule the westlands maniakes shouted making the sailors stare at him before he added or as much of them as isnt more than two bowshots from shore the sailors laughed which was what he had had in mind thrax earnest and serious as usual said if it please your majesty ill order the dromons in close to shore so they can shoot at clumps of the enemy who have come down too close to the sea yes do that maniakes said it will remind them we dont tamely yield our land to abivard and the king of kings it may even do the makuraners a little real harm too which wouldnt be the worst thing in the world maniakes hoped darts flying at them from beyond bow range would convince the makuraners to stay away from the seaside which might have let him land raiders with impunity instead abivards men set up catapults of their own close by the edge of the sea some of them threw stones big and heavy enough to sink a dromon if they hit it square but they didntthey couldntand in a few days the engines vanished from the beaches the makuraner engineers werent used to turning their machines to aim at a target more mobile than a wall and especially werent used to shifting them to hit a target that was not only moving but doing its best not to get hit and the videssian sailors who compensated for wave action whenever they used their dartthrowers and who practiced hitting land targets had a fine time shooting at catapults that had to stay in one place and take it they damaged several and killed a fair number of the engineers who served them before abivard figured out he was involved in a losing game and pulled back his machines a few days later the first snow fell maniakes hoped abivards men would freeze inside across yet at the same time could not wish for too savage a winter if the cattle crossing iced up abivard might have his revenge for the little wounds the catapult crews on the dromons had inflicted on his force maniakes wished his father hadnt told him the story of that dreadful winter he went back to drilling his soldiers on the practice field out by the southern end of the city wall as they had the winter before the makuraners sometimes came out to see what they could see sometimes now a dromon would chase them away from the beach of across maniakes took considerable satisfaction whenever he saw that happen no less an authority than tzikas said your majesty they look more like fighting men than they did a year agoand you have more of them now too he tempered that by adding whether you have enough men whether theyll be good enough those are different questions so they are maniakes shaded his eyes with his hand and peered west over the cattle crossing he saw no makuraners today a dromon slid smoothly through the channel not pausing to harass any of abivards men but maniakes knew they were there whether he could see them or not not all the smoke that rose above across came from cookfires the makuraners were busy wrecking the suburb all over again come the spring i expect you will put them to the test by the way tzikas sounded that was more a judgment against maniakes character than an expression of hope for victory spring feels a million years a million miles away maniakes kicked at the yellowbrown dead grass under his boots frustration gnawed at him like an ulcer that would not heal i want to go against them now to drive them off videssian soil with a great swift blow you tried that once your majesty the results were imperfectly salubrious from our point of view tzikas might have been a litterateur criticizing a bad piece of poetry rather than a general commenting on a campaign maniakes regarded him with reluctant respect that he criticized his sovereign at all bespoke a certain courage and integrityor perhaps such a perfect confidence in his own rightness as to blind him to any offense he might give either way he also seemed blind to how much maniakes hated acknowledging himself unable to strike back at abivards army he was glad to get back inside the walls of videssos the city in there try as he would he could not see the cattle crossing let alone the land on the western shore he could try to pretend all of it still yielded up taxes to the fisc still recognized him as its ruler before he had gone far into the city he discoverednot for the first timehe was no good at fooling himself when he got to the palace quarter he could distinguish once more the smoke rising from across from that coming off the myriad fires within videssos the city even had his pretense survived so long that would have killed it oblivious to his worries rhegorios said to the ice with tzikas hes the sort whod order up a lemon for his sweet that was true but did little to lift maniakes spirits when he didnt answer rhegorios let out an indignant sniff at the imperial residence he went off in a huff wine your majesty kameas asked the only reply he got was a shake of the head he was trained not to show annoyance and very emphatically didnt show it maniakes wondered if the nights supper would suffer on account of that no he decided kameas also had great pride in service nice to know someone has pride in something maniakes muttered everything he had spent so much time and effort and gold rebuilding in the spring and summer had fallen to pieces in a few weeks as fall approached maybe things would get better when spring came once more or maybe the good weather would just lead to yet another round of catastrophes he went into the chamber where he was in the habit of trying to match the dribbles of revenue that came into the fisc with the unending flood of gold that poured out of it he had had a new slender trickle of gold coming in from those parts of the westlands closest to videssos the city but he couldnt robor even borrow fromthe temples nearly so much this year they didnt have much either that meant he had to pay out less or cheapen the currency again which amounted to the same thing if he stopped paying everyone but the soldiers he wouldnt have any bureaucrats to collect next years taxes if he put more copper in the goldpieces people would start hoarding good money traders would stop doing business and he wouldnt have much in the way of taxes to collect next year someone rapped on the door go away he growled without looking up assuming it was kameas coming to try to make him feel better but the voice that said very well didnt belong to kameas it was lysias maniakes head came up with a jerk there werent many people in the city he didnt want to irk but she was one of them im sorry he said i thought you were someone else please come in she had already started to turn away for a moment he thought she would ignore the invitation stubbornness ran all through his family he said if you dont come in here this instant cousin of mine ill call you up before the avtokrator on a charge of lese majesty through wanton and willful disobedience he hoped that would amuse her instead of making her angry and it did not that she cried anything but that i abase myself before your majesty she really did start a proskynesis never mind that by the good god maniakes exclaimed they both started to laugh then looked warily at each other since niphone died they had been cautious when they were together and they hadnt been together much maniakes sighed scowled and shook his head i think back on how things were at kastavala and do you know what cousin of mine they dont look so bad i didnt have to look over my shoulder whenever i wanted to talk to you and i didnt have to worry about peering over the water and seeing the makuraners wrecking everything in sight he sighed again it might even be better back there now come to think of it dont let your father hear you say that lysia warned hed box your ears for you whether you wear the red boots or no i cant say id blame him either how could you fight the makuraners in the westlands if you were back on kalavria how can i fight them now he asked i was watching their smoke rise up from across while i was out with the troops at the practice field there they sit right at the very heart of the empire and i dare not do anything more against them than the little pinprick raids we tried this summer they arent at the heart of the empire lysia said we are here at videssos the city as long as we hold the heart we can bring the rest back to life one day no matter how bad things are in the westlands so everyone says so ive thought maniakes answered i really do wonder if its true though suddenly the notion of sailing back to kalavria leaving behind the hateful reminders of how weak the empire of videssos had grown seemed sweeter than honey to him back at the old fortress above kastavala he could think of the empire as it had always been not in its present mutilated state and could rule it without worrying so much about the daytoday emergencies that made life here in the capital feel so difficult but before he could make clear to lysia his vision of the benefits abandoning videssos the city might bring she said of course its true theres never been a fortress never been a port like this one in the history of the world and if you give up on videssos the city why shouldnt the people here give up on you he paused thoughtfully she had a point she had a couple of points in fact if the fickle city mob raised up a new avtokrator that man whoever he was would gain a tincture of legitimacy because he held videssos the city he would also gain its walls its dromons and even genesios the unspeakable had reigned half a dozen years with those advantages and so keeping his longing for kalavria to himself he said maybe youre right i told you once you had the wit to be sevastos i know you got angry at me then and if you tell me again ill get angry at you now lysia said by the way her nostrils flared she was angry the city mob wouldnt let me do that any more than theyd let you sail away and she added grudgingly my brother has shaped well in the job maniakes got up from the table piled high with receipts and registers and requests for gold he did not have any excuse for escaping from those requests was a good one as far as he was concerned he walked over to lysia and set his hands on her shoulders i am sorry cousin of mine he said it just seems as if everything has gone to the ice since we came to videssos the city i should never have named my flagship the renewal every time i board it that strikes me as a cruel jokemaybe on myself maybe on the empire itll come right in the end she said hugging him in the sea fights before he took videssos the city he had watched floundering men find floating planks and cling to them as if they were life itself that was how he clung to lysia now she still had faith in him no matter how much trouble he had holding onto faith in himself he was also acutely aware of holding a woman in his arms after a little while she could hardly have failed to notice his body responding to hers he never was sure whether she first raised her head or he lowered his when their lips met it was with as much desperation as passionbut the passion was there at last they drew back just a little are you sure lysia said softly he didnt need to ask what she meant his laugh rang harsh im not sure of anything any more he said but he went to the door of the chamber and closed it before he let the bar fall he said you can still go out if you like weve talked about this before after all if we go on from here it will complicate both our lives more than either of us can guess now and i have no idea whether it will come right in the end whether it will turn out to be worth it neither do i lysia said still in a low voice she didnt leave she urged no course on him he stood a moment irresolute then very carefully he set the bar in its bracket he took a step toward her she met him halfway it was chilly and awkward and they had no comfortable place in the roomand none of that mattered their two robes and their drawers on the mosaic floor did well enough maniakes expected to find her a maiden and he did past that everything was a surprise he had thought to be slow and gentle as he had been with niphone their first night together bare hours after agathios set the imperial crown on his head lysia did grimace and stiffen for a moment when he entered her to the hilt but she startled him by taking pleasure afterward she had no practiced skill at what they did but enthusiasm made up for a great deal she exclaimed in surprise and delight a moment before he could hold back no longer even as he spent he thought of pulling free of her and spurting his seed onto her belly as he had that once with niphone but he discovered that thinking of a thing and being able to do it were not one and the same even as the idea skittered over the topmost part of his mind his body drove ever deeper into hers and for a little while all thought went away it returned too quickly as thought has a way of doing at such times now what he murmured his face scant inches from hers he wasnt really talking to her or to anyone she answered with a womans practicality now let me breathe please im sorry maniakes said and got off her she had a sunburst print between her breasts from the amulet bagdasares had given him sliding away from him she started to dress when she got a look at her drawers she clucked to herself there wont be any hiding this from the serving women her mouth twisted in wry amusement not that id bet anything above a worn copper that the servants dont already know maniakes glanced toward the barred door that had given them privacyor its illusion i wouldnt be surprised if youre right he put on his clothes a little faster than he would have without her words after running his fingers through his hair he said now what again easiest maybe would be to pretend this never happened lysia answered she paused then shook her head no not easiest most convenient i should say to the ice with convenience maniakes burst out besides you just said the servants will know and youre right and what the servants know today is gossip in the plaza of palamas day after tomorrow thats true lysia cocked her head to one side and studied him what then my cousin your majesty i know what id do if you werent my cousin maniakes said if you werent my cousin i expect wed have married years ago out on kalavria youre probably right lysia hesitated then went on i hope you wont be angry if i tell you there were times when i was very jealous of rotrude angry maniakes shook his head no of course not ihad feelings for you that way i didnt think you had them too not till i was about to sail off to see if i could overthrow genesios and you were sailing to niphone lysia added what was i supposed to do then i did what i thought i had to do but now whatever we do now were going to make a scandal i know maniakes said they also took the chance of having the scandal become all too dreadfully obvious in nine months timealthough actually if that befell it would become obvious rather sooner with that worry in mind he went on the best way i can think of to deal with this is for me to marry you now in spite of everything if thats what you want to do of course its what id like she said nodding but will a priest marry us if he does will agathios anathematize him and what will our families say im sure i can find a priest who will do as i tell him maniakes answered what agathios will do i dont know hes a political beast but thiswell just have to find out if agathios thundered of sin the city mob was liable to erupt well have to find out about our fathers too and our brothers he had known this would complicate his life maybe he hadnt let himself think about how much and maybe the same thoughts were running through lysias mind she said it really might be easiest to pretend this didnt she stopped and shook her head plainly she didnt want to do that neither did maniakes he said ive loved you as a cousin for as long as i can remember and ive always thought a lot of your good sense and now with this even after they had made love he hesitated about openly saying so i cant imagine wanting anyone else as my wife he went over to her and took her in his arms she clung to him nodding against his chest well just have to get through it thats all she said her voice muffled so we will maniakes said maybe it wont be so hard after squeezing her once more he went to the door and unbarred it then he opened it and looked up and down the corridor he saw no one heard no one for a moment he was relieved we got away with it ran through his mind then he thought about how seldom the corridors of the imperial residence were so eerily quiet and deserted odds were that the servants were deliberately avoiding going anywhere near that door he had just unlocked he clicked his tongue between his teeth a serving maid wouldnt have to see lysias drawers the secret was already out the elder maniakes took a long swallow of wine he peered down into the depths of the silver cup as if he were bagdasares using it as a scrying tool you aim to do what he rumbled to marry my cousin maniakes answered we love each other she has the best head on her shoulders of anyone in the family except maybe you and we love each other his ears heated at the repetition but it was done his father raised the cup again draining it this time he was careless when he set it down on the table and it fell over ringing sweetly as a goldpiece he muttered to himself as he straightened it to maniakes amazement he started to laugh it does keep things in the family doesnt it is that all you have to say maniakes demanded no not by a long shot the elder maniakes said phos only knows what my brother will dois lysia telling him he waited for maniakes to nod before continuing the patriarch will scream incest at the top of his lungs you know have you thought about that maniakes nodded again oh yes part of him was screaming the same thing he was doing his best not to listen to it the same probably held true for lysia that was one more complication he hadnt thoroughly thought through and yetit didnt just happen out of the blue you know oh yes i do know that his father answered one day back on kalavria when rotrude was pregnant with your boy he put one hand out in front of his own considerable belly she told me shed stick a knife in you if she ever caught you in bed with your cousin did she maniakes said amazed he was in fact amazed for a couple of reasons i would have guessed shed tell me that not you so would i the elder maniakes said i think being with child might have had something to do with her acting so weak and womanish he rolled his eyes to show he did not intend that to be taken seriously but the point of it is shed noticed the two of you i had too but i wasnt so sure id known the both of you longer than she had of course and i knew youd always been friendly she was the one who saw it was something more than that rotrude always knew me pretty well maniakes said soberly seems she knew me better than i knew myself there he walked over to the pitcher of wine which had on it a low relief of a fat old man drunkenly chasing a maiden who was neither fat nor old nor overburdened with clothing after pouring his own cup full he raised it to his lips and drank it down without drawing breath then he filled it again but father what am i going to do eh the elder maniakes dug a finger in his ear you told me what you were going to do youre going to marry her arent you what do you expect me to do about it tell you i think youre a fool i do think youre a foola couple of fools i gather but am i going to take a leather strap and turn your arse red send you to your room without supper by the good god son youre a man now and entitled to your choices no matter how stupid i think they are and youre the avtokrator ive read the chronicles i have avtokrators fathers who try giving them orders have a curious way of ending up shorter by a head maniakes stared at him in genuine horror if you think id do such a thing id better take off the red boots and shave my own head for a monk no son the monastery is the other place for fathers who make their imperial sons unhappy the elder maniakes said he studied the avtokrator are you sure this cant be settled somewhere short of marriage you mean by keeping her as mistress maniakes asked his father nodded he shook his head i wouldnt take honor away from her his laugh held irony some would say falling in love with her did that wouldnt they well let them but thats not the only problem i see suppose we dont wed but i do take another wife one day what would she and her family think about the arrangement lysia and i have nothing good ive no doubt the elder maniakes said suppose instead that you put your cousin aside now what then then my life looks cold and empty and dark as skotos icy hell maniakes answered spitting on the floor in rejection of the dark god when i look out at the empire gloom is all i see must i see the same when i look here at the imperial residence i told you son youre a man grown his father answered if this is what you want and what my niece wants he coughed a little at that but went on gamely enough then its what you will have where we go from there is any mans guess but i expect well find out before long kameas said your majesty the most holy ecumenical patriarch agathios has arrived at the residence in response to your summons good maniakes stomach knotted within him at the prospect of the meeting that lay ahead but he did not show it bring him to me full formality throughout here mind you he is not summoned for a friendly chat i shall observe your majestys requirements in all particulars the vestiarios replied with dignity he swept away the tiny mincing steps he took under his long robe made him seem to float as he moved like a ship running before the wind your majesty agathios said at the doorway after kameas announced him he went down to his knees and then to his belly in full proskynesis when he started to get up before maniakes had given him leave the avtokrator coughed sharply agathios bent his back once more touching his forehead to the marble floor rise most holy sir maniakes said after a wait he judged suitable you may take a seat erthank you your majesty warily the patriarch sat down he suited his tone to the one maniakes had taken in what way may i be of service to your majesty this morning we have thought the time ripe to abandon the single life and choose for ourself another bride maniakes answered he couldnt remember the last time he had bothered with the imperial we but he would try anything to overawe agathios today which was why he had summoned the patriarch to the palace quarter rather than visiting him at his own residence next to the high temple i rejoice at the news and wish you joy your majesty agathios said fulsomely if without any great warmth he hesitated then asked and to whom have you chosen to yoke yourself for what i pray will be many happy and fruitful years maniakes didnt miss that hesitation he wondered what sort of rumors the ecumenical patriarch had heard none had got back to him yet from the plaza of palamas which did not mean they were not there carefully he said we have chosen to wed lysia the daughter of the most noble symvatios he made no mention of lysias relationship to him if anyone was going to raise that issue it would have to be agathios the patriarch did raise it in a sidelong manner has the most noble symvatios given this union his approval yes most holy sir he has maniakes answered you may ask this of him yourself if you doubt me he had spoken the truth his uncle hadnt said no but if symvatios had been enthusiastic at the prospect of his daughters becoming empress he had concealed that enthusiasm very well of course i rely on your majestys assurance agathios hesitated again coughed and looked this way and that maniakes sat silent willing him to keep quiet here in the imperial residence agathios a malleable soul if ever there was one would surely be too intimidated to argue from a doctrinal standpoint wouldnt he after that long long pause the ecumenical patriarch resumed be that as it may however i must bring it to your majestys attention that the bride you propose to wed is ah within the prohibited degrees of relationship long established in canon law and also forbidden under all imperial law codes he hadnt screamed incest at the top of his lungs but that was what his polite nervous phrases amounted to and what he would do back at the high temple was anyones guess maniakes said most holy sir what pleases the avtokrator has the force of law in videssos as you know in this particular case it pleases us to exempt ourself from the secular laws you mention that is within our power similarly it is within your power to grant us a dispensation from the strictures of canon law so we ask and so we instruct you to do agathios looked unhappy in his boots maniakes would have looked unhappy too had the patriarch had a little less backbone he would have yielded and that would have been that as it was he said let me remind your majesty of the pledge he gave on entering videssos the city to assume the imperial dignity wherein he promised he would make no alterations in the faith we have received from our fathers we do not seek to alter the faith only to be dispensed from one small provision of it maniakes answered surely there is precedent for such a man who lives by precedent alone can should he search find justification for almost anything agathios said whether the results of breaking justify one doing so is you will forgive me debatable maniakes glared at him most holy sir do you tell me straight out that you will not do as i instruct you he kicked at the floor in annoyancehe had fallen out of the imperial we agathios looked even unhappier may it please your majesty it pleases me not at all maniakes snapped may it please your majesty the patriarch repeated i must in this matter however much i regret doing so heed the dictates of my conscience and of anciently established canon law however much you regret it now youll regret it more later maniakes said i daresay i can find another patriarch one willing to listen to common sense avtokrators have indeed cast patriarchs down from their seats in the past agathios agreed gravely should your majesty undertake to do so in this instance however and for this cause my opinion is that he will bring to birth a schism among the priests and prelates of the holy temples maniakes bit into that one like a man stubbing his tooth on an unseen bone in his meat the empire cannot afford such a schism not now far be it from me to disagree with what is so selfevidently true agathios said then you will do my bidding and marry me to the woman i love maniakes said she is your first cousin your majesty she is within the degrees of relationship prohibited for marriage the patriarch said as he had before if i were to perform such a marriage in the high temple the temples throughout the empire would likely see schism if you oust me rigorists would rebel against whatever pliant prelate you put in my place if i acceded to your demands those same rigorists would rebel against me knowing the temper of videssian priests maniakes judged that all too likely i do not wish to have to live with lysia without the sanction of marriage he said nor she with me if you will not perform the ceremony in the high temple most holy sir will you let it be done here at the small temple in the palace quarter by some priest who does not find the notion as abominable as you seem to he had yielded ground to etzilios he had yielded ground to abivard now he found himself yielding ground to agathios he stood straighter a private wedding was the only concession he would so much as consider with what looked like genuine regret agathios shook his head you ask me to designate someone else to commit what i still reckon to be a sin i am sorry your majesty but the matter admits of no such facile compromise maniakes let out a long unhappy breath he didnt want to dismiss the ecumenical patriarch sure as sure that would start a tempest in the temples and videssos might fall apart under such stress agathios might have been reading his thoughts since affairs of state have come to such a pass of hardship and difficulty the patriarch said i urge you to incline toward putting your own affairs in good order do not contemplate this lawless action rejected by the statutes of videssos nor transgress decency with your cousin you have said what you think good maniakes answered but you do not persuade me i shall act as i think best and the consequences of my action shall rest on me alone so they shall your majesty agathios said sadly so they shall some of maniakes bodyguards entered the high temple with him others the big fair men from halogaland who did not follow phos waited outside one of them yawned i hope your head priest will not talk long today he said in slow videssian too nice the day for standing about maniakes thought it was chilly and raw but halogaland routinely knew winters like the one of which his father had spoken in horror however long he speaks ill hear him out he said the tall blond haloga dipped his head in resigned acquiescence in the exonarthex priests bowed low to maniakes they did not prostrate themselves not here in the high temple phos authority was highest that of the avtokrator lowest of anywhere in the empire a small opening in a side wall gave onto a stairway leading up to the small chamber reserved for the imperial family maniakes climbed those stairs his videssian guards mounted them with him a couple of men stopped just out of sight of the bottom of the stairway the rest accompanied him to the chamber and posted themselves outside the door as maniakes peered out through the filigree grillwork that gave avtokrators and their families privacy when they cared to have it he saw one of the bluerobed priests who had greeted him hurry down the aisle and speak to agathios who was standing by the altar in the center of the temple agathios heard him out then nodded his gaze went to the grill from times when he had worshiped in the public area of the high temple maniakes knew he was effectively invisible behind it all the same for a moment he and the patriarch seemed to lock eyes then agathios looked away from him and up toward the great dome that was the architectural centerpiece of the high temple maniakes eyes traveled up to the dome too and to the mosaic of phos in stern judgment covering its inner surface the good gods eyes seemed to look into his as they would have had he been anywhere in the high temple the phos in the dome there was the model for depictions of the good god in temples throughout the empire some of the provincial imitations looked even fiercer than the original but none could approach it for aweinspiring majesty you would have to think twice before contemplating sin under that gaze try as he would though maniakes had trouble seeing the desire to marry his cousin as something for which the lord with the great and good mind would condemn him to the eternal ice in his time on the throne he had seen the difference between rules in place because they made sense and those in place because they were in place he reckoned the prohibition that so exercised agathios one of the latter the patriarch kept looking up into the dome his back was straighter when at last he gave his attention to the growing number of worshipers filing into the pews that led up to the altar presently maniakes heard and felt priests shutting the doors down below him agathios lifted up his hands the congregants rose behind the filigree screen maniakes stood with everyone else though no one except that phos brooding in righteousness could have seen him had he stayed seated along with the rest of the worshipers he followed the patriarchs lead in reciting phos creed then sat once more as a chorus of priests sang the good gods praises going through the infinitely familiar liturgy rising and sitting praying and chanting cleansed maniakes spirit of some of the worry with which he had entered the high temple it served to unite him to the good god and also to unite the people of the empire with one another wherever videssos dominions ran men and women prayed in the same way and acknowledged the same clerical hierarchy a schism would shatter that unity hardly less than the makuraner occupation of the westlands had following agathios lead the worshipers stood for a last time repeated phos creed and then sat back down to hear the ecumenical patriarchs sermon that of course varied from day to day from week to week and from temple to temple maniakes leaned forward and put his ear close to the grillwork so as to miss nothing it was principally for the sermon he had come not for the liturgy comforting though that was may the lord with the great and good mind look down kindly upon videssos and ensure that we pass through the present crisis unharmed agathios said small murmurs of so may it be floated up to maniakes from the pews a good half the congregants sketched the suncircle over their hearts maniakes traced a quick suncircle himself the patriarch went on may the lord with the great and good mind also instill piety and wisdom into the heart of the avtokrator the course he presently contemplates would make it difficult for phos to grant his blessings to him in particular and to the empire as a whole while i grieve with his majesty and sympathize with the loneliness now engulfing him i must respectfully remind you all that the laws of the temples are not a bill of fare at an eatery wherefrom a man may choose those courses pleasing to him while paying no heed to the rest they form a seamless garment which will fall to rags if any one of them be torn from it he looked up toward the grillwork behind which maniakes sat the avtokrator is of course phos viceregent on earth and heads the empire consecrated to the good gods true and holy faith he is at the same time a man far from being the good gods son or any other such outlandish notion and is subject to the same fleshly temptations as other men such temptations are lures of skotos to be resisted with all the power a man shall have agathios went on in that vein for some time he was polite reasonable he did not shout about incest or urge the people of videssos either to rise against their avtokrator or risk the imperilment of their souls as maniakes had seen agathios enjoyed being patriarch and wanted to hold the job he was giving maniakes as little excuse to oust him as he couldbut he also was not retreating from the position he had set forth in the imperial residence it was in its own way a masterful performance in the abstract maniakes admired it he was however not much given to abstraction at the moment as agathios dismissed the congregants from the liturgy maniakes rose from his seat and left the private imperial box the guards nodded to him as he came out one asked did the sermon please you your majesty he didnt mean anything by it by his tone it was just a question for the sake of casual conversation but it was not the question maniakes wanted to hear then no he snapped will you sack him then your majesty the guard asked eagerly the eyes of all his companions lit up doctrinal controversy was meat and drink to anyone who lived in videssos the city i hope not maniakes answered visibly disappointing the soldiers they were still trying to get more out of him when he left the temple and came out to where the halogai waited the northerners found videssian theological squabbles inordinately complex this stupid priest does not do what you want your majesty you put his head up on the milestone one of them said the next chief priest you pick he do what you tell him he hefted his axe by the look of him he was ready to carry out the sentence he had passed on agathios its not that simple maniakes said with a regretful sigh the halogai all laughed in their bloodthirsty code everything was simple despite more prodding from the videssian guards maniakes stayed quiet and thoughtful all the way back to the imperial residence when he got there he called for kameas how may i serve you your majesty the vestiarios asked summon me the healerpriest philetos maniakes answered of course your majesty kameas smooth beardless face twisted in concern is your majesty ill no maniakes said but then amended that im sick to death of agathios ill tell you so much i see kameas said slowly in a speculative tone of voice he went on the holy philetos being so much concerned with his healing researches is apt to be of less certain obedience to the most holy ecumenical patriarch than a good many others from the ecclesiastical hierarchy whose names spring to mind really maniakes said in mock surprise how on earth can you suppose such a consideration might matter to me it is my duty to serve your majesty in every possible way kameas answered it was not quite responsive but informative enough in its way the vestiarios went on i shall summon the holy sir directly good maniakes said after philetos had prostrated himself before the avtokrator he asked how may i serve your majesty he sounded genuinely curious which maniakes took as a sign that he was too busy with his research to care about what was going on in the wider world around him i want you to perform the ceremony of marriage for me the avtokrator said coming straight to the point if agathios wouldnt ask a cooperative priest to tend to that he would do it himself philetos gray eyebrows rose of course i shall obey and ii am honored that you should think of me he stammered but i cant imagine why you have chosen me rather than the ecumenical patriarch ander forgive me but to whom would you have me join you in marriage he was naive again maniakes answered directly to my cousin lysia he did not waste time skirting the relationship as he had with agathios if philetos had been surprised before he was astonished now she is your first cousin is she not your majesty he asked and then answered his own question yes of course she is have you a dispensation from the patriarch for this union no maniakes said i ask it of you even so philetos stared at him your majesty you put me in a difficult position if i obey you i suffer the wrath of my ecclesiastical superior while if i disobey he spread his hands he knew under whose wrath he fell if he disobeyed the avtokrator that is the choice you must make and you must make it now maniakes said your majesty i have never performed the ceremony of marriage in all my days in the priesthood philetos said my interest has centered on applying phos goodness and mercy to broken and infirm bodies and i took my priestly vows for that purpose alone i maniakes cut him off you are not prevented from serving the part of a priest with less abstruse concerns are you well no but philetos began very well then maniakes broke in again your answer holy sir philetos looked trapped he was trapped as maniakes knew very well the avtokrator thought about pledging some large sum of gold to the sorcerers collegium after the ceremony was done but found a couple of reasons not to do so such promises were as likely to offend as to accomplish their purpose even more to the point he couldnt lay his hands on any large sum of gold for the collegium very well your majesty philetos said at last i shall do as you say but i warn you that trouble is likelier than joy to spring from your decision oh i know it will cause trouble maniakes laugh held scant humor but i have so much trouble already whats some more and wedding lysia will bring me joy i know that too arent i entitled to a little now and then joy is every mans portion from phos philetos answered gravely maniakes suddenly wondered if he was yielding because he felt guilty over having failed to save niphone and was seeking this way to make amends he didnt ask he didnt want to know not for certain finding out would make him feel guilty in turn philetos went on when would you like the ceremony celebrated at once maniakes said i dont want to give you the chance to change your mind he called for kameas when the vestiarios came in he said gather together lysia my father her father and rhegorios the wedding will go forward your majesty when you bade me summon the holy sir here i took the liberty of alerting the people whom you mention to that possibility kameas replied they are all in readiness thatsmost efficient of you maniakes said i suppose i shouldnt be surprised at such things anymore but every once in a while i still am i aim to be taken for granted your majesty kameas said while maniakes was still trying to figure out how to reply to that philetos asked where will the wedding take place your majesty i gather you do not care to draw a great deal of attention to it you gather correctly holy sir maniakes answered i had in mind the small temple here in the palace compound it may be in something less than perfect repair as its not been used a great deal by the past few avtokrators but i did think it would serve kameas coughed again anticipating your majesty i have sent a crew of cleaners to that small temple to make such efforts as they can toward improving its appearance and comfort maniakes stared at him esteemed sir you are a marvel your majesty kameas said with considerable dignity if something is to be done it is to be done properly parsmanios scowled at maniakes brother of mine you didnt do that properly not even close to it the whole citys buzzing now that words seeped out yes the people are buzzing maniakes admitted they arent screaming though the way i was afraid they would with luck the buzz will die down and ill be able to go on about my business his brother continued as if he hadnt spoken and i dont much fancy you going and tying yourself to symvatios and rhegorios either let me tell you that you treat them better than you do your own flesh and blood and theres a fact theres your problem brother of mine maniakes said youre not jealous of lysia youre jealous of rhegorios and why shouldnt i be parsmanios retorted if youre avtokrator he has the place that should be mine by right you had no business naming a cousin sevastos when you had a brother ready to hand maniakes exhaled through his nose first of all you werent ready to hand when i needed a sevastos you were off in your piddlepot little town you hadnt been my right arm all the way through the war with genesios and rhegorios had and ever since i gave him the post hes done a firstrate job with it weve been over this ground before brother of mine why do you want to walk down the track again because i didnt think youd be stupid enough to commit in parsmanios stopped not quite soon enough you are dismissed from our presence maniakes voice went cold as a winter storm you have incurred our displeasure we do not care to speak with you again until you have expiated your offense against us go he hadnt used the imperial we half a dozen times since he had become avtokrator and now twice inside a few days it seemed a better way to show his anger than shouting for the guards to fling parsmanios in the gaol that lay under the government office building on middle street parsmanios stalked away not two minutes later rhegorios rapped on the door jamb my cousin your brother looked imperfectly delighted with the world when he walked out of the residence here he remarked your cousin my brother will look even less delighted if he tries to set foot in the residence any time soon maniakes answered still fuming let me guess rhegorios said if it takes more than one go get yourself someone with a working set of wits and put him in my place youre in no danger there maniakes kicked at the floor if he did it often enough he might tear loose a couple of tiles from the mosaic there that would give him the feeling he had accomplished something and vex kameas when he noticed which he would in a matter of hours kicking again maniakes went on when even my own brother shouts incest at me i wouldnt lose any sleep over it my cousin your majesty brotherinlaw of mine rhegorios grinned at the clumsy collection of titles he had used to label maniakes forgive my bluntness but i have trouble seeing parsmanios leading rioters baying for your head now that you mention it so do i maniakes came over to slap rhegorios on the shoulder if you were leading the rioters now theyd be laughing not baying rhegorios said most of the time i just amuse people despite that claim his face was serious but i might have been out there trying to make the mob howl you know maniakes gave him a pained look not you too you never let on and if you had i dont see how lysia and i could have gone on i might have been out there i said before i did anything though i went and talked with my sister for some reason or other marrying you was what she wanted to do and ive come to have a great deal of respect for lysias good sense if you have any sense of your own youll pay attention to her too i intend to maniakes answered if i didnt think i wanted to listen to her when she told me something this would have happened differently yes i can see how it might have rhegorios thought for a moment better this way he nodded judiciously so did the avtokrator maniakes looked forward to midwinters day with the same eager anticipation a little unwalled town in the westlands felt on the approach of abivards army he could not hold back the passing days though and avoiding the amphitheater would have been an unthinkable confession of weakness when the festival came he and lysia went out across the plaza of palamas to the great stone bowl where he confidently expected they would be mocked without mercy a few of the people in the plaza made a point of turning away from the avtokrator and his new bride more though treated them with the casual equality that was everyones due on midwinters day the two of them leapt over a fire hand in hand shouting burn illluck inside the amphitheater some catcalls and hisses greeted maniakes and lysia he pretended not to hear them and squeezed lysias hand she squeezed back hard she was not used to public abuse the elder maniakes and her own father and brother greeted her warmly when she and the avtokrator ascended to the spine of the amphitheater so did tzikas who looked splendid in a gilded chainmail coat parsmanios tried to make his nods to her and maniakes civil but did not succeed well the elder maniakes scowled at him afterward parsmanios worked harder at acting friendly but managed only to pour honey on top of vinegar agathios the patriarch made no effort to be friendly as far as he was concerned maniakes and lysia might as well not have existed he did recite the creed to begin the days events but even that felt perfunctory after the patriarch sat down once more maniakes took his place at the spot from which he could speak to the whole amphitheater people of videssos the city he said people of the empire of videssos we have all of us had another hard year the lord with the great and good mind willing when we gather here for the next midwinters day we shall have passed through sorrow into happiness so may it be so may it be the people echoed the acoustics of the amphitheater making their voices din in his ears now let the revelry begin maniakes shouted and sat down to make as if he enjoyed the lampoons the mimes were going to aim at him anything can happen on midwinters day so the saying went usually that meant something like finding an unexpected love affair but it could have other more sinister meanings as well to the avtokrators relief the first mime troupe mocked only his failure to regain the westlands he had seen himself portrayed as running away from anything in makuraner armoreven if it was an old man on a swaybacked muleand as fouling his robes while he ran mimes had been making those jokes about him since he took the throne if he had managed to smile for them before he could do it again without straining himself unduly when the troupe trooped off he glanced over to lysia she smiled back and mouthed so far so good he nodded he had been thinking the same thing it didnt stay good for long the very next troupe of mimes had a fellow dressed in gaudy robes and wearing a crown of gilded parchment sniffing lasciviously after a band of pretty little girls played by pretty little boys in wigs and dresses when he found one who wore a dress much like his robe and a scarf much like his crown he slung her over his shoulder and carried her away with a lecherous smirk on his face the crowd roared laughter it dinned in maniakes ears he had to sit there and pretend to be amused as he had warned her to do lysia also feigned a smile but through that false expression she said what a filthy lie im not that far from your own age and anyone who knows anything about us knows it but most of the people in the city didnt really know anything about maniakes and lysia that was the point the city mob formed its opinions from things like mime shows and seventhhand gossip some people who did know maniakes and lysia were laughing too parsmanios for instance was on the far side of a polite show of mirth so was kourikos who sat farther down the spine among the highranking bureaucrats not far away from him tzikas glittering in that mail shirt sat quiet sedate and discreet so did agathios the ecumenical patriarch continued to walk his fine line disapproving of the avtokrators conduct but not seeking to inflame the city by his own maybe i should have sent him as envoy to sharbaraz maniakes thought wondering what had happened to poor triphylles another troupe came out this one lampooned niphones funeral with people throwing up all along the route it was in extremely bad taste which meant the crowd ate it up maniakes bared his teeth curled the corners of his mouth upward and endured the next skit had lysia chasing maniakes rather than the other way round lysia had no trouble bearing up under it but it infuriated maniakes i wish genesios hadnt tried to put down the mimes and failed he said i dont want to imitate him at all but i could try suppressing the troupes myself if only he hadnt had a go at them its all right lysia answered we pay one day a year to have peace the rest of the time thats usually a good bargain maniakes said but what the people see here today will color the way they look at us for the rest of the year and for a long time after that too the next troupe came out what the people saw was another variation on the same theme this one had rhegorios pushing lysia at maniakes rhegorios laughed at that one it angered both maniakes and lysia having to keep his face twisted into the semblance of a smile was making maniakes cheeks hurt he glanced over at his guardsmen loosing them on the mimes would have turned his smile broad and genuine instead of slaughtering the troupes though he had to pay them for entertaining the people they certainly were entertaining parsmanios his brother laughed long and hard until the elder maniakes leaned over and said something to him in a low voice parsmanios sobered after that but the sullen looks he sent his father said his mind had not been changed no one spoke to kourikos maniakes former fatherinlaw showed more enjoyment of the mimes crude jokes than seemed quite fitting in such a normally humorless man one troupes lampoon was of the patriarch agathios for being too spineless to do a proper job of condemning maniakes and lysia the fellow playing him raised an angry hand drew it back in fright raised it drew it back finally a man dressed in an ordinary priests robe gave him a kick in the fundament that sent him leaping high in the air tzikas guffawed at that skit agathios assumed what was probably meant to be an expression of grave dignity but looked more as if he had been sucking on a lemon at last the ordeal ended the crowd in the amphitheater didnt hiss and scream curses at maniakes when he rose to dismiss them not too many of them laughed at him he considered that a major triumph when he and lysia got back to the imperial residence it was as still and quiet as it ever got most of the servants and several members of his family were off reveling in videssos the city lysia looked down the empty corridors and said well we got through it and we dont have to worry about it for another year the good god willing the mime troupes will have something besides us to give them ideas by then maniakes caught her to him have i told you anytime lately that i like the way you think yes she answered but i always like to hear it a message from abivard you say maniakes asked kameas by all means lets have it if its word triphylles has been released thatll be news good enough to warm this miserably cold day true your majesty the vestiarios said the servitors are stoking the furnace and the hot air is going through the hypocausts but sometimes he shrugged the weather defeats us in spite of all we can do a lot of things lately have defeated us in spite of all we can do maniakes said wearily sooner or later the weather will get better so will the resti hope send in the messenger after the fellow had prostrated himself and while he was gratefully sipping at a steaming cup of wine spiced with cinnamon and myrrh maniakes opened the leather message tube he had given him the avtokrator was becoming all too familiar with the lion of makuran on scarlet wax that abivard used to seal his messages he broke the wax unrolled the parchment and read the letter his foe had commanded some poor videssian to write for him abivard general to sharbaraz king of kings may his years be many and his realm increase to maniakes styling himself avtokrator of the videssians greetings i regret to inform you that the man triphylles whom you sent as an envoy to the glorious court of sharbaraz king of kings and who was subsequently imprisoned as just and fit punishment for undue and intolerable insolence before his majesty has suffered the common ultimate fate of all mankind i pray the god shall accept his spirit with compassion in lieu of returning his corpse to you sharbaraz king of kings ordered it cremated which was of course accomplished before word of these events reached me so that i might transmit them to you maniakes read through the missive twice he still could notand did notbelieve triphylles had acted insolently enough for any prince to find reason to cast him into prison the noble had begged not to be sent to the makuraner court at mashiz but maniakes had overborne his objections he had been confident sharbaraz adhered to civilized standards of conduct and now triphylles was dead after a long spell in gaol and who was to blame for that sharbaraz certainly but also maniakes fetch me sealing wax and a lamp he said to kameas as the eunuch hurried away maniakes inked a pen and wrote his answer maniakes avtokrator of the videssians to abivard slave to sharbaraz liar of liars killer of killers greetings i have received your word of the mistreatment and tragic death of my emissary the eminent triphylles tell your master one thing from me and one thing only he shall be avenged when kameas returned with the stick of wax and a lighted lamp he took one look at maniakes face and said a misfortune has befallen the eminent triphylles he sketched the sunsign above his plump breast it has indeed a mortal misfortune maniakes answered grimly he tied his letter with ribbon and pressed his sunburst signet into hot wax then he popped it into the tube and gave it to the messenger deliver this into abivards hands or into those of his servants i shall do as you say of course your majesty the messenger saluted with clenched right fist laid over his heart very well maniakes shook his head in sad bewilderment when i fought alongside them abivard and sharbaraz seemed decent enough fellows he plucked at his beard for that matter abivard still seems decent enough war is a nasty business no doubt of that but he hasnt made it any filthier than it has to beno great massacres in the towns hes taken nothing of the sort but sharbaraz now sitting on the throne of mashiz has gone to his head unless im sadly wrong the messenger stood mute quietly kameas said we have seen that in videssos the city too your majesty likinios came to think that anything could be so simply because he ordered it genesios spilled an ocean of blood for the sport of itand because he was afraid of his own shadow and the more blood he spilled the more reason he had to be afraid maniakes broke in that is nothing less than the truth your majesty kameas agreed we find ourselves fortunate with you the vestiarios did not lay flattery on with a trowel as if it were cementnot with maniakes at any rate no matter what he might have done for genesios he had seen the present wearer of the red boots did not care for such things now maniakes had a disheartening thought he imagined all his servants watching him wondering if and how he would turn into a monster so far kameas at least seemed satisfied he hadnt that was something he waved to the messenger the man nodded and hurried off to do his bidding he would have been astonished and angry had the fellow done anything else if you expected absolute obedience all the time who would warn you when you started giving orders that did not deserve to be obeyed if someone did warn you what were you liable to do to him would you do what genesios had done to anyone upon whom his suspicions fellhad he had cloudbursts of suspicions what sharbaraz had done to triphylles when the envoy said something wrongor when the king of kings imagined he had said something wrong how did you keep from becoming a monster maniakes didnt know but hoped that over the years he would find out the broad lawns of the palace quarter so inviting and green in spring and summer were nothing but snowfields now when the snow was fresh and the sun sparkled off it it was pretty in a frigid way today gray clouds filled the sky and the snow was gray too gray with the soot from the thousands of braziers and hearths and cook fires of videssos the city looking out at it through the barebranched trees surrounding the imperial residence maniakes screwed his mouth into a thin tight line the gloomy scene matched his mood a servant walking along a paved path slipped on a patch of ice and landed heavily on his backside maniakes faintly heard the angry curse the fellow shouted he got to his feet and limping a little went on his way maniakes eyes went back down to the petition for clemency he was reading a prosperous farmer named bizoulinos had started pasturing his sheep on a field that belonged to a widow who lived nearby when her son went to his house to protest bizoulinos and his own sons had set upon him with clubs and beaten him to death the local governor had sentenced them to meet the executioner but as was their right they had sent an appeal to the avtokrator after reviewing the evidence he did not find them in the least appealing he inked a pen and wrote on the petition let the sentence be carried out had they observed the law as carefully before their arrest as they did afterward they and everyone else would have been better off he signed the document and impressed his signet ring into hot wax below it bizoulinos and his sons would keep their appointments with the headsman maniakes rose and stretched condemning men to death gave him no pleasure even when they had earned it better by far if people lived at peace with one another better by far if nations lived at peace with one another too or so he thought the makuraners perhaps understandably given their successes seemed to feel otherwise a flash of color through the screen of cherry tree trunks drew his eye a couple of men in the bright robes of the upper nobility were walking along not far from the grand courtroom even at that distance he recognized one of them as parsmanios the set of his brothers wide shoulders the way he gestured as he spoke made him unmistakable for maniakes the man with whom he was talking was smaller slighter older than he maniakes squinted trying to make out more than that was it kourikos he couldnt be sure his hands closed into angry fists just the same his brother had no business associating with someone who so vehemently disapproved of his marriage to lysia his scowl deepened parsmanios disapproved of that marriage too and hadnt been shy about saying so he hadnt said so in an effort to change maniakes mind either he had just been out to woundand wound he had metaphorically anyhow who was the fellow beside him maniakes could not make him out though he brought his eyelids so close together that he was peering through a screen of his lashes if that was kourikos he and parsmanios could cook up a great deal of mischief together whoever they were the two men went into the grand courtroom together theyre plotting something maniakes muttered by the good god ill put a stop to that he listened in his minds ear to what he had just said and was appalled he didnt know with whom parsmanios had been talking or what he had been talking about this had to be how genesios had started seeing something innocent assuming the worst and acting on that assumption two men together obviously a plot stick their heads up on the milestone to warn others not to be so foolish acting without evidence led to monsterdom ignoring evidence on the other hand led to danger but would his brother could his brother betray him the clan had always been closeknit until he had evidence he wouldnt believe it he wished he and parsmanios were boys again so their father could solve their differences with a clout to the head that wouldnt work now even should parsmanios deserve it too bad maniakes thought one thing maniakes found he was far happier wed to lysia than he had been before they married had he not been so worried about the state of the empire he would have said he had never been so happy in his life that came as a considerable relief to him and something of a surprise as well he had done the honorable thing with her after they found themselves in each others arms but hadnt guessed the honorable would prove so enjoyable lysia had always been a companion a sounding board someone who could laugh with him or when he deserved it at him he still sometimes found himself bemused to be waking up in the same big bed with her i was afraid he said one morning we wouldnt stay friends once we were lovers good to see i was wrong she nodded i had the same fear but if we cant rely on each other whos left no one maniakes said as they got out of bed then he backtracked thats not quite true my father and yours and rhegorios he started to name parsmanios but he couldnt how sad not to be able to count on your own brother in any case lysia shook her head then brushed the shiny black curls back from her face it isnt the same she said after a moment he had to nod she frowned thoughtfully looking for the right words with which to continue at last she found them what we have is deeper somehow she flushed beneath her swarthy skin and dont you dare make the joke i know youre thinking thats not what i meant i wasnt going to make the joke maniakes did not deny it had crossed his mind i think youre right good lysia said she seemed happy too which eased maniakes mind he reached for the bell pull that summoned kameas who slept in the room next to the imperial bedchamber lysia went on as well its winter and im in a woolen gown i wouldnt want the vestiarios to come in after id got out of bed bare the way i do when the weather is hot and sticky yes niphone was modest about him at first too but she got used to it maniakes said i wasnt thinking of that lysia answered what would it do to him to see me naked hes not a man in his body poor fellow but does he think a mans thoughts even if they do him no good i dont know maniakes admitted i wouldnt have the nerve to ask either i suspect youre right though that sort of consideration couldnt hurt anyhow he clicked his tongue between his teeth if you did have a mans urges all those years and were utterly unable to do anything about themhow could you go on living he thought it would have driven him mad for kameas sake he hoped the eunuch was as sexless as his voice when he did summon kameas the vestiarios went through the robes in the closet with a critical eye at last he said does the leekgreen wool suit your majesty this morning yes that should do maniakes felt of it good thick cloth this one would keep me warm in a blizzard he threw off his sleeping robe and was about to let kameas vest him in the formal one for daily wear when he felt a warmth that had nothing to do with thick soft wool his hand went to the amulet bagdasares had given him back in opsikion when he was still trying to overthrow genesios the goldandhematite charm was almost hot enough to burn his chest almost hot enough to burn his palm and fingers as they closed on it for a moment he simply stood there in surprise then he remembered the wizards warning if the amulet grew hot that meant he was under magical attack he also remembered bagdasares warning him that it could not long withstand such an attack clad only in drawers and the amulet he ran out of the imperial bedchamber and down the halls of the residence behind him lysia and kameas both cried out in surprise he didnt take the time to answer themat every step the amulet felt hotter he pounded on the door to bagdasares room then tried the latch bagdasares hadnt barred the door he burst in the wizard was sitting up in bed looking bleary and astonished beside him with the same mix of expressions was one of lysias serving women neither of them seemed to wear even as much as the avtokrator did magic maniakes said clutching the amulet intelligence lit in bagdasares fleshy features he bounded out of bed making the sunsign as he did so he was nude by the way she squeaked and clutched the bedclothes to herself so was the maidservant maniakes felt as if something was squeezing him inside his skin however much good the amulet was doing it wasnt altogether keeping the hostile spell from having its way with him he yawned as if trying to clear his head while he had a cold that did nothing to relieve the oppressive sensation slowly building inside him bagdasares kept his case of sorcerous supplies by his bedside reaching into it he pulled out a ball of twine and a knife whose white bone handle had a golden sunburst set into it he used the knife to cut off a good length of twine then began tying the ends together in an elaborate knot whatever youre doing there please hurry maniakes said he felt something wet on his upper lip reaching up to touch it he found his nose was bleeding worse was that he thought a nosebleed the least of what the magic would do to him when it fully defeated the power of the amulet your majesty this must be done right bagdasares answered if i make a mistake i might as well not have done it at all easy for him to sayhis head wasnt being turned to pulp from the inside out maniakes stood still and hoped he wouldnt die before bagdasares got through doing things right the mage finished the knot at last when maniakes looked at it his eyes didnt want to follow its convolutions bagdasares grunted in absentminded satisfaction and began to chant in the vaspurakaner language running his hands along the circle of twine as he did so it wasnt just pressure inside maniakes head nowit was pain he tasted blood it dropped onto the floor of bagdasares room by the expression on the maidservants face he wasnt a pretty sight and if bagdasares didnt hurry up he was going to find out that being a slow wizard was one way of being a bad one bagdasares cried out to phos and to vaspur the firstborn then passed the circle of twine over maniakes head and slowly down to his feet it began to glow much as had the lines of power from his protective spell back in opsikion the wizard invoked the good god and the eponymous ancestor of his people once more when the circle of twine touched the ground he was careful to make sure it surrounded the blood maniakes had lost what color was the enchanted cord gold blue orange purple red it flickered back and forth among them faster than maniakes eyes could follow after a moment he didnt care the heat from the amulet began to fade against the skin of his chest and his head no longer felt as if the walls of his skull were going to squeeze together crushing everything between them better maniakes whispered still in her nightdress lysia appeared in the doorway her eyes wide and frightened kameas was right behind her maybe bagdasares magic hadnt been so slow after all if they were just now getting here it certainly had seemed slow with his head no longer feeling as if it were about to cave in on itself he was able to pay more attention to the shifting colors of the twine they changed ever more slowly red gold blue and all at once the twine was just twine again what does that mean lysia asked before maniakes could it means the assault against his majesty is over bagdasares answered he may leave the circle now if he so desires maniakes had wondered how long he would have to stay in there even so he hesitated before stepping out beyond the confines of the cord if by any chance bagdasares was wrongmaniakes didnt let himself think about that he stepped over the cord if he had felt in the least peculiar he would have jumped back into the circle nothing untoward happened he glanced over at kameas im glad i hadnt put on that leekgreen robe esteemed sir he said i would have bled all over it and thats very fine wool to the ice with the wool kameas said unwontedly emphatic i am glad your majesty is safe safe maniakes said an avtokrator isnt safe from the day he dons the red boots to the one when he gets shoved into a niche under the temple dedicated to the holy phravitas nobodys trying to kill me right now though a few minutes ago he shivered as he realized what a narrow escape he had had lysia seemed to have understood that all along turning to bagdasares she said can you find out who did this sorcerous sir no let me ask it another way can you find out who was behind the attempt if the mage escapes thats one thing but if whoever paid him to try to slay the avtokrator stays free he will surely try again bagdasares frown brought his heavy eyebrows together finding out who did the deed or planned it will not be easy not in the abstract i think i could determine on a yesorno basis whether any particular individual was involved in the attack that should do the job maniakes said i can think of most of the people who might want to be rid of me i expect what would you need from them for your sorcery whatever it is ill arrange it i promise you that i shouldnt require much your majesty bagdasares answered something that belongs to one of the individuals you suspect would suffice a sample of his writing for instance would be excellent ill have trouble taking care of that for abivard i fearmaybe i promised too readily maniakes paused or maybe not would a fragment of the wax he used to seal a letter he dictated do the job it should your majesty a mans seal is almost as much uniquely his own as his script bagdasares ran a hand through his tousled hair and whom else shall i examine lysia and kameas both flicked a glance toward the serving maid who shared the wizards bed maniakes didnt need that hint he had thought of her too but while he did aim to thwart gossip or warnings he didnt want to hurt her feelings he said lets not think of that while were all so disheveled kameas wasnt disheveled but then kameas as best maniakes could tell was never disheveled he finished after breakfast is time enough after breakfast the four of them gathered in a small reception chamber and considered who was liable to want maniakes off the throne kourikos name quickly came up so did that of phevronia his wife she is liable to resent your marriage to me even more than her husband does lysia said quietly i might not have thought of that for myself maniakes said thank you i have good reasonsmany good reasonsto want you on the throne for a very long time lysia answered speaking of reasons agathios hasor thinks he hasreasons to want you deposed your majesty bagdasares said so he does maniakes agreed well the most holy ecumenical patriarch is prolix with his pen well have no trouble getting a writing sample from him the eminent tzikas kameas said well check him maniakes said nodding id be surprised if he proves to have anything to do with this though he may want the throne but i think hed like to see it drop into his lap he is not aboveboard in what he does kameas insisted such men earn close scrutiny and deserve it eunuchs had a reputation for deviousness maybe they got suspicious when they sensed it in others the drungarios bagdasares said thrax maniakes had all he could do to keep from bursting out laughing if ever there was a man who wasnt devious thrax was the one but he nodded again even so straightforward men got ambitious too the eminent triphylles will have kin who may resent his passing in a foreign land kameas said maniakes hardly knew triphylles kin but that was a possibility genesios widow too he observed thoughtfully she may be mured up in a convent but nothing is ever sealed as tight as you wish it was messages can go in messages can come out after that a silence fell have we no more candidates bagdasares asked if not let us be about the business of obtaining samples of these persons writings or other articles closely associated with them one more person comes to mind maniakes said and then paused he glanced over to lysia your brother would name the name if we failed to and he would be right come to that so would my father i think parsmanios do you mean she asked naming maniakes brother to keep him from having to do it he sighed aye after we quarreled i saw himnot so long agodeep in conversation with someone who i think was kourikos though i would not take oath to that on phos holy scriptures bagdasares well need to be extra careful in getting a sample from him and youll need to be discreet in and after your test of that sample if he learns i suspected him he may become willing to conspire against me even if he wasnt before your majesty a mage who gossips is soon a mage without clients bagdasares answered as you command though i shall exercise particular care here that same care should be applied as you say in obtaining writings from him we should have in the archives orders he wrote for the vanguard as we advanced toward amorion maniakes said we can get some of those without his being any the wiser i should think that would be excellent your majesty bagdasares said with a nod as soon as you convey to me the necessary documents i shall begin examining them to see if their owners were involved in this wicked effort against you im sure i have here at the residence parchments written by kourikos and agathios maniakes said you can start on those right away i also have the letters from abivard here so youll be able to do whatever you aim to do with the bits of wax from his seal kameas said it might be instructive to go out and ask the guards whether anyone came wandering by a little while ago inquiring after your majestys wellbeing you or i would not be so foolish but few people find themselves at a disadvantage by underestimating the stupidity even of seemingly clever people no one who had held the imperial throne for a while would have presumed to disagree with that hoping the case would unravel like the sleeve of a cheap robe when the first thread pulled lose maniakes walked out to the entrance no one though had come round to see if he was still intact he sighed since the day he had donned the red boots nothing had been easy he didnt suppose he ought to expect anything different now when he turned back to deliver the negative news he found his father coming up the hall toward him are you all right son the elder maniakes asked the servants are telling all sorts of ghastly tales i shouldnt be surprised but yes im fine maniakes explained what had happened his fathers face darkened with anger sketching phos sunsign above his left breast he growled to the ice with whoever would try such a thing worse than hiring an assassin if you ask me a mage doesnt have to get close to try to slay you whos on your list maniakes named names his father nodded at each one in turn then the avtokrator named parsmanios the elder maniakes eyes closed in pain for a moment at last with a sign he nodded again aye youll have to look into that wont you he was away from us for a long time and he hasnt been happy with his circumstances since he came to videssos the city but by the good god how i hope youre wrong so do i maniakes answered as you say theres not been a lot of love lost between us but he is my brother if you dont remember that youre a long step closer to the ice right there the elder maniakes said bagdasares is finding out what you need to know is he how soon will he have any idea of whats toward where we have specimens hes already started work maniakes answered for some of the people who might have done it well either have to pull samples out of the archives or else get them to give us new ones we should have something from parsmanios in the files the elder maniakes sighed once more you have to do it but this is a filthy business i wonder if we wouldnt have been better off staying on kalavria in spite of all the tears and speeches the nobles gave ive thought the same thing the avtokrator said now he sighed in turn going back wouldnt be easy not what with everything thats happened since but heading for a place where no ones plotting against you has its temptations if we did go back someone might start plotting against you his father said he named no names but rotrude sprang into the avtokrators mind she hadnt married since he had left she would be jealous of lysia and she would want to advance atalarikhos fortunes the haloga style in such matters was liable to include good old straightforward murder maniakes felt like jumping into the sea only the fish would bother him there kameas stood in the doorway waiting to be noticed yes esteemed sir maniakes asked the excellent bagdasares has tested writings from the most holy agathios and the fragments of abivards seal your majesty the vestiarios replied he reports that neither man was involved in the attack on you he is about to evaluate writings from the eminent kourikos and wonders if you might be interested in observing the process as you expressed the belief that he may well be one of the guilty parties yes ill come maniakes said glad not to have to gauge the odds of rotrudes turning against him what about you father thank you ill stay here the elder maniakes said what wizards do can be useful how they do it never much interested me because i have no hope of doing it myself the avtokrator knew he would never make a wizard either but found what they did intriguing even so when he walked into the chamber where bagdasares was working the mage showed him a piece of parchment with crabbed notations complaining about a lack of funds this is indeed written in the hand of the eminent kourikos bagdasares asked maniakes nodded whistling softly between his teeth bagdasares set the parchment on a table he poured wine from one jar and vinegar from another together into a cup they symbolize what is and what shall be he said and this chunk of hematite he held it up is by the law of similarity attuned to the piece of the same mineral in the amulet that protected you and allowed you to reach me now he dipped a glass rod into the cup that held the mixed wine and vinegar then dabbed several drops of the mixture onto the parchment the letters and numbers there smeared as they got wet chanting bagdasares touched the wet places with the lump of hematite if the eminent kourikos was involved with the magic your majesty we should see those areas begin to glow as my sorcery exposes the connection maniakes waited nothing happened after a couple of minutes he asked has it done everything its going to do eryes your majesty bagdasares answered it would appear that the eminent kourikos was in fact not one of those who so wickedly plotted against you pointing out to an avtokrator that he was wrong could be a risky business maniakes however greeted the wizards words with a shrug and bagdasares relaxed maniakes was just as well pleased not to have the logothete of the treasury under suspicion for his innocence made parsmanios more likely maniakes wished he could have been positive it was kourikos he had seen with his brother but he couldnt and no help for it doing his best to make life difficult bagdasares said we do of course still have to test the script of the logothetes wife im sure youll attend to that in due course maniakes said he supposed kourikos could have been a gobetween for phevronia and parsmanios without directly doing business with the mage who had tried to kill him but it didnt strike him as probable he rubbed his chin i dont think i have a handwriting specimen from the eminent tzikas here ill send him a note and get one back in return as if on cue kameas stuck his head into bagdasares makeshift thaumaturgical laboratory and said your majesty a clerk has fetched writings hither from the government offices the vestiarios had discretion and to spare he never mentioned parsmanios name let him come in eminent sir maniakes said the clerk a weedy little man in a robe of wool homespun prostrated himself and then gave the avtokrator a sheet of parchment tied into a cylinder with a ribbon when maniakes slid off the ribbon he saw it was indeed one of parsmanios orders of the day for the vanguard of an army now long defeated the clerk disappeared presumably to return to the hordes of pigeonholes where such documents slept against the unlikely chance that they like this one might eventually need to be revived maniakes forgot about him the moment he was gone his attention swung back to bagdasares who was preparing the document for the same treatment he had given the one written by kourikos the mage sprinkled the marching order with his mix of wine and vinegar he began his chant once more and touched the piece of hematite to the parchment immediately it was suffused in a soft nimbus of blueviolet light the test has found an affirmative your majesty bagdasares said like kameas he did not speak parsmanios name a crushing weight of sorrow descended on maniakes are you certain sorcerous sir he asked no doubt or possible misinterpretation no your majesty bagdasares said sadly but without hesitation i regret being the agent who its not your fault maniakes said its my brothers fault he walked down the hall to the room where he had left his father he looked in parsmanios he said the elder maniakes grimaced but nodded the avtokrator walked out to the guards who stood on the steps he divided them in two and told one group go find parsmanios hell probably be in one of the wings of the grand courtroom at this time of day whatever hes doing fetch him here at once the guards asked no questions but hurried off to do his bidding when he went back into the imperial residence he found his father standing near the entrance what will you do with him to him i should say the elder maniakes asked hear him out maniakes answered wearily then have him tonsured and send him into exile in the monastery at prista up on the northern shore of the videssian sea its either that or take his head i know the elder maniakes clapped the younger on the back its a good choice he scowled no its the best choice you could make i never dreamed id have to thank you for sparing your brothers life but i do maniakes did not feel magnanimous he felt empty betrayed a messenger arrived with tzikas reply to his note he didnt even look at it but sent the fellow straight on to bagdasares then he went out and stared east through the cherry trees toward the grand courtroom before long the guards headed back to the residence parsmanios in their midst he was complaining volubly this is an outrage i tell you when the avtokrator hears of how you highhandedly jerked me out of that meeting with the eminent themistios logothete of petitions and how he stared as you did so his majesty will commend his men for carrying out his orders maniakes interrupted he spoke to the guards make sure he has no weapons despite parsmanios protests the soldiers removed his belt knife and after some searching a slim holdout dagger he wore in his left boot that done they escorted him to the chamber to which his father had returned why son the elder maniakes asked beating the avtokrator to the question why what parsmanios began then he looked from his father to his brother and saw that wouldnt get him anywhere from assumed innocence sprang fury why do you think the ice take you you shut me away from everything you did you gave rhegorios the spot that should have been mine i didnt know you were alive when rhegorios got the sevastos spot maniakes said how many times must i tell you parsmanios went on as if he hadnt spoken and as if that wasnt enough you started swiving his sister why didnt you just take him to bed incest with one wouldnt be any worse than incest with the other son you would be wiser to have a care in what you say the elder maniakes said you would have been wiser to have a care in what you did too better you should tell that to him parsmanios said pointing to his brother but no you dont care what he does you never cared what he did he was your eldest so it had to be right my backside says youre a liar maniakes said not that you havent shown that already say whatever you want parsmanios said it doesnt matter now i failed and youll take my head and that will be the end of it i had in mind taking your hair not your head maniakes said but listening to the swill you spew tempts me to give you what most traitors get he shook his head exile to prista will do he paused wondering how best to put his next question at last he said shall we send anyone into exile with you parsmanios stood mute maniakes thought of turning him over to the torturers to see what they could wring out of him but couldnt make himself do it he called the guards saying my brother is a proved traitor i want him kept in a constantly guarded chamber here in the residence for the time being later until he is sent off into exile well move him to a cell under the government office building some of the guardsmen looked astonished but they saluted to show they understood before leading parsmanios away maniakes looked up toward the ceiling every time i think it cant possibly get any worse cant possibly get any harder it does you did that as well as you could son the elder maniakes told him better than i would have managed it and thats a fact i never should have had to do it in the first place maniakes sat down and rested his chin on the knuckles of one hand my idiot brother he would have gone on but kameas paused in the doorway waiting to be acknowledged phos what now maniakes cried the vestiarios flinched then gathered himself your majesty the mage alvinos requests your presence he used bagdasares videssiansounding name more often than almost anyone else perhaps because it fit in with his notions of what was proper vaspurakaners had played a major role in videssian life for centuries but videssians seldom admitted or even noticed how large it was bagdasares bowed when maniakes came into the chamber where he labored i have here something i had not thought possible your majesty an ambiguous result on my test of this writing from tzikas i do not know whether he was involved in the sorcerous attempt on your life or he was not he wiped his forehead with the back of his hand it is a puzzlement show me what you mean by an ambiguous result maniakes said certainly bagdasares walked over to the parchment lying on the table as the ritual required i sprinkled it with my mixture of wine and vinegar then added the spiritual element of the spell and used the hematite you see for yourself see maniakes did most of the drops of the mixture had fallen on the writing where they had had no effect save to blur it but one or two had splashed down by the edge of the parchment after bagdasares touched his hematite to them they had begun to glow like the entire document parsmanios had written its almost as if tzikas was in contact with the parchment without having written what purports to be his reply bagdasares said and yet the message isor rather was before it was smearedaddressed directly from him to you suspicion flared in maniakes tzikas was subtle a master of defense i wonder if he took alarm at getting a message from me just after he tried to do me in and had someone else write a reply he glanced at bagdasares will my looking at it or touching it do any harm no your majesty the mage answered the avtokrator stepped up to the makeshift worktable as bagdasares had said the mixture of wine and vinegar had smeared much of the writing on the parchment it had also left the scraped sheepskin tangy to the nose maniakes bent to examine those few words he could still make out this isnt tzikas hand he said after a moment ive seen his script often enough to recognize it by the good god i dont know who wrote this but he didnt if he took the note afterward though that would account for the positive reaction at the edges of the sheet where he would have touched it before returning it to your messenger bagdasares finished for him if that fellow didnt see with his own eyes tzikas doing the writing i think we can be confident enough in our evaluation to summon the eminent general to give an accounting of himself well find out maniakes said he called kameas who arranged to have the messenger return to the imperial residence no your majesty i didnt see him write it the man said he stepped inside for a bit then came back out nobody told me i was supposed to watch him do the writing he looked anxious its all right maniakes said no blame for you he went out to the guards i now require the immediate presence of the eminent tzikas as they had when he had ordered them to fetch parsmanios they came to stiff attention busy day around here one of them observed as they went off to do his bidding maniakes let that go with a nod bringing in parsmanios had been easy if tzikas didnt feel like coming he had men loyal to him who might fight maniakes scowled and shook his head at the idea of a new round of civil war breaking out in videssos the city he waited the guardsmen were gone a long time when they came back they did not have tzikas with them apprehension on his face their leader said your majesty weve searched everywhere the eminent tzikas is likely to be and we spoke with several men who know him no one has seen him since shortly after he gave your messenger some sort of note i dont fancy the sound of that maniakes said go to the guard barracks rout out the offduty men and make a proper search crying his name through the streets and especially searching all the harbor districts aye your majesty the guard captain said the harbor districts eh you fear he may try to flee to the makuraners in across no maniakes answered i fear hes already done it he went back into the imperial residence to report that dispiriting news to his father the elder maniakes made a sour face these things happen he said hes no fool the note must have put his wind up and as soon as he gave it to you he lit out for parts unknownor parts known too well what will you do now see how much parsmanios will admit then get him tonsured and send him into exile the avtokrator said he again thought of giving his brother over to the torturers and again couldnt make himself do it he doubted whether parsmanios would have had the same compunctions about him parsmanios scowled at him when he walked into the chamber where his brother was being held under guard come to gloat have you the younger man said bitterly no just to let you know your comrade tzikas has run off to the makuraners maniakes answered i wonder if hell get a better bargain from them than he would have from me i wouldnt have sent him to the chopper not when i was leaving you alive no justice to that you could have gone off to prista together how wonderful parsmanios said how generous maniakes wondered if his brother was trying to provoke him to take his head instead of exiling him he ignored that asking so he was your comrade if you already know why bother asking parsmanios replied who was the wizard maniakes persisted who hired him i dont know his name parsmanios answered bring on the needles and the redhot pincers if you like but i never heard it tzikas and i met him in an old house not far from the forum of the ox i dont think the house was his i think he justinfested it tzikas got him hed known him i guess but said having me there would help make the magic stronger maybe it did but it still wasnt strong enough worse luck for me even if true none of that was very informative no doubt that was deliberate on parsmanios part keeping his voice as light as he could maniakes asked what did the wizard look like his brother said a man maybe your age maybe a little older not fat not thin kind of a long nose he spoke like someone with an education but a mage would wouldnt he i suppose so maniakes answered absently he knew considerable relief that the sorcerer tzikas had found was not the horrible old man genesios had employed that old man had almost slain him across half the breadth of the empire maniakes would have been happiest if he stayed lost forever against any ordinary mage bagdasares and the wizards of the sorcerers collegium were protection aplenty parsmanios said if you ever pluck my wife and son out of the provinces dont blame them for anything ive done youre in no position to ask favors brother of mine maniakes said parsmanios stared at him stared through him he softened his words a little i wouldnt do anything to them because of you as you say they had nothing to do with your stupidity im not the one who was stupid parsmanios answeredhe had his own measure of the clans stubbornness so many women all through the empire would drop their drawers if you lifted a finger and you had to go and wallow in filth instead even if i failed skotos waits for you maniakes spat on the floor to avert the evil omen shes not my sister and shes not ten years old he said in exasperation but saw he might as well have been talking to the wall he threw his hands in the air fine parsmanios have the last word enjoy it all the way to prista he walked out of the chamber that confined his brother and did not look back a blizzard blew in the next day maniakes had planned to send parsmanios into exile on the instant but realized that might well entail losing not only his brother whom he would not have missed but also a ship and its crewthe videssian sea was a bad risk in wintertime he transferred parsmanios to the prison under the government offices with instructions to the gaoler to keep him apart from the other prisoners when good weather arrived parsmanios would depart after the blizzard eased a fellow with a message from abivard came down to the shore at across carrying a shield of truce upon his being conveyed to the palaces maniakes was less than delighted but also less than surprised to see him the avtokrator turned to kameas who had announced the messengers arrival would you care to place a small wager on the contents of that tube esteemed sir thank you your majesty but no the vestiarios replied i have a more pressing need for every goldpiece currently in my possession he probably had a good many of them in his possession too maniakes wondered how far confiscating his property would go toward making the empire solvent he shook his head annoyed at himself he wasnt that desperatehe hoped he popped the lid off the message tube drew out the parchment inside unrolled it and began to read aloud abivard general to sharbaraz king of kings may his years be many and his realm increase to maniakes falsely styling himself avtokrator of the videssians greetings he hasnt said falsely styling himself avtokrator in a while kameas observed so he hasnt maniakes said and then well i insulted him and sharbaraz in my last letter he coughed i read on whereas the eminent general tzikas who in former days misguidedly gave allegiance to you has now recognized his earlier errors he bids me inform you that he acknowledges the sovereignty over the empire of videssos of hosios avtokrator son of likinios avtokrator and rejects your regime as the vile vain illegitimate and void usurpation it is universally known to be and bids all videssians to do likewise seeing that only in this way shall peace be restored to your land kameas pursed his lips as he considered the message at last he delivered his verdict the content your majesty can hardly be reckoned surprising as for the style i must say i confess to a certain admiration not everyone could have packed so much information into a single grammatically proper sentence if i want literary criticism esteemed sir rest assured i shall ask for it maniakes said of course your majesty the vestiarios said are you then seeking advice as to your proper conduct in response oh no not this time maniakes turned to the messenger who looked miserably cold in a makuraner caftan you speak videssian when the fellow nodded the avtokrator went on i have no written reply for you but tell abivard hes welcome to keep tzikas or kill him however he pleases but if he does decide to keep him hed better not turn his back have you got that yes your majesty the messenger answered his accent strong but understandable he repeated maniakes words back to him maniakes spoke to kameas have him taken west over the cattle crossing if abivard doesnt worry about tzikas more now than while he was holed up in amorion hes a fool that would get back to abivard too maniakes couldnt do anything about his rebellious generals flight not now with a little luck though he could keep abivard from taking full advantage of tzikas and if abivard chose to ignore his warnings which were of course hardly disinterested the makuraner general stood an excellent chance of falling victim to the refugee about whose presence he now boasted kameas escorted the messenger out of maniakes presence when he came back he found the avtokrator sitting with his elbows on his knees his face buried in his hands are you all right your majesty the vestiarios asked anxiously to the ice with me if i know maniakes answered weary beyond anything sleep could cure phos i didnt think tzikas had the nerve to betray me and he went and did it anyhow who knows what will come crashing down on meand down on videssosnext your majesty that is as the author of our fate the lord with the great and good mind shall decree kameas said whatever it may be i am sure you will meet it with your customary resourcefulness resourcefulness is all very well but without resources even resourcefulness struggles in vain maniakes said and genesios curse him was right to ask if id do any better than he at holding back the empires foes so far the answer looks to be no youve done far better at everything else though kameas said videssians no longer war with videssians and the present unpleasantness aside weve not had a single pretender rise against you the empire stands united behind you waiting for our luck to turn except for the peoplemy brother for instancewho stand behind me so i wont see the knife till it goes into my back and the ones who think im an incestuous sinner who ought to be cast into the outer darkness of excommunication and anathema kameas bowed as your majesty appears more inclined today to contemplate darkness than light i shall make no further effort to inject with any undue optimism he glided away maniakes stared after him then started to laugh the vestiarios had a knack for puncturing his pretensions this time he had managed to pack a warning in with his jibe a man who contemplated darkness rather than light was liable to end up contemplating skotos rather than phos as he had when questioning parsmanios maniakes spat on the floor in rejection of the evil god someone tapped on the door lysia i have news i think she said maniakes raised an eyebrow waiting for her to go on she did a little hesitantly ii think im with child i would have waited longer to say anything because its early to be quite sure but her words poured out in a rush you could use good news today oh by phos that is the truth maniakes caught her in his arms may it be so likarios remained his heir but another baby especially one that was his and lysias would be welcome he resolved as he had more than once before to pay more attention to the children he had already fathered he studied lysia with some concern niphone had been thin and frail while his cousin whom he had wed was almost stocky and in full vigorous health nevertheless it will be all right she said as if plucking the alarm from his mind it will be fine of course it will he said knowing it was not of course even so youll see zoile as soon as may be no point waiting lysia might have started to say something whatever it was she thought better of it and contented herself with a nod spring came for maniakes it was not only a season of new leaf and new life as soon as he was reasonably confident no storm would send a ship to the bottom he took parsmanios from the prison under the government offices and sent him off to exile in prista where watching the khamorth travel back and forth with their flocks over the pardrayan steppe was the most exciting sport the locals had maniakes on the other hand watched lysia she was indeed pregnant and proved it by vomiting once every morning whereupon she would be fine till the next day any little thing could touch off the fit one day kameas proudly fetched in a pair of poached eggs lysia started to eat them but bolted for the basin before she took a bite they were looking at me she said darkly after rinsing her mouth out with wine later she broke her fast on plain bread dromons continually patrolled the cattle crossing maniakes watched abivard as well as lysia this spring the makuraner general gave no immediate sign of pulling back from across maniakes worried over that and pondered how to cut abivards long supply lines through the westlands to get him to withdraw but when the blow fell abivard did not strike it etzilios did a ship brought the unwelcome news to videssos the city the kubratoi came past varna and theyre heading south the captain of the merchantman a stocky sunburned fellow named spiridion told maniakes after rising from a clumsy proskynesis oh a pestilence the avtokrator burst out he pointed a finger at spiridion have they come down in their monoxyla again if they have our war galleys will make them sorry but the ship captain shook his head no your majesty this isnt like that last raid i heard about that but the beggars are on horseback this time and looking to steal whats not spiked down and to burn what is when i beat etzilios ill pack his head in salt and send it round to every city in the empire so people can see ive done it maniakes growled down deep in his throat all at once thinking of how fine he would feel to do that to the kubrati khagan he understood what must have gone through genesios vicious mind after disposing of an enemyor of someone he imagined to be an enemy at any rate the comparison was sobering spiridion seemed oblivious to his distress wed be well rid of that khagan yes we would but youve got all these soldiers sitting around eating like theres no tomorrow and pinching the tavern girls isnt it time you got some use from em dont mean to speak too bold but oh yes well fight them maniakes said but if theyre already down past varna well have a busy time pushing them back where they belong where they really belonged was north of the astris not on any territory that had ever belonged to videssos likinios had tried pushing them back onto the eastern edge of the steppe and what had it got him mutiny and death nothing better and now the kubratoi like wolves that scented meat were sharpnosing their way down toward the suburbs of videssos the city maniakes rewarded spiridion with gold he could not afford to spend and sent him on his way that done he knew he ought to have ordered a force out to meet etzilios raiders but hadnt the will to do it on the instant after parsmanios and tzikas had conspired against him he had asked the lord with the great and good mind what could possibly go wrong next by now he told himself bitterly he should have known better than to send forth such questions all too often they had answers a couple of minutes after spiridion left lysia came into the chamber where maniakes sat shrouded in gloom the servants say she began hesitantly he might have known that the servants would say trying to keep anything secret in the imperial residence was like trying to carry water in a sieve everything leaked its true he answered the kubratoi are riding again the good god only knows how well be able to stop them too send out the troops lysia said as if he had complained about a hole in his boot and she had suggested he take it to a cobbler oh i will he said with a long sigh and then ill have the delight of seeing them flee back here to the city with their tails between their legs ive seen that before too many times he sighed again ive seen everything before too many times it wouldnt take more than a couple of coppers to get me to sail off for kalavria and never come back he had said that before when things looked bleak now all at once the idea caught fire within him he could see the mansion up above kastavala could hear the gulls squealing as they whirled overheadoh gulls squealed above videssos the city too but somehow in a much less pleasant tone of voicecould remember riding to the eastern edge of the island and looking out at the sailors sea going on forever the idea of the seas going on forever had a strong appeal for him now if there was no land on the far side of the sailors seafor no one who had ever sailed across it had found any no one that is who had ever come backhe would actually have found one direction from which enemies could not come at him from his present perch in embattled videssos the city the concept struck him as miraculous he took lysias hands in his by the good god lets go back to kastavala things here will sort themselves out one way or another and right now i dont much care which all i want to do is get free of this place do you really think its the best thing you could do lysia said weve talked of this before and i dont care what i said before maniakes broke in the more i think of leaving videssos the city now the better i like it the fleet will hold abivard away from the city come what may and i can command it as well from kastavala as i can right here where i stand now what will your father say lysia asked hell say yes your majesty maniakes answered his father would probably say several other things too most of them pungent he would certainly have something to say about rotrude ill have to deal with her maniakes thought he was surprised lysia hadnt mentioned her and mentally thanked her for her restraint aloud he went on whats the point of being avtokrator if you cant do what you think best can you be avtokrator if you dont hold videssos the city lysia said that had brought him up short the last time he had thought of removing to kastavala now though he said who says i wouldnt hold the city an avtokrator on campaign isnt here but no one rebels against him because of thatwell not usually anyhow and the bureaucrats would stay right where they are he laughed sardonically they dont think they need me to run the empire anyhow theyll be glad for the chance to show theyre right do you truly think this is best lysia asked again if you want to know the truth dear i just dont know maniakes said this much ill tell you though i dont see how going to kalavria could make things much worse than they are now do you put that way maybe not lysia made a wry face that for once had nothing to do with the uncertain stomach her pregnancy had given her it shows what a state weve come to though when we have to put things that way it isnt your fault she added hastily genesios left the empire with too many burdens and not enough of anything with which to lessen them and ive made mistakes of my own maniakes said i trusted etziliosor didnt mistrust him enough however you like i tried to do too much too soon against the makuraners ive been hasty thats what ive been if im operating out of kastavala i wont be able to be hasty news will get to me more slowly and the orders i send will take their time moving too by all the signs that would make things work better than they do now lysia said well perhaps it will be all right with that ringing endorsement maniakes got ready to announce his decision to the wider world themistios the logothete in charge of petitions to the avtokrator was a stout placid fellow most of the time his was a small bureaucratic domain dealing with matters like disputed tax assessments and appeals such as the one the now probably late bizoulinos had submitted now he presented maniakes with an enormous leather sack full of sheets of parchment heres another load your majesty he said theyll be coming into my offices by the dozens every hour too that they will this is the third batch youve given me today eminent sir maniakes said so it is themistios agreed people are upset your majesty thats something you need to know i already had an inkling thanks maniakes said dryly what themistios meant at least in part was that he was upset himself and making no effort to do anything about the flood of petitions begging maniakes to stay in videssos the city except passing them straight on to the avtokrator themistios coughed forgive me for being so frank your majesty but i fear civil unrest may erupt should you in fact implement your decision eminent sir i have no intention of taking all my soldiers with me when i go maniakes answered if civil unrest does pop up i think the garrison will be able to put it down again possibly so your majesty the logothete said but then again possibly not he tapped the pile of petitions as is my duty i have acquainted myself with these and i tell you that a surprising number of them come from soldiers of the garrison they feel your departure abandons them to the none too tender mercies of the men of makuran thats absurd maniakes said the boiler boys can no more get over the cattle crossing than they can fly your majesty is a master of strategy themistios said maniakes looked sharply at him given the number of defeats he had suffered he suspected sarcasm but the logothete seemed sincere he went on simple soldiers will not realize what is obvious to you and if their courage should fail them what they fear may follow and become fact i shall take that chance eminent sir maniakes replied thank you for presenting these petitions to me my preparations for the return to kastavala shall go forward nonetheless themistios muttered something under his breath maniakes waited to see if he would say it out loud and force him to notice it the logothete didnt shaking his head he left the imperial residence the next day kourikos presented himself to the avtokrator after he had risen from his prostration and been granted leave to speak he said your majesty it has come to my attention that you are removing large sums of money in gold silver and precious stones from a treasury that as you must be aware is painfully low on all such riches yes i am eminent sir maniakes said if im going to center the administration at kastavala ill need money to meet my ends but your majesty youll leave too little for videssos the city kourikos exclaimed in dismay why should i care about videssos the city maniakes demanded the logothete of the treasury stared at him that question had never entered kourikos mind for him videssos the city was and always would be the center of the universe as if phos had so ordained in his holy scriptures maniakes went on what have i ever had here except grief and troublefrom you not least eminent sir i shall be glad to see the last of the city and of you i tell you to your face i thought the one who conspired with my brother was you not tzikas nnot i your majesty kourikos stammered he was suddenly seeing that having a family connection to the avtokrator could bring danger as well as advantage ii do not agree with what you have done but i do not seek to harm you or plot against you you are father to my grandchildren after all thats fair enough eminent sir maniakes laughed ruefully its better than ive had from almost anyone else as a matter of fact emboldened kourikos said then you will abandon your unfortunate plan for taking yourself and so much of the empires wealth back to that provincial hinterland whence you came here eh no i wont do anything of the sort eminent sir maniakes said ive had more of videssos the city than i want nothing anyone has told me has given me any reason to change my mind it sounds to me your majesty as if it would take a miracle vouchsafed by the lord with the great and good mind to accomplish that kourikos said yes that might do it maniakes agreed i cant think of much less that would kameas pursed his lips your majesty this is the third time this past week that the most holy ecumenical patriarch agathios has requested an audience with you do you not think you would be wise to confer with him true you are phos viceregent on earth but he heads the holy hierarchy of the temples his words are not to be despised he wont sanction my marriage and he wants to keep me from sailing off to kalavria maniakes answered there now ive said what hell have to say and ive saved myself the time hed take kameas glowered at him there is a time for all things this does not strike me as the time for uncouth levity maniakes sighed he had seen enough on the throne to know that when the vestiarios was blunt enough to use a word like uncouth he needed to be taken seriously very well esteemed sir ill see him but he used to be a flexible man if hes just going to repeat himself he wont get far i shall convey that warning to skombros his synkellos kameas answered and skombros maniakes had no doubt would convey it to agathios the avtokrator got the idea that kameas and skombros probably complemented one another well neither had much formal power each had influence that made his formal insignificance irrelevant when agathios came to the imperial residence a few days later he did not wear the blue boots and pearlencrusted clothofgold vestments to which his rank entitled him to take their place he had on a black robe of mourning and left his feet bare after he rose from his proskynesis he cried your majesty i beg of you do not leave the imperial city the queen of cities a widow by withdrawing the light of your countenance from her thats very pretty most holy sir but you may bawl like a branded calf as much as your heart desires without convincing me i ought to stay maniakes said your majesty agathios gave him a hurt look i am utterly convinced that this move will prove disastrous not only for the city but also for the empire never has an avtokrator abandoned the capital in time of crisis what necessity is there for such a move when we shelter behind our impregnable walls safe from any foe any foe who has no siege engines maniakes interrupted if the makuraners were on this side of the cattle crossing instead of the other one wed be fighting for our lives right now about the only two peaceful stretches of the empire i can think of are prista on the one handwhich is not a place i want to go myselfand kalavria on the other your majesty is this justice agathios said you have borrowed from the temples large sums of gold for the sustenance and defense of the empire and now you seek to abandon videssos beating heart he sketched the suncircle above his own heart what more concessions could we possibly offer you to persuade you to change your mind and return to the course dictated by prudence and reason for a moment maniakes took that as nothing but more rhetoric of the kind the patriarch had already aimed at him then he wondered whether agathios meant what he said only one way to find out i dont know most holy sir what do you offer when he had first come into videssos the city he had watched agathios go from thundering theologian to practical politician in the space of a couple of breaths the shift had bemused him then and bemused him again now cautiously the ecumenical patriarch said you have already taken so many of our treasures that i tremble to offer more your majesty but if our gold would make you remain in the city i might reckon it well spent i appreciate that maniakes said on the whole sincerely its not lack of gold that drives me out of videssos the city though what then agathios asked spreading his hands gold is the chief secular advantage i can confer upon you they looked at each other the patriarch started to raise an admonitory hand before he could maniakes said not all advantages are secular most holy sir if they were wed have no temples you swore to me when you took the throne that you would make no innovations in the faith agathios protested ive never said a word about innovations maniakes answered a dispensation though is something else again your majesty we have been over this ground before agathios said i have explained to you why granting a dispensation for your conduct in regard to this marriage is impracticable thats true most holy sir and ive explained to you why im leaving videssos the city for kalavria maniakes answered but your majesty the cases are not comparable the ecumenical patriarch said i am in conformity with canon law and with longstanding custom while you set established practice on its ear maniakes didnt say anything agathios coughed a couple of times hesitantly he asked are you telling me you might be willing to remain in videssos the city and administer the empire from here following ancient usage should you receive this dispensation im not suggesting anything maniakes stroked his chin it would give me ecclesiastical peace though wouldnt it thats worth something to the ice with me if i know whether its worth staying here in videssos the city though one more midwinters day like the last couple ive had to endure and id be tempted to climb up to the top of the milestone and jump off i too have suffered the jibes of the falsely clever and the smilingly insolent on midwinters day agathios said perhaps you will forgive me for reminding you that should your disagreement with the temples be resolved one potential source of satire for the mime troupes would be eliminated thus making midwinters day shows less likely to distress you yes that is possible the avtokrator admitted since youve said no dispensation is possible though the discussion has little pointwouldnt you agree most holy sir agathios drew himself up to his full if unimpressive height i have the authority to go outside normal forms and procedures if by so doing i can effect some greater good as you know your majesty should iand i speak hypothetically at the moment you must understanddispense you from the usual strictures pertaining to consanguinity would you in turn swear a binding oath similar to the one you gave me at the outset of your reign this one pledging never to abandon videssos the city as the imperial capital maniakes thought then shook his head saying id never do something puts chains around me chains i dont care to wear i would swear never to abandon the city save as a last resort but the definition of what constitutes a last resort would have to remain in my hands no one elses now the patriarch plucked at his bushy beard as he considered let it be as you say he replied in sudden decision you have proved yourself reliable on the whole in matters of your word i do not think you will break it here most holy sir we have a bargain maniakes stuck out his hand agathios took it his grip was hesitant his palm cool he sounded worried as he said those of a rigorist cast of mind will judge me harshly for what i do here today your majesty despite the benefits accruing to the empire from my actions the schism we have discussed on other occasions may well come to pass because of our agreement the rigorists will maintainwill strongly maintaini am yielding to secular pressure here you will know more of ecclesiastical politics and the results of these schisms than i do most holy sir maniakes replied but isnt it so that the side with secular support prevails in them more often than that without as a matter of fact your majesty it is agathios said brightening youll have that support i assure you maniakes told him oh splendid splendid agathios risked a smile and discovered that it fit his face well you shall prepare the oath for me and i the dispensation for you and all will be amicable and you will remain in videssos the city so i will maniakes pointed at the patriarch as something else occurred to him the dispensation will need to have a clause rescinding any penalties youve set for the holy philetos because he performed the marriage ceremony for lysia and me your majesty is loyal to those who serve him agathios observed the smile fading when he spoke again after a moments silence it was as if he was reminding himself such loyalty is a virtue the clause shall appear as you request ill be as loyal to you most holy sir maniakes promised and the patriarch cheered up again maniakes and lysia peered through the grillwork that screened off the imperial niche in the high temple maniakes had stored the parchment with the text of agathios dispensation with other vital state documents he presumed the ecumenical patriarch had done something similar with his written pledge not to abandon videssos the city save under the most dire of circumstances the temple is packed today lysia said sure enough nobles had trouble finding space in the pews because so many common people had come to hear the patriarchs promised proclamation better to let agathios make the announcement than for me to do it maniakes answered if i did it would seem as if i forced the agreement down his throat coming from him itll be a triumph of reason for both sides he started to say more but the congregants below suddenly quieted signaling that the patriarch was making his way to the altar sure enough here came agathios with censerswinging priests of lower rank accompanying him and filling the high temple with sweetsmelling smoke when the patriarch reached the altar he raised his hands to the great stern image of phos in the dome of the high temple the worshipers sitting on all sides of the altar rose behind the screening grillwork so did maniakes and lysia they intoned phos creed along with agathios and the rest of the congregants we bless thee phos lord with the great and good mind by thy grace our protector watchful beforehand that the great test of life may be decided in our favor maniakes took less pleasure in the liturgy than he usually did instead of joining him to his fellow believers throughout the empire today it seemed to separate him from what he really waited for agathios sermon his prayers felt perfunctory springing more from his mouth than from his heart agathios led the worshipers in the creed again then slowly lowered his hands to urge them back into their seats everyone stared intently at him he stood silent milking the moment letting the tension build he should be a mime lysia whispered to maniakes he nodded but waved her to silence rejoice agathios cried suddenly his voice filling the high temple and echoing back from the dome rejoice he repeated in softer tones his majesty the avtokrator has sworn by the lord with the great and good mind to rule the empire of videssos from videssos the city so long as hope remains with us rumor had said as much these past few days but rumor was known to lie for that matter patriarchs were also known to lie but less often the high temple rang with cheers they too came rolling back from the dome filling the huge open space below with sound they love you lysia said they approve of me because im staying maniakes answered shaking his head theyd be howling for my blood if agathios had just told them id be sailing day after tomorrow before lysia could respond to that agathios was continuing surely phos will bless the avtokrator his viceregent on earth for this brave and wise choice and will also pour his blessings down on the queen of cities here so that it remains our imperial capital forevermore so may it be so may it be everyone echoed maniakes voice loud among the rest he tensed as he waited for agathios to go on the patriarch had set forth what he had got from maniakes how would he present what he had given up agathios hesitation this time wasnt to build tension he was like most men he had trouble admitting he had needed to concede anything at last he said his majesty the avtokrator bears a heavy burden and must struggle valiantly to restore videssos fortunes any aid he can find in that struggle is a boon to him we all know of the tragic loss of his wifehis first wifewho died giving birth to likarios his son and heir maniakes frowned it wasnt really the patriarchs business to fix the succession even though what he said agreed with what the avtokrator had established he glanced over at lysia she showed no signs of annoyance maniakes decided to let it go in any case agathios was continuing all this being said on reflection i have determined that a dispensation recognizing and declaring licit in all ways the marriage between his majesty the avtokrator and the empress lysia will serve the empire of videssos without compromising the longestablished holy dogmas of the temples and have accordingly granted them the aforesaid dispensation at his words a priest near the altar set down his thurible and strode out of the high temple presumably in protest out went kourikos and phevronia too the logothete of the treasury was willing to go on working with maniakes but not to be seen approving of his marriage another priest left the high temple and a few more layfolk too but the large majority of worshipers and clerics stayed where they were agathios had not presented his bargain with maniakes as the thisforthat exchange it was at bottom that probably helped reconcile some of the congregants to the arrangement and others would be relieved enough to hear that maniakes was staying in videssos the city that they wouldnt care how agathios had got him to do so the patriarch stood straighter when he saw his announcement was not going to set off riots under the temples dome the liturgy is ended he said and maniakes could almost hear him adding and i got away with it too a buzz of talk rose from the congregants as they made their way out to the mundane world once more maniakes tried to make out what they were saying but had little luck he turned to lysia how does it feel to be my proper wife in the eyes of all well most he thought the clerics in the empire except for morning sickness it feels fine she answered but then it felt fine before too good maniakes said if maniakes stood on the seawall and looked west over the cattle crossing he could see smoke rising from the makuraner armys encampments in across and now if he stood at the northern edge of the capitals land wall he could look north and see smoke rising from the suburbs the kubratoi were burning refugees streamed into videssos the city from the north some in wagons with most of their goods others without even shoes on their feet monasteries and convents did what they could to feed and shelter the fugitives maniakes sent the religious foundations a little gold and a little grain to help them bear the burden that was all he could do with the makuraners holding the westlands and the kubratoi swooping down toward the capital the lands recognizing his authority were straitened indeed he visited a monastery common room for one thing he wanted to show the refugees he knew they were suffering the fervent greetings he got made him uneasily aware of how much power his office held over the hearts and minds and spirits of the videssian people had he sailed off to kalavria they might indeed have lost hopethough he had no intention of ever admitting that to agathios he also wanted to get a feel for what the kubratoi had in mind with their invasion i just saw maybe ten or twenty one man said in a rustic accent didnt wait for no morenot me your majesty i hightailed it fast as i could go saw em out on some flat ground another fellow said they werent bunched up or nothinridin along all kind of higgledypiggledy like they would have got me sure a third man offered his face breaking out in sweat as he recalled his escape only they stopped to kill my pigs and loot my house and so i was able to get away the stories confirmed what maniakes had come to believe from other reports unlike the makuraners the kubratoi did not plan to make any permanent conquests they had swarmed into videssos for loot and rape and destruction and spread themselves thin across the landscape he summoned his father and rhegorios to a council of war if we can catch them before theyre able to concentrate well maul them he said i ask the question you would want me to ask rhegorios said are you looking for us to do more than we can and heres another question along with that one the elder maniakes added so what if we do beat them theyll just scoot back to kubrat faster than we can chase them when they ride north theyll torch whatever they missed burning on the way south even a win seems hardly worth it no thats not so or at least i think i have a way to make it not so the avtokrator pointed to the map of the region north of videssos the city that lay on the table in front of him he talked for some time when he was through the elder maniakes and rhegorios looked at each other if id been so sneaky when i was so young the elder maniakes rumbled id have had the red boots instead of likinios and you lad he pointed at maniakes would be standing around waiting for me to die before maniakes could say anything to that rhegorios declared it all still depends on that first victory what doesnt maniakes said if we do go wrong though well be able to retreat inside the walls of videssos the city we wont be caught in a place where we can be hunted down and slaughtered he slammed his fist onto the tabletop i dont want to think about retreat not now he hit the table again no thats not righti know i need to think about it but i dont want the men to know its ever crossed my mind or else itll be in the back of theirs ah there you come down to the rub the elder maniakes said but youre going to try this scheme of yours maniakes remembered the ambush etzilios had set remembered his failure in the campaign up the valley of the arandos as rhegorios had said he had tried to do too much in both of them was he making the same mistake now he decided it didnt matter i will try it he said we arent strong enough to wrest the westlands away from makuran if we also arent strong enough to keep the kubratoi away from videssos the city i might as well have sailed to kalavria because it would be about the only place our foes couldnt come after me that was one of the reasons i wanted to go there always haloga pirates rhegorios said helpfully thank you so much cousin and brotherinlaw of mine maniakes said does either of you think the risk isnt worth taking if anyone would tell him the truth his father and cousin would they both sat silent maniakes slammed his fist down on the table for a third time well try it sunburst banners flapping in the breeze maniakes army rode forth from the silver gate the avtokrator glanced south toward the practice field where his soldiers had spent so much time at drill this was no drill this was war now he would find out how much the men had learned scouts galloped out ahead of the main body finding the foe would not be hard not at the start of this campaign all maniakes had to do was lead his army toward the thickest smoke he absently wondered why all warriors regardless of their nation so loved to set fires but finding the foe was not the only reason to send out scouts you also wanted to make sure the foe did not find you before you were ready havent been on campaign in a goodish while symvatios said riding up alongside maniakes if you dont do this every year you forget how heavy chainmail getsand im not as young as i used to be not quite he chuckled i expect ill still remember what needs doing though uncle im sorry to have to ask you to come along but im short a couple of senior officers maniakes answered if tzikas has a command these days its on the wrong side and parsmanios he didnt go on that grief wouldnt leave him soon if ever i am a senior officer by the good god symvatios agreed laughing again he had always been more easygoing than the elder maniakes not quite ready for the boneyard though i hope to show you what maniakes hoped was that his uncle would have the sense not to get mixed up in handtohand fighting with barbarous warriors a third his age he didnt say that for fear of piquing symvatios and making him rush into danger to prove he could still meet it bravely towns and nobles villas and estates clustered close to the imperial capital rich pickings for raiders who managed to get so far south the kubratoi had managed maniakes troopers ran into them on the afternoon of the day they had left videssos the city when the scouts came pounding back with the news the first question maniakes asked was are we riding into an ambush no your majesty one of the horsemen assured him the barbariansa couple of hundred of em id guessnever spied us they were busy plundering the little village they were at and theres open country beyond it so nobodys lurking there waiting to jump us all right well hit them maniakes slammed a fist down on the mailcoat that covered his thighs he turned to symvatios hammer and anvil right you are his uncle answered thats the way well be running this whole campaign isnt it he called orders to the regiments he commanded no horn signals now for fear of alerting the foe his detachment peeled off from the main force and rode away to the northeast on a long swing around the hamlet the nomads were looting maniakes made the main force wait half an hour then waved them forward following the scouts he headed almost straight for the kubratiinfested village he swung his troopers slightly westward to come on the kubratoi from the southwest that worked out even better than he had expected for an almond grove screened his approach from the kubratoi only when the first ranks of videssian horsemen rode out from the cover of the trees did the barbarians take alarm their frightened shouts were music to his ears he shouted for music of his own now the trumpeters blared forth the charge a lot of the kubratoi had dismounted several of them stood around waiting their turn with a luckless screaming woman who hadnt been able to flee the fellow who lay atop her at the moment sprang to his feet and tried to run for his steppe pony but tripped over the leather breeches he hadnt fully raised when the first arrow penetrated him he screamed louder than the woman had a couple of more hits and he sagged to the ground once more and lay still arrows came back toward the videssians too but not many most of the nomads who were on horseback or could get to their ponies rode away from the oncoming imperial force as fast as they could push them maniakes called to his men dont let them think of anything but running run the kubratoi did a lot of them outdistanced their pursuers too for the boiled leather they wore was lighter than the videssians ironmongery and then from straight ahead of them more videssian horn calls rang out the nomads cried out in dismay in running from maniakes horsemen they had run right into the soldiers symvatios commanded trapped between the two videssian forces the kubratoi fought as best they could but were quickly overwhelmed maniakes hoped they had perished to the last man but knew how unlikely that was he had to assume a couple of them had escaped to warn their fellows he was in the field as fights went it wasnt much and maniakes knew it the videssian army though had been without victories for so long that even a tiny one made the soldiers feel as if they had just sacked mashiz they sat around the campfires that evening drinking rough wine from the supply wagons and talking in quick excited voices about what they had doneeven if a lot of them in truth had done very little hammer and anvil symvatios said lifting a clay mug to maniakes in salute maniakes drank with his uncle kameas had wanted to pack some fine vintages for him this time he hadnt let the vestiarios get away with it wine that snarled when it hit the palate was what you were supposed to drink when you took the field if nothing else it made you mean we have to do this three more times i think the avtokrator said if we manage that he let the sentence hang there fate had delivered too many blows to videssos for him to risk tempting it now he drained his mug and said you made a fine anvil uncle aye well my hard head suits me to the role symvatios replied laughing he quickly grew more serious we wont be able to work it the same way in every fight you know the ground will be different the kubratoi will be a little more alert than they were today itll get harder i know that maniakes said im glad we had an easy first one thats all what we have to do is make sure that we dont do anything stupid and give the kubratoi an edge they shouldnt have youve got enough scouts and sentries out and youve posted them far enough away from our camp symvatios said the only way etzilios could surprise us would be to fall out of the sky good maniakes cast a wary eye heavenward symvatios laughed again the avtokrator didnt about noon the next day the scouts came upon a goodsized band of kubratoi this time they were seenand pursued some fought a rearguard action while others brought the news to maniakes he listened to them then turned to symvatios move up with your detachment he said make as if youre at the head of the whole army while theyre engaging you ill swing wide and try to take them in flank his uncle saluted well see how it goes your majesty a sideways hammer blow but i think a good one my guess is the nomads dont yet know how many men weve put in the field i think youre right maniakes said with luck youll fool them into believing youre at the head of the whole force once theyre well engaged with you banners flapping and horns blaring symvatios led his detachment forward to support the videssian scouts maniakes hung back and swung off to the east using low scrubbily wooded hills to screen his men from the notice of the nomads less than an hour passed before a rider galloped over to let him know the kubratoi were locked in combat with symvatios troopers theres enough to give them a hard time too your majesty the fellow said plenty of eastwest tracks ran through the hills this close to videssos the city roads crisscrossed the land like spiderwebs maniakes divided his force into three columns to get all his men through as fast as he could again he sent scouting parties ahead to make sure the kubratoi werent lying in wait in the woods even after the scouts went through safe his head swiveled back and forth watching the oaks and elms and ashes for concealed nomads all three columns came through the hill country unmolested there on the flat farm country ahead the kubratoi were trading arrows and swordstrokes with symvatios detachment the nomads were trying to wheel around to symvatios right he was having trouble shifting enough men fast enough to defend against them as the messenger had said the kubratoi were there in considerable force their outflanking maneuver though left them between symvatios troopers and maniakes emerging army the avtokrator heard the shouts of dismay that went up from them when they realized as much his own men shouted too hearing his name burst as a war cry from thousands of throats made excitement surge through him as if he had had too much of the rough camp wine the kubratoi tried to break off their fight with symvatios men and flee but the soldiers from the detachment pressed them hard and then maniakes men were on them shooting arrows flinging javelins and slashing with swords the videssians fought more ferociously than they had since the days of likinios now almost ten years gone the kubratoi scattered before them madly galloping in all different directions trying to escape maniakes called a halt to the pursuit only when darkness began to render it dangerous like lions they fought symvatios exclaimed as they made camp like lions i remembered they could but i hadnt seen it in so long id started to have doubts and i maniakes agreed nothing like the sight of the enemys back to make you think youre a hero is there aye thats a sovereign remedy symvatios said not far away a wounded man groaned and bit back a scream as a surgeon dug out an arrowhead symvatios jubilation ebbed heroing doesnt come free worse luck what does maniakes said to which his uncle spread his hands the avtokrator went on etzilios will know were out and after him no way now he can help but know it hes used to beating us too we may not have two fights ahead of us before we put our plan to the full test we may have only one behooves us to win that one too so it does symvatios said now that you mention it yes maniakes answered dryly if we lose theres not much point to the rest is there the videssian army pressed north unchallenged for the next day and a half they overran a few small bands of kubratoi but most of the nomads seemed to have already fled before them the relative tranquility did not ease maniakes mind somewhere ahead or off to one flank etzilios waited when the army moved a cloud of scouts surrounded it to the front and rear and either side if etzilios wanted to strike he could he would not take maniakes by surprise doing it whenever the army approached woods the avtokrator sent whole companies of troopers probing into them he was beginning to believe his men would keep on fighting well but he wanted them to do it on his terms not those of the khagan of kubrat a scout came riding back toward him alongside the cavalryman was a fellow in peasant homespun riding a donkey that had seen better days the scout nudged the farmer who said your majesty uh and then couldnt go on made modest or awestruck or perhaps just frightened at the prospect of addressing his sovereign the scout spoke for him your majesty hes fleeing from the northwest he told me all the kubratoi in the worldthats what he saidwere gathering close by his plot of land and he didnt care to stay around to find out what they would do the trooper chuckled cant say as i blame him either nor i maniakes turned to the peasant where is your plot how far had you come before the soldier found you when the farmer still proved incapable of speech the trooper once more answered for him hes well south of varna your majesty we cant be more than half a days ride from the nomads well halt here then maniakes declared hearing his words the trumpeters who rode close by him blared out the order to stop maniakes told the peasant a pound of gold for your news thank you your majesty the fellow cried money loosening his tongue where everything else had failed maniakes and symvatios huddled together do you think your men can feign a retreat from the kubratoi and then turn around and fight when the time comes the avtokrator asked i think so his uncle answered you want to make the fight here do you the ground is goodopen enough so they cant try much in the way of trickery and if things go wrong well have a real line of retreat open aye though i dont want to think about things going wrong maniakes said my notion was that if i pick the ground here ill be able to set up the toys the engineers have along in their wagons no chance for that if etzilios is the one paying the flute player there youre right symvatios said so what will you want me to do tomorrow ride ahead find the kubratoi and then flee back to you as if id fouled my breeches like a mimeshow actor thats the idea maniakes agreed my hope is etzilios will figure us for cowards at heart my other hope is that hes wrong would be nice wouldnt it symvatios said if your boys see mine running and take off with them the kubratoi will chase us all back to videssos the city laughing their heads off and shooting arrows into us every mile of the way its happened before dont remind me maniakes said remembering his own flight from etzilios tomorrow though the good god willing theyll be the ones who run as he had every night since setting out from the capital he strung sentries out all around the camp he wouldnt have put a night attack past the kubrati khagan come to that he wouldnt have put anything past him dew was still on the grass and the air was crisp and cool when symvatios and his detachment rode north as proudly and ostentatiously as if they were the whole of the videssian army maniakes arranged the rest of the force in line of battle with a gap in the center for symvatios men to fill he had plenty of time to brief the troopers and explain what he thought would happen when symvatios men came back while he spoke engineers unloaded their wagons and assembled their machines with tackle they had brought up from the city when they asked it of him maniakes detailed a cavalry company to help them then there was nothing to do but wait eat whatever iron rations they had stowed in their saddlebags and drink bad wine from canteen or skin the day turned hot and muggy as maniakes had known it would sweat ran into his eyes burning like blood under his surcoat under his gilded mailshirt under the quilted padding he wore beneath it he felt as if he had just gone into the hot room of the baths scouts rode out of the forest ahead spurring their horses toward him their shouts rang thin over the open ground theyre coming maniakes waved to the trumpeters who blew alert up and down the line men reached for their weapons maniakes drew his sword sunlight sparkled off the blade here came symvatios and his men maniakes heart leapt into his throat when he spied his uncle who had a bloodstained rag tied round his head but symvatios waved at him to show the wound was not serious he shouldnt have been fighting at all but maniakes breathed easier symvatios rearguard turned in the saddle to shoot arrows at the kubratoi behind them the nomads seemed taken aback to discover more videssians athwart their path but kept on galloping after symvatios men their harsh guttural shouts put maniakes in mind of so many wild beasts but they were more clever and deadly than any mere animals maniakes waited till he spied etzilios standard and assured himself the khagan was not hanging back then he shouted videssos and waved his troopers into the fight at the same instant symvatios and his hornplayers ordered a rally from his fleeing detachments for a dreadful moment maniakes feared they would not find it videssian armies had done so much real retreating all through his reign and genesios before itcould the detachment once heading away from the foe remember its duty or would it be doomed to repeat the disasters of the past he shouted with joy as behind the screen of the rearguard symvatios troopers reined in turned their horses and faced the kubratoi once more fresh flights of arrows arced toward the nomads off on either wing the catapults the engineers had assembled hurled great stones at the onrushing barbarians one of them squashed a horse like a man kicking a rat with his boot another took the head from a kubrati as neatly as an executioners sword might have done still clutching his bow he rode on for several strides of his horse before falling from the saddle of themselves the blows the stonethrowers struck were pinpricks and only a few pinpricks at that but the kubratoi were used to facing death from javelins or swords not so from flying boulders maniakes saw them waver and also saw their discomfiture at symvatios rally videssos he shouted again and then charge the horns screamed out that command his men shouted too as they spurred their horses toward the kubratoi some like maniakes shouted the name of their empire more though shouted his name when he heard that the sword in his hand quivered like a live thing the nomads special skill was shifting from attack to retreator the other way roundat a moments notice but the kubratoi at the rear were still pressing forward while the ones at the fore tried to wheel and go back the videssians mounted on bigger heavier horses and wearing stronger armor got in among them and thrashed them as they had not been thrashed in years see how it feels etzilios maniakes shouted slashing his way toward the khagans horsetail standard see how it feels to be fooled and trapped and beaten he all but howled the last word a nomad cut at him he turned the blow on his shield and gave one back the kubrati carried only a tiny leather target he blocked that first stroke with it but a second laid his shoulder open maniakes heard his cry of pain but rode past and never knew how he fared after that all at once the entire nomad host realized the snare into which they had rushed etzilios felt no shame at fleeing the kubratoi were remorselessly practical at war and waged it for what they could get if all they were getting was a drubbing time enough to pull back and try again when chances looked better the usual videssian practice was to let them go once the main engagement was won the better to avoid sudden and unpleasant reversals pursue maniakes yelled now dog them like hounds dont let them regroup dont let them get away today well give them what they earned for invading us the nomads pursuit from imbros down to videssos the city had chewed his force to bits and swallowed most of the bits that was what he wanted to emulate now he soon saw it was too much to ask of his men because they were more heavily accoutered than the kubratoi they were also slower and unlike etzilios warriors they were used to keeping to their formations rather than breaking up to fight as individuals thus the slower troopers held back those who might have been faster so they did not destroy the kubrati host they did hurt the invaders running down wounded men men on wounded horses and those luckless enough to be riding nags that simply could not run fast and every so often etzilios rearguard tried to gain some space between the rest of the kubratoi and the videssians the imperial army rode over them like the tide rolling up the beach near kastavala maniakes hated to see the sun sink low in the west shall we camp your majesty soldiers called still seeking routine though they had broken it by beating the kubratoi instead of shattering at the nomads onslaught well ride on a while after dark the avtokrator answered you can bet the kubratoi wont be resting not tonight they wont theyll want to get as far away from us as they can and do you know what were not going to let them we wont let them ambush us in the blackness either well have plenty of scouts and well go slower but well keep going and keep going they did sometimes dozing in the saddle sometimes waking to fight short savage clashes with foes they could scarcely see maniakes was glad when his horse splashed into a stream the cold water on his legs helped revive him when dawn touched the eastern sky with gray symvatios looked around and said weve outrun the supply wagons we wont starve in the next day or two maniakes answered anyone who doesnt have some bread or cheese or sausage or olives with him is a fool anyhow he glanced over at his uncle the bandage made symvatios look something like a veteran something like a derelict how did you pick that up by the time we get back to videssos the city ill have a fine heroic scar symvatios answered right now i just feel like a twit one of my troopers was hacking away at a kubrati in front of him and when he drew back his sword for another strokewell my fool head got in the way laid me open as neat as if a cursed nomad had done it i wont tell if you dont maniakes promised you ought to be able to bribe the trooper into keeping his mouth shut too they both laughed laughing maniakes discovered came easy when you were moving forward the pursuit went more slowly than it had the day before troopers had to go easy on their horses for fear of foundering them the kubratoi gained ground on the imperials for some of them in nomad fashion had remounts available etzilios kept on fleeing though now he led the men who had been surprised and beaten and who wanted no more of their foes then toward late afternoon a scout galloped back to maniakes the fellow urged on his mount as if it had left the stable not a quarter of an hour before your majesty he cried and then again your majesty he delivered his news with a great shout the kubratoi up ahead theyre fighting by the good god maniakes said softly he glanced over to symvatios the bandage had slipped down so it almost covered one of his uncles eyes giving him a distinctly piratical air symvatios clenched his right hand into a fist and laid it over his heart in salute maniakes turned and spoke to the trumpeters blow pursuit once more now we give all the effort we have in us if we can get to the battlefield fast enough the kubratoi will take a blow theyll be a long time getting over martial music rang out tired men spurred tired horses from walks up to trots they checked their quivers few had many arrows left the nomads would be in the same straits maniakes wished the supply wagons could have kept up with his host if they had he would have poured arrows into etzilios men till night made him stop to his initial startlement a band of nomads charged straight back toward his forces symvatios figured out what that meant shouting etzilios knows hes in the smithys shop are we going to let him keep the hammer from coming down on the anvil one last time no the videssian soldiers roared they were no more enthusiastic about exposing their bodies to wounds than any men of sense would have been but since they had chosen that trade they did not want their risks to be to no purpose they surged forward against the kubratoi who badly outnumbered were soon overwhelmed up ahead maniakes saw the rest of the nomads battling a force under sunburst banners deployed directly across their line of retreat hammer and anvil he cried echoing his uncle now we come down the wail of despair that rose when the kubratoi spied his force was music to his ears he spurred his horse into a shambling gallop the first kubrati he met cut at him once missed then set spur to his own pony and did his best to escape a videssian who still had arrows brought him down as if he were a fleeing fox maniakes shouted the videssians who kept the kubratoi from escaping to the north rhegorios maniakes shouted back and his troopers took up the call now that maniakes men had reached the field his cousin instead of merely holding the nomads at bay pressed hard against them rhegorios soldiers were fresh and rested and mounted on horses that hadnt been going hard for a day and a night and most of another day their quivers were full they struck with a force out of proportion to their numbers all at once the kubratoi opposing them made the fatal transition from army to frightened mob each man looking no farther than toward what might keep his uniquely precious self alive another few minutes in that moment of dissolution maniakes looked round the field for the horsetail that marked etzilios position he wanted to serve the khagan as he had nearly been served south of imbros if he could kill or capture the leader of the kubratoi the nomads might fight among themselves for years over the succession he saw nothing to show etzilios place as he himself had while fleeing from the kubrati ambush the khagan had abandoned the symbol of his station to give himself a better chance of keeping it five pounds of gold to the man who brings me etzilios alive or dead the avtokrator cried though the battle was won and won crushingly a good many kubratoi managed to squeeze out from between maniakes force and rhegorios then the light began to fail which allowed more escapes no one led etzilios in bonds before maniakes or rode up carrying the khagans dripping head maniakes wondered whether he lay anonymously dead on the field or had succeeded in getting away time would tell at the moment in the midst of triumph his fate seemed a small thing here came rhegorios his handsome face wearing a smile as bright as the sun now setting we did it he cried and embraced maniakes by phos we did it hammer and anvil and crushed them between us i have two anvilsfather and son maniakes waved to symvatios who sat his horse close by so much hope going into this campaign i had to hope wed win down south of here win hard enough and often enough to make the nomads decide pulling back would be a good idea and then i had to hope youd put your men in the right spot after thrax and the fleet carried you up the coast to varna i almost didnt rhegorios said the scouts i had out farthest ran up against the kubratoi fleeing first and fastest i had to hustle the lads along to get em where theyd do the most good in time for them to do it but we managed he waved to show the victory videssian arms had won like most triumphs this one was better contemplated in song and chronicle than in person twilight started to veil the aftermath of battle but did not completely cover it not yet men and horses lay still and silent in death or twisting in the agony of wounds and screaming their pain to the unhearing sky the stink of blood and sweat and shit filled maniakes nostrils hopeful crows hopped not far away waiting to feast on the banquet of carrion spread before them healerpriests and ordinary physicians and horseleeches strode across the battlefield doing what they could for injured videssians and animals other men these still in armor traveled the field too making sure all the kubratoi on it would never rise from it again maniakes wondered if the scavengers could tell the difference between the men who gave them less to eat and those who gave them more may i share your tent tonight he asked rhegorios mine isback there somewhere he waved vaguely southward toward the outrun baggage train rhegorios grinned at him again any man would share with his brotherinlaw any man would share with his cousin any man would share with his sovereign and since i can do all three at once and put only one extra man in my tent how can i say no can you spare some space in that crowd of people for your poor feeble father as well symvatios said despite the bandage he didnt look feeble he wasnt quite the cool calculator the elder maniakes was but he had led his troops bravely and done everything the avtokrator asked of him a lot of officers half his age couldnt approach his standard rhegorios cooks got fires going and stewpots bubbling above them hot stew went down wonderfully well after the two hard days just ended maniakes sat on the ground inside rhegorios tentafter some argument he and rhegorios had persuaded symvatios to take the cot in thereand sipped at a mug of wine he hoped it wouldnt put him to sleep or at least not yet having won his victory he wanted to hash it over too most important is that the men stood and fought rhegorios said we couldnt know whether they would till we took em out and tried em they didnt waste all that time on the practice field thats so maniakes said nodding from the cot symvatios let out a snore he hadnt wanted to fall asleep any more than he had wanted to accept the cot but however willing his spirit his flesh was far from young maniakes glanced over at him affectionately then went on the other important thing we did was land your men behind the kubratoi that turned what would have been a victory into a rout i wonder if we got etzilios it was a fine idea rhegorios answered the nomads are nothing to speak of on the sea i wish we had run up against some of those little pirate boats of theirs those monoxyla thraxs dromons would have smashed em to kindling and we wouldnt have landed an hour late maniakes plucked at his beard the makuraners havent much in the way of ships either he remarked and then paused to listen to what he had just said thoughtfully he went on weve taken advantage of that in small ways already landing raiders in the westlands and so forth but we could move along the coasts by sea faster than abivard could shift his forces by land trying to keep up with us we could provided we have troops who wont piss their drawers the first time the boiler boys come thundering down on them rhegorios said then he too looked thoughtful were on our way to getting troops like that arent we either were on our way or else we have them now maniakes said going over the cattle crossing and ramming headlong into the makuraners always struck me as the wrong way to go about clearing them from the westlands and a good recipe for getting beat to boot now maybe we have another choice no guarantees rhegorios said maniakes laugh held a bitter edge what in life has any guarantees he remembered niphones face pale and still as she lay in her sarcophagus you do as well as you can for as long as you can if were not going to let the makuraners keep the westlands well have to drive them out making them move to respond to us would be a pleasant change dont you think you get no arguments from me there rhegorios answered id love to see them scurrying about instead of us can we do it this summer do you think i dont know maniakes said well have to go back to videssos the city and see how long well need to refit how many men we can pull together how many ships we have wed have a surer chance of doing it if etzilios hadnt jumped on us curse him you may end up thanking him one of these days rhegorios said you might never have come up with this idea if he hadnt invaded there is that the avtokrator admitted sooner or later though i think i would have its the best choice weve got it may be the only choice weve got whether its good enoughwell find out the end
