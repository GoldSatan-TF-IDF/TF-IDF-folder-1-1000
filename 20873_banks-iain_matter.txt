matter by iain m banks for adèle with thanks to everybody who helped adèle les mic simon tim roger gary lara and dave le taxi prologue a light breeze produced a dry rattling sound from some nearby bushes it lifted delicate little veils of dust from a few sandy patches nearby and shifted a lock of dark hair across the forehead of the woman sitting on the wood and canvas camp chair which was perched not quite level on a patch of bare rock near the edge of a low ridge looking out over the scrub and sand of the desert in the distance trembling through the heat haze was the straight line of the road some scrawny trees few taller than one man standing on anothers shoulders marked the course of the dusty highway further away tens of kilometres beyond the road a line of dark jagged mountains shimmered in the baking air by most human standards the woman was tall slim and well muscled her hair was short and straight and dark and her skin was the colour of pale agate there was nobody of her specific kind within several thousand light years of where she sat though if there had been they might have said that she was somewhere between being a young woman and one at the very start of middle age they would however have thought she looked somewhat short and bulky she was dressed in a pair of wide loosefitting pants and a thin coollooking jacket both the same shade as the sand she wore a wide black hat to shade her from the late morning sun which showed as a harsh white point high in the cloudless pale green sky she raised a pair of very old and wornlooking binoculars to her nightdark eyes and looked out towards the point where the desert road met the horizon to the west there was a folding table to her right holding a glass and a bottle of chilled water a small backpack lay underneath she reached out with her free hand and lifted the glass from the table sipping at the water while still looking through the ancient field glasses theyre about an hour away said the machine floating to her left the machine looked like a scruffy metal suitcase it moved a little in the air rotating and tipping as though looking up at the seated woman and anyway it continued you wont see much at all with those museum pieces she put the glass down on the table again and lowered the binoculars they were my fathers she said really the drone made a sound that might have been a sigh a screen flicked into existence a couple of metres in front of the woman filling half her field of view it showed from a point a hundred metres above and in front of its leading edge an army of men some mounted most on foot marching along another section of the desert highway all raising dust which piled into the air and drifted slowly away to the southeast sunlight glittered off the edges of raised spears and pikes banners flags and pennants swayed above the army filled the road for a couple of kilometres behind the mounted men at its head bringing up the rear were baggage carts covered and open wagons wheeled catapults and trebuchets and a variety of lumbering wooden siege engines all pulled by dark powerfullooking animals whose sweating shoulders towered over the men walking at their sides the woman tutted put that away yes maam the machine said the screen vanished the woman looked through the binoculars again using both hands this time i can see their dust she announced and another couple of scouts i think astounding the drone said she placed the field glasses on the table pulled the brim of her hat down over her eyes and settled back in the camp seat folding her arms and stretching her booted feet out crossed at the ankle having a snooze she told the drone from beneath the hat wake me when its time just you make yourself comfortable there the drone told her mmhmm turminder xuss drone offensive watched the woman djan seriy anaplian for a few minutes monitoring her slowing breathing and her gradually relaxing musclestate until it knew she was genuinely asleep sweet dreams princess it said quietly reviewing its words immediately the drone was completely unable to determine whether a disinterested observer would have detected any trace of sarcasm or not it checked round its halfdozen previously deployed scout and secondary knife missiles using their sensors to watch the still distant approaching army draw slowly closer and to monitor the various small patrols and individual scouts the army had sent out ahead of it for a while it watched the army move from a certain perspective it looked like a single great organism inching darkly across the tawny sweep of desert something segmented hesitant bits of it would come to a stop for no obvious reason for long moments before starting off again so that it seemed to shuffle rather than flow en masse but determined unarguably fixed in its onward purpose and all on their way to war the drone thought sourly to take and burn and loot and rape and raze what sullen application these humans devoted to destruction about half an hour later when the front of the army was hazily visible on the desert highway a couple of kilometres to the west a single mounted scout came riding along the top of the ridge straight towards where the drone kept vigil and the woman slept the man showed no sign of having seen through the camouflage field surrounding their little encampment but unless he changed course he was going to ride right into them the drone made a tutting noise very similar to the one the woman had made earlier and told its nearest knife missile to spook the mount the pencilthin shape came darting in effectively invisible and jabbed the beast in one flank so that it screamed and jerked nearly unseating its rider as it veered away down the shallow slope of ridge towards the road the scout shouted and swore at his animal reining it in and turning its broad snout back towards the ridge some distance beyond the woman and the drone they galloped away leaving a thin trail of dust hanging in the nearstill air djan seriy anaplian stirred sat up a little and looked out from under her hat what was all that she asked drowsily nothing go back to sleep hmm she relaxed again and a minute later was quietly snoring the drone woke her when the head of the army was almost level with them it bobbed its front at the body of men and animals a kilometre distant while anaplian was still yawning and stretching the boys are all here it told her indeed they are she lifted the binoculars and focused on the very front of the army where a group of men rode mounted on especially tall colourfully caparisoned animals these men wore high plumed helmets and their polished armour glittered brightly in the glare theyre all very parade ground anaplian said its like theyre expecting to bump into somebody out here they need to impress god the drone suggested the woman was silent for a moment hmm she said eventually she put the field glasses down and looked at the drone shall we merely say the word anaplian looked back at the army took a deep breath and said very well let us do this the drone made a little dipping motion like a nod a small hatch opened in its side a cylinder perhaps four centimetres wide and twentyfive long shaped like a sort of conical knife rolled lazily into the air then darted away keeping close to the ground and accelerating quickly towards the rear of the column of men animals and machines it left a trail of dust for a moment before it adjusted its altitude anaplian lost sight of its camouflaged shape almost immediately the drones aura field invisible until now glowed rosily for a moment or two this it said should be fun the woman looked at it dubiously there arent going to be any mistakes this time are there certainly not the machine said crisply want to watch it asked her i mean properly not through those antique opera glasses anaplian looked at the machine through narrowed eyes for a little then said slowly all right the screen blinked into existence just to one side of them this time so that anaplian could still see the army in the distance with the naked eye the screen view was from some distance behind the great column now and much lower than before dust drifted across the view thats from the trailing scout missile turminder xuss said another screen flickered next to the first this is from the knife missile itself the camera in the knife missile registered the tiny machine scudding past the army in a blur of men uniforms and weapons then showed the tall shapes of the wagons war machines and siege engines before banking sharply after the tail end of the army was passed the rushing missile stooped taking up a position a kilometre behind the rear of the army and a metre or so above the road surface its speed had dropped from nearsupersonic to something close to that of a swiftly flying bird it was closing rapidly with the rear of the column ill synch the scout to the knife follow it in behind the drone said in moments the flat circular base of the knife missile appeared as a dot in the centre of the scout missiles view then expanded until it looked like the smaller machine was only a metre behind the larger one there go the warps xuss said sounding excited see two arrowhead shapes one on either side detached from the knife missiles body swung out and disappeared the monofilament wires which still attached each of the little warps to the knife missile were invisible the view changed as the scout missile pulled back and up showing almost the whole of the army ahead ill get the knife to buzz the wires the drone said what does that mean vibrates them so that whatever the monofils go through itll be like getting sliced by an implausibly sharp battleaxe rather than the worlds keenest razor the drone said helpfully the screen displaying what the scout missile could see showed a tree a hundred metres behind the last trundling wagon the tree jerked and the top threequarters slid at a steep angle down the sloped stump that was the bottom quarter before toppling to the dust that took a flick the drone said glowing briefly rosy again and sounding amused the wagons and siege engines filled the view coming from the knife missile the first bits actually the trickiest the fabric roofs of the covered wagons rose into the air like released birds tensed hoops of wood cut sprang apart the giant solid wheels of the catapults trebuchets and siege engines shed their top sections on the next revolution and the great wooden structures thudded to a halt the top halves of some of them also cut through jumping forward with the shock armthick lengths of rope wound rocktight a moment earlier burst like released springs then flopped like string the scout missile swung between the felled and wrecked machines as the men in and around the wagons and siege engines started to react the knife missile powered onwards towards the foot soldiers immediately ahead it plunged into the mass of spears pikes pennant poles banners and flags scything through them in a welter of sliced wood falling blades and flapping fabric anaplian caught glimpses of a couple of men slashed or skewered by falling pikeheads bound to be a few casualties the drone muttered bound to be the woman said the knife missile was catching glimpses of confused faces as men heard the shouts of those behind them and turned to look the missile was a halfsecond away from the rear of the mass of mounted men and roughly level with their necks when the drone sent are you sure we cant positive anaplian replied inserting a sigh into what was an entirely nonverbal exchange just stick to the plan the tiny machine nudged up a halfmetre or so and tore above the mounted men catching their plumed helmets and chopping the gaudy decorations off like a harvest of motley stalks it leapt over the head of the column leaving consternation and fluttering plumage in its wake then it zoomed heading skywards the following scout missile registered the monofil warps clicking back into place in the knife missiles body before it swivelled rose and slowed to look back at the whole army again it was anaplian thought a scene of entirely satisfactory chaos outrage and confusion she smiled this was an event of such rarity that turminder xuss recorded the moment the screens hanging in the air disappeared the knife missile reappeared and swung into the offered hatchway in the side of the drone anaplian looked out over the plain to the road and the halted army many casualties she asked smile disappearing sixteen or so the drone told her about half will likely prove fatal in time she nodded still watching the distant column of men and machines oh well indeed turminder xuss agreed the scout missile floated up to the drone and also entered via a side panel still the drone said sounding weary we should have done more should we yes you ought to have let me do a proper decapitation no anaplian said just the nobles the drone said the guys right at the front the ones who came up with their spiffing war plans in the first place no the woman said again rising from her seat and turning folding it she held it in one hand with the other she lifted the old pair of binoculars from the table module coming overhead the drone told her it moved round her and picked up the camp table placing the glass and water bottle inside the backpack beneath just the two nasty dukes and the king anaplian held on to her hat as she looked straight up squinting briefly in the sunlight until her eyes adjusted no this is not i trust some kind of transferred familial sentimentality the drone said with halfpretended distaste no the woman said watching the shape of the module ripple in the air a few metres away turminder xuss moved towards the module as its rear door hinged open and are you going to stop saying no to me all the time anaplian looked at it expressionless never mind the drone said sighing it bobnodded towards the open module door after you the expeditionary factory the place had to be some sort of old factory or workshop or something there were big toothed metal wheels half buried in the wooden floors or hanging by giant spindles from the network of iron beams overhead canvas belts were strung all over the dark spaces connecting smaller smooth wheels and a host of long complicated machines he thought might be something to do with weaving or knitting it was all very dusty and grimylooking and yet this had been that modern thing a factory how quickly things decayed and became useless normally he would never have considered going anywhere near some place so filthy it might not even be safe he thought even with all the machinery stilled one gable wall was partially collapsed bricks tumbled planks splintered rafters hanging disjointed from above he didnt know if this was old damage from deterioration and lack of repair or something that had happened today during the battle in the end though he hadnt cared what the place was or had been it was somewhere to escape to a place to hide well to regroup to recover and collect himself that put a better gloss on it not running away he told himself just staging a strategical retreat or whatever you called it outside the rollstar pentrl having passed over the horizon a few minutes earlier it was slowly getting dark through the breach in the wall he could see sporadic flashes and hear the thunder of artillery the crump and bellowing report of shells landing uncomfortably close by and the sharp busy rattle of small arms fire he wondered how the battle was going they were supposed to be winning but it was all so confusing for all he knew they were on the brink of complete victory or utter defeat he didnt understand warfare and having now experienced its practice first hand had no idea how people kept their wits about them in a battle a big explosion nearby made the whole building tremble he whimpered as he crouched down pressing himself still further into the dark corner he had found on the first floor drawing his thick cloak over his head he heard himself make that pathetic weak little sound and hated himself for it breathing under the cloak he caught a faint odour of dried blood and faeces and hated that too he was ferbin otz aelshhauskr a prince of the house of hausk son of king hausk the conqueror and while he was his fathers son he had not been raised to be like him his father gloried in war and battle and dispute had spent his entire life aggressively expanding the influence of his throne and his people always in the name of the worldgod and with half an eye on history the king had raised his eldest son to be like him but that son had been killed by the very people they were fighting perhaps for the last time today his second son ferbin had been schooled in the arts not of war but of diplomacy his natural place was supposed to be in the court not the parade ground fencing stage or firing range still less the battlefield his father had known this and even if he had never been as proud of ferbin as he had of elime his murdered first son he had accepted that ferbins skill you might even term it his calling ferbin had thought more than once lay in the arts of politicking not soldiering it was anyway what his father had wanted the king had been looking forward to a time when the martial heroics he had had to undertake to bring this new age about would be seen for the rude necessities they had been he had wanted at least one of his sons to fit easily into a coming era of peace prosperity and contentment where the turning of a pretty phrase would have more telling effect than the twisting of a sword it was not his fault ferbin told himself that he was not cut out for war it was certainly not his fault that realising he might be about to die at any moment he had felt so terrified earlier and even less to his discredit that he had lost control of his bowels when that yilim chap he had been a major or a general or something had been obliterated by the cannon shot dear god the man had been talking to him when he was just gone cut in half their small group had ridden up to a low rise for a better look at the battle this was a modestly insane thing to do in the first place ferbin had thought at the time exposing them to enemy spotters and hence to still greater risk than that from a random artillery shell for one thing hed chosen a particularly outstanding mersicor charger as his mount that morning from the abroadtents of the royal stables a pure white beast with a high and proud aspect which he thought he would look well on only to discover that generalmajor yilims choice of mount obviously pitched in the same direction for he rode a similar charger now he thought about it and oh the number of times hed had cause to use that phrase or one of its cousins at the start of some explanation in the aftermath of yet another embarrassment ferbin wondered at the wisdom of riding on to an exposed ridge with two such conspicuous beasts he had wanted to say this but then decided he didnt know enough about the procedures to be followed in such matters actually to speak his mind and anyway he hadnt wanted to sound like a coward perhaps majorgeneral or generalmajor yilim had felt insulted that hed been left out of the frontline forces and asked instead to look after ferbin keeping him close enough to the action so that hed later be able to claim that hed been there at the battle but not so close that he risked actually getting involved with any fighting from the rise when they achieved it they could see the whole sweep of the battleground from the great tower ahead in the distance over the downland spreading out from the kilometreswide cylinder and up towards their position on the first fold of the low hills that carried the road to pourl itself the sarl capital city lay behind them barely visible in the misty haze a shortdays ride away this was the ancient county of xilisk and these were the old playgrounds of ferbin and his siblings long depopulated lands turned into royal parks and hunting grounds filled with overgrown villages and thick forests now all about their crumpled riven geography sparkled with the fire of uncounted thousands of guns the land itself seemed to move and flow where troop concentrations and fleets of war craft manoeuvred and great sloped stems of steam and smoke lifted into the air above it all casting massive wedged shadows across the ground here and there beneath the spread of risen mists and lowering cloud dots and small winged shapes moved above the great battle as caude and lyge the great venerable warbeasts of the sky spotted for artillery and carried intelligence and signals from place to place none seemed mobbed by clouds of lesser avians so most likely they were all friendly poor fare compared to the days of old though when flocks squadrons whole clouds of the great beasts had contended in the battles of the ancients well if the old stories and ancient paintings were to be believed ferbin suspected they were exaggerated and his younger halfbrother oramen who claimed to study such matters had said well of course they were exaggerated though being oramen only after shaking his head at ferbins ignorance choubris holse his servant had been to his left on the ridge digging into a saddle bag and muttering about requiring some fresh supplies from the nearest village behind them major or general yilim had been on his right holding forth about the coming campaign on the next level down taking the fight to their enemies in their own domain ferbin had ignored his servant and turned to yilim out of politeness then midword with a sort of tearing rush of sound the elderly officer portly a little flushed of face and inclined to wheeze when laughing was gone just gone his legs and lower torso still sat in the saddle but the rest of him was all ripped about and scattered half of him seemed to have thrown itself over ferbin covering him in blood and greasily unknowable bits of body parts ferbin had stared at the remains still sitting in the saddle as he wiped some of the gore off his face gagging with the stink and the warm steaming feel of it his lunch had left his belly and mouth like something was pursuing it hed coughed then wiped his face with a goreslicked hand fucking hell hed heard choubris holse say voice breaking yilims mount the tall pale mersicor charger which yilim had spoken to more kindly than to any of his men as though suddenly realising what had just happened screamed reared and fled dumping what was left of the mans body on to the tornup ground another shell or ball or whatever these ghastly things were landed nearby felling another two of their group in a shrieking tangle of men and animals his servant had gone too now ferbin realised mount toppled falling on top of him choubris holse yelled with fright and pain pinned beneath the animal sir one of the junior officers shouted at him suddenly in front of him pulling his own mount round ride away from here he was still wiping blood from his face hed filled his britches he realised he whipped his mount and followed the younger man until the young officer and his mount disappeared in a sudden thick spray of dark earth the air seemed to be full of screeches and fire deafening blinding ferbin heard himself whimper he pressed himself against his mount wrapping his arms round its neck and closing his eyes letting the pounding animal find its own way over and around whatever obstacles were in its path not daring to raise his head and look where they were going the jarring rattling terrifying ride had seemed to last for ever he heard himself whimpering again the panting heaving mersicor slowed eventually ferbin opened his eyes to see they were on a dark wooded track by the side of a small river booms and flashes came from every side but sounded a little further away than they had something burned further up the stream as though overhanging trees were on fire a tall building half ruined loomed in the late afternoon light as the labouring panting mount slowed still further he pulled it to a stop outside the place and dismounted hed let go of the reins the animal startled at another loud explosion then went wailing off down the track at a canter he might have given chase if his pants hadnt been full of his own excrement instead he waddled into the building through a door wedged open by sagging hinges looking for water and somewhere to clean himself his servant would have known just what to do choubris holse would have cleaned him up quick as you like with much muttering and many grumblings but efficiently and without a sly sneer and now ferbin realised he was unarmed the mersicor had made off with his rifle and ceremonial sword plus the pistol hed been given by his father and which he had sworn would never leave his side while the war was waged was no longer in its holster he found some water and ancient rags and cleaned himself as best he could he still had his wine flask though it was empty he filled the flask from a long trough of deep flowing water cut into the floor and rinsed his mouth then drank he tried to catch his reflection in the dark length of water but failed he dipped his hands in the trough and pushed his fingers through his long fair hair then washed his face appearances had to be maintained after all of king hausks three sons he had always been the one who most resembled their father tall fair and handsome with a proud manly bearing so people said apparently he did not really trouble himself with such matters the battle raged on beyond the dark abandoned building as the light of pentrl faded from the sky he found that he could not stop shaking he still smelled of blood and shit it was unthinkable that anyone should find him like this and the noise hed been told the battle would be quick and they would win easily but it was still going on maybe they were losing if they were it might be better that he hid if his father had been killed in the fighting he would he supposed be the new king that was too great a responsibility he couldnt risk showing himself until he knew they had won he found a place on the floor above to lie down and tried to sleep but could not all he could see was general yilim bursting right in front of him gobbets of flesh flying towards him he retched once more then drank from the flask just lying there then sitting his cloak pulled tight around him made him feel a little better it would all be all right he told himself hed take a little while away from things just a moment or two to collect his wits and calm down then hed see how things were they would have won and his father would still be alive he wasnt ready to be king he enjoyed being a prince being a prince was fun being a king looked like hard work besides his father had always entirely given everybody whod ever met him the strong impression that he would most assuredly live for ever ferbin must have nodded off there was noise down below clamour voices in his jangled still halfdrowsy state he thought he recognised some of them he was instantly terrified that he would be discovered captured by the enemy or shamed in front of his fathers own troops how low he had fallen in so short a time to be as mortally afraid of his own side as of the enemy steelshod feet clattered on the steps he was going to be discovered nobody in the floors above a voice said good there lay him there doctor there was some speech that ferbin didnt catch he was still working out that hed escaped detection while hed been asleep well you must do whatever you can bleye tohonlo ride for help as ive asked sir at once priest attend the exaltine sir will be with us in due course im sure for now the dutys yours of course sir the rest of you out give us some air to breathe here he did know that voice he was sure he did the man giving the orders sounded like in fact must be tyl loesp mertis tyl loesp was his fathers closest friend and most trusted adviser what was going on there was much movement lanterns cast shadows from below on to the dark ceiling above him he shifted towards a chink of light coming from the floor nearby where a broad canvas belt descending from a giant wheel above disappeared through the planking to some machinery on the ground floor shifting he could peer through the slit in the floor to see what was happening beneath dear god of the world it was his father king hausk lay face slack eyes closed on a broad wooden door resting on makeshift trestles immediately beneath his armour was pierced and buckled over the left side of his chest and blood was seeping through some flag or banner wrapped around him he looked dead or close to death ferbin felt his eyes go wide dr gillews the royal physician was quickly opening bags and small portable cabinets an assistant fussed beside him a priest ferbin recognised but did not know the name of stood by his fathers head his white robes soiled with blood or mud he was reading from some holy work mertis tyl loesp tall and partially stooped still dressed in armour his helmet held in one hand his white hair matted paced to and fro armour glinting in the lanternlight the only others present that he could see were a couple of knights standing rifles held ready by the door the angle was wrong to see further up than the chest of the tall knight on the right side of the door but ferbin recognised the one whose face he could see bower or brower or something he should reveal himself he thought he should let them know he was here he might be about to become king after all it would be aberrant perverse not to make himself known he would wait just a moment longer all the same he felt this like an instinct he told himself and his instinct had been right about not riding up on to the ridge earlier his fathers eyes flickered open he grimaced with pain one arm moving towards his injured side the doctor looked at his assistant who went to hold the kings hand perhaps to comfort him but certainly preventing him from probing his injury the doctor joined his assistant holding scissors and pliers he cut cloth pulled at armour mertis the king said weakly ignoring the doctor and holding his other hand out his voice usually so stern and strong sounded like a childs here tyl loesp said coming to the kings side he took his hand do we prevail mertis the other man looked round at the others present then he said we prevail sir the battle is won the deldeyn have surrendered and ask our terms they conditioned only that their massacre cease and they be treated honourably which we have allowed so far the ninth and all that it holds lies open to us the king smiled ferbin felt relieved it sounded like things had gone well he supposed he really ought to make his entrance now he took a breath to speak let them know he was there and ferbin the king asked ferbin froze what about him dead tyl loesp said it was said ferbin thought with somewhat insufficient grief or pity almost a chap less charitable than himself might have thought with relish dead his father wailed and ferbin felt his eyes moisten now now he needed to let his father know that his eldest surviving son still lived whether he smelled of shit or not yes tyl loesp said leaning over the king the vain silly spoiled little brat was blown to bits on cherien ridge some time after midday a sad loss to his tailors jewellers and creditors i dare say as to anyone of consequence well the king made a spluttering noise then said loesp what are you we are all of one mind here are we not tyl loesp said smoothly ignoring the king ignoring the king and looking round everybody present a chorus of low muttered voices gave what must have been assent not you priest but no matter tyl loesp told the holy man continue with the reading if you would the priest did as he was instructed eyes now wide the doctors assistant stared at the king then glanced at the doctor who was looking back at him loesp the king cried something of his old authority back in his voice what do you mean by this insult and to my dead child what monstrosity of oh do be quiet tyl loesp laid his helmet at his feet and leaned further forward putting his knuckles to his cheeks and resting his mailed elbows on the kings armoured chest an act of such unprecedented disrespect that ferbin found it almost more shocking than anything hed heard the king winced breath wheezing out of him ferbin thought he heard something bubbling the doctor had finished exposing the wound in the kings side i mean the cowardly little cunt is dead you old cretin tyl loesp said addressing his only lord and master as though he was a beggar and if by some miracle hes not he soon will be the younger boy i think ill keep alive for now in my capacity as regent though im afraid poor quiet studious little oramen may not live to the point of accession they say the boys interested in mathematics i am not save like yourself for its trajectorial role in the fall of shot however id compute his chances of seeing his next birthday and hence majority grow less substantial the closer the event creeps what the king gasped labouring loesp loesp for all pity no tyl loesp said leaning more heavily on the bloodbright curve of armour causing the king to moan no pity my dear dim old warrior youve done your bit youve won your war thats monument and epitaph enough and your time is past but no pity sir no i shall order all the prisoners of today killed with the utmost dispatch and the ninth invaded with every possible severity so that gutters rivers heavens water wheels too for all i care run with blood and the shrieking will i dare say be terrible to hear all in your name brave prince for vengeance for your idiot sons too if you like tyl loesp put his face very close to that of the king and shouted at him the game is over my old stump it was always greater than you knew he pushed himself back off the kings chest making the prone man cry out again tyl loesp nodded at the doctor who visibly gulping reached out with some metal instrument plunging it into the wound in the kings side making him shudder and scream you traitors you treacherous bastards the king wept as the doctor took a step back instrument dripping blood face grey will no one help me bastards all you murder your king tyl loesp shook his head staring first at the writhing king then at the doctor you ply your given trade too well medic he moved round to the other side of the king who flailed weakly at him as tyl loesp passed the priest stuck out a hand clutching at the noblemans sleeve tyl loesp looked calmly down at the hand on his forearm the priest said hoarsely sir this is too much its its wrong tyl loesp looked at his eyes then back at his clutching hand until the priest released him you stray your brief mumbler tyl loesp told him get back to your words the priest swallowed then lowered his gaze to the book again his lips began to move once more though no sound issued from his mouth tyl loesp moved round the broken door shoving the doctor back until he stood by the kings other flank he crouched a little inspecting a mortal wound indeed my lord he said shaking his head you should have accepted the magic potions our friend hyrlis offered i would have he plunged one hand into the kings side arm disappearing almost to the elbow the king shrieked why tyl loesp said heres the very heart of it he grunted twisting and pulling inside the mans chest the king gave one final scream arched his back and then collapsed the body jerked a few more times and some sound came from his lips but nothing intelligible and soon they too were still ferbin stared down he felt frozen immobilised like something trapped in ice or baked to solidity nothing he had seen or heard or ever known had prepared him for this nothing there was a sharp crack the priest fell like a sack of rocks tyl loesp lowered his pistol the hand holding it dripped blood the doctor cleared his throat stepped away from his assistant ah the boy too he told tyl loesp looking away from the lad he shook his head and shrugged he worked for the kings people as well as us im sure master i the youth had time to say before tyl loesp shot him as well in the belly first folding him then in the head the doctor looked quite convinced that tyl loesp was about to shoot him too but tyl loesp merely smiled at him and then at the two knights at the door he stooped took a towel from the waistband of the murdered assistant wiped his pistol and his hand with it then dabbed a little blood from his arm and sleeve he looked round the others this had to be done as we all know he told them he looked distastefully at the body of the king as a surgeon might at a patient who has had the temerity to die on him kings are usually the first to talk and at some length of overarching destiny and the necessity of fulfilling greater purposes he said still wiping and dabbing so lets take all that billowy rhetoric as heard shall we we are left with this the king died of his wounds most honourably incurred but not before swearing bloody vengeance on his enemies the prancing prince is dead and the younger one is in my charge these two here fell prey to a sniper and well burn down this old place just for good measure now come all our fine prizes await he threw the bloodied towel down on to the face of the felled assistant and then said with an encouraging smile i believe we are concluded here palace oramen was in a round room in the shade wing of the royal palace in pourl when they came to tell him that his father and his elder brother were dead and he would in time be king he had always liked this room because its walls described an almost perfect circle and if you stood at its very centre you could hear your own voice reflected back at you from the chambers circumference in a most singular and interesting fashion he looked up from his papers at the breathless earl whod burst into the room and broken the news the earls name was droffo from shilda if oramen was not mistaken meanwhile a couple of the palace servants piled into the room behind the nobleman also breathing hard and looking flushed oramen sat back in his seat he noticed it was dark outside a servant must have lit the rooms lamps dead he said both of them are you sure if all reports are to be believed sir from the army command and from tyl loesp himself the king is the kings body is returning on a gun carriage sir droffo told him sir im sorry its said poor ferbin was cut in half by a shell i am so sorry sir sorry beyond words they are gone oramen nodded thoughtfully but i am not king the earl who to oramen looked dressed half for court and half for war looked confused for a moment no sir not until your next birthday tyl loesp will rule in your name as i understand it i see oramen took a couple of deep breaths well now he had not prepared himself for this eventuality he wasnt sure what to think he looked at droffo what am i supposed to do what is my duty this too seemed to flummox the good earl just for an instant sir he said you might ride out to meet the kings bier oramen nodded i might indeed it is safe sir the battle is won yes oramen said of course he rose and looked beyond droffo to one of the servants puisil the steam car if you would take a little while to get steam up puisil said sir then dont delay oramen told him reasonably the servant turned to go just as fanthile the palace secretary appeared a moment fanthile told the servant causing puisil to hesitate his gaze flicking between the young prince and the elderly palace secretary a charger might be the better choice sir fanthile told oramen he smiled and bowed to droffo who nodded back at the older man fanthile was balding and his face was heavily lined but he was still tall and carried his thin frame proudly you think oramen said the car will be quicker surely the mount would be more immediate sir fanthile said and more fitting one is more public on a mount the people will need to see you one can stand up in the back of my fathers steam car oramen considered saying but he saw the sense in what was being proposed also fanthile continued seeing the prince hesitate and deciding to press the road may be crowded a mount will slip through spaces yes of course oramen said very well puisil if you would sir the servant left oramen sighed and boxed his papers his day had largely been taken up with working on a novel form of musical notation he had been kept with the rest of the household in the cellars of the palace during the early morning when the deldeyn had first been expected to break out from the nearby tower in case things went badly and they had to flee through subterranean tunnels to a fleet of steam vehicles waiting ready in the citys lower reaches but then they had been allowed out when as expected the enemy had been met with such prepared force they had soon ceased to be a threat to the city and their attention became focused instead on their own survival midmorning hed been persuaded to climb to a balustraded roof with shir rocasse his tutor to look out over the stepped palace grounds and the higher reaches of the hilltop city towards the xiliskine tower and the battleground that telegraph reports now stated stretched almost all around it but there had been little to see even the sky had appeared entirely devoid of action the great battleflocks of caude and lyge that had filled the ancient airs and made the battles of yesteryear seem so romantic were largely gone now consigned reduced to scout patrols messengering artillery spotting and raids that were little better than brigandry here on the eighth such flying warbeasts were widely held to have no significant part to play in modern ground battles largely due to the machinery and accompanying tactics king hausk himself had introduced there had been rumours that the deldeyn had steampowered flying machines but if these had been present today they must have been in small numbers or had little obvious effect oramen had been mildly disappointed though he thought the better of saying so to his old tutor who was as patriotic raceconscious and worldgodly as any might wish they came down from the roof for what were supposed to be lessons shir rocasse was nearing retirement but had anyway realised during the last shortyear that he had little to teach oramen now unless it was by rote straight out of a book these days the prince preferred to use the palace library unmediated though he still listened to the old scholars advice not entirely out of sentimentality he had left rocasse in the library wrapt by some dusty set of scrolls and made his way here to the round room where he was even less likely to be disturbed well until now oramen renneque ran in darting past droffo and fanthile and flinging herself at his feet in a derangement of torn clothing i just heard it cant be true renneque the lady silbe hooked her arms round his feet hugging tight she looked up her young face livid with tears and grief brown hair spilling say its not please not both not the king and ferbin too not both not both for anything not both oramen leant down gently and pulled her up until she knelt before him her eyes wide her brows pulled in her jaw working he had always thought her rather attractive and been envious of his elder brother but now he thought she looked almost ugly in this surfeit of grief her hands having been deprived of the patent reassurance of his feet now clutched at a plump little world symbol on a thin chain round her neck twisting it round and round in her fingers the filigree of smaller shells inside the spherical outer casing all revolving sliding back and forth continually adjusting oramen felt quite mature even old all of a sudden now renneque he said taking her hands and patting them we all have to die the girl wailed throwing herself to the floor again madam fanthile said sounding kindly but embarrassed and reaching down to her then turning to see mallarh one of the ladies of court also looking tearful and distracted appear in the doorway mallarh perhaps twice renneques age face pitted with the tiny scars of a childhood infection bit her lip when she saw the younger woman weeping on the wooden floor please fanthile said to mallarh indicating renneque mallarh persuaded renneque to rise then to exit now sir fanthile said before turning to see harne the lady aelsh the kings present consort and mother to ferbin standing in the doorway her eyes red fair hair straggled and unkempt but clothing untorn her face set and stance steady fanthile sighed madam he began just confirm it fanthile the lady said is it true the two both of mine fanthile looked at the floor for a moment yes my lady both gone the king most certainly the prince by all accounts the lady aelsh seemed to sag then slowly drew herself up she nodded then made as though to turn away before stopping to look at oramen he looked straight back at her he rose from his seat still held by that gaze though they had both sought to conceal it their mutual dislike was no secret in the palace his was based on his own mother having been banished in harnes favour while hers was generally assumed to be caused by oramens mere existence still he wanted to say that he was sorry he wanted to say at least when he thought more clearly and logically about it later that he felt for her double loss that this was an unlookedfor and an unwanted promotion of his status and that she would suffer no diminution of her own rank by any action or inaction of his either during the coming regency or following his own ascension but her expression seemed to forbid him from speech and perhaps even dared him to find anything that might be said that she would not find in some way objectionable he struggled against this feeling for some moments thinking that it was better to say something rather than seem to insult her with silence but then gave up there was a saying wisdom is silence in the end he simply bowed his head to the lady saying nothing he sensed as much as saw her turn and leave oramen looked up again well at least that was over come sir fanthile said holding out one arm ill ride with you will i be all right like this oramen asked he was dressed most informally in pants and shirt throw on a good cloak sir fanthile suggested he looked steadily at the younger man as he hesitated patting the papers he had been working on as though not sure whether to take them with him or not you must be distraught sir the palace secretary said levelly oramen nodded yes he said tapping the papers the topmost sheet was nothing to do with musical notation as a prince oramen had of course been educated in the ways of the aliens who existed beyond his home level and outwith sursamen itself and idling earlier hed been doodling his name and then attempting to express it as those aliens might oramen lin bliskhauskr yun pourl yun dich oramenman prince pourlinebrac su human oramen prince of pourl house of hausk domain of sarl of the eighth sursamen meseriphinesursamensa oramen lin bliskhauskr dam pourl he reordered the pages picked up a paperweight and placed it on the pile yes i must mustnt i just hoisting oneself aboard a mersicor it appeared had become rather more complicated than it had ever been before oramen had hardly tarried since hearing the news but even so a considerable fuss had already accrued in the lanternlit mounting yard by the time he got there accompanied harried might have been as fit a term by fanthile oramen had visited his apartments to grab a voluminous riding cloak suffered fanthile pulling a comb through his auburn hair and then been rushed down the steps towards the yard taking care to nod at the various grave faces and sets of wringing hands en route he had only been held up once by the oct ambassador the ambassador looked like some sort of giant crab its upright ovoid body about the size of a childs torso was coloured deep blue and covered with tiny bright green growths that were either thin spikes or thick hairs its thricesegmented limbs four hanging like legs four seemingly taking the part of arms were an almost incandescent red and each terminated in small double claws which were the same blue as the main body the limbs protruded not quite symmetrically in brokenlooking zshapes from four black stubs which for some reason always reminded oramen of fleshy cannon mouths the creature was supported from the rear and sides by a frame of mirrorfinished metal with bulkier additions behind it which apparently housed the means it used to hover soundlessly in midair occasionally leaking small amounts of strangely scented liquid a set of tubes led from another cylinder to what was assumed to be its face set in the middle of its main body and covered with a sort of mask through which tiny bubbles could occasionally be seen to move its whole body glistened and when you looked very closely and oramen had you could see that a very thin membrane of liquid seemed to enclose every part of it with the possible exception of its little green hairs and the blue claws the oct diplomatic mission was housed in an old ballroom in the palaces sun wing and was apparently completely full of water the ambassador and two escorting oct one slightly smaller and one a little larger than it floated over the corridor tiles towards oramen and fanthile as they reached the final turn in the stairs fanthile stopped when he saw the creatures oramen thought better of not doing likewise he heard the palace secretary sigh oramenman prince ambassador kiutopourl said its voice was that of dry leaves rustling or a small fire starting in tinder that who gave that you might be given unto life is no more as our ancestors the blessed involucra who are no more to us are grief is to be experienced thereto related emotions and much i am unable to share being nevertheless and forbearance i commend unto you one assumes likely too assumption takes place fruitions energy transfers like inheritance and so we share you we as though in the way of pressure in subtle conduits we do not map well oramen stared at the thing wondering what he was supposed to make of this apparent nonsense in his experience the ambassadors tangential utterances could be made to represent some sort of twisted sense if you thought about them long enough preferably after writing them down but he didnt really have the time just now thank you for your kind words he blurted nodding and backing towards the stairs the ambassador drew back a fraction leaving a tiny pool of moisture glistening on the tiles keep you go to that which you go to take that which i would give you knowing of alikeness oct inheritors descend from veil inherit you inherit also is pity with your leave sir fanthile said to the ambassador then he and oramen bowed turned and went clattering down the last flight of stairs towards ground level the fuss in the mounting yard mostly involved a whole blaring coven of dukes earls and knights disputing loudly over who ought to ride with the prince regent on the short journey he was about to make to meet the body of the returning king oramen hung back in the shadows arms folded waiting for his mount to be brought before him he stepped backwards into a pile of dung near the yards tall rear wall and tutted shaking some of the shit from his boot and attempting to scrape off the rest on the wall the dung pile was still steaming he wondered if you could tell what sort of animal had left the turd from its appearance and consistency probably he imagined he looked straight up at the sky there still visible over the lanterns illuminating the mounting yard from the ensquaring walls a dull red line marked the cooling course incised by the rollstar pentrl many hours set and many days away from returning he looked to the nearpole where domity would rise next but this was a relatively long night and even the rollstars forelight was still some hours away he thought he could see just a suggestion of the keandeyiine tower stretching into the darkness above the lower extent of the xiliskine though nearer was hidden by a tall tower of the palace but he was not sure xiliskine or tower that was the name their mentors the oct would give it he supposed he ought to prefer xiliskine he returned his attention to the yard so many nobles hed assumed theyd all be out fighting the deldeyn but then his father had long since drawn a firm distinction between those nobles who brought grace and emollience to a court and those who were capable of successfully fighting a modern war the levied troops magnificently motley led by their lords still had their place but the new army was part fulltime professional and part welltrained peoples militias all of it commanded by captains majors colonels and generals not knights lords earls and dukes he spotted some senior priests and a few parliamentarians in the mixture too pressing their suit for inclusion he had fondly imagined riding out alone or with one or two attendants instead it looked like he would be leading out a small army of his own oramen had been advised not to have anything to do with the battle taking place out over the plains that day and anyway had no real interest in it given that they had all been most severely assured it was quite certain to go their way by werreber one of his fathers most forbidding generals just the night before it was a pity in a way only a couple of years ago hed have been fascinated with the machinery of war and all the careful dispositioning of forces involved the intense numericality of its planning and the extreme functionality of its cruel workings would have consumed him somehow though since then hed lost interest in things martial they seemed even as they were in the process of securing it profoundly inimical to the modern age theyd help usher in war itself was becoming oldfashioned and outmoded inefficient wasteful fundamentally destructive it would have no part in the glitteringly pragmatic future the greatest minds of the kingdom foresaw only people like his father would mourn such a passing he would celebrate it my prince murmured a voice beside him oramen turned tove he said clapping the other young man on the back tove lomma had been his best friend almost since nursery he was an army officer nowadays and wore the uniform of the old flying corps youre here i thought youd be fighting how good to see you theyve had me in one of the lyge towers the last few days with a squadron of the beasts light guns in case there was an aerial attack listen he put one hand on oramens arm this is so bad about your father and ferbin the stars would weep oramen i cant tell you all the men of the flight well we want you to know were at your command rather at loesps he is your champion in this oramen hell serve you well im sure as am i your father though our dear king our every toves voice broke he shook his head and looked away biting his lip and sniffing hard oramen felt he had to comfort his old friend well he died happy i imagine he said in battle and victorious as hed have wished as wed all have wished anyway he took a quick look round the mêlée in the yard the contesting nobles seemed to be gathering themselves into some sort of order but there was still no sign of his charger hed have been quicker in the steam car after all it is a shock he continued tove was still looking away i shall miss him miss him well terribly obviously tove looked back at him oramen smiled broadly and blinked quickly truth be told i think im like a halfstunned beast still walking around but eyes crossed as wits i fully expect to wake up at any moment id do so now if it was in my power when tove looked back his eyes were bright ive heard that when the troops learned their beloved king was dead they fell upon their captives and killed every one i hope not oramen said that was not my fathers policy they killed him oramen those beasts i wish id been there too to take my own revenge well neither of us were we must hope whats been done in our name brings only honour tove nodded slowly clutching oramens arm once more you must be strong oramen he said oramen gazed at his old friend strong indeed this was quite the most vapid thing tove had ever said to him death obviously had an odd effect on people so tove said with a sly tentative smile do we call you sire or majesty or something yet not yet oramen began then was led away by an earl and assisted to his mount by dukes on the xilisk road near the small town of evingreath the cortège bearing the body of king nerieth hausk back to his capital met with the barely smaller procession led by the prince oramen immediately he saw the prince regent lit by hissing travel lanterns and the slowincreasing forelight of the rollstar domity still some hours from its dawn mertis tyl loesp who all the world knew had been like a third hand to the king for almost all his life dismounted and pulling himself with heavy steps to the princes charger went down on one knee on the muddied road head bowed so that his silvery hair spiked and wild from the tearings of grief and his distraught face still dark with powder smoke and streaked by hot unceasing tears were level with the stirruped foot of the prince then he raised his head and said these words sir our beloved master the king who was your father and my friend and was friend and father to all his people comes back to his throne in triumph but also in death our victory has been great and complete and our gain and new advantage immeasurable only our loss exceeds such vast accomplishment but it does so by a ratio beyond calculation beside that hateful cost for all its furious glory our triumph these last hours now looks like nothing your father was full occasion for both one would not have been but for his matchless leadership and steady purpose the other was invoked by his untimely unwanted undeserved death and so it is fallen to me and is my great if everunlookedfor privilege to rule for the short interval between this most loathsome day and the glorious one of your accession i beseech you sir believe me that whatever i do in your name my lord will be for you and the people of sarl and always in the name of the worldgod your father would expect no less and in this cause so great to us i might begin to start some small repayment of the honour he did me i honour you as i honoured him sir utterly with all my being with my every thought and every action now and for as long as it is my duty so to do i have today lost the best friend a man ever had sir a true light a constant star whose fixity outshone outstared any mere celestial lamp the sarl have lost the greatest commander they have ever known a name fit to be clamoured down the aeons till times end and echo loud as that of any hero of the distant ancients amongst the unseen stars we can never hope to be a tenth as great as he but i take respite in only this the truly great are strong beyond death itself my lord and like the fading streak of light and heat a great star leaves behind it once its own true brilliance has been obscured a legacy of power and wisdom remains from which we may draw strength by its focus magnifying our own small allotment of fortitude and will sir if i seem to express myself inelegantly or without the due respect i would give your station and your self forgive me my eyes are blinded my ears stopped and my mouth made numb by all thats taken place today to gain more than we thought possible then lose an infinity more than even that would have shattered any man save only the one unmatched soul it is our sad abhorrent duty to bring before you here tyl loesp fell silent oramen knew he was expected to say something in return hed been doing his best to ignore the prattling dukes around him for the last halfhour after fanthile had briefly made it through the press of bodies animal and human surrounding him to warn him he might need to give a speech the palace secretary had barely had time to impart even this morsel of advice before he and his mount were nudged and jostled out of the way back to what the more splendid nobles obviously regarded as his proper place amongst the minor nobility the dutifully wailing priests and dourlooking parliamentarians since then oramen had been trying to come up with something suitable but what was he supposed to say or do he glanced at the various resplendent nobles around him all of whom from their grave almost exaggerated nods and mutterings seemed to approve quite mightily of mertis tyl loesps speech oramen twisted briefly in his saddle to glimpse fanthile now still further back in the crush of junior nobles priests and representatives signalling with jerks of his head and jagged flaps of his hand that he ought to dismount he did so already a small crowd of dismounted men and people presumably from the nearby town and countryside had gathered around them filling the broad way and jostling for position on the roadside banks the growing forelight predawn under a sky of scattered clouds silhouetted some folk climbing nearby trees for a better view he still had no idea what to say in return though he suddenly thought what a fine subject for a painting such a scene might make oramen took tyl loesp by one hand and got him to stand before him thank you for all youve said and done dear tyl loesp he told the older man he was very aware of the contrast between the two of them he the slight prince barely out of childish clothes and dressed beneath his thrownback cloak as though preparing for bed the other the allpowerful conquering warrior still in his battle armour flecked here and there with all the marks of war three times his age and barely any younger or less impressive than the lately killed king harshbreathing sternfaced still stinking of blood and smoke bearing all the signs of mortal combat and unbearable grief tyl loesp towered over him the drama of the scene was not lost on oramen this would make a good painting he thought especially by one of the old masters say dilucherre or sordic perhaps even omoulldeo and almost at the same moment he knew what to do hed steal not from a painting of course but from a play there were enough old tragedies with like scenes and suitable speeches for him to welcome back a dozen dead dads and doughty combateers the choice was more daunting than the task it might relieve hed recall pick edit join and extemporise his way through the moment this is indeed our saddest day oramen said raising his voice and his head if any energies of yours could bring our father back i know youd devote them to that cause without stint that vigour instead will be turned to the good interest of all our people you bring us sorrow and joy at once my good tyl loesp but for all the misery we feel now and for all the time we must rightly hence devote to the mourning of our incomparable fallen the satisfaction of this great victory will still shine brightly when that rite has been most fully observed and my father would surely want it so the sum of his most glorious life was cause for fervent celebration well before the great triumph of this day and the weight of that result has grown only more majestic with the exploits of all who fought for him before the xiliskine tower oramen looked round the gathered people for a moment at this point and attempted to raise his voice still further my father took one son to war today and left one myself at home i have lost both a father and a brother as well as my king and his loved and rightful heir they outshine me in death as they did in life and mertis tyl loesp though having no lack of other responsibilities must stand in place of both for me i tell you i can think of no one more fitted to the task oramen nodded towards the grimfaced warrior in front of him then he took a breath and still addressing the assembled mass said i know i have no share of this days glory i think my boyish shoulders would fail beneath the smallest part of such a load but i am proud to stand with all the sarl people to celebrate and to honour the great deeds done and pay the fullest respect to one who taught us celebration encouraged us to honour and exemplified respect this fetched a cheer which rose raggedly then with increasing strength from the congregation of people gathered around them oramen heard shields being struck by swords mailed fists beating on armoured chests and like a modern comment on such flowery antiquity the loud crack of small arms fire rounds spent into the air like some inverted hail mertis tyl loesp who had kept a stony face during oramens reply looked very briefly surprised even alarmed at its end but that briefest of impressions which might so easily have been the result of the uncertain light cast by the carried travel lanterns and the wan glow of a still unrisen minor star was close to uncapturably shortlived and easily dismissible may i see my father sir oramen asked he found that his heart was beating hard and his breath was quick still he did his best to maintain a calm and dignified demeanour as he gathered was expected nevertheless if he was expected to wail and scream and tear out his hair when he saw the body this impromptu audience was going to be disappointed he is here sir tyl loesp said indicating the long carriage pulled by hefters behind him they walked to the carriage the crowd of men mostly armed many with all the appearance of great distress parting for them oramen saw the tall spare frame of general werreber whod briefed them at the palace about the battle just the night before and the exaltine chasque the chief of priests both nodded to him werreber looked old and tired and somehow despite his height shrunken inside his crumpled uniform he nodded then cast his gaze downwards chasque resplendent in rich vestments over gleaming armour formed the sort of clenched encouraging halfsmile people sometimes did when they wanted to tell you to be brave or strong they climbed on to the platform where oramens father lay the body was attended by a couple of priests in appropriately torn vestments and lit from above by a single hissing sputtering travel lamp casting a white caustic light over the bier his fathers face looked grey and still and drawndown somehow as though he was pondering eyes shut jaws set some overwhelmingly demanding problem a silvery sheet embroidered with gold covered his body from the neck down oramen stood looking at him for a while in time he said in life by choice his deeds spoke for him in death i must be as mute as all his undone undertakings he clapped tyl loesp on the arm ill sit with him while we return to the city he looked behind the gun carriage a mersicor a great charger disarmoured though in full regalia was tied to its rear saddle empty is that he began then made a show of clearing his throat thats my fathers mount he said it is tyl loesp confirmed and my brothers unfound sir let my mount be tied to the end of the carriage too behind my fathers he went to sit at his fathers head then imagining fanthiles face thought that might be held inappropriate and repositioned himself at the foot of the bier he sat there at the trailing edge of the carriage crosslegged looking down while the two mersicors loped along just behind breath steaming in the increasingly misty air the whole aggregated column of men animals and wagons made the rest of the journey to the city in a silence broken only by the creak of wheel and axle the snap of whip and the snort and clop of beast the morning mists obscured the rising star of the new day almost until the walls of pourl itself then lifted slowly to become a layer of overcast that hid the higher city and the palace on the approaches to the nearpole gate where a conglomeration of small factories and what was effectively a new town had sprung up within oramens lifetime the temporary sun shone only for a little while then was gone again behind the clouds folly choubris holse found his master in the eighth of the distinct places where he thought he might actually be which was of course a significant and most propitious location to discover somebody or something a person was looking for it was also the last place he knew of to look with any purpose beyond simply wandering randomly indeed with this in mind he had left it to the afternoon of his second day of searching specifically with the hope that this might finally be where ferbin had fetched up the folly looked like a small castle poised on a low cliff overlooking a turn in the river feyrla it was just a hollow round of walls really with crenellations and had been built preruined as it were to improve the view from a hunting lodge a little further down the valley it had been a place choubris holse knew where the kings children had played while their father on one of his infrequent spells at home from his various wars of unity went hunting choubris tethered his rowel by the single low door to the ruin and left it noisily cropping moss from the wall the mersicor trailing behind the rowel brought in case he found his master mountless nibbled daintily at some flowers holse preferred rowels to mersicors they were less skittish and harder working he might have taken a flying beast he supposed but he trusted those even less royal servants above a certain rank were expected to be able to fly and he had suffered the instruction and the instructors who had not spared him their opinion that such honour was wasted upon one so coarse but had not enjoyed the learning a proper searching like so many things was best done on foot from the ground hurling oneself grandly across the sky was all very well and certainly gave the impression of lordly oversight and superiority but what it really did was give you the opportunity to miss all details at once rather than one at a time which was the ration for decent folk plus as a rule a most fixed and strict rule it had long struck choubris it was the people who had to make things work on the ground who ended up paying for such sweepingly overgeneralised judgementing this principle seemed to apply to highups of all distinctions whether their height was literal or metaphorical sir he called into the hollow round of stones his voice echoed the masonry was illdressed worse within than without the lower tier of piercings much too wide for any real fortification gave out on to pleasant views of hill and forest the xiliskine tower rose pale and vast in the distance disappearing beyond the clouds into the heavens plumes of smoke and wisps of steam were scattered across the landscape like missed stalks after a harvest all leaning away from the backing wind he limped further into the folly his left leg still hurt from where that seedbrained mersicor had fallen on him the day before he was getting too old for such shenanigans he was in his middle years now and starting to fill out nicely and become distinguished or develop a paunch and become grey and grizzled by his wifes less forgiving measure his whole side every rib pained him when he took a deep breath or tried to laugh not that thered been much laughing choubris had seen many signs of battle while hed been riding round the area whole wastelands of tornup fields and shattered forests the land raddled with a pox of craters entire woods and brush forests still on fire smoke walling the sky other fires only just exhausted or extinguished leaving vast black tracts of razed ground seeping wispy fumes the wrecks of smashed war machines lying crippled like enormous broken insects with tracks unrolled behind them a few still leaking steam some great dead battle beasts spread crumpled and forlorn uoxantch chunsels and ossesyi plus a couple of types he didnt recognise hed seen bands of wounded troops walking in lines or borne on carts and wagons groups of soldiers dashing about importantly on mersicors a few airborne men on caude slowly crisscrossing dipping and wheeling when searching for any still surviving enemy or stray fallen or making straight and fast if bearing messages hed passed engineers rigging or repairing telegraph lines and thrice hed pulled off roads and tracks to let hissing spitting smokebelching steam vehicles past hed patted and comforted the old rowel even though shed seemed unbothered hed come too upon numerous details digging charnel pits for the enemy dead of which there seemed a great many the deldeyn holse thought looked much like normal folk perhaps a little darker though that might have been the effect of death itself hed stopped and talked to anybody willing to spare the time pretty much regardless of rank partly to enquire about missing nobles on white chargers mostly because as he would freely admit he enjoyed flapping his jaw he took a little crile root with the captain of one company shared a pipe of unge with a sergeant from another and was grateful to a quartermasterlieutenant for a bottle of strong wine most of the soldiers were more than happy to talk about their part in the battle though not all the massburial men in particular tended to the taciturn even surly he heard a few interesting things as any fellow open to easy discourse was bound to prince he yelled louder voice echoing off the rough stones inside the folly sir are you here he frowned and shook his head beneath the open crown of the empty tower ferbin he shouted he ought not to call his master by his name like that but then it looked like the prince wasnt here after all and there was a thrill to be had from such address roundly insulting ones superiors behind their backs was one of the perks of being inferior choubris held besides hed been told often enough that he could use the familiar term though such licence was only ever offered when ferbin was very drunk the offer was never renewed in sobriety so choubris had thought the better of acting on the privilege he wasnt here maybe he wasnt anywhere alive maybe the gaudy dope had accorded himself war hero status by mistake riding neckclutch like a terrified child wherever his idiot mount had taken him to be shot by one side or other or fall off a cliff knowing ferbin hed probably thought to raise his head again just as he went charging under an overhanging bough choubris sighed that was it then there was nowhere obvious left to look he could wander the great battlefield pretending to search for his lost master skipping through triage pens inhabiting field hospitals and haunting morgue piles all he liked but unless the worldgod took a most unlikely personal interest in his quest hed never find the blighter at this rate hed be forced to return to his wife and children in the littler though hardly less savage battlefield that was their apartment in the palace barracks and now whod have him hed lost a prince if you wanted to take an uncharitable view of the matter and he knew plenty that would what were the chances hed get to serve any other quality again with that recorded against him the king was dead and tyl loesp was in charge at least until the boy prince came of age choubris had a feeling in his gut that a lot of things things that had seemed settled and comfortable and pleasantly justso for honest respectable hardworking people would change from here onwards and the chances of a proven princemisplacer bettering himself under any regime were unlikely to be good he shook his head sighed to himself what a sorry mess he muttered he turned to go choubris is it you he turned back hello he said unable to see where the voice had come from a sudden feeling inside his belly informed him somewhat to his surprise that he must have a degree of genuine human fondness for prince ferbin after all or perhaps he was just glad not in fact to be a princeloser there was movement up on one wall at the base of one of the impractically wide windows on the second tier a man crawling out of a fissure in the rough stonework that was mostly hidden by a rustling tangle of wallcreep choubris hadnt even noticed the hideyhole ferbin completed his emergence crawled to the edge of the window ledge rubbed his eyes and looked down at his servant choubris he said in a sort of loud whisper he glanced around as though afraid it is you thank god i already have sir and you might thank me for such diligence in the looking is there anybody with you the prince hissed only the aforesaid deity sir if the more insistent priests are to be believed ferbin looked most unkempt and unslept too he glanced about the place again nobody else an old though dependable rowel sir and for yourself choubris i am in the most terrible danger choubris scratched behind one ear ah with respect sir you might not be aware we did win the battle i know that choubris im not an idiot choubris frowned but remained silent youre absolutely sure theres nobody else about choubris looked back to the small door then up at the sky well there are lots of people about sir half the greater army is tidying up or licking its wounds after our famous victory it was beginning to dawn on choubris that he might have the ticklish job of telling the prince that his father was dead this ought to mean of course that ferbin was effectively king but choubris knew people could be funny regarding that whole good newsbad news business i am alone sir he told ferbin i dont know what else to tell you perhaps youd best get down from there yes i cant stay here for ever the drop was easily jumpable but ferbin made to turn round and lower himself half way to the earthen floor of the folly choubris sighed and stood by the wall to help choubris have you anything to drink or eat ferbin asked im parched and famished wine water bread and saltmeat sir choubris said forming a stirrup with his hands back against the wall my saddle bags are like a travelling victuallers ferbin lowered one boot to his servants hands narrowly avoiding scarring him with his spur wine what sort fortified sir better so than this place choubris took the princes weight in his cupped hands and grunted in pain as he lowered him are you all right ferbin asked when he was on the ground he looked frightened grey with worry or shock or something or other his clothes were filthy and his long fair hair all tangled and matted also he smelled of smoke choubris had never seen him look so distressed he was crouched too choubris was used to looking up to his prince but they were of a level now no sir im not all right i had a beast fall on me in the confusion yesterday of course yes i saw quick lets crouch down here ferbin pulled choubris to one side by a tall bush no wait fetch me something to eat and drink if you see anybody dont tell them im here sir choubris said deciding to humour the fellow for now probably all he needed was something in his belly as the traitors and regicides set to burn the old building having taken themselves and the bodies of the murdered outside ferbin had started looking for a way out he felt dazed stunned half dead himself his vision seemed to have shrunk or his eyes would not move properly in their orbits because he seemed only able to see straight ahead his ears appeared to think he was near a great waterfall or in a high tower in a storm for he could hear a terrible roaring noise all about him that he knew was not really there as if the worldgod even the world itself was shrieking in horror at the foulness of what had been done in that awful ruin hed waited for people loyal to the king to come rushing in when they heard the shots that killed the priest and the young medic but nobody did others had appeared but they seemed calm and unconcerned and merely helped move the bodies and bring some kindling and lampstone to start the fire they were all traitors here he thought to reveal himself now would be to die like the others hed crept away sick and weak with the shock of it barely able to stand he climbed to the next highest floor by steps set against the buildings rear wall as they lit the fires below smoke came up quickly initially grey then turning black filling the already shadowy spaces of the antique factory with still greater darkness and making him choke at first most of the fumes made for the great hole in the gable wall but then they thickened around him stinging in his nose and throat had the sound of crackling and roaring below not been so loud hed have feared being heard outside as he hacked and coughed he looked for windows on the side of the building where hed crawled and climbed but could see nothing he found more steps leading him still further up into what must be the buildings loft and felt along the wall with his fingers coughing now with every breath until he found what appeared to be a window he pulled at a shutter pushed at some already broken glass and it gave smoke surged out around him he stuck his head forward gulping in cool clear air but he was too high up even if there was nobody on this side to see him hed never survive the fall uninjured he looked out dipping his head beneath the current of smoke and heat exiting around and above him he expected to see a track or yard four storeys below instead he stung himself on a rainsticky brattle bush he felt down and his hand closed on damp earth in the vague red afterlight of a longset sun he saw that he was incredibly somehow back to ground level the building was situated on a river bank so steep that one side was fully four floors high while the other pressed against the valleys steep side was barely one he pulled himself out still coughing and crawled away across rainwet glutinously muddy ground to wait beneath some nearby bushes while the abandoned building burned all due respect and such sir but have you gone mad choubris i swear on the worldgod on my dead fathers body its just as ive said choubris holse had noticed earlier while his master was swallowing wine from the upended bottle and tearing off lumps of bread with his teeth it seemed that take away the table and you took away the accompanying manners that prince ferbin was unarmed while he of course still had his trusty shortknife on his belt not to mention an army pistol issued a couple of days ago he seemed to have forgotten to return and which was tucked into his waistband by the small of his back not to mention and he rarely did a small but exceedingly sharp emergency knife reassuringly scabbarded down one boot these facts had he judged just gone from being of barely passing interest to moderately important given that it now appeared he was dealing with a bizarrely deluded madman ferbin put the bottle down and let the end of the bread drop to his lap setting his head back against the wall of the ruin as though looking up through the foliage of the bush hed insisted they hide beneath before hed been prepared to break his fast even you dont believe me he cried despairing he put his head in his hands and wept choubris was taken aback hed never seen the prince weep like this not sober everybody knew that to drink was to increase the hydrographical pressure within a body thus expressing the relevant fluids from all available bodily orifices so that didnt count he ought to try to comfort him somehow perhaps hed misunderstood hed try to get the matter clear sir are you really saying that he began then he too looked round as though afraid of being overheard that tyl loesp your fathers best friend the glove to his hand the very edge of his sword and all that murdered your father he spoke the word in a whisper ferbin looked at him with a face of such desperate fury and despair that choubris felt himself flinch at the sight of it plunged his filthy fist into my fathers chest and wrung the living force out of his beating heart ferbin said his voice sounding like it never had all gasped and rough and wild he sucked in a terrible faltering breath as though each atom of air hesitated in his mouth before being hauled howling to his lungs i saw it clear as i see you now choubris he shook his head his eyes filling with tears and his lips curling back and if trying to think it away if trying to persuade myself i was in any way mistaken or drugged or hallucinating or dreaming could make it so then by god id jump at that id welcome that with both arms both legs and a kiss a million times over id rather be safely mad having imagined what i saw than know my only derangement is the grief of having seen what did take place that last phrase he roared into his servants face one hand grasping the collar at choubris throat choubris put one hand behind his back partly to steady himself so that he did not fall over backwards and partly to bring the army pistol within quick reach then his masters face went slack and he seemed to crumple in on himself he put one hand on each of choubris shoulders and let his head fall to his servants chest wailing oh choubris if you dont believe me who will choubris felt the heat of the other mans face upon his breast and a dampness spread across his shirt he lifted his hand to pat the princes head but that seemed too much like the action one would take with a woman or a child and he let his hand fall back again he felt shaken even at his most raucously or selfpityingly drunken the prince had never seemed so moved so affected so distressed by anything not the death of his elder brother not losing a beloved mount to a wager not realising his father thought him a dolt and a wastrel nothing sir choubris said taking the prince by his shoulders and setting him upright again this is too much for me to absorb at the single sitting i too would rather think my own dear master mad than entertain the possibility that what he says is true for if its so then by god we are all halfway to madness and the heavens themselves might fall upon us now and cause no increase in disaster or disbelief ferbin was biting both his quivering lips together like a child trying not to cry choubris reached out and patted one of his hands let me tell you what ive heard various but consistent from a mixture of guileless strapping military types and seen on an army news sheet too what is the official and authorised version as you might say perhaps hearing this will make a compromise in your poor head with the fever possessing you ferbin laughed bitterly putting his head back again and sobbing even while he seemed to smile he raised the wine bottle to his lips then let it fall aside dropping it to the bare ground pass me the water ill pray some dead cur upstream polluted it so i may poison myself by mouth as you pour it in at my ear a job worth doing choubris cleared his throat to hide his astonishment this was unprecedented ferbin putting aside a bottle unfinished he was mad with something all right well sir they say the king died of his wound a smallcannon shot to his right side so much half accurate the wound was to his right his death was easy if solemn and witnessed not an hours ride from here in an old manufactury since burned by them they burned it ferbin sniffed at one sleeve and nearly me he shook his head i almost would they had he finished though this collided with his death was witnessed by tyl loesp the exaltine chasque the general what ferbin protested angrily chasque wasnt there a lowly roadpriest was all he had and even he tyl loesp killed blew his brains out and also by the doctors gillews and tareah and gillews ferbin broke in gillews alone save for his assistant another casualty of tyl loesps pistol also the general begging your pardon now the field marshal werreber and several of his sta lies lies upon lies they werent there its said they were sir and that the king ordered the killing of all the deldeyn captured though to admit the difference others say the troops themselves embarked upon this sorry course on hearing of your fathers death in a fury of deadly vengeance i grant this does not seem settled yet and when it is it will be to the advantage of tyl loesp and his filthy accomplices ferbin shook his head my father ordered no such crime this does him no honour this is made to sap his reputation before hes even laid to rest lies choubris lies he shook his head again all lies the whole army believes it true sir as does the palace id guess and all who can read or hear in pourl and in the full throughoutness of the land as fast as wire or beast or whatever other inferiority of messaging can carry the news still ferbin said bitterly even if i were alone in knowing what happened i know it still choubris scratched behind one ear if the whole world thinks differently sir is that even wise ferbin looked at his servant with an unsettling straightness and youd have me do what choubris eh why well sir come back with me to the palace and be the king and not be shot as an imposter an imposter sir enlighten me what is my status according to this established version of how things are well yes youre correct in that you have been ascribed dead but surely on sight of your good self id not be killed on the instant of being seen why killed at all because i dont know the all of who is and who is not part of this treachery those i saw at the death yes guilty beyond guilt the others chasque werreber did they know did they just claim to be present at this fictitious easy death to help support whatever circumstance they were presented with by those whod wrought the crime do they suspect nothing something all were they part of it from the beginning every one tyl loesp is culprit and no one was closer to my father who else might not be guilty tell me have you not heard warnings against spies snipers saboteurs and guerrillas some sir were there any orders of particular strictness you heard of regarding those who suddenly appeared within the greater battlefield resembling authority well just latterly yes sir but which means that ill be held then shot in the back i dont doubt so they can say i was trying to escape or dyou think such things never happen in army or militia they and if i did get as far as the palace the same applies how long might i survive long enough to tell the truth in front of a quorate sufficient to carry the day i think not long enough to challenge tyl loesp or confront the wretch beyond doubt beyond the grave id say he shook his head no i have thought long about this over the last day and can see quite clearly the merits of the contending courses but also i know my instincts and they have proved unfailingly trustworthy in the past this was true ferbins instincts had always told him to flee trouble or potential conflict rowdies creditors angry fathers of shamed daughters and whether escaping to the shelter of an obscure bawdy house a congenially distant hunting lodge or indeed the palace itself this intuition had invariably proved itself sound either way sir you cant hide here for ever i know that and i am besides not the one to enter into any such contention with the tyl loesps of this world i know they have the guile on me and the easy turn to brute well god knows im not such a one either sir i must escape choubris escape sir oh indeed escape escape far far away and seek sanctuary with or find a champion in one of two people i never imagined id have to trouble for so demeaning a favour i suppose i ought to be thankful i have any sort of choice or just two chances and they would be sir first we must get ourselves to a tower fitted out for travel i have an idea for obtaining the necessary documents ferbin said almost as though talking to himself then we shall have ourselves transported to the surface and take ship away across the stars to xide hyrlis who generals for the nariscene now and who may take up our cause for the love of my dead father and if he is unable to do so then at least he might signpost the route to djan ferbin told holse with what sounded like sudden weariness anaplias daughter who was raised to be fit to marry a prince and then found herself dowried to the mongrel alien empire that calls itself the culture in transit utaltifuhl the grand zamerin of sursamennariscene in charge of all nariscene interests on the planet and its accompanying solar system and therefore by the terms of the mandate the nariscene held under the auspices of the galactic general council as close as one might get to overall ruler of both was just beginning the long journey to the th great spawning of the everlasting queen on the fardistant home planet of his kind when he met the director general of the morthanveld strategic mission to the tertiary hulian spine paying a courtesy call to the modest but of course influential morthanveld embassy on sursamen in the third equatorial transit facility high above sursamens dark greenblue pocked surface the nariscene were insectile the zamerin was sixlimbed and keratincovered his dark quintuply segmented body a little under a metre and a half long excluding stalks mandibles retracted was studded with implanted jewels inlaid veins of precious metals additional sensory apparatus numerous tiny holoprojectors displaying the many medals honours distinctions and decorations that had come his way over the years and a smattering of light weaponry mostly ceremonial the grand zamerin was accompanied by a bevy of his kind all rather less impressively dressed and slightly smaller than he they were additionally if that was the right word neuters they tended to move through the cavernous webfilled spaces of the transit facility in an arrowhead formation with the grand zamerin forming its tip the morthanveld were spiniform waterworlders the director general was a milkylooking sphere a metre or so in diameter surrounded by hundreds of spiny protrusions of varying thicknesses and in a broad spectrum of pastel colours her spines were mostly either curled up or gathered back at the moment giving her a compact streamlined appearance she carried her environment around with her in a glistening wrap of silvery blue membranes and fields containing her own little sample of oceanic fluids she wore a few small spine torques bracelets and rings she was accompanied by a trio of more stoutly built assistants toting so much equipment they looked armoured the transit facility was a microgravity environment and lightly pressured with a gently warmed gaseous nitrogenoxygen mix the web of lifesupport strands that infested it were coded by colour scent texture and various other markers to make them obvious to those who might need to use them one identified the right strand in the web and hooked into it to receive that which one needed to survive oxygen chlorine salty water or whatever the system couldnt accommodate every known life form without requiring them to protect themselves in a suit or mask but it represented the best compromise its nariscene builders had been prepared to come up with dg shoum my good friend i am glad it was possible for our paths to cross the grand zamerins language consisted of mandible clicks and occasionally directed pheromones the director general understood nariscene reasonably well without artificial aids but still relied on a neurologically hardwired translator ring to be sure of what was being said the grand zamerin on the other hand like most nariscene eschewed alien languages as a matter of both principle and convenience and so would depend entirely on his own translation units to understand the director generals reply grand zamerin always a pleasure formal squirts of scent and packeted water molecules were exchanged members of their respective entourages carefully gathered the greeting messages as much out of politeness as for archival purposes utli director general shoum said reverting to the familiar and floating up to the nariscene she extended a maniple spine the grand zamerin clicked his mandibles in delight and took the offered limb in his foreleg he twisted his head and told his assistants amuse yourselves children he sprayed a little cloud of his scent towards them mixed to indicate reassurance and affection a flush of colour across shoums spines gave a similar instruction to her escorts she set her communications torque to privacy though with a mediumlevel interrupt the two officials floated slowly away through the web of environmental support strands heading for a massive circular window which looked out to the planets surface i find you well shoum asked extraordinarily the grand zamerin replied we are filled with delight to be called to attend the great spawning of our dear everlasting queen how wonderful do you contend for mating rights us me contend for mating rights the grand zamerins mandibles clicked so fast they nearly hummed signalling hilarity gracious no the preferred specification glitchsorry signalled the translator then hurried to catch up the preferred genotypespread called for by the imperial procreational college was far outside our bias i dont believe our family even submitted a tender and anyway on this occasion there was generous leadtime if we had been in the running wed have bred some braw and brawny hunk especially for our dear queen no no the honour is in the witnessing and the lucky father dies i understand of course now that is a distinction they were drifting closer to a great porthole on the underside of the facility showing sursamen in all its dark glory the grand zamerin bristled his antennae as though lost in wonder at the view which he wasnt we had such prominence once he said and the translator if not shoums own processes picked up a note of sadness in amongst the pride utli waved at one of his little holobaubles this you see indicates that our family contributed a speciesfather sometime in the last thirtysix birthgenerations however that was thirtysix birthgenerations ago and sadly short of a miracle i shall lose this decoration in less than a standard year from now when the next generation is hatched you might still hope hope is all the tenor of the times drifts from my familys mode of being we are downwinded other scents outsmell ours the translator signalled an imperfect image and you are compelled to attend utlis head made a shrugging gesture technically we fail to accept the invitation on pain of death but that is for forms sake really he paused not that it is never carried out it is but on such occasions it is generally used as an excuse court politics quite hideous the grand zamerin laughed you will be gone long shoum asked as they arrived at the great window they were still politely holding limbs standard year or so better hang around the court for a while lest they forget who we are let the family scent sink in you know also taking some consecutive leave to visit the old family warrens some boundaries needing redrawn maybe an upstart toiler or two to fight and eat it sounds eventful horribly boring only the spawning thing dragging us back i suppose it is a onceinalifetime experience endofalifetime experience for the father ha ha well you will be missed im sure so am i some dully competent relations of mine will be in charge during our absence the clan girgetioni i say dully competent that may flatter them my family has always been firmly of the opinion that if it is absolutely necessary to take leave of ones responsibilities for a while always be sure to leave surrogates in charge who will ensure your welcome on return will be both genuine and enthusiastic ha ha utlis eye stalks waggled as though in a strong wind indicating humour but this is to jest the girgetioni clan are a credit to the nariscene species i have personally placed my least incompetent nephew in the position of acting zamerin i have the highest possible confidence in him and them and how are things shoum asked within sursamen i mean quiet just quiet shoum asked amused generally not a peep not a molecule from the godbeast in the basement for centuries always reassuring always reassuring utli agreed oh the awful saga of the third level future use committee proceedings rumbles on like cosmic background though at least that might be swept away in some future cataclysm or big concluding event whereas said committee might plausibly go on far far beyond that and redefine the meaning of the term in perpetuity for any entities having the ghastly misfortune still to be around at the time the grand zamerins body shape and scents signalled exasperation the baskers still wish it to be theirs the cumuloforms still claim it as already long promised to them each side has come heartily to despise the other though not wed lifestake a sixth as much as we have come to despise both of them the l swimmers perhaps inspired by the japes the cumuloforms and baskers are having with their dispute have waved a scenttrace to the wide winds regarding the vague possibility of one day perhaps if we wouldnt mind if nobody else would object taking over fourteen the vesiculars of utli paused as he checked elsewhere eleven announced some time ago that they wished to migrate en masse to jiluence which is somewhere in the kuertile pinch and they allege an ancestral homeworld of theirs that was some gross of days ago though and weve heard nothing since a passing fancy probably or art they confuse such terms they confuse us too it may be deliberate possibly too long an association with the oct who are most adept at lateral thinking but seemingly incapable of anything but lateral expression too were there a prize for leasttranslatable galactic species the oct would win every cycle though of course their acceptance speeches would be pure gibberish what else utlis demeanour indicated resignation and amusement then went back to exasperation again mixed with annoyance oh yes talking of the oct who call themselves the inheritors they have managed to antagonise the aultridia of ill repute et cetera through some inebriate machination or other we listened to their petitions before leaving but it all sounds lamentably trivial tribal wars amongst the natives of some cuspid wastelevels the oct may well have been interfering it has been my curse to command the one world where the local oct seem unable to leave well ill or indeed indifferent alone however as they dont appear actually to have transferred any technology to the protégé barbarians concerned we are without immediate excuse to step in ineffably tiresome they meaning the oct and the ghastly squirmiforms wouldnt listen to our initial attempts to mediate and frankly we were too taken up with our leaving preparations to have the patience to persist storm in an egg sac if youd like to take a sniff at the problem do feel free they might listen to you emphasis might though be prepared fully to deploy your masochistic tendencies the director general allowed a flush of amusement to spread across her body so then you will miss sursamen like a lost limb the grand zamerin agreed he pointed his eye stalks at the porthole they both looked down at the planet for some moments then he said and you you and your family group whatever are they well all well and are you staying long here as long as i can without unduly upsetting our embassy here the director general replied i keep telling them i just enjoy visiting sursamen but i believe they think i have an ulterior motive and their preferred candidate is a determination on my part to find something wrong in their conduct she indicated amusement then formality this is a courtesy call no more utli however i shall certainly seek whatever excuses i can to stay longer than the polite minimum simply to enjoy being in this wonderful place it has its own sort of blotchy deeply buried beauty we might be persuaded to concede utli said grudgingly with a small cloud of scent that indicated guarded affection director general morthanveld shoum freechild of meast nest of zuevelous domain of tleish of gavantille prime pliyr looked out over the mighty mostly dark still slightly mysterious world filling the view beneath the transit facility sursamen was a shellworld shellworld it was a name that even now brought a thrill to the very core of her being sursamen an arithmetic shellworld orbiting the star meseriphine in the tertiary hulian spine she could still see the glyphs rippling across the surface of her school teaching mat she had worked hard to be here dedicated her life through study application diligence and no small amount of applied psychology to one day making sursamen an important part of her existence in a sense any shellworld would have done but this was the place that had initiated her enchantment and so for her it had a significance beyond itself ironically the very force of that drive somehow to make herself part of sursamens fate had caused her to overshoot her mark her ambition had carried her too far so that now she had oversight of morthanveld interests within the whole long riversystem of stars called the tertiary hulian spine rather than just the meseriphine system containing the enigmatic wonder that was sursamen with the result that she spent less time here than she would have considered ideal the dim green glow of the gazangya crater lit up her body and that of the grand zamerin the gentle light slowly increasing as sursamen turned and presented more of the vast pockmark of the crater to the rays of the star meseriphine sursamen collected adjectives the way ordinary planets collected moons it was arithmetic it was mottled it was disputed it was multiply inhabited it was multimillionyear safe and it was godded shellworlds themselves had accreted alternative names over the aeons shield worlds hollow worlds machine worlds veil worlds slaughter worlds the shellworlds had been built by a species called the involucra or veil the best part of a billion years earlier all were in orbits around stable mainseries suns at varying distances from their star according to the disposition of the systems naturally formed planets though usually lying between two and five hundred million kilometres out long disused and fallen into disrepair they had with their stars drifted out of their longago allotted positions there had been about four thousand shellworlds originally was the commonly assumed exact number as it was a power of two and therefore by general though not universal assent as round a figure as figures ever got no one really knew for sure though you couldnt ask the builders the involucra as they had disappeared less than a million years after theyd completed the last of the shellworlds the colossal artificial planets had been spaced regularly about the outskirts of the galaxy forming a dotted net round the great whirlpool of stars almost a billion years of gravitational swirling had scattered them seemingly randomly across and through the skies ever since some had been ejected from the galaxy altogether while others had swung into the centre some to stay there some to be flung back out again and some to be swallowed by black holes but using a decent dynamic star chart you could feed in the current positions of those which were still extant backtrack eight hundred million years and see where they had all started out that fourthousandplus figure had been reduced to a little over twelve hundred now mostly because a species called the iln had spent several million years destroying the shellworlds wherever they could find them and nobody had been willing or able to prevent them exactly why nobody was entirely sure and again the iln were not around to ask they too had vanished from the galactic stage their only lasting monument a set of vast slowly expanding debris clouds scattered throughout the galaxy and where their devastation had been less than complete shellworlds that had been shattered and collapsed into barbed and fractured wrecks shrunken compressed husks of what they had once been the shellworlds were mostly hollow each had a solid metallic core fourteen hundred kilometres in diameter beyond that a concentric succession of spherical shells supported by over a million massive gently tapering towers never less than fourteen hundred metres in diameter layered out to the final surface even the material they were made from had remained an enigma to many of the galaxys involved civilisations at least for over half a billion years before its properties were fully worked out from the start though it had been obvious that it was immensely strong and completely opaque to all radiation in an arithmetic shellworld the levels were regularly spaced at fourteenhundredkilometre intervals exponential or incremental shellworlds had more levels close to the core and fewer further out as the distance between each successive shell increased according to one of a handful of logarithmbased ratios arithmetic shellworlds invariably held fifteen interior surfaces and were fortyfive thousand kilometres in external diameter incremental shellworlds forming about twelve per cent of the surviving population varied the largest class was nearly eighty thousand kilometres across they had been machines in fact they had all been part of the same vast mechanism their hollowness had been filled or perhaps had been going to be filled again nobody could be certain this had actually been done with some sort of exotic superfluid turning each of them into a colossal field projector with the aim when they were all working in concert of throwing a force field or shield round the entire galaxy precisely why this had been thought necessary or even desirable was also unknown though speculation on the matter had preoccupied scholars and experts over the aeons with their original builders gone the people who had attacked the worlds seemingly also permanently missing and the fabled superfluid equally absent leaving those vast internal spaces linked by the supporting towers themselves mostly hollow though containing twisted webs of structurally reinforcing material and punctured with portals of various sizes giving access to each of the levels it had taken almost no time at all for a variety of enterprising species to work out that a derelict shellworld would make a vast readymade and nearinvulnerable habitat after just a few relatively minor modifications gases fluids especially water and solids could be pumped or carried in to fill all or some of the spaces between the levels and artificial interior stars might be fashioned to hang from the ceilings of each level like gigantic lamps the various venturesome species set about exploring the shellworlds closest to them and almost immediately encountered the problem that would bedevil frustrate and delay the development of the worlds profoundly for the next few million years and intermittently beyond the shellworlds could be deadly it remained unclear to this day whether the defence mechanisms that kept killing the explorers and destroying their ships had been left behind by the worlds original builders or those who appeared to have dedicated their entire existence to the task of destroying the great artefacts but whether it had been the veil or the iln or as it was now generally agreed both who had left this lethal legacy behind the principal factor limiting the use of the shellworlds as living spaces was simply the difficulty of making them safe many people died developing the techniques by which a shellworld might be so secured and the same lessons generally had to be learned afresh by each competing civilisation because the power and influence which accrued to a grouping capable of successful shellworld exploitation meant that such techniques remained fiercely guarded secrets it had taken an altruist civilisation exasperated and appalled at such a selfish waste of life to come along develop some of the techniques steal others and then broadcast the whole to everybody else they had of course been roundly vilified for such unsporting behaviour nevertheless their actions and stance had in time been ratified and even rewarded by various galactic bodies and the culture although far remote in time from these now longsublimed people had always claimed a sort of kinship by example with them the civilisations which specialised in making shellworlds safe and who effectively took partownership of their interiors became known as conducers sursamen was unusual in that two species the oct who claimed direct descent from the longdeparted involucra and so also called themselves the inheritors and the aultridia a species with what might be termed a poorly perceived provenance had arrived at the same time and begun their work it had also been unusual in that neither species ever got a decisive upper hand in the ensuing conflict which in the only positive aspect of the dispute at least remained localised to sursamen in time the situation within the world had been formalised when the two species were awarded joint protective custody of sursamens access towers by the then newly formed galactic general council though importantly without any stipulation that the two could not contend for increased influence in the future the nariscene were granted full inhabitory rights to the planets surface and overall control of the world formalising their longheld claim to it though even they had to defer ultimately to the morthanveld in whose volume of influence the system and the world lay so sursamen had been colonised making it inhabited and by a variety of species hence the multiply prefix the holes in the supporting towers that might have let gases or liquids vent to lower levels were sealed some effectively permanently others with lock complexes that permitted safe entry and exit while transport mechanisms were installed inside the great hollow towers to allow movement between the various levels and to and from the surface material in gaseous liquid and solid form had been moved in over the many millions of years of the planets occupation and beings peoples species species groups and whole ecosystems had been imported by the oct and the aultridia usually for a consideration of some sort or another sometimes at the behest of the peoples concerned more often at the request of others interior stars had been emplaced these were thermonuclear power sources like tiny suns but with the useful distinction of being antigravitative so that they pressed upwards against the ceiling above any given level they subdivided into fixstars and rollstars the former stationary the latter moving across the skies on predetermined routes and on regular if sometimes when there were many of different periodicities complicated schedules the deaths continued too long after a given shellworld had been apparently deweaponed and made safe hidden defence systems could wake up centuries millennia and decieons later resulting in gigadeaths teradeaths effective civicides and nearextinctions as interior stars fell levels were flooded from above or drained often with the result that oceans met interior stars resulting in clouds of plasma and superheated steam atmospheres were infested by unknown widespeciesspectra pathogens or were turned inexorably into poisonous environments by unseen mechanisms nobody could stop or intense bursts of gamma radiation emanating from the floorceiling structure itself flooded either individual levels or the whole world these were the events that gave them the name slaughter worlds at the point that director general shoum gazed down upon the dark colourspotted face of sursamen no mass deaths had been caused by the shellworlds themselves for nearly four million years so the term slaughter world had long since slipped into disuse save amongst those cultures with exceptionally long memories nevertheless on a grand enough scale the morbidity of any habitat type could be roughly judged by the proportion that had become draazon planets of the dead over time planets of the dead were preserved forbidden monuments to globeencompassing carnage and destruction which were overseen and usually kept in a pristine just postcatastrophe state by the draazon one of the galactic communitys more reclusive semisublimed elder civilisations with attributes and powers sufficiently close to godlike for the distinction to be irrelevant out of the fourthousandplus shellworlds originally existing and the unequivocally remaining in a collapsed state fully eightysix were planets of the dead this was generally agreed to be an alarmingly high proportion all things considered even some of the shellworlds lacking the morbid interest of the draazon had a kind of semidivine investment there was a species called the xinthian tensile aeronathaurs an airworld people of enormous antiquity and according to fable once of enormous power they were the second or third largest airborne species in the galaxy and for reasons known solely to themselves sometimes one of them would take up solitary residence in the machine core of a shellworld though once widespread and common the xinthia had become a rare species and were regarded as developmentally inherently pervasively and permanently senile in the unforgiving language of galactic taxonomy by those who bothered to concern themselves with such anachronisms at all for as long as anybody could remember almost all the xinthia had been gathered together in one place a necklace of airworlds ringing the star chone in the lesser yattlian spray only a dozen or so were known to exist anywhere else and seemingly they were all at the cores of individual shellworlds these xinthians were presumed to have been exiled for some transgression or to be solitudecraving hermits presumption was all anybody had to go on here too as even though the xinthia unlike the longdeparted veil or iln were still around to ask they were even by the standards of the galaxys taciturn cultures quite determinedly uncommunicative hence the godded part of sursamens full description there was a xinthian tensile aeronathaur at its core called by some of the worlds inhabitants the worldgod invariably inside the great worlds and sometimes on their exteriors the shells were adorned with massive vanes whorls ridges bulges and bowls of the same material that made up both the levels themselves and the supporting towers where such structures appeared on the surface of a shellworld the bowlshaped features had usually been filled with mixtures of atmospheres oceans andor terrain suitable for one or more of the many involved species the shallower examples of these somewhat perversely called craters were roofed the deeper usually not sursamen was one such example of a mottled shellworld most of its surface was smooth dark grey and dusty all the result of being lightly covered with nearly an aeons worth of impact debris after systemic and galactic bodies of various compositions sizes and relative velocities had impacted with that unforgiving adamantine skin about fifteen per cent of its external shell was pocked with the covered and open bowls people called craters and it was the greenyblue reflected light of one of those the gazangya crater that shone through the porthole in the transit facility and gently lit up the bodies of the grand zamerin and the director general you are always glad to arrive to see sursamen or any shellworld are you not utli asked shoum of course she said turning to him a little whereas personally the grand zamerin said swivelling away from the view its only duty keeps me here im always relieved to see the back of the place there was a tiny warble and one of his eye stalks flicked briefly over to look at what appeared to be a jewel embedded in his thorax which were informed occurs very shortly our ship is ready shoums comms torque woke to tell her the same thing then went back to its privacy setting relieved really the director general asked as they floated back through the web towards their respective entourages and the docking chutes that gave access to the ships we shall never understand why you are not shoum these are still dangerous places its been a very long time since any shellworld turned on its inhabitants utli ah but still the intervals dear dg the grand zamerin was referring to the distribution of shellworldinduced mass dieoffs through time plotted out they implied only a slow dying away of such titanic murderousness not yet a final end the graphed shape of attacks approached zero but did so along a curve that implied there might be one or two more yet to come probably some time in the next few thousand years if of course that was really the way these things worked the implied threat of future cataclysms might be the result of coincidence nothing more well then shoum said to be blunt we would have to hope it does not happen during our tenure or if does it does not happen in sursamen its just a matter of time the grand zamerin told her gloomily these things turn killer or disappear and nobody knows why yet utli the director general said signalling mischievousness do you not find it in any sense romantic somehow even in a sense reassuring that there are still such mysteries and imponderables in our polished cultivated times no the grand zamerin said emphatically expelling an emission named doubting the sanity of ones companion with barely a trace of humour not even in the abstract not even in the abstract oh well still i wouldnt worry if i were you shoum told utaltifuhl as they approached their attendants i suspect sursamen will still be here when you get back you think its disappearance is unlikely utli said now expressing mock seriousness vanishingly shoum said but the joke didnt translate indeed and of course however it has struck us that so wonderful and enjoyable is the life we lead that a disaster of equal but opposite proportions must always be a threat the higher you build your tower the more tempting a target for fate it becomes well at least you are vacating your tower for the next year i trust the trip home is rewarding and i shall look forward with pleasure to seeing you again grand zamerin and i you director general utaltifuhl told her and performed the most respectful and delicate of formal mandiblenips on her outstretched maniple spine shoum blushed appropriately they had reached their respective entourages and a giant window that looked out the other side of the transit facility to a small fleet of docked ships utaltifuhl looked out at the star craft and emoted dubiety hmm he said and interstellar travel is also not without its risks platform djan seriy anaplian who had been born a princess of the house of hausk a dynasty from a widespectrum panhuman species lately from a median level of the shellworld sursamen and whose middle name basically meant fittobemarriedtoaprince stood alone on a tall cliff looking out over a rust desert deep within the continent of lalance on the planet prasadal a strong wind lashed at her long coat and tore at her clothes she still wore her dark widebrimmed hat and its stiff material was caught and tugged at by the gusting wind as though it was trying to tear it off her head the hat secured by welltied ribbons was unlikely to come off but it meant that the wind made her head shake and nod and jerk as though with palsy the wind carried dust and sand in small dry flurries that came beating up from the desert floor beneath and curling over the serrated edge of the cliff stinging her cheeks where they were exposed between the scarf that covered her mouth and nose and the goggles that protected her eyes she put one gloved hand to the goggles pulling them away from her face a fraction to let a little moisture out from the base of the frames the sparse liquid ran down her cheeks leaving streaks but soon dried in the dusty force of air she took a deep breath through the protecting scarf as the clouds of dust parted like a dry mist allowing her an uninterrupted view of the distant city and the forces that had been besieging it the city was burning siege engines taller than its own towers buttressed its walls like gigantic calipers the desert around it until recently dark with the besieging army was clearing as they poured into the stricken city exposing sand the colour of drying blood smoke tried to rise from the wreckage of the shattered buildings in great curling bundles of darkness but was struck down by the force of the gale flattened and whirled away from the various conflagrations dipping down and back towards the desert to come rearing up again as it met the cliff so that it went billowing over anaplians head in a ragged fastmoving overcast the wind increased in strength out over the plain a wall of dust was forming between her and the city as half the desert seemed to lift into the air gradually dimming and wiping away the view silhouetting a series of rocky outcrops for a few moments until they too were swept under the hem of the advancing dust storm she turned and walked a little way back to where a contraption like a cross between a skeleton and a sculpture sat poised on all fours on the exposed rock she gathered the coat about her and stepped backwards on to the feet of the strange machine the seatrider came alive instantly swinging up fluidly and fitting itself about her clasps closing round ankles thighs waist neck and upper arms nestling its thin form around her like a lover she took the offered control grip as it swung out to her hand and pulled it upwards sending the machine and her flying into the sky then pushed forward so that she went racing through the storm of dust and smoke to the beleaguered city she rose through the haze into clearer air as she built up speed leaving the fields down at first and letting the slipstream buffet her the wind making her coat tails snap like whips and forcing the hats brim to fold itself away then she clicked the streamline field on and rode in a deltashaped bubble of quiet air towards the city she dropped and slowed as she crossed over the walls and turned the streamline field off again she flew between windtwisted columns of smoke watching the besieging forces as they swept into the spaces of the city saw defenders falling back and inhabitants fleeing observed arrows fly and a last few rocks and fire barrels land in the citys upper reaches she smelled the smoke and heard the clash of blades and the crack and rattle of burning and the rumble of falling masonry and the ululating battle cries and war trumpets of the victorious invaders and the wails and screams of the defeated she saw a few tiny figures pointing at her and a couple of arrows arced towards her then fell away again she was knocked to one side and almost thought herself hit with the violence of the action as the seatrider dodged a fire barrel it went past with a great roar and a stench of burning oil looping downwards to crash into the roof of a temple in the upper city splashing flame she turned the full panoply of fields back on hiding her and the machine and enclosing herself in the still bubble of protected air again she had been heading for the centre of the city for what she assumed would be the citadel and the palace but then changed her mind and flew around one side of the city level with its middle reaches watching the general influx of invaders and the chaotic retreat of defenders and civilians while also trying to observe the slighter struggles of small groups and individuals eventually she alighted on the flat lowwalled roof of a modest building where a rape was in progress and a small child cowered in a corner the four soldiers waiting their turn gazed at her with annoyance when she appeared seemingly from thin air stepping off the seatrider their frowns were beginning to turn into appreciative if unpleasant smiles when she drew a sleek chunk of a gun from a shoulder holster and smiling thinly back set about punching headsized holes in each of their torsos the first three men went flying backwards off the roof to the street below in frothy detonations of blood and tissue the fourth man had time to react and as he ducked and started to dive away a tiny part of anaplians combat wiring kicked in flicking the gun more quickly than her conscious mind could have ordered the action and simultaneously communicating with the weapon itself to adjust its emission pattern and beamspread the fourth soldier erupted across the roof in a long slithering torrent of guts a sort of bubbling gasp escaped his lips as he died the man raping the woman was looking up at anaplian mouth open she walked round a few paces to get a clear shot at him without endangering the woman then blew his head off she glanced at the child who was staring at the dead soldier and the form lying underneath the spasming bloodspouting body she made what she hoped was a calming motion with her hand just wait she said in what ought to be the childs own language she kicked the soldiers body off the woman but she was already dead theyd stuffed a rag into her mouth perhaps to stop her screams and she had choked on it djan seriy anaplian let her head down for a moment and cursed quickly in a selection of languages at least one of which had its home many thousands of light years away then turned back to the child it was a boy his eyes were wide and his dirty face was streaked with tears he was naked except for a cloth and she wondered if he had been due to be next or just marked to be thrown from the roof maybe theyd have left him maybe they hadnt meant to kill the woman she felt she ought to be shaking doubtless without the combat wiring she would be she glanded quickcalm to take the edge off the internal shock she put the gun away though even now the boy probably didnt understand it was a weapon and walked over to him crouching down and hunkering as she got up close to him she tried to look friendly and encouraging but did not know what to say the sound of running footsteps rang from the open stairwell on the opposite corner of the roof she lifted the boy by both armpits he didnt struggle though he tried to keep his legs up and his arms round his knees retaining the ball shape shed first seen him in he was very light and smelled of sweat and urine she turned him round and held him to her chest as she stepped into the seatrider it closed around her again offering the control grip as its sliding clicking components fastened her and it together a soldier wielding a crossbow arrived clattering at the top of the steps she took the gun out and pointed it at him as he took aim at her but then shook her head breathed oh just fuck off flicked the controls and zoomed into the air still holding the child the bolt made a thunking noise as it skittered off the machines lower field enclosure and what exactly do you intend to do with it the drone turminder xuss asked they were on a tall stump of rock at least as far downwind from anaplians earlier clifftop vantage point as that had been from the city the child he was called toark had been told not to go near the edge of the great rock column but was anyway being watched by a scout missile turminder xuss had in addition given the boy its oldest and least capable knife missile to play with because the weapon was articulated its stubby sections snicked and turned in the childs hands he was making delighted cooing noises so far the knife missile had suffered this treatment without complaint i have no idea anaplian admitted release him into the wild the drone suggested send him back to the city no anaplian said sighing he keeps asking when mummys going to wake up she added voice barely above a whisper you have introduced a special circumstances apprenticeship scheme on your own initiative the drone suggested anaplian ignored this well look for somewhere safe to leave him find a family that can raise him she told the machine she was sitting on her haunches her coat spread around her you should have left him where he was the drone said above the still strong wind lowering the tone of its voice and slowing its delivery as it tried to sound reasonable rather than sarcastic i know that didnt feel like an option at the time your seatrider tells me you how shall i put this appeared to the attackers and defenders of the city like some demented if largely ineffectual angel before you swooped in and carried little toark away anaplian glared at the seatrider not that the obedient but utterly unintelligent machine would have had any choice but to surrender its memories to the drone when it had been asked what are you doing here anyway she asked xuss shed asked to be left alone for the day to watch the fall of the city it had been her fault after all it had come about due to actions she had taken and indeed helped plan and though it was by no means what had been desired its sacking represented a risk that she amongst others had judged worth taking it was demonstrably not the worst that might have happened but it was still an abomination an atrocity and she had had a hand in it that had been enough for her to feel that she could not just ignore it that she needed to bear witness to such horror the next time if there was a next time if she wasnt thrown out for her irrational overly sentimental actions she would weigh the potential for massacre a deal more heavily we have been summoned the machine said we need to get to the quonber jerle batra awaits its fields flashed a frosty blue i brought the module anaplian looked confused that was quick not to slap your wrist for disturbing the war or rescuing adorable waifs the summons predates such eccentricities batra wants to see me personally anaplian frowned i know not like him it dipped leftright in its equivalent of a shrug it anaplian rose dusting her hands lets go then she called to the boy who was still trying to twist the uncomplaining knife missile apart the module shimmered into view at the cliff edge do you know what his name means the drone asked as the child came walking shyly towards them no the woman said she lifted her head a little she thought shed caught a hint of the smell of distant burning toark the drone said as the boy came up to them politely handing back the knife missile in what they call the old tongue lady when does my mother wake the boy asked anaplian gave what she was sure was a not particularly convincing smile i cant tell you she admitted she held out one hand to guide the child into the modules softly gleaming interior it means lucky the drone finished the module trajectoried itself from the warm winds of the desert through thinning gases into space then fell back into the atmosphere half a world away before toark had finished marvelling at how clean he had become and how quickly anaplian had told him to stand still close his eyes and ignore any tickling sensation then plonked a blob of cleaner gel on his head it torused down over him unrolling like liquid and making him squirm when a couple of smaller circles formed round his fingers and rolled back up to his armpits and back down shed cleaned his little loincloth with another blob but he wanted that gone and chose a sort of baggy shirt from a holodisplay instead he was most impressed when this immediately popped out of a drawer meanwhile the woman and the drone argued about the degree of eyeaverting that ought to be applied to her rulebreaking flight over the city she was not quite yet at the level where the minds that oversaw this sort of mission just gave her an objective and let her get on with it she was still in the last stages of training and so her behaviour was more managed her strategy and tactics more circumscribed and her initiative given less free rein than that of the most experienced and skilled practitioners of that ultimately dark art of always wellmeaning sometimes risky and just occasionally catastrophic interference in the affairs of other civilisations they agreed the drone wouldnt volunteer any information or opinion it would all come out in the end everything came out in the end but by then hopefully it wouldnt seem so important part of the training of a special circumstances agent was learning a that the rules were supposed to be broken sometimes b just how to go about breaking the rules and c how to get away with it whether the rulebreaking had led to a successful outcome or not they landed on the platform quonber a flat slab of hangar space and accommodation units that looked like a small squashed cruise liner albeit one perfectly disguised by a camoufield it floated smoothly in the warm air just over the altitude where a few puffy clouds drifted their shadows spotting the surface of the pale green ocean a couple of thousand metres below directly beneath the platform lay the salt lagoons of an uninhabited island near the planets equator the platform was home to another eleven sc human staff all charged with attempting to alter the development of the various species on prasadal the planet was unusual in having five quite different sentient expansionistaggressive species all hitting their civilisational stride at the same time in all recorded history every other time this had happened without some outside influence taking a hand in matters at least three and usually four of the contending species were simply destroyed by the victorious grouping the cultures notoriously highly detailed and allegedly extremely reliable simulations confirmed that this was just the way things worked out for your average aggressive species unless you interfered when the module arrived everybody else was either on the ground or busy so they saw nobody else as one of the quonbers own slaved drones escorted them along the open sidedeck towards the rear of the platform toark stared goggleeyed through the drop of air towards the salt lagoons far below shouldnt you at least hide the boy the drone suggested what would be the point anaplian asked it the slavedrone showed them into the presence of anaplians control and mentor jerle batra who was taking the air on the wide balcony that curved round the rear portion of the modules third deck jerle batra had been born male he had as was common in the culture changed sex a while and had borne a child later for his own reasons he had spent some time in storage passing a dreamless millennium and more in the closest thing the culture knew to death from which it was still possible to wake and when he had awoken and still felt the pain of being a human in human form he had had his brain and central nervous system transferred sequentially into a variety of different forms ending for now at least with the body type he now inhabited and which he had retained for the last hundred years or so certainly for the decade or more that anaplian had known him that of an aciculate his shape was bushlike his still human brain plus its accompanying biological but nonhuman support systems was housed in a small central pod from which sixteen thick limbs protruded these quickly branched and rebranched to form smaller and smaller limblets maniples and sensor stalks the most delicate of which were hairthin in his normal everyday state he looked just like a small rootless spherical bush made from tubes and wires compressed he was little larger than the helmet of an oldfashioned human spacesuit fully extended he could stretch for twenty metres in any given direction which gave him what he liked to term a high contortionality factor he had in all his forms always worshipped order efficiency and fitness and in the aciculate form felt he had found something that epitomised such values aciculacy was not the furthest one could stray from what the culture regarded as human basic other exhumans who looked superficially a lot like jerle batra had had their entire consciousness transcribed from the biological substrate that was their brain into a purely nonbiological form so that usually an aciculate of that type would have its intelligence and being distributed throughout its physical structure rather than having a central hub their contortionality factor could be off the scale compared to batras other people had assumed the shapes of almost anything mobile imaginable from the relatively ordinary fish birds other oxygenbreathing animals to the more exotic via alien lifeforms again including those which were not normally in the habit of supporting a conscious mind all the way to the truly unusual such as taking the form of the cooling and circulatory fluid within a tueriellian maieutic seedsail or the sporewisp of a stellar fieldliner these last two though were both extreme and oneway there was a whole category of amendations that were hard to do and impossible to undo nothing sanely transcribable had ever been shifted back from something resembling a stellar fieldliner into a human brain a few genuine eccentrics had even taken the form of drones and knife missiles though this was generally considered to be somewhat insulting to both machine and humankind djan seriy anaplian batra said in a very humansounding voice good day oh do i congratulate this is toark anaplian said he is not mine indeed i thought i might have heard anaplian glanced at the drone im sure you would have and handrataler turminder xuss good day to you too delightful as ever muttered the drone turminder this does not involve you initially would you excuse djan seriy and me you might entertain our young friend i am becoming an accomplished childminder my skills grow with every passing hour i shall hone them the drone escorted the boy from the balcony anaplian glanced up at the overhanging bulk of the accommodation deck and took her hat off throwing it into one suspended seat and herself into another a drinks tray floated up batra drifted nearer a greyly skeletal bush about headheight you are at home here he stated anaplian suspected she was being gently rebuked had she been overcasual in her hatthrowing and her seatcollapsinginto perhaps batra was chiding her for not showing him sufficient deference he was her superior to the extent that this wilfully unhierarchic civilisation understood the idea of superiors and inferiors he could have her thrown out of sc if he wanted to or at the very least make her restart the whole process however he wasnt usually so sensitive regarding matters of etiquette it serves she said batra floated across the deck and settled into another of the seats hanging from the ceiling resting in it like a sort of fuzzy vaguely metallic ball he had formed part of the side facing anaplian into a kind of simulated face so that his visual sensors were where the eyes should be and his voice came from where a human mouth would have been it was disconcerting just having a fuzzy ball talking to you would have been much less alarming anaplian thought i understand that events have not ended as well as they might with the zeloynuersotise situation a year ago we disabled and turned back an army on its way to sack a city anaplian said wearily today the wouldbe attackers became the attacked the more progressive tendency as we would put it ought now to prevail though at a cost she pursed her lips briefly part of which i have just witnessed i have seen some of this the image of the face suggested by batras mass of steelylooking tendrils expressed a frown then closed its eyes politely indicating that he was reviewing data from elsewhere anaplian wondered if he was watching general views of the siege and sacking of the city or something that included her unwarranted excursion on the seatrider batras eyes opened again the knowledge that so much worse happens where we do nothing and always has long before we came along and that so much worse might happen here were we to do nothing seems of very little significance when one is confronted with the grisly reality of aggression we have failed to prevent all the more so when we had a hand in allowing or even enabling it he sounded genuinely affected anaplian who was innately suspicious of perfectly one hundred per cent natural utterly unamended humanbasic humans wondered whether batra this bizarre manytimesalien twothousandyearold creature that still thought of itself as he was expressing sincere emotion or simply acting she wondered this very briefly having realised long ago the exercise was pointless well she said it is done and much more remains to be done batra said thatll get done too anaplian said beginning to lose patience she was short on patience she had been told this was a fault i imagine she added the metallic bush rolled back a little and the face on its surface seemed to nod djan seriy i have news batra said something about the way the creature said this made her quail really she said feeling herself battening down shrinking inward djan seriy i have to tell you that your father is dead and your brother ferbin may also be deceased i am sorry both for the news itself and to be the one who bears it she sat back she drew her feet up so that she was quite enclosed in the gently swinging egg of the suspended seat she took a deep breath and then unfolded herself deliberately well she said well she looked away it was of course something she had tried to prepare herself for her father was a warrior he had lived with war and battle all his adult life and he usually led from the front he was also a politician though that was a trade hed had to train himself to do well rather than one that he had taken to entirely naturally and excelled at she had always known he was likely to die before old age took him throughout the first year when she had come to live amongst these strange people that called themselves the culture she had half expected to hear he was dead and she was required to return for his funeral gradually as the years had passed she had stopped worrying about this and also gradually she had started to believe that even when she did hear he was dead it would mean relatively little to her you had to study a lot of history before you could become part of contact and even more before you were allowed to join special circumstances the more shed learned of the ways that societies and civilisations tended to develop and the more examples of other great leaders were presented to her the less in many ways she had thought of her father she had realised that he was just another strong man in one of those societies at one of those stages in which it was easier to be the strong man than it was to be truly courageous might fury decisive force the willingness to smite how her father had loved such terms and ideas and how shallow they began to look when you saw them played out time and time again over the centuries and millennia by a thousand different species this is how power works how force and authority assert themselves this is how people are persuaded to behave in ways that are not objectively in their best interests this is the kind of thing you need to make people believe in this is how the unequal distribution of scarcity comes into play at this moment and this and this these were lessons anybody born into the culture grew up with and accepted as being as natural and obvious as the progression of a star along the main sequence or evolution itself for somebody like her coming in from outside with a set of assumptions built up in a society that was both profoundly different and frankly inferior such understanding arrived in a more compressed time frame and with the impact of a blow and ferbin dead too perhaps that she had not expected they had joked before shed left that he might die before his father in a knife fight over a gambling game or at the hand of a cuckolded husband but that had been the sort of thing one said superstitiously inoculating the future with a weakened strain of afflictive fate poor ferbin who had never wanted to be king do you need time to grieve batra asked no she said shaking her head fiercely are you sure positive she said my father did he die in battle apparently so not on the battlefield but of his wounds shortly after before he could receive full medical attention hed rather have died on the field itself she told batra he must have hated having to settle for second best she found that she was both crying a little and smiling when did it happen she asked eleven days ago batra made a bristling motion even news of such importance travels slowly out of a shellworld i suppose anaplian said her expression thoughtful and ferbin missing on the same battlefield anaplian knew what that meant the vast majority of those labelled missing in battles either never reappeared at all or turned up dead and what had ferbin being doing anywhere near a battle in the first place do you know where she asked exactly how farflung a province was it near the xiliskine tower she stared at him what near the xiliskine tower batra repeated within sight of pourl that is the capital isnt it yes anaplian said her mouth was suddenly quite dry dear god it had all fallen away then it had all crumbled and gone she felt a sorrow she barely understood so was this some excuse me she cleared her throat was this a final stand in that case and why hadnt she heard why had no one told her things had reached a point of such awful desperation were they afraid shed try to return and use her newfound skills and powers to intercede were they worried shed try to join the fray was that it how could they now djan seriy batra said while i have been briefed in this i cannot claim to have immediate access to an expert database however i understand that it was the result of what was expected to be a surprise attack by the deldeyn what from where anaplian said not even trying to hide her alarm from this xiliskine tower but theres no way out of she began then put one hand to her mouth pursing her lips and frowning as she stared at the floor they must have opened a new she said more to herself than to batra she looked up again so is the xiliskine controlled by the aultridia now or first let me assure you that as i understand it pourl and your fathers people are not under threat the deldeyn are the ones facing disaster anaplians frown deepened even as the rest of her body showed signs of relaxing how so your father had effectively completed his wars of unity as he termed them really she felt a surge of relief and a perverse urge to laugh he did keep busy the deldeyn would appear to have assumed that theyd be his next target they therefore staged what they hoped would be a decisive preemptive surprise attack on your fathers capital city having been convinced by the oct inheritors synonyms anaplian flapped one hand again either that they the oct would deliver the deldeyn forces in secret to where a new portal would be opened in the xiliskine tower through which they might effect such an attack taking the city this was a ruse and one which the sarl were party to your fathers forces were waiting for the deldeyn and destroyed them anaplian looked confused why were the oct deceiving the deldeyn this is still a matter for conjecture apparently and the aultridia the other conducer species they have backed the deldeyn in the past they are believed to be considering military and diplomatic action against the oct hmm so why anaplian shook her head once more what is going on back there she asked again jerle batra suspected this question was not really directed at him he let her continue so ferbins in charge no of course hes probably dead too oramen then she asked looking worried and sceptical at once no your younger brother is deemed too young to inherit all your fathers power immediately a man called mertis tyl loesp is regent until your brothers next birthday tyl loesp anaplian said thoughtfully she nodded at least hes still around he should be all right your younger brother wont be in any danger will he danger batras impersonated face configured a weak smile it has been my understanding that like wicked stepmothers ambitious regents do not usually come out well from such contexts perhaps that is only in tales no anaplian said with what sounded like relief she wiped her eyes tyl loesps been my fathers best friend since they were children hes always been loyal fastened his ambitions to my fathers god knows they were grand enough for two grand enough for a host anaplian looked away to one side where the bright tropic air of this place that she had almost come to think of as home over the last two years now seemed as far away as it had when shed first arrived though what do i know its been fifteen years she wondered how much ferbin had changed in that time and oramen her father she strongly suspected would hardly have changed at all he had been the same forbidding occasionally sentimental rarely tender utterly focused individual for as long as shed known him utterly focused yet with one eye always on history on his legacy had she ever known him most of the time he wasnt there to be known in the first place always away fighting his distant wars but even when he had returned to pourl his palace concubines and children he had been more interested in the three boys especially elime the eldest and by far the most like him in character second in age her gender and the circumstances of her birth had fixed the kings only daughter firmly last in his affections should i leave you djan seriy batra asked hmm she looked back at him i thought you may need time alone or do you need to talk either is i need you to talk to me she told him what is the situation now on what is called the eighth stable the king is mourned with all due has he been buried he was due to be seven days ago my information is eight or nine days old i see sorry go on the great victory is celebrated preparations for the invasion of the deldeyn continue apace the invasion is widely expected to take place between ten and twenty days from now the oct have been censured by their nariscene mentors though they have blamed everybody else for what has happened including elements within their own people the aultridia have as i have said threatened retaliation the nariscene are trying to keep the peace the morthanveld are so far not involved though they have been kept informed she pinched her lower lip with her fingers she took a breath and said how long would it take for me to get back to sursamen a moment please batra said falling silent for a moment while she imagined he consulted the course schedules of whole networks of distant ships she had time to wonder why he hadnt already memorised or at least accessed this information and whether this possibly deliberate hesitation implied a criticism of her for even thinking of abandoning her post here between one hundred and thirty and one hundred and sixty days batra told her the uncertainty comes from the changeover to morthanveld space morthanveld space the morthanveld were the highestlevel involved species around sursamen as part of her training anaplian had studied and been suitably stunned by the full threedimensional map of all the various species that inhabited the galaxy and had spread sufficiently far from their homes to discover that they were profoundly not alone the standard star chart detailing the influence of the bettertravelled players was fabulously complex and even it only showed major civilisations those with just a few solar systems to their name didnt really show up even with the holomap filling ones entire field of vision generally overlapping often deeply interconnected slowly shifting subject to continual gradual and very occasionally quite sudden change the result looked like something committed by a madman let loose in a paint factory the morthanveld held sway over vast regions of space one tiny pocket of which happened to include the star around which her home planet orbited they had been there or spreading slowly out in that direction for longer than the culture had existed and the two civilisations had long since settled into a comfortable and peaceful coexistence though the morthanveld did expect all but the most pressing business crossing their sphere of influence to be conducted using their own spacecraft having immersed herself in the politics geography technology and mythology of prasadal for over two intense demanding years and having almost ignored outside events for the same amount of time anaplian realised she had half forgotten that the culture was not somehow the totality of the galactic community that it was indeed a relatively small part even if it was a powerful and almost defiantly widespread one would i be excused here she asked batra djan seriy the metallic bush said and for the first time something other than its pretended face moved its sides expanding in a gesture that looked a lot like a human spreading their arms you are a free agent nothing keeps you here but you you may go at any time but would i be welcome back would i still have a place in sc if i did return home could i come back here to prasadal none of that is for me finally to decide the creature was being evasive it would have a say even if the final decision might be made by some tiny clique of ship minds spread throughout the culture and across the galaxy anaplian arched one eyebrow take a guess sc id imagine yes here i can only imagine how long would you be going for do you think i dont know anaplian admitted and neither would we it is unlikely you would start any return journey within a few days of arriving you might be gone a standard year all told perhaps longer who can say we would have to replace you here there was a degree of margin in the system here of course her colleagues could fill in for her for a while at least leeb scoperin especially knew what anaplian had been doing in her part of the planet and seemed to have the sort of natural understanding of her aims and techniques that would let him take over her role with as little turbulence as possible plus he was one of those training an assistant so the overall burden wouldnt be too great but that sort of arrangement would not do for ever a little slack was one thing but leaving people feeling useless for extended amounts of time was pointless and wasteful so the platform was not overstaffed for the task in hand batra was right theyd have to replace her you could give me a ship anaplian said that would get her there and back quicker ah batra said that is problematical this was one of his several ways of saying no the culture was being especially careful not to offend the morthanveld at the moment the reason was officially moot though there had been some interesting suggestions and one in particular that had become the default explanation anaplian sighed i see or she could just stay here she supposed what good after all could she do back home avenge her father that was not a daughters duty the way the sarl saw things and anyway it sounded like the deldeyn were about to have more than sufficient vengeance visited upon them long before she would be able to get there her father would have been the aggressor in all this anyway she had no doubt that the preemptive attack the deldeyn had launched was anything other than just that an attempt to stop the sarl under king hausk invading them perhaps she would just make a bad situation worse if she went back things would be in turmoil enough without her suddenly reappearing she had been away too long she thought people would have forgotten about her and everything would have changed anyway she was female after fifteen years living in the culture it was sometimes hard to recall just how misogynist her birthsociety had been she might go back and try to affect things only to be laughed at scorned ignored oramen was clever if still young hed be all right wouldnt he tyl loesp would take care of him her duty arguably lay here this was what she had taken on this was what she had to do what she was expected to finish she knew that could affect the course of history on prasadal it might not always go as shed wish and it could be bloody but her influence was in no doubt and she knew that she was good at what she did on the eighth and the ninth given that the deldeyn had been forced into the matter she might effect nothing or only harm that was not what she was being trained to do her father had sent her to the culture as payment if you wished to be brutal about it she was here as the result of a debt of honour she had not been banked far away from sursamen as some sort of insurance neither was it assumed she would be educated further and returned an even more fit bride for some foreign prince to cement an alliance or tiein a far away conquerance her duty in perpetuity was to serve the culture to repay it for the help through the man called xide hyrlis it had given her father and the sarl people king hausk had made it perfectly clear that he did not expect ever to see his only daughter again well he had been right about that when this bargain had first been suggested she had struggled with the competing emotions of pride at being asked to play such an important role and anguish at experiencing a rejection even more final and complete than all the other rejections her father had made her suffer at the same time there had been a kind of triumph coursing through her that had been stronger still than either feeling at last at last she would be free of this idiot backwater at last she could develop as she wished not as her father and this femalefearing womandemeaning society demanded she was accepting an obligation she might spend the rest of her life fulfilling but it was one that would take her away from the eighth away from the sarl and the constrictions of the life she had gradually realised with increasing dismay through her girlhood she would otherwise have been expected to lead she would still be going into service but it was service in faraway exotic places service in a greater cause and perhaps even one that actually involved action not simply the requirement to please a man and produce a litter of petty royals her father had thought the culture representatives effeminate fools for being more interested in her than in her brothers when hed insisted on sending one of his children into their employ even his respect for xide hyrlis had suffered when he too had suggested little djan should be the one to go and anaplian didnt know of anyone save perhaps tyl loesp that her father had thought as highly of as hyrlis her father had barely pretended to be sorry that they had chosen his troublesome discontented discounted daughter rather than one of his precious sons if of course she wished to go the cultures representatives made it very clear that they had no desire to coerce her into their employ naturally as soon as theyd asked shed had no choice her father had been convinced hed been presented with an absolute bargain and hurried her departure before the culture could see sense and change its mind but it was precisely what she would have chosen anyway she had pretended she had pretended to her father and the rest of the court to be reluctant to go to the culture in just the way that a girl chosen to be a bride was expected to pretend to be reluctant to go to her new home and husband and she had trusted that the culture people would see that this was an act for appearances sake to observe the niceties they had and shed duly gone with them when the time came she had never regretted it for a moment there had been times many of them when shed missed her home and her brothers and even her father times when shed cried herself to sleep for many nights at a time but not once not even for an instant had she thought that she might have made the wrong choice her duty was here then her father had said so the culture special circumstances no less assumed so and was relying on her to remain here no one on the eighth would expect her to return and if she did there was probably nothing useful she could do yet what was duty what was obligation she had to go and knew it in her bones she had been silent just a few moments she did something she only ever did with reluctance and clicked into her neural lace and through it into the vast bludgeoningly vivid metaexistence that was the sc version of the cultures dataverse a clamorous phantasmagoric scape opened instantly in front of her and flicked all around confronting pervading anaplian in this minddazzling seemingly frozen blink of time was a collection of inputs using every amendedrange sense available this barely graspable riot of sensory overload presented itself initially as a sort of implied surrounding sphere along with the bizarre but perfectly convincing sensation that you could see every part of it at once and in more colours than even the augmented eye possessed the immediately appreciable surface of this vast enclosing globe was less than tissue thin yet seemed to connect with senses deep inside her as the colossal but intricate simulation suffused into what felt like every fragment of her being you thought through to an apparent infinitude of further membranes each with its own sensory harmonics like a lens adjusting to bring different depths within its field of vision into focus it was a given that this perceptual frenzy was as close as a human or anything like a human could get to knowing what it was like to be a mind only politeness prevented most minds pointing out that this was the drastically coarsened savagely cutdown vastly inferior wellbelownurserylevel version of what they themselves were immersed within throughout every moment of their existence even without consciously thinking about it she was there with a diagrammatic and dataended representation of this section of the galaxy the stars were shown as exaggerated points of their true colour their solar systems implied in logscaled plungefoci and their civilisational flavour defined by musical notegroups the influence of the culture was signalled by a chord sequence constructed from mathematically pure wholetone scales reaching forever down and up an overlay showed the course schedules of all relevant ships and a choice of routes was already laid out for her colourcoded in order of speed strand thickness standing for ship size and schedule certainty shown by hue intensity with comfort and general amenability characterised as sets of smells patterns on the strands making them look braided like rope indicated to whom the ships belonged circles and ellipses mostly confronted her a few supplementally more complicated shapes squiggled through the view where ships anticipated describing more eccentric courses between the stars over the next few tens and hundreds of standard days seemingly unbidden another line formed in the overlay almost perfectly straight showing her how quickly the nearest available unit of the cultures fleet of very fast pickets could get her there crude flight time was a little over a dozen days though it would take almost as long for the ship to get to prasadal to pick her up in the first place other ships could have made the journey in even less time though they were too far away there was a degree of favourable uncertainty in the projection it applied only to culture vessels that were currently making their whereabouts known it was entirely possible that another ship of the rapid asset fleet not currently bothering to circulate its location was even closer and would respond positively to a broadcast request but that wasnt going to happen batra had made that clear she wiped the offending overlay from the view she would have to take the prescribed route and be passed like a baton from ship to ship it looked complicated a lot of very clever processing had already gone on in her neural lace to predict what shed want to look at effectively before she knew herself and fabulously convenient and highly technically impressive though this might be it was this aspect of laceuse that most disturbed anaplian and caused her to keep its application to a minimum in the end she didnt even need to pull out any dataends to check the raw figures there was one fairly obvious route through this tangled scribble from prasadal to sursamen and it would indeed take at least one hundred and twentynine and a bit days if she left any time within the next two days assuming that the morthanveld end of things went as fortuitously as it might a lot seemed to depend on whether the morthanveld great ship inspiral coalescence ringdown decided to take in the nestworld syaungun on its way from one globular cluster to another she was about to click out when a barely formed thought regarding exactly what a morthanveld great ship and a nestworld actually were started to blossom into a whole hierarchy of increasingly complicated explanations as the lace raced to retrieve and present the relevant information with all the desperate enthusiasm of an overenthusiastic child asked to perform a party piece she shut it down with a sort of inward slam and clicked out again with the usual sense of relief and vague guilt the last vestige of the laces presence informed her that her heart was still completing the beat it had been beginning when shed first clicked in it was like waking up though from a dream world where everything was more detailed vivid splendid and even plausible than reality not less that was another reason she didnt like using the lace she wondered briefly how jerle batras normality compared to hers im sorry i think i have to go she told him think djan seriy batra asked sounding sad i am going she said i must i see now the man who looked like a fuzzy little bush sounded apologetic there will be a cost djan seriy i know scholastery ferbin otz aelshhauskr and his servant choubris holse were riding along an illkept road through a forest of cloud trees towards the xiliskineanjrinh scholastery they had chosen to travel through the long halfnight of the rollstar guime which showed as a sullen red glow spread like a rosy bruise across the farpole horizon they had pulled off the road only twice so far once to avoid a troop of mounted ichteuen and once when a steam truck had appeared in the far distance the prince no longer looked like himself holse had closecut his scalp his facial hair was growing quickly darker than his head hair nearly brown which peeved him disproportionately he had removed all his rings and other regal jewellery and he was dressed in clothes holse had obtained from the battlefield from a corpse ferbin had spluttered staring down at himself wideeyed holse had thought to inform the prince of the provenance of his newtohim civvies only after hed put them on one with no obvious wounds sir holse had assured him reasonably just a little bleeding from the ears and nose dead a good two or three days too so any fleas would assuredly have caught cold and jumped ship and he was a gentleman too i might add an army private provisioner unless im mistaken thats not a gentleman ferbin had told his servant patiently thats a merchant hed pulled at his sleeves held out his hands and shaken his head if there had been any aerial activity unlikely in the near darkness they didnt see it at any rate nobody came swooping down to inspect them as they trudged on holse on his rowel and ferbin on the mersicor his servant had brought to the folly overlooking the river four days earlier holse had dug a couple of wads of crile root from a saddle bag to help keep them awake as they rode and they chewed on this while they talked it gave their conversation what holse felt was a rather comical munchy sort of quality though he thought better of mentioning this to ferbin choubris holse it is your duty to accompany me to wherever i might choose to go id beg to differ sir theres no differing involved duty is duty yours is to me within the kingdom and within the rule of the kings law id not argue with you sir it is my duty beyond that reach i might think to question holse you are a servant i am a prince youd be best advised to do as youre damn well told even were i some lowly gent with no more than a tumbledown fort a fleabitten nag and too many children to his name as servant to a prince the senior prince i might add of the royal house of hausk ferbin broke off choking on his own amazement and disgust at encountering such obduracy in a servant my father would have you thrashed for this holse i tell you or worse damn it man i am the rightful king sir i am with you now and intend to stay with you until the varsity and thence to whatever conveyance you might find beyond that which they are able to recommend you to to that very point i shall be at your side as faithful as ever and there you damn well have to stay wherever i go sir pleasing your pardon my allegiance at the bottom of the pot after all reduction as it were is to the throne rather than to your good self once you remove yourself from the furthest extent of your fathers conquests it is my understanding that i am bound to return to the seat of authority which i would take to be the royal palace in pourl all other matters being in normal balance there to take fresh instruction from well whomsoever holse are you a lawyer dear god forbid sir then shut up your duty is to stay with me thats the all and end of it my duty begging your pardon sir is to the king but i am the king havent you been telling me for the last four days that im the rightful heir to the throne sir excuse my bluntness but you are an uncrowned king who is riding most determinedly away from his throne yes yes to save my life to seek help so that i may return to claim that throne if the worldgod lets and i would point out in doing so i am following the highest precedents does not the worldgod find its own sanctuary from cares here at the core of our blessed world did not the sarl people themselves flee persecution on their homeworld escaping here to our own dear sursamen still sir being a king has its expectations one is letting people know youre alive is it really well well ferbin said deciding to be witheringly sarcastic do you tell me that now and what else might one ask well sir acting in a kingly manner regarding the taking up of the reins of power by dispute if needs be rather than leaving them to fall to choubris holse you will not lecture me in the art of kingcraft or my regal obligations and responsibilities indeed not sir i agree most completely lecturing is the province of the scholastic monk types towards which we make our way no argument there from me sir holses rowel snored as though in agreement their animals were bred to nightwalk and could literally walk in their sleep though they needed the odd prod to keep them on the road i decide my duty holse not you and my duty is not to let myself be murdered by those who have already killed one king and would not flinch from adding another that is me to their score holse looked up at the nearungodly vastness of the hicturean tower rising to their left like fate the skysupporting stem was skirted with grassed and forested slopes their steepness increasing as they approached the topmost edge where piled up against the smooth uncanny surface of the tower the ground and foliage broke like a dark green wave against the trunks vast pale roundness glowing in the low red light like the bone of some longdead god holse cleared his throat these documents we go in search of sir they dont work the other way do they the other way what do you mean holse well would they let you travel downwards to the core to see the worldgod sir holse had no idea how these things worked he had never really bothered with religion though he had always paid lipservice to the church for the sake of an easy life he had long suspected that the worldgod was just another convenient semifiction supporting the whole structure that sustained the rich and powerful in their privilege to see if its divineness might help you he shrugged it would save all the bother of travelling to the surface and then to the external stars sir that is impossible holse ferbin said patiently trying not to lose his temper at such childish drivel the oct and thank god the aultridia are forbidden from interfering with the worldgod they may not descend to the core therefore neither may we he might have replied at greater length but following an inopportune partial inhaling of a wellchewed wad of crile root he was struck by an attack of coughing and spent much of the next few minutes wheezing and spluttering and refusing holses repeated offers to administer a forceful slap on the back the hictureananjrinh scholastery sat on a low hill a days ride from the hicturean tower in the direction of nearpole so that the great column was almost directly between it and pourl like most scholasteries the place was forbiddinglooking even if technically it was unfortified it looked like a long low castle with its curtain wall removed it had two turrets but they housed telescopes rather than guns the visible walls actually looked quite jolly painted in all sorts of different colours but it still appeared somehow grim to ferbin he had always been rather in awe of such places and the people who inhabited them to give yourself up to a life of study thought and contemplation seemed like well such a waste he tipped continually between contempt for anyone who could cut themself off from so much that made life fun just to pursue this abstraction they called learning and something close to reverence deeply impressed that seriously clever people would willingly choose such an abstemious existence it was to one of these places that he knew djan seriy would have wanted to go had she been free to choose she hadnt been of course and anyway the culture had made off with her some of her letters home to her family after she had gone with them had spoken of places of learning that sounded a lot like scholasteries ferbin had formed the impression that shed learned a great deal far too much in the snorting estimation of their father later letters seemed to hint that she had become some sort of warrior almost a champion they had worried about her sanity at first but woman warriors were not unknown everybody had thought they belonged firmly in the past but well who knew the ways of the aliens the superior mentor and optimae races and who could say what others were beyond knowing so much of life went in great circles in wheels of good and ill fortune maybe woman warriors were part of some utterly strange and incomprehensible future ferbin hoped she was a warrior if he could get to her or at least get word to her djan seriy might be able to help him the rollstar obor was spreading a slow reluctant dawn to their right as they approached they passed apprentice scholars leaving the scholastery compound to work in the fields orchards and streams around the jumble of gaily painted buildings they nodded helloed waved hats ferbin thought they looked almost happy an increasing number of the cities of the sarl were becoming host to something like a scholastery though these urban institutions offered more practical instruction than the ancient usually remote and rural scholasteries many merchants and even some nobles were starting to send their sons to such modern varsities and ferbin had heard of one in reshigue that accepted only girls though that was reshigue and everybody knew the people of that thankfully distant city were mad no telegraph connection that i can see holse pointed out casting his gaze about the jumble of buildings that may be to the good well see hmm ferbin said ferbin rarely prayed it was a failing he knew but then a noble one hed always told himself even gods he felt sure must have limited patience and even attention by not praying he was leaving the floor of the divine court that little bit less crowded and so free for more deserving less fortunate people whose own prayers would therefore stand by that same increment more likely to be heard above whatever hubbub must surely fill said assembly in fact he took comfort in the fact that being a prince his entreaties would of course have been given priority in the worldgods petitionary court he would have had a naturally louder voice as it were and so by his modest selfeffacing absence he did far more good than a fellow of more limited importance would have done by such an act of selfsacrifice still the worldgod was there and while going to see it as holse had suggested was patently ridiculous prayers were assuredly listened to sometimes indeed the worldgod was said to intervene in the affairs of people taking up the cause of the good and just and punishing those who had sinned it would therefore positively be dereliction of princely duty not to entreat the deity even if it did as it surely would already know of the terrible events that had befallen ferbin and which might be about to befall the sarl people as a whole with a usurper in their midst and indeed in charge the worldgod might not feel able to act until it had received a sort of formal request from him the rightful king he wasnt sure exactly how these things worked never having paid attention in divinity classes but he had a feeling it might be something like that dear god god of the world support me in my cause let me escape my pursuers if ah assuming there are pursuers if not then let there continue not to be any aid my getting out of the world and finding xide hyrlis and my dear sister djan that she may succour me let her be not turned away from her brother by the luxuries and umm luxuriances of the culture people please god visit the most terrible and disgusting tribulations and humiliations upon the filthy usurper tyl loesp who killed my father there is a foul fiend indeed god there is a monster in the form of man you must have seen what happened god and if not look into my memory and see it seared in there like a brand burned and fixed for ever what more awful crime has there ever been what ghastliness committed between your skies can outdo that atrocity ferbin found he was growing breathless and had to stop to collect himself god if you punish him most severely i shall rejoice if not then i shall take it as a sure and certain sign that you grant him not even the honour of divine retribution but leave his punishment for human hand that hand may not be my own i am as your good self knows more of a man of peace than of action but it will be at my instigation i swear and it will be a sorry tower of anguish and despair that bastard suffers beneath and the others all who helped him all them too i do swear this on the violated body of my own dearly loved father ferbin swallowed coughed you know i ask this for my people not for myself god i never wanted to be king though i will accept this burden when it falls to me elime he should have been the king or oramen might make a good king one day i im not sure id be very good at it i never have been sure but sir duty is duty ferbin wiped some tears away from his tightly closed eyes thank you for this my god oh also i would ask you to make my idiot servant see where his true duty lies and get him to stay with me i have no skill negotiating the base vulgarities of life whereas he has and argumentative wretch though he may be he makes progress the smoother for me ive hardly dared let him out of my sight since i began to worry he might run off and i cannot think how daunting my way would be without him please also let the head scholar here one seltis be well disposed to me and not remember that it was i who put the tack on his seat that time or the maggot into his pie on that other occasion actually twice come to think of it anyway let him have a tower travel warrant thing that he doesnt mind letting me have so that i can get away from here grant me all of this worldgod and on my fathers life i swear i shall build a temple to your greatness mercy and wisdom that will challenge the towers themselves umm right with all my ah well thats all ferbin sat back opening his eyes then closed them and went on one knee again oh and ah thank you he had been given a small cell in the scholastery after theyd arrived and announced themselves as a gentleman traveller and his assistant a title a promotion even that holse had insisted upon who had need of an audience with the head scholar ferbin found it strange to be treated like an ordinary person in a way it was almost fun but it was also a little shaming and even annoying despite the fact it was this disguise of ordinariness that might well be all that was keeping him alive being asked to wait while anybody other than his father found time to see him was a novel experience too well not that novel perhaps certain ladies of his knowledge were prone to such tactics too but that was a delicious sort of waiting even if at the time seemingly intolerable this was not delicious at all this was frustrating he sat on the small sleeping platform in the little room looked round the bare sparsely furnished space and briefly took in the view towards the hicturean tower most scholastery windows looked towards towers if they could he looked down at his clothes stolen from a dead man he shivered and was hugging himself when the door was struck loudly and almost before he could say enter choubris holse had swung into the room looking unsteady his face flushed sir holse said then seemed to collect himself drawing himself up and producing a nod that might have been the remnants of a bow he smelled of smoke the head scholar will see you now sir i shall be there directly holse ferbin said then recalling that the worldgod allegedly helped those most given to helping themselves a treatise holse himself most obviously lived by he added thank you holse frowned and looked confused seltis my dear old friend it is i ferbin entered the office of the head scholar of hictureananjrinh scholastery and held his arms open the elderly man in slightly wornlooking scholastic robes sat on the far side of a broad paperlittered desk blinking behind small round glasses that you are you sir is one of lifes great undeniables he replied do you apply for position by stating such truisms and claiming them profound ferbin looked round to make sure the door had been closed from outside by the serving scholar who had let him in he smiled and approached the head scholars desk arms still outspread no seltis i mean it is i he lowered his voice ferbin who once was your most exasperating yet still i hope most loved pupil you must pardon my disguise and i am glad that it is so effective but it is most assuredly me hello old friend and most wise tutor seltis rose an expression of some wonder and uncertainty on his withered face he made a small bow by god i do believe it might be too his gaze searched ferbins face how are you boy no longer a boy seltis ferbin said taking a comfortable seat to one side of the desk in a small bay window seltis remained at his desk looking over a small cart full of books at his former pupil ferbin let a serious even tormented expression take over his features rather a young man old friend and a happy carefree one at that until a few days ago dear seltis i saw my own father murdered in the most obscene circumstance seltis looked alarmed and held up one hand he turned away from ferbin and said munhreo leave us please yes head scholar said another voice and somewhat to ferbins horror a young man dressed in the robes of a junior scholar rose from a small paperpiled desk set in one alcove of the room and with a fascinated glance at ferbin went to leave the room munhreo the head scholar said to the youth as he was opening the door the young scholar turned round you heard nothing do you understand the young scholar made a small bow indeed sir ah he must study the art of hiding that one eh ferbin said awkwardly after the door had closed he is trustworthy i believe seltis said he drew his own seat over and sat by ferbin still studying his face remind me my assistant at the palace who would that have been ferbin frowned blew out his cheeks oh i dont know youngish chap cant recall his name he grinned sorry and did i ever implant the name of the capital of voette sufficiently well for it to take root ah voette knew an ambassadors daughter from there once lovely girl she was from nottle gottle dottle something like that that right the capital of voette is wiriniti ferbin seltis said wearily and i truly do believe you are who you say excellent welcome sir i have to say though we had been informed that you were killed prince and if the wishes of that murderous scheming turd tyl loesp made such things so i would be old friend seltis looked alarmed the new regent whats the cause of this hatred ferbin related the fundamentals of his story since the moment he and his party had crested the cherien ridge and looked out over the great battlefield seltis sighed polished his glasses twice sat back sat forward again stood up at one point walked round his seat looked out through the window and sat back down again he shook his head a few times and so myself and my unreliable servant are here to ask for your help dear seltis firstly in getting a message to oramen and also in getting me away from the eighth and from the great world itself i have to warn my brother and seek my sister i am that reduced my sister has been with these optimae the culture for many years and has by her own account learned such things that even you might find impressive she may even have become a sort of female warrior as i understand it in any event she might have or can call upon powers and influences that i myself cannot help me make my way to her seltis and help me warn my brother and my gratitude i swear will be great i am the rightful king even if i am not the anointed monarch my formal ascension lies in the future as must your reward even so one as wise and learned as yourself no doubt understands even better than i the duty a subject owes to their sovereign i trust you see that i ask for no more than i have every right to expect well ferbin the old scholar said sitting back in his seat and taking his glasses off again to inspect them i dont know which would be the more confounding that all you say is true or that your skills in fictive composition have suddenly improved a millionfold he placed his glasses back on his nose truthfully i would rather that what you say is not so i would rather believe that you did not have to witness what you did that your father was not murdered and our regent is not a monster but i think i have to believe that all you claim is true i am sorry for your loss ferbin beyond words but in any case i hope you see that it is as well i attempt to restrict your stay here to a minimum i will certainly do all i can to assist you on your way and i shall depute one of my senior tutors to take a message to your brother thank you old friend ferbin said relieved however you should know that there are rumours against you ferbin they say that you deserted the battlefield shortly before your death and that many other crimes large and small domestic and social are being piled against you now that you are thought safely dead what ferbin shouted as i say seltis said they seek by the sound of it to make you illmissed and perhaps if they suspect you are not dead to make it the more likely that you will be betrayed by anyone you reveal yourself to take all care young man that was boy and prince that hopes to be king inequity upon infamy ferbin breathed his mouth drying as he spoke injustice piled upon outrage intolerable intolerable a terrible anger built within him causing his hands to shake he stared at his trembling fingers marvelling at such a physical effect he swallowed looking at his old tutor with tears in his eyes i tell you seltis at every point at which i feel my rage cannot conceivably grow any further having reached the outermost extremity of that possible for a man to bear i am propelled further into indecent fury by the next action of that unspeakable puddle of excrement tyl loesp taking account of all you say seltis said rising that is hardly to be wondered at he went to a sash hanging by the wall behind his desk will you have something to drink some respectable wine would not go amiss ferbin said brightening my servant favours stuff youd hesitate to rinse a rowels arse with seltis pulled on the sash a gong rang distantly he came and sat down with the prince again i take it you wish me to recommend you to the oct for entowerment for transportation to the surface whatever you call it ferbin said eagerly sitting forward yes naturally there are in theory royal prerogatives i might use but that would amount to suicide with a pass from you i might hope to evade tyl loesps spies and informants rather more than just spies and informants in potential at least the whole of the army and even all of the people seltis said everyone thinking themselves loyal will be turned against the one they ought to be loyal to indeed ferbin said i must trust to my own wits and those of my irritating but wily servant seltis looked concerned ferbin thought a servant came to the door and wine was ordered when the door was closed again ferbin leant forward and said solemnly i have prayed to the worldgod good seltis that can do no harm the head scholar said looking no less concerned someone rapped loudly on the door enter seltis called the kitchens are not usually so choubris holse lunged into the room nodded briefly at the head scholar and to ferbin said sir i fear we are discovered ferbin leapt to his feet what how holse looked uncertainly at seltis little scholar fellow on the roof sir heliographed a passing patrol three knights on caude just coming in to land munhreo the head scholar said also standing maybe theyre just visiting ferbin suggested in the circumstances assume the worst seltis told him moving to his desk youd best get going ill try to detain them as long as i can well never outrun them on mounts ferbin protested seltis do you have any flying beasts no ferbin we do not he took a small key from a drawer kicked a rug behind his desk against the wall and grunting knelt on the boards opening a small hatch in the floor and taking out two thick heavy grey envelopes stoutly secured with thin metal bands he opened a flap in each package and quickly wrote their names then stamped the scholastery seal on them here he said handing the envelopes to ferbin the dnengoal tower the towermaster is one aiaik ake ferbin said seltis tutted and spelled the name for him aiaik ferbin said thank you seltis he turned to his servant holse what are we going to do holse looked pained i have reluctantly had an idea sir the three caude were tied to a hitching ring on the flat roof of the scholasterys main building a small crowd of mostly young scholars and servants had gathered to gape at the great air beasts which had settled on their haunches on the roof and were munching on whatever was in their nose bags giving every impression of ignoring the crowd around them with a degree of disdain a warm gusting wind ruffled their crests and made the gaudy coverings under their saddles flap ferbin and holse hurried up the steps and crossed the roof make way holse shouted striding through the crowd ferbin drew himself up to his full height and strode manfully too affecting an expression of hauteur yes out of my way he yelled holse moved a couple of youthful scholars aside with the flat of his hand and then pointed at another you untie the beasts just two now i was told to guard them by their riders the youth protested and im telling you to untie them holse said drawing his shortsword what a sheltered life they must lead here ferbin thought as the youngsters eyes went wide and he started fumbling with the reins of one of the beasts amazed at the sight of caude and impressed by a drawn sword you holse shouted at another youth help him ferbin felt rather proud of holse if a little envious too even resentful he admitted to himself he wished he could do something dynamic or at least useful he looked at the twenty or so faces confronting him trying to remember what the scholar called munhreo had looked like is munhreo here he said loudly cutting through a dozen muttered conversations sir he went with the knights said one voice the various conversations resumed ferbin glanced back at the stairs that led to the roof whos most senior here he barked looks were exchanged in a moment one tall scholar stepped forward i am you are aware what these are ferbin asked pulling the two fat envelopes from his jacket more wide eyes and some nodding if you are loyal to your head scholar and your rightful king guard that stairway with your life make sure nobody else comes up it and stop anybody from leaving the roof too until weve gone sir the tall scholar looked initially doubtful but he took a couple of his peers and went to stand by the steps the rest of you kindly stand over there ferbin said indicating the far corner of the roof there was some muttering but the scholars complied he turned back holse was removing the nose bag from one of the caude he emptied the bag with a flick while the creature was mewling in protest turned the caude round to face towards the nearest edge of the roof and then quickly threw the emptied bag over the beasts head do the same with the other one would you sir he asked ferbin and moved to the caude which was still tied up make sure it points the same way as that one ferbin did as hed been asked starting to understand why he felt sick the two caude with the nose bags over their heads laid their heads obediently on the surface of the roof and might already have been asleep holse gentled the third caude patting its nose and murmuring to it even as he brought the shortsword to its long neck he slashed its throat deep and hard and the creature jerked back snapped its tied reins and fell over backwards wings half extending then folding back again long legs kicking then to the shocked cries of several of the scholars it went still dark blood pooling on the roofs dusty paving holse flicked blood from his sword sheathed it and strode past ferbin he whipped the nose bags off the two surviving caude their heads rose and deep grumbling noises issued from their wide mouths jump on sir he said try and keep it from seeing the dead one ferbin mounted the nearest caude fitting himself into the deep saddle and drawing its belt over while holse was doing the same ferbin was buttoning his jacket tight when his caude bent its long leathery neck back and looked at him with what might have been a puzzled expression possibly registering the fact that it had a rider different from the one it was used to caude were fabulously stupid animals the intelligence had been bred out of them as obedience and stamina had been bred in ferbin had never heard of one being trained to accept just one rider he patted the beasts face and sorted its reins then kicked its sides and got it to rise on its great long legs and half open its wings with a dry rustling sound suddenly he was towering over the collection of startled shockedlooking scholars ready holse shouted ready ferbin yelled they kicked the caude forward to the edge of the roof the animals jumped on to the parapet and in the same heartstopping movement launched themselves into the air just as shouts from the stairway end of the roof rang out ferbin whooped half in fear and half in excitement as the great wings opened with a snap and he and the caude started to fall towards a flagstoned courtyard half a dozen storeys below the air roaring in his ears the caude began pulling out of its dive heavying him into the saddle the wind screamed about him and he caught a glimpse of holse to his side grimfaced hands clenched round the reins as they levelled out and the giant beasts took their first flap at the air distant popping noises behind them might have been gunfire something whizzed past between his caude and holses but then they were beating out away from the scholastery over the fields and streams reception a reception was held in a grand drawing room of the palace after the state funeral of the late king and his internment in the hausk family mausoleum which lay some distance outside the farpole edge of the city walls it had rained since morning and the day was still dark beyond the tall windows of the great room hundreds of candles burned by mirrored walls the king had recently had installed lights which consumed lampstone and others which arced electricity to make light but both had proved problematic in operation and oramen was glad to see the candles they gave a softer light and the room didnt stink of the noxious gases the other types of lamp gave off fanthile oramen said seeing the palace secretary sir fanthile in his most formal court clothes all trimmed with mourning red bowed deeply to the prince this is the sorriest of days sir we must hope it marks the end of the very sorriest of times my father would have wanted it no other way oramen saw a couple of fanthiles assistants waiting behind him as good as hopping from foot to foot like children in need of the toilet he smiled i believe youre needed fanthile with your leave sir of course oramen said and let fanthile go to arrange whatever needed to be arranged he supposed it was a busy time for the fellow personally he was quite content to stand and watch the atmosphere in the echoing great space it seemed to oramen was one almost of relief he had only recently developed a feeling for things like the atmosphere of a room amazingly this was something ferbin had purposefully taught him before oramen had tended to dismiss talk of such abstracts as atmosphere as somehow unimportant stuff adults talked about for want of anything actually worth discussing now he knew better and by measuring his own submerged mood he could attempt to gauge the emotional tenor of a gathering like this over the years oramen had learned much from his older brother mostly things like how to behave so as to avoid beatings tutors tearing their hair out scandalised lenders petitioning ones father for funds to pay gambling debts outraged fathers and husbands demanding satisfaction that sort of thing but this was an instance when ferbin had had a proper lesson he could actually teach his younger brother rather than simply exemplifying the bad example ferbin had taught oramen to listen to his own feelings in such situations this had not been so easy oramen often felt overwhelmed in complicated social environments and had come to believe that he felt every emotion there was to feel at such times so that they all cancelled each other out or none at all eitherly the result was that he would just stand there or sit there or at rate just be there at whatever ceremony or gathering he was present at seemingly near catatonic feeling thoroughly detached and declutched a waste to himself and an embarrassment to others he had never suffered especially as a result of this mild social disability one could get away with almost anything being the son of the king as ferbin seemed to have spent most of his life attempting to prove however such incidents had come to annoy him and hed known that they would only increase as he grew older and even as the younger prince hed be expected to start taking a fuller part in the ceremonial and social workings of the court gradually under ferbins admittedly casual tutelage he had learned to seek a sort of calmness in himself and then amplify what feeling was still there and use that as his marker so that if after a little immersion in a social grouping he still felt tense when he had no particular reason to then the shared feeling amongst that group must be something similar if he felt at ease then that meant the general atmosphere was also placid there was here he thought standing looking out over the people collecting in the great drawing room genuine sadness as well as an undercurrent of apprehension regarding what would happen now with the great king gone his fathers stature had risen all the higher with his death as if he was already passing into legend but there was too a kind of excitement everyone knew that the preparations for the attack on what was thought to be the now neardefenceless deldeyn were being stepped up and the war perhaps as the late king had believed the last ever war was therefore approaching its conclusion the sarl would achieve a goal they had been pursuing for almost all the life of their departed king the deldeyn would be defeated the loathsome and hated aultridia would be confounded the worldgod would be protected who knew even saved and the oct the longterm allies of the sarl would be grateful one might even say beholden the new age of peace contentment and progress that king hausk had talked so much about would finally come to pass the sarl would have proved themselves as a people and would as they grew in power and influence within the greater world and eventually within the alieninhabited skies beyond take their rightful place as one of the inplay as an involved species and civilisation a people fit perhaps one day no doubt still some long way in the future to treat even the optimae of the galaxy the morthanvelds the cultures and who knew what alien others as their equals that had always been his fathers ultimate aim oramen knew though hausk had known that hed never see that day neither would oramen or any children he would ever have but it was enough to know that one had done ones bit to further that albeit distant goal that ones efforts had formed some sturdy part of the foundations for that great tower of ambition and achievement the stage is small but the audience is great had been one of king hausks favourite sayings to some degree he meant that the worldgod watched and hopefully somehow appreciated what they were doing on its behalf but there was also the implication that although the sarl were primitive and their civilisation almost comically undeveloped by the standards of say the oct never mind the nariscene still less the morthanveld and the other optimae nevertheless greatness lay in doing the best you could with what you were given and that greatness that fixity of purpose strength of resolve and decisiveness of action would be watched and noted by those far more powerful peoples and judged not on an absolute scale on which it would barely register but on one relative to the comparatively primitive resources the sarl had available to them in a sense his father had told him once his contemplative moods were rare so memorable the sarl and people like them had more power than the ungraspably supreme optimae peoples with their millions of artificial worlds circling in the sky their thinking machines that put mere mortals to shame and their billions of starships that sailed the spaces between the stars the way an iron warship cruised the waves oramen had found this claim remarkable to put it kindly his father had explained that the very sophistication the optimae and their like enjoyed acted as binds upon them for all the legendary size of the great island of stars that existed beyond their own world of sursamen the galaxy was a crowded settled muchlivedin place the optimae the morthanveld the culture and so on were selfconsciously wellbehaved and civilised peoples and existed hipbyhip with their fellow inhabitants of the great lens their realms and fields of influence and to a degree their histories cultures and achievements tended to intermingle and overlap reducing their cohesiveness as societies and making a defensive war difficult similarly there was little or nothing they ever needed to compete for and so might come to arms over instead they were bound by numerous treaties agreements accords conventions and even never fully articulated understandings all designed to keep the peace to avoid friction between those who were entirely alien in form to one another but entirely alike in having reached the plateau of civilisational development where further progress could only take one away from the real life of the galaxy altogether the result was that while their individuals had what appeared to be complete freedom within their societies the societies themselves had very little freedom of movement at all certainly not that seemingly implied by their colossal martial potential there was simply not much left for them to do on any grand scale there were no or at least very few great wars at this level no vast tusslings for position and power except by the slowest and most subtle of manoeuvrings the last great or at least fairly substantial conflict had been a millennium of eighth shortyears ago when the culture had fought the idirans and that had been bizarrely over principle at least on the culture side oramen suspected that if it had not been xide hyrlis himself who had confirmed the truth of this his father would never have believed anything that seemed to him so decadently preposterous the optimae had no kings to move a whole people to a single purpose at once they had no real enemies they felt they had no choice but to fight and they had nothing they valued that they could not somehow produce seemingly at will cheaply and in whatever quantities they chose so there were no resources to fight over either but they the sarl the people of the eighth this little race of men they and their like were free to pander to their natures and indulge in their disputes untrammelled they could do in effect and within the limits of their technologies as they liked was that not a fine feeling some of the treaties the optimae indulged in amongst themselves were framed so as to allow people like the sarl to behave like this unfettered in the name of noninterference and resisting cultural imperialism was this not rich their licence to fight and lie and cheat their way to power and influence was guaranteed by spacealien statute the king had found this thoroughly amusing the stage is small but the audience is great he had repeated but never forget he had told oramen that you might be in more of a theatre than you thought the abilities of the optimae easily encompassed watching all that was going on amongst people as defenceless to such technologies as the sarl it was one of the ways that the optimae refreshed their jaded palates and reminded themselves what a more barbarous life was like they watched for all the world like gods and while various agreements and treaties were supposed to control and restrict such spying they were not always observed decadent it might be but it was the price a people like the sarl had to pay perhaps for their sanction to behave in ways that the optimae might otherwise find too distasteful to allow but never mind maybe one day the descendants of the sarl would spend their time flying between the stars and watching their own mentored primitives dispute happily by then his father had informed the youthful oramen they would both be long and safely dead who knew to what extent the sarl were observed oramen looked about the great room and wondered maybe alien eyes were watching this great mass of people all dressed in their deep red clothes maybe they were watching him right now oramen my sweet young prince the lady renneque said suddenly at his side you must not just stand there people will think you a statue come be my escort to the grieving widow well pay what respects are due together what do you say oramen smiled and took the ladys offered hand renneque was radiantly beautiful in her crimson gown her nightdark hair was not quite perfectly contained in a scarlet mourning cap ringlets and curls had sprung out here and there framing her perfectly smooth and flawless face you are right oramen said i should go to see that lady and say the right things they walked together through the crowd which had greatly increased in size since oramen had last paid proper attention to it as more mourners had been delivered by their carriages there were hundreds of people here now all dressed in a hundred shades of red only the urletine mercenaries emissary and the knight commander of the ichteuen godwarriors seemed to have been excused and even they had made an effort the emissary had removed almost all the dried enemy bodyparts from his clothing and donned a brown cap that no doubt appeared red to him while the knight commander had concealed his most shocking facial scars with a crimson veil and not just humanity was represented he could smell the presence of the oct ambassador kiu in amongst this the animals of the court ynt like anklehigh furry waves slinking sinuously across the floor always sniffing happily trailing vermilion ribbons ryre tiptoeing decorously usually by walls thinly kneehigh evercharmed by their own reflection watchful barely tolerating crimson collars choups bouncing and skittering on the polishedtoagleam wood tiles bumping into peoples thighs and waists alarmed at any alienness proudly sporting little saddles for children flanks tiedover with red to indicate mourning like fullsize mounts throughout the kingdom on this day all caparisoned in scarlet moving through the crowd in renneques rustlingly red wake oramen gave many small smiles to many slightly anxious faces trying to hit on the right combination of regretful grief and encouraging friendliness renneque kept her face modestly down yet seemed to appreciate every glance cast her way and to be energised by the attention you have grown oramen she told him slipping back to his side it seems that only yesterday i could look down on you but no more youre taller than me now practically a man i trust i grow rather than you shrink what oh renneque said and squeezed his hand with every appearance of bashfulness she glanced up so many people oramen all would be your friends now i did not think i lacked for friends before but i suppose i must accept i was wrong will you go with the army oramen down into the ninth to fight the dreadful deldeyn i dont know its not really for me to decide renneque looked down at her fine red gown being kicked out ahead of her with every step perhaps it should be perhaps i hope the victory is quick i want to see the great falls at hyengzhar and the nameless city i have heard they are most spectacular my friend xidia shes older than me of course but still she saw them once in more peaceful times her father was ambassador to the deldeyn he took her she says they are like nothing else a whole city imagine that i should like to see them im sure you shall they arrived at where harne the lady aelsh was seated surrounded by her own ladies many clutching handkerchiefs and still dabbing at their eyes harne herself looked dryeyed though grim oramens late father had never taken any lady to be his queen thinking it best to leave that position free in case he needed to use it as a method of securing a troublesome or muchrequired territory it was said that king hausk had come close to marrying several times certainly the subject had been raised amongst the ambassadors and diplomats of the court often enough and if you believed every rumour he had been nearly married to almost every eligible princess of the eighth and at least one from the ninth in the event his feats of arms had done all the securing required without recourse to a diplomatic or strategic marriage and instead he had chosen to make a series of more tactical alliances within the nobility of his own kingdom through a judicious choice of honoured concubines oramens own mother aclyn the lady blisk who had also birthed his elder brother the late and still sorely lamented elime had been banished shortly after oramen had been born allegedly at the insistence of harne who being older it was said had felt threatened or perhaps there had been a fallingout between the two women versions varied according to whom within the palace you listened to oramen had no memories of his mother only of nurses and servants and an occasionally visiting father who somehow contrived to seem more remote than his utterly absent mother she had been banished to a place called kheretesuhr an archipelagic province in the vilamian ocean towards the far side of the world from pourl one of oramens goals now that he was at least approaching the true seat of power was to secure her return to the court he had never expressed this desire to anyone yet he had always felt that somehow harne must know this the final link in this unhappily expansive family had been vaime the lady anaplia always frail she had collapsed when heavily pregnant the doctors had told the king he could save the mother or the child but not both he chose to save the child expecting a boy instead he was presented with a tiny premature dot of a girl he was so appalled at this disaster that the infant wasnt even named for a month eventually she was called djan over the years the king had made no secret least of all towards djan herself that had he known her gender before birth she would have been sacrificed for the good of her mother his only solace had been that he might marry the girl off one day for diplomatic profit the king had lately taken another couple of junior concubines though these were kept in a smaller palace in another part of the city again at the insistence of harne according to palace gossip however it was harne that was recognised as his widow in all but name the two younger concubines had not even been present at the service or internment nor had they been invited here madam good lady oramen said bowing deeply to harne it is only in you that i feel my sense of loss is matched even outweighed i beg you accept my most sincere condolences if we may take one ray of light from this dark time let it be that you and i grow closer than we have been my fathers death and that of your son giving birth to a more affectionate relationship between us than that which has existed in the past the king always sought harmony even if through initial conflict and ferbin was the very soul of sociability we might honour both their memories by seeking our own concord hed had this little speech this careful formed set of words prepared for some days now he had meant to say the kings death but it had come out otherwise he had no idea why he felt annoyed at himself the lady aelsh kept her strict expression but made a small inclination of her head thank you for your words prince im sure they would both be pleased if all could be in agreement within the court we might all take pains to celebrate them so and that oramen thought as renneque fell to harnes side and took the older womans hands in hers and shook them as she told her how awful was her own grief will just have to do it was not outright rejection but neither was it quite what hed been hoping for he caught harnes gaze briefly while renneque talked on he bowed and turned away how go our preparations field marshal oramen asked the gauntly forbidding form of the armys newly promoted chief werreber was standing drink in hand gazing out at the rain falling over the city he turned and looked down at oramen satisfactorily sir he said gravely the rumours say we attack within ten days i have heard as much myself sir oramen smiled my father would have loved to have been at the head of our forces he would indeed sir we will not suffer by his lack i mean sufficiently for there to be any doubting the outcome he is a great loss sir werreber said however he left the army in its best deportment and there is of course an urge amongst the men to avenge his death hmm oramen said frowning i heard that the deldeyn prisoners were slaughtered after his death there was killing sir it was a battle after the battle though when by every other standard and practice of my father prisoners are meant to be treated as we would want any of our own taken there was killing then too sir it is to be regretted doubtless the men were blinded by grief i have heard it said that my father ordered the slaughter i am sorry you have heard that sir you were there with him when he died dear werreber do you remember such an order the field marshal drew back and up a little and appeared positively discomfited prince he said looking down his great long nose at him it is sad but there are times when the less that is said about certain matters the better it is for all a clean wounds best left only pain comes from poking and prodding at it oh werreber i could not be there at my fathers death i have a need natural to any son to know quite how it was can you not help fix it in my mind so that secured its easier to leave it finally alone otherwise i must imagine the scene the words the actions and all these things shift because they are not established for me so it becomes a wound i cannot help but return to the field marshal looked as uncomfortable as oramen had ever seen him i was not present throughout the incident of your fathers dying he said i was with the exaltine on our way having been summoned or for some long time outside the building not wishing to make a crowd while efforts to save the kings life continued i heard no such order given by your father regarding the prisoners but that does not mean it was not given it hardly matters sir done to order or in an excess of grief the enemy concerned remain dead so id not dispute oramen said it was more the reputation of my father i was thinking of he must have been in great pain and distress sir a fever can afflict men in such circumstances they become other than themselves and say things they would never say otherwise even the bravest it is often not an edifying spectacle i repeat sir it is all best left alone are you saying that at the very end he did not die as he had lived he would think that a severe charge no sir i am not in any event i did not see the very end werreber paused as if unsure quite how to express himself your father was the bravest man i ever knew i cannot imagine he met death with anything other than the fierce composure with which he faced its threat so many times during life also though he was never one to dwell excessively on the past even having made a mistake he took what he might learn from it and then dismissed it we must do as he would have done and turn our attention to the future now sir might i be excused i believe i am needed at headquarters there is much still to be planned of course werreber oramen said sipping his drink i did not mean to detain you or unduly press on any wound sir the field marshal bowed and departed oramen counted himself privileged to have got so much from werreber who was known as a man of few words this was a description unsuited to the exaltine chasque the next figure he approached seeking detail of his fathers death the exaltine was rotund in body and face and his dark red robes bulked him out still further he blustered over his own part in the deathbed scene claiming his eyes had been too full of tears and his ears brimming with the lamentations of all around to recall much clearly and so do your studies progress young prince the exaltine asked as though returning to the more important subject eh do you continue to sup at the well of learning hmm oramen smiled he was used to adults asking about favourite school subjects when they could think of nothing else to talk of or wished to get off an awkward subject so he replied perfunctorily and made his escape they say the dead look back at us from mirrors dont they gillews the royal physician turned round with a startled expression on his face and then staggered and nearly fell over your that is prince oramen the doctor was a small tense nervouslooking man at the best of times he seemed now positively abuzz with energy also from his continued swaying and the glassy look about his eyes quite drunk too he had been staring at his reflection in one of the mirrors that covered half the walls of the drawing room oramen had been looking for him moving amongst the throng accepting sympathies dispensing solemn pleasantries and trying to look and be grieving brave calm and dignified all at once did you see my father gillews oramen asked nodding to the mirror was he in there looking down on us whats that the doctor asked his breath smelled of wine and some unsluiced foodstuff then he seemed to catch up with what was going on and turned swaying again to look into the tall mirror what the dead no i see no one saw nobody indeed not prince no my fathers death must have affected you deeply good doctor how could it not the little fellow asked he wore a doctors skullcap but it had slipped to one side and come forward too so that it was starting to droop over his right eye wispy white hairs protruded he looked down into his nearempty glass and said how could it not again im glad i found you gillews oramen told him i have wanted to talk to you since my father was killed the doctor closed one eye and squinted at him uh he said oramen had grown up with adults getting drunk around him he didnt really enjoy drinking the sensation of being dizzy as though you were about to be sick seemed an odd state to pursue with such determination but he quite liked being with drunk people having learned that they often gave away the true natures they otherwise contrived to hide or just let slip some item of information or gossip they would not have parted with so casually when sober he already suspected he had got to dr gillews too late but hed give it a try anyway you were with my father when he died obviously it was a most obvious death sir true the doctor said and strangely attempted a smile this dissolved quickly into an expression of some despair then he dropped his head so that his expression was unreadable and started muttering what sounded like well not obvious why obvious gillews you idiot doctor id know how my father was in those last minutes this is a matter of some importance to me i feel i cant put him fully to rest in my mind until i know please can you recall to rest gillews said what rest what rest is there rest is rest is beneficial renews the frame redefines the nerves resupplies the muscles and allows the mechanical stresses on the greater bodily organs to abate yes that is rest and crave it we might death is not rest no death is the end of rest death is decay and rotting down not building up dont talk to me of rest what rest is there tell me that what rest where when our king lies heavy in his grave for whom eh i thought not oramen had taken a step back as the doctor raved at him he could only wonder at the depths of emotion the poor man must be feeling how he must have loved his king and how devastating it must have been for him to lose him to be unable to save him the doctors two principal assistants moved in on either side to take gillews arms supporting him one took his glass and pushed it into a pocket the other looked at oramen smiled nervously and shrugged he mumbled something apologeticsounding that ended in sir what gillews said head tipping from side to side as though his neck was half broken eyes rolling as he tried to focus on the two young men my pallbearers already is it to a council of my peers an arraignment before the shades of physicians past throw me in the mirror let me reflect he pitched his head back and wailed oh my king my king then slumped in the grip of the two men weeping the assistants took gillews stumbling away dear oramen tyl loesp said appearing at oramens side he looked after the departing figures of gillews and his two helpers the doctor may have enjoyed his drink too much he enjoys nothing else oramen said i feel outdone in unkiltered grief there is appropriate grief and inappropriate grief dont you think tyl loesp said standing close to oramen towering over him white hair shining in the candlelight his dark red trous and long jacket contrived to make him look no less massive than hed looked in full armour the evening hed brought the kings body back from the battlefield oramen was growing tired of being polite did my father die well in the end tyl loesp he asked tell me please tyl loesp had been bending over oramen a little now he drew himself back and up like a king should sir i was never more proud of him nor held him in greater esteem as at that moment oramen put his hand on the tall warriors arm thank you loesp it is my pleasure and my duty young prince i am but the stake to support a sapling you have supported me well in this and i am in your debt never so sir never so tyl loesp smiled at oramen for a moment or two then his gaze flicked to somewhere behind the prince and he said here sir look a more welcome face my prince said a voice behind oramen he turned to find his old friend tove lomma standing there smiling tove oramen said equerry tove if youll have me prince regent equerry oramen asked to me of mine id hope nobody else would have me in fact a most able young man tyl loesp said clapping both lomma and oramen on the shoulders remember merely that he is meant to keep you out of mischief not lay a course towards it tyl loesp smiled at oramen ill leave you two to plot much good behaviour he bowed shortly and left tove looked rueful not a day for mischief prince not this one but we must hope there will be many in the future well share none if you dont call me by my name tove tyl loesp instructed me most strictly that you were the prince regent nothing more familiar tove said and pretended to frown consider that order rescinded by me duly agreed oramen lets have a drink tower fate i tell you if not the hand of the worldgod itself or whatever manipulatory appendage worldgods possess anyway the hand metaphorically of the worldgod possibly i think you underguess the workings of blind chance sir blind chance that took me to that dreadful place unarguably sir your startled mount ran crosscountry until it found a track naturally it then took the levelled road rather than the coarse ground and of course it took the easier downhill route then that old mill appeared on the first place where the road widens and levels out natural place for it to stop ferbin looked across at the prone form of his servant lying on the ground a couple of strides away across the leaflittered ground with a large blue leaf poised over his head choubris holse looked calmly back they had flown straight out from the scholastery until hidden from it by a line of low hills then set down on a sloped heath above the limit of cultivated land i think ive heard of the dnengoal tower ferbin said while they inspected the two grumbling huffing caude but im damned if i know which way it is same here sir said holse he opened up one of the saddle bags on his beast though with any luck therell be a map in here let me just have a quick furtle he dug his hand elbowdeep into the bag the saddle bags yielded maps some food a little water a telescope a heliograph two hefty pocket chronometers one barometeraltimeter some rifle and pistol ammunition but no weapons four small bomblets like smooth hand grenades with cruciform flights padded jackets gauntlets one small blanket each and the usual paraphernalia of tack associated with caude including a good supply of the krisk nuts they found so stimulating holse popped one in the mouth of each animal they mewed and whinnied appreciatively ever tried these things sir holse asked holding up the bag of krisk no ferbin lied of course not bloody horrible bitter as a scolds piss he put the bag away fastened the saddle bags and adjusted his saddle and these bastard knights that came to the scholastery must be ascetics or something for theres no sign of any of the little niceties that make life bearable for the common man sir like wine or unge or crile bloody fliers holse shook his head at such lack of consideration no goggles or masks either ferbin pointed out must have carried them with them holse was checking one of the pistol rounds theyd discovered in the saddle bags against one from his own gun lets have a quick look and then be off eh sir he said then shook his head and dumped all the ammunition on the heath they consulted the maps one of which was of sufficient scale to show the land for nearly ten days flying around pourl depicting hundreds upon hundreds of the great towers as well as the shade limits and periods of the various rollstars there it is ferbin said tapping on the map what would you say sir four shortdays flying more like three ferbin said glad to have found a practical subject he knew so much more of than his servant five towers along and one down four times over then three and one away from pourl which is to the good he glanced up at obor its redtinged bulk was still barely above the horizon as it rose upon its slow and settled course its a longday today we shall have to let the beasts daysleep but we should achieve the tower before dusk could do with a snooze myself holse yawned he looked disparagingly at his mount which had tucked its long neck under its massive body to lick its genitals rather hoped id seen the last of these things this close i do confess sir holses caude removed its head from between its legs though only long enough for it to fart long and loud as though to confirm its new riders poor opinion you are not enamoured of the beasts of the air holse indeed not sir if the gods had meant us to fly theyd have given us the wings and the caude the pox if they hadnt meant us to fly gravity would be stronger ferbin replied i wasnt aware it was adjustable sir ferbin smiled tolerantly he realised that his servant might not be versed in the kind of alien lore that would insist that what he and holse had known all their lives as normal gravity was about half standard whatever that really meant however holse said lets get moving eh they both went to saddle up best put these jackets on ferbin said itll be cold up there he gestured upwards clouds are clearing so well be able to go high holse sighed if we must sir ill work the clock shall i ferbin held up the chronometer that necessary sir ferbin who had got lost while flying too many times mistakenly thinking that you could never miscount things as big as towers or fall asleep in the saddle for that matter said i think it advisable they had flown without incident at the altitude best for caude cruising stamina they had seen other fliers far in the distance but had not been approached the landscape moved slowly beneath them changing from tiny fields to stretches of waste and heath that were low hills then back to fields small towns and great glaring areas of bright green that marked the roasoaril plantations whose fruits went to feed the refineries which produced the fuel to power the steam engines of the modern age slowly over the horizon appeared a handful of long fingers of shining water that were the quoluk lakes ferbin recognised the island that held the hausk family estate of moiliou the river quoline gathered water from all the lakes and then wound away towards the distant equator vanishing in the haze canals blinked reflecting sunlight like thin threads of silver spearing straight over level areas and describing curving contours about raised ground even in the jacket ferbin shivered his knees covered only in hose and trous were especially cold not having goggles or a mask meant his eyes were watering all the time hed wrapped his collar scarf round his lower face but it was all still most uncomfortable he kept an eye on the chronometer clipped to the tall front edge of his saddle and used a waterproof pad and wax crayon also attached to the saddle to mark down the passing of each great tower as it loomed and then slid slowly past to their right the towers as ever were a source of a kind of odd comfort from this height more of them were visible than one saw from the ground and one was able to form a proper impression of their numbers and regular spacing only from this sort of altitude ferbin thought did one fully appreciate that one lived within a greater world a world of levels of regularly spaced floors and ceilings with the towers holding one above the other they rose like vast spars of pale luminescence masts of a celestial ship of infinite grace and absolute inconceivable power high above just visible the laciness of filigree showed where the towers splayed summits still fourteen hundred kilometres over his and holses heads for all their chilly altitude fluted out like an impossibly fine network of branches from a succession of vast trees a million towers held the world up the collapse of just one might destroy everything not just on this level their own dear eighth but on and in all the others too the worldgod itself might not be beyond harm but then it was said that the towers were near invulnerable and sursamen had been here for a thousand times a million years whether this meant their own shortyears or longyears or socalled standard years he didnt know with such a number it hardly mattered ferbin wiped his eyes free of tears and looked carefully around taking time to let his gaze rest on a succession of distant points the better to catch any movement he wondered how long it would take for word to get back to pourl of what had happened at the scholastery riding there would take five days or so but using the heliograph perhaps another patrol would be attracted and in reality the knights whod lost their mounts only needed to get to the nearest telegraph station plus the patrol would be missed when it didnt return search parties would be sent out and would no doubt be signalled from the scholastery seltis would surely be questioned would they stoop to torture what if he told them about the documents and the dnengoal tower well he and holse had little choice they would make the best time they could the rest was up to luck and the worldgod their beasts started to show signs of fatigue ferbin checked the chronometer they had been in the air nearly ten hours and must have flown over six hundred thousand strides six hundred kilometres they had passed twelve towers to their right and flown left by one tower every five obor a slow orange rollstar was just approaching its noon they were about halfway they descended found an island at the edge of a vast bowlsea with a rich crop of fat baldhead fruit and landed in a small clearing the caude swallowed fruit until they looked fit to burst they started farting again then promptly fell asleep in the nearest shade still expelling gas ferbin and holse tethered the beasts also had something to eat then found another patch of deep shade and cut down a giant leaf each to shield their eyes still further from the light while they slept this was where ferbin chose to share his thoughts with his servant on the course of events recently and why ideas like predestination destiny and fate had been much on his mind during the long cold and painful hours in the saddle oh i see ferbin said you are familiar with the disposition of that ancient manufactury all im saying sir is that it was about the only intact building for half a days ride around even the old hunting lodge which was as it were the cause of every other building in the area having as useful a roof as that stupidity i found you in folly that folly i found you in was smashed to buggery it had been artilleried but anyway sir your mount getting you there was no great surprise very well ferbin said determined to show his reasonableness by making a concession my arriving might not have been due to the hand of fate the traitors taking my father there that was destiny was taking a hand perhaps even the worldgod my fathers fate was sealed it would seem and he could not be saved but at least his son might be allowed to witness the despicable crime and set vengeance in train im sure it seemed and seems so to you sir however with no buildings about the place in the heat of a battle and a dirtrain starting taking a wounded man to a place with a roof only makes sense if dirtrain gets into a wound it turns cutrot and infection from a bad risk to a perfect certainty ferbin had to think back he recalled that when hed crawled out of the burning building into the damp cloying leaves and branches it had indeed been a dirty rain that had been falling that was why it had all felt so sticky and grainy and horrible but they wanted him dead he protested and where would you rather do that sir in full view of whoknowswho in the open or under a roof between walls ferbin frowned pulled his big blue leaf down over his face and from underneath said grumpily still for all your cynicism holse it was fate as you say sir holse said sighing and pulled his own leaf over his face good sleep sir he was answered with a snore when they awoke it was to colder darker windier conditions the oborlit longday was still in its early afternoon but the weather had changed small grey clouds sailed raggedly across the sky beneath a high overcast and the air smelled damp the caude were slow to wake and spent much of the next halfhour defecating noisily and voluminously ferbin and holse took their small breakfast some distance upwind that winds against us ferbin said looking out from the edge of the plantation across the quickchopping waves of the bowlsea a dark horizon in the direction they would be heading looked ominous as well we made good distance yesterday holse said chewing on some airdried meat they secured their few belongings checked the map took a few of the baldhead fruit with them for the caude the fruit was indigestible to humans then took off into a freshening breeze the wind added to the sensation of cold even though they were flying much lower than earlier due to the great banks and drifts of dark grey cloud striating the sky they skirted the bigger clouds and flew through only the smallest caude were reluctant to fly through thick cloud anyway though they would do so if they were forced once inside cloud the animals were as bad as humans at gauging whether they were upright and flying straight and level or describing a banked circle and about to crash into some nearby tower caude were the rowels of the air reliable work beasts rather than thoroughbred racing creatures like lyge and so only flew at about fifty or sixty kilometres per hour even so hitting a tower at that speed was usually enough to kill both beast and rider and if not then the subsequent fall to the ground tended to do the trick ferbin was still keeping an eye on the chronometer and marking the passage of the towers to their right they were flying closer to them now only a few kilometres off each one so they didnt miss any something ferbin knew from experience it was all too easy to do however he found himself thinking back to a dream hed had the night before and via that to his one journey to the surface back when hed been a youth that too was like a dream to him now he had walked on strange ground beneath no lid or ceiling save that of the atmosphere itself held contained by a far circle of walls and by nothing else but gravity a place with no towers where the curve of the earth beneath ones feet just went on uninterrupted unbroken unsupported unbelievable he had watched the stars wheel and in each of the halfdozen days he had been there had marvelled at the tiny blinding dot that was meseriphine the unseen sun the distant connected yet unconnected pivot that great sursamen itself spun slow about there was a remorselessness about those surface days one sun one source of light one regular set of days and nights always the same seemingly unchanging while everything hed ever known was far below entire levels that were themselves worlds beneath him and only nothing above a dark truenothingness sprinkled with a rash of faint points of light that he was told were other suns his father had been meant to be there but had had to call off at the last moment ferbin had gone with his older brother elime who had been there before but had wanted to go again they were very privileged to be treated so their father could command the oct to take people to other levels including the surface as could some other rulers and the head scholars of scholasteries but any other person travelled at the whim of the oct and they granted almost no such wishes they had taken a couple of friends and a few old servants the great crater theyd stayed within for most of their visit was green with vast meadows and tall trees the air smelled of unidentifiable perfumes it was thick and at once fresh and heady they had felt energised almost drugged they had lived within an underground complex in the face of a tall cliff looking out over a vast network of hexagonal lakes bounded by thin strips of land this pattern stretched to the horizon they had met some nariscene and even one morthanveld ferbin had already seen his first oct in the scendship that had taken them up the tower to the surface this had been before the oct embassy had been opened in the palace at pourl and ferbin had the same superstitious dread of the oct as most people there were legends rumours and uncorroborated reports that the oct issued from their towers in the dead of night to steal people from their beds sometimes whole families or even villages disappeared the oct took the captured back to their towers and experimented upon them or ate them or transported them to another level for sport and devilment the result was that the common mass of people dreaded both the oct themselves and the very idea of being taken to and transported within a tower ferbin had long been told these were nonsense tales but hed still been nervous it had been a relief to discover the oct were so small and delicatelooking the oct in the scendship had been most insistent that they were the true inheritors and direct descendants of the involucra the original builders of the shellworlds he had been highly impressed with this and had felt a vicarious outrage that this fact was not more widely accepted hed been in awe of the octs casual familiarity with and easy control of this vessel that could rise within a tower past level after unglimpsed level to the very outside of all things it was control of the world he realised it seemed more real more relevant and somehow even more important and impressive than control of the infinitude of ungraspable space beyond the world itself this hed thought was power then hed watched how the oct and the nariscene treated each other and realised that the nariscene were the masters here they were the superiors who merely indulged this strange species that to his people to the sarl had nearmagical powers how lowly the sarl must be to be mere cargo simple primitives to the oct who were themselves treated like little more than children by their nariscene mentors seeing furthermore how the nariscene and the morthanveld interacted was almost dismaying because the morthanveld in turn seemed to regard the nariscene as something like children and treated them with amused indulgence another level and another all beyond his above his peoples heads in some ways they were the lowest of the low he realised was this why so few of his people were ever invited here perhaps if everybody saw what he his brother and their friends were seeing the sarl might sink into a state of apathy and depression for they would know how little their lives really counted within the everexpanding hierarchies of alien powers beyond them this had been elimes opinion he also believed that it was a deliberate scheme of their mentors to encourage those who were in power or who would one day assume power to witness the wonders that they were now being shown so that they would never be tempted to get above themselves so that they would always know that no matter how magnificent they appeared to themselves or those around them and regardless of what they achieved it was all within the context of this greater more powerful sophisticated and ultimately far superior reality they try to break us elime had told ferbin elime was a big burly energetic young man always full of enthusiasm and opinions and tirelessly keen to hunt or drink or fight or fuck they try to put a little voice in our heads that will always say you dont matter what you do means nothing elime like their father was having none of this so the aliens could sail within the towers and cruise between the stars and construct whole worlds so what there were powers beyond them that they didnt fully understand perhaps this nesting this shellaftershellbeyondwhatyouknew principle went on for ever did the aliens give up and do nothing no they had their disputes and contentions their disagreements and alliances their wins and losses even if they were somehow more oblique and rarefied than the wars victories and defeats that the sarl both enjoyed and suffered the stratagems and powerplays the satisfactions and disillusions that the sarl experienced mattered as much to them as those of the aliens did to their own overweeningly cosmopolitan and civilised souls you lived within your level and accepted that you did you played by the rules within that level and therein lay the measure of your worth all was relative and by refusing to accept the lesson the aliens were implicitly trying to teach here behave accept bow down conform a hairyarsed bunch of primitives like the sarl could score their own kind of victory against the most overarching sophisticates the galaxy had to offer elime had been wildly excited this visit had reinforced what hed seen during his first time at the surface and had made sense of all the things their father had been telling them since they were old enough to understand ferbin had been amazed elime was positively glowing with joy at the prospect of returning to their own level with a kind of civilisational mandate to carry on his fathers work of unifying the eighth and who knew perhaps beyond at the time ferbin who was just starting to take an interest in such things had been more concerned with the fact that his beautiful second cousin truffe who was a little older than he and with whom hed started to think he might be falling in love had succumbed with frightening indecent ease to elimes bluff charms during the visit to the surface that was the sort of conquering ferbin was starting to take an interest in thank you and elime had already beaten him to it they had returned to the eighth elime with a messianic gleam in his eye ferbin with a melancholic feeling that now truffe was forever denied him he couldnt imagine shed settle for him after his brother and besides he wasnt sure he wanted her any more anyway his young life was already over he also felt that in some strange roundabout way the aliens had succeeded in lowering his expectations by the same degree they had inadvertently raised elimes he realised he had drifted off in this reverie when he heard holse shouting at him he looked about had he missed a tower he saw what looked like a new tower some distance off to his right and forward it looked oddly bright in its paleness this was because of the great wall of darkness filling the sky ahead he was damp all over they must have flown through a cloud the last he recalled they had been flying just under the surface of some long grey mass of vapour with hazy tendrils stretching down like forest creepers all around them gritcloud he heard holse yell he looked up at the cliff of darkness ahead and realised it was indeed a silse cloud a mass of sticky rain it would be dangerous and possibly fatal to try and fly through even the caude he was riding seemed to have realised things werent quite right it shivered beneath him and he could hear it making moaning whining noises ferbin looked to either side there was no way round the great dark cloud and it was far too tall for them to go over the top the cloud was loosing its gritty cargo of rain too great dragged veils of darkness swept back along the ground beneath it theyd have to land and sit it out he signalled to holse and they wheeled right round back the way theyd come descending fast towards the nearest forest on the side of a tall hill bound on three sides by the loop of a broad river drops of moisture tickled ferbins face and he could smell something like dung they landed on the broad boggy summit of the hill near a roughedged pool of dark brackish water and squelched through a quaking mire of shaking ground leading the grumbling caude down to the tree line they persuaded the caude to trample down a few springy saplings so they could all shoulder their way far enough in they sheltered under the trees while the whole day darkened until it was like night the caude promptly fell asleep the gritrain whispered in the branches high above growing slowly louder the view of the hills top and a line of remaining brightness in the sky beyond disappeared what i wouldnt give for a pipe of good unge leaf holse said sighing bloody nuisance eh sir ferbin could barely make out his servants face in the gloom though he was almost within touching distance yes he said he squinted at the chronometer which he was keeping inside his jacket we wont get there in daylight now he said a few leaffiltered drops of the dirty rain plopped down about them one landed on ferbins nose and trickled to his mouth he spat my old dad lost a whole crop of xirze to one of these buggering silse storms once holse said well they destroy but they build up too ferbin said i have heard them compared to kings in that regard holse said sir we need them both ive heard that too sir in other worlds they have no silse no sticky rain so ive been told really doesnt the land just wear away to nothing apparently not not even eventually sir dont these places have rain and such ordinary rain i mean obviously that would wear the hills down and carry them all away to lakes and seas and oceans they generally do seemingly they also have such hydrological systems that can build up land from beneath from beneath holse said sounding unconvinced i remember one lesson where it sounded like they had oceans of rock so hot it was liquid and not only flowed like rivers but also could flow uphill to issue from the summits of mountains ferbin said really sir holse sounded like he thought ferbin was trying to fool him into believing the sort of preposterous nonsense a child would dismiss with derision these effects serve to build up land ferbin said oh and the mountains float and can grow upwards wholesale apparently entire countries crash into each other raising hills there was more but i rather missed the start of that lesson and it does all sound a bit farfetched i think they were having you on sir trying to see how gullible you might be holse might have sounded hurt i thought that i have to say ferbin shrugged unseen oh i probably got it wrong choubris i wouldnt quote me on this frankly i shall take care not to sir holse said anyway that is why they dont need silse rain if a tenth of all that stuffs true sir i think we have the better side of the bargain so do i silse rebuilt land as ferbin understood it tiny animalcules in the seas and oceans each grabbed a particle of silt and then made some sort of gas that hoisted creature and particle to the surface where they leapt into the air to become clouds which then drifted over the land and dropped the lot in the form of dirty sticky rain silse clouds were relatively rare which was just as well a big one could drown a farm a village or even a county as efficiently as a small flood smothering crops with kneedeep mud tearing down trees or leaving them stripped of branches breaking roofs of too shallow a pitch paving over meadows blanketing roads and damming rivers usually only temporarily swiftly resulting in real floods the gritty rain was dripping on to them even under the cover of the trees as it found its way through the now heavy drooping branches from all directions around them a sporadic series of loud cracks rang out above the sound of the silse storm each followed by a rushing tearing crashing noise concluding in a great thump if you hear that right above us sir holse said best jump i most certainly shall ferbin said trying to uncloy his eyes from the gritty stuff falling on them the silse stank like something from the bottom of a latrine trench though right now death does not seem so unattractive the cloud passed eventually the day brightened again and a strong wind veered about the hilltop they squelched out on to the doubly treacherous summit the newly dumped silse mud covering the already unstable surface of the bog pulled at their feet and those of the caude both of which showed signs of distress at being forced to walk in such conditions the mud reeked like manure ferbin and holse brushed as much as they could from their skin and clothes before it caked could do with a shower of nice clean rain now eh sir what about that sort of pool thing up there ferbin asked good idea sir holse said leading the caude to the shallow now overbrimming tarn near the summit of the hill the caude whinnied and resisted but eventually were persuaded to enter the water which came to halfway up their bellies the two men cleaned the beasts and themselves as best they could the caude were still unhappy and their slipping sliding takeoff run only just got them above the trees in time they flew on into the late afternoon they kept flying even as the dusk slowly descended though the caude were whining almost constantly now and continually tried to descend dropping down and answering only slowly and with much grumbling to each uppulling of the reins on the landscape below must be farms villages and towns but they could see no sign of them the wind was to their left side constantly trying to push them towards the towers they needed to keep to their right the clouds had settled back to a high overcast and another ragged layer at about half a kilometre they kept beneath this knowing that getting lost in night cloud might easily be the end of them eventually they saw what they thought must be the dnengoal tower a broad pale presence rising across an extensive marsh still just about reflecting the slowfading embers that obor had left on the undersurface of the sky high above the dnengoal tower was what was known as a pierced tower one through which access might be gained to its interior and so to the network of thoroughfares in which the oct and the aultridia sailed their scendships this was at least the popular understanding ferbin knew that all the towers had been pierced originally and in a sense still were every tower where it fluted out at its base on each level contained hundreds of portals designed to transport the fluid which it was alleged the involucra had planned to fill the world with on the eighth the portals were in any case all buried under at least a hundred metres of earth and water but in almost every tower the portals had all long since been firmly sealed by the oct and aultridia there were rumours which the oct did nothing to deny that other peoples other rulers had sunk mines down to where the sealed portals were and had tried to open them only to find that they were utterly impenetrable to anybody without the kind of technology that let one sail the stars never mind the interior of towers and also that even attempting to meddle with them inevitably brought down the wrath of the oct those rulers had been killed and those peoples scattered often across other less forgiving levels only one tower in a thousand still had a single portal which gave access to the interior at least at any useful height telescopes had revealed what might be portals high above the atmosphere hundreds of kilometres above ground level and the usual sign of a pierced tower was a much smaller though still by human standards substantial access tower sited nearby the dnengoals access tower proved surprisingly difficult to spot in the gloom they flew round the tower once under the thickening layer of cloud feeling pressed between the mists rising from the ground below and the lowering carpet of darkness directly above ferbin was worried first that they might crash into the lesser tower in the darkness they were being forced to fly at only a hundred metres above the ground and that was about the usual altitude for the top of an access tower and then that they had chosen the wrong tower in the first place the map theyd looked at earlier had shown the tower was pierced but not exactly where its accompanying access tower was it also showed a fairsized town dengroal situated very close to the nearpole base of the main tower but there was no sign of the settlement he hoped it was just lost in the mists the access tower lit up in front of them as the top twenty metres of the cylinder suddenly flashed in a series of giant towerencircling hoops so bright they dazzled the eye it was less than a hundred strides in front of them and its summit was a little above their present level almost in the clouds the blue light picked out their gauzy undersurface like some strange inverted landscape he and holse pulled up and banked and then with gestures agreed to land on the top the caude were so tired they hardly bothered to complain as they were asked to climb one more time the summit of the access tower was fifty strides across a concentric series of blue hoops of light was set into its surface like a vast target the light pulsed slowly from dim to bright like the beat of some vast and alien heart they landed on the towers nearest edge the startled caude scrambled and beat their wings with one last frantic effort as the smooth surface under their grasping feet failed to bring them to a halt as quickly as ground or even stone would have but then their scraping claws found some purchase their wingbeats pulled them up and finally with a great whistling sigh that sounded entirely like relief they were stopped they each settled down quivering slightly wings half outstretched with exhaustion heads lying on the surface of the tower panting blue light shone up around their bodies the vapour of their breath drifted across the flat bluelit summit of the tower dissipating slowly ferbin dismounted joints creaking and complaining like an old mans he stretched his back and walked over to where holse was standing rubbing at the leg hed hurt when the mersicor had fallen on top of him well holse we got here and a strange old here it is sir holse said looking around the broad circular top of the tower it appeared to be perfectly flat and symmetrical the only visible features were the hoops of blue light these issued from handwide strips set flush with whatever smooth material made up the towers summit they were standing about halfway between the centre of the surface and the edge the blue light waxed about them giving them and their beasts a ghostly otherworldly appearance ferbin shivered though it was not especially cold he looked about them there was nothing visible beyond the circles of blue above the slowmoving layer of cloud looked almost close enough to touch the wind picked up for a moment then fell back to a breeze at least theres nobody else here he said thankful for that sir holse agreed though if there is anybody watching and they can see through the mist theyll know were here anyway what happens now well i dont know ferbin admitted he couldnt recall what one had to do to gain access to one of these things on the occasion when hed gone to the surface with elime and the others hed been too distracted by everything that was happening to take note of exactly what the procedure was some servant had done it all he caught holses expression of annoyance and looked around again gaze settling on the centre of the towers surface perhaps he started to say as hed spoken hed pointed at the glowing dot at the focus of the pulsing blue hoops so they were both looking right at it when it rose slowly smoothly into the air a cylinder about a foot across extended like a section of telescope from the dead centre of the towers summit rising to around head height its top surface pulsed blue in time with the widening circles radiating out from it that might be useful ferbin said as a hitching post for the beasts if nothing else sir holse said theres bugger all else to tie them to up here ill take a look ferbin said he didnt want to show holse he felt frightened ill hold the reins ferbin walked over to the slim cylinder as he approached an octagon of grey light seemed to swivel into place facing him level with his own face it showed a stylised oct in silhouette the cylinders surface beaded with moisture as a light rain began to fall repetition said a voice like rustling leaves before ferbin could say anything in reply the voice went on patterns yes for periodicity as the veil become the oct so one iteration becomes another spacing is the signal so creates yet also repetition shows lack of learning again be on your way signal that is no signal simply power follows unrepeats the octagonal patch showing the silhouetted oct shape faded and the cylinder started to sink silently back into the surface wait ferbin shouted and grabbed at the smooth round shape putting both arms round it and attempting to prevent it disappearing it felt cold and seemed to be made of metal it would have been slick enough anyway but the drizzle made it more so and it slid imperturbably downwards as though his efforts to retrain it were having no effect whatsoever then it seemed to hesitate it drew to a stop and rose back to its earlier height the grey octagonal shape some sort of screen ferbin realised glowed into existence on the surface again before it could say anything he shouted i am ferbin prince of the house of hausk with documents to support my right to warranted travel under the protection of our esteemed allies the oct i would speak with the towermaster aiaik denigration is the cylinder had started to say then the voice cut off documents the voice said after a few moments ferbin unbuttoned his jacket and took out the fingerthick grey envelopes brandishing them in front of the screen by the authority of seltis head scholar of the anjrinh scholastery ferbin said of the eighth he added partly in case there was any confusion and partly to show he was familiar with the realities of the world and not some coarsebonce bumpkin whod somehow achieved the summit of the tower for a bet to wait said the leafrustling voice the screen faded again but this time the cylinder stayed where it was sir holse called from where he stood holding the reins of the now soundly sleeping caude yes ferbin said just wondering whats happening sir i believe weve established some sort of rapport he frowned thinking back to what the voice had said when it had first spoken to him but i think were not the first here not recently perhaps he shrugged at the worriedlooking holse i dont know ferbin swivelled looking all about trying to see through the glowing blue mist created by the drizzle he saw something dark moving in the air to one side of holse and the caude a huge shadow heading straight for them holse he cried pointing at the apparition holse glanced round already starting to drop the great shape tore through the air just above the two slumped mounts missing holses head by no more than the span of a hand the sound of massive wings beating whumped through the air it looked like a lyge ferbin thought with a rider on its back a sharp crack and a tiny fountain of yellow sparks announced holse firing his pistol at the departing wheeling beast the lyge rose stalled and turned catching itself on a single great beat of its massive wings as it landed on the far edge of the tower a slight figure jumped from its back holding a long gun the flier dropped to one knee and took aim at holse who was slapping his pistol with his free hand and cursing holse dived for cover between the caude both of which had raised their heads at the sound of the shot and were looking sleepily about them the rifle spoke again and the caude nearest the shooter jerked and screamed it started trying to rise from the surface beating one wing and scraping one leg back and forth its fellow raised its head high and let out a terrified wail the flier from the lyge levered another round into the rifle small detonations said the oct voice just above ferbis head he hadnt even realised hed ducked down just his head showing round the side of the cylinder so he could still see the flier attacking them celebratory actions inappropriate the voice continued betokening the undesired to cease let us in ferbin said in a hoarse whisper behind the figure with the rifle the lyge hunkered down the wounded caude near holse screamed and thrashed its wings against the surface of the tower its companion keened shifting and shuffling away stretching its own wings the flier took aim again and shouted show yourself surrender fuck off holse yelled back ferbin could barely hear him over the screaming caude the creature was moving slowly backwards over the surface of the tower as it beat its wings and shrieked the second caude rose suddenly on its legs and seemed to realise only then that it was unrestrained it turned hopped once to the edge of the tower spread its wings and launched itself into the darkness with a miserable wail disappearing immediately please ferbin said knocking on the cylinders surface with his knuckles let us in the cessation of childishness the cylinders voice announced necessary if not sufficient the wounded caude rolled half to one side as though stretching itself its screams fading as its voice became hoarse and you the lyge flier yelled turning to point the rifle at ferbin both of you out ill not shoot if you surrender now the hunts finished im just a scout there are twenty more behind me all regents men its over surrender youll not be harmed ferbin heard a fizzing sound between the desperate shrieks of the wounded caude and a hint of yellow light seemed to illuminate the surface just behind the screaming animal all right holse shouted i surrender something flew up from behind the wounded caude lobbed over its beating wings on an arc of orange sparks the flier with the rifle started back rifle barrel flicking upwards the finned grenade landed three strides in front of the lyge flier as the bomblet bounced the caude holse had been sheltering behind gave a final great thrash of its wings and one last scream before overbalancing and falling over the edge of the tower in a despairing tangle of wings revealing holse lying on the surface the creatures wails faded slowly as it fell the grenade landed and rolled round pivoting about its cruciform tail then its fuse gave a little puff of orange smoke and went out even as the lyge flier was scrambling backwards away from it in the relative silence following the departure of the caude ferbin could hear holse trying to fire his pistol the click click click noise sounded more hopeless than had the wounded caudes cries the lyge flier went down on one knee again and took aim at the now utterly exposed holse who shook his head well you can still fuck off he shouted the chronometer smacked the lyge flier across the bridge of the nose the rifle pointed fractionally upwards as it fired sending the shot a foot or so above holse he was up and running at the dazed figure on the far side of the roof before the chronometer ferbin had thrown got to the edge of the towers summit and vanished into the drizzle the lyge looked down at the rolling disconnectedlooking figure in front of it and appeared merely puzzled as holse threw himself forward and on to its rider fuck me sir youre a better shot than him holse said as he knelt on the fliers back and prised the rifle out of his fingers ferbin had started to think their assailant was a woman but it was just a smallbuilt man lyge were faster than caude but they could carry less weight their fliers were usually chosen for their small frame ferbin could see dark blood on the glowing blue band beneath the fallen flier holse checked the rifle and reloaded it still with one knee pressing on the back of the struggling lyge flier thank you holse ferbin said he looked up at the thin dark puzzled face of the lyge which rose up a little and gave a single great beat of its wings before settling back down again the pulse of air rolled over them what should we do with the grenade fizzed into life again they scrambled away on all fours holse making an attempt to pull the lyge flier with him they rolled and clattered across the hard surface and ferbin had time to think that at least if he died here it would be on the eighth not somewhere lost and unholy between the stars the grenade exploded with a terrific smacking noise that seemed to take ferbin by the ears and slap him somewhere in between them he heard a ringing sound and lay where he was when he collected his scattered senses and looked about him he saw holse a couple of strides away looking back at him the lyge flier lying still a few strides further back and that was all the lyge had gone whether killed or wounded by the grenade or just startled by it it was impossible to know holses mouth moved as if he was saying something but ferbin couldnt hear a damn thing a broad cylinder a good fifteen strides across rose up in the centre of the towers summit swallowing the thin tube that ferbin had been talking to this fresh extrusion climbed five metres into the air and stopped a door big enough to accept three mounted men side by side slid open and a greyblue light spilled out around the tower a number of great dark shapes started to appear circling ferbin and holse got up and ran for the doorway his ears were still ringing so ferbin never heard the shot that hit him onefinger man mertis tyl loesp sat in his withdrawing chamber high in the royal palace of pourl the room had started to seem overly modest to him recently however hed thought it best to leave it a shortyear or so before moving into any of the kings apartments he was listening to two of his most trusted knights report your boy knew the old fellows hiding place in a secret room behind a cupboard we hauled him out and persuaded him to tell us the truth of earlier events vollird who had been one of those guarding the door when the late king had met his end in the old factory smiled the gentleman was a onefinger man the other knight baerth said he too had been there when the king had died he used both hands to mime breaking a small twig a twitch about his lips might also have been a smile yes thank you for the demonstration tyl loesp said to baerth then frowned at vollird and then you found it necessary to kill the head scholar against my orders we did vollird said uncowed i reckoned the risk of bringing him to a barracks and oublietting him too great kindly explain tyl loesp said smoothly sitting back vollird was a tall thin darkly intense fellow with a look that could as now verge on insolent he usually regarded the world with his head tipped downwards eyes peering out from beneath his brow it was by no means a shy or modest aspect rather it seemed a little wary and distrusting certainly but mostly mocking sly and calculating and as though those eyes were keeping carefully under the cover of that sheltering brow quietly evaluating weaknesses vulnerabilities and the best time to strike baerth was a contrast fair small and bulky with muscle he looked almost childish at times though of the two he could be the most unrestrained when his blood was up both would do tyl loesps bidding which was all that mattered though on this occasion of course they had not he had asked them to perform various disappearances intimidations and other delicate commissions for him over the past few years and they had proved reliable and trustworthy never failing him yet however he was worried they might have developed a taste for murder above obedience a principal strand of this concern centred on who he could find to dispose of these two if they did prove in sum more liabilitous than advantageous to him he had various options in that regard but the most ruthless tended to be the least trustworthy and the least criminal the most tentative mr seltis confession was most comprehensive vollird said and included the fact that the gentleman who had been there earlier had specifically demanded that the head scholar get word to said gentlemans brother here in the palace regarding the manner of their fathers death and the danger the younger brother might therefore be in there had been no time for the head scholar to begin effecting such warning however he seemed most tearfully regretful at this and i formed the distinct impression he would do what he could to pass this information on should he have the chance to whatever barracksman militia or army he happened to encounter so we took him to the roof on excuse of visiting the place where the fleeing gentlemen had absconded and threw him to his death we told those in the scholastery that he had jumped and assumed our most shocked expressions baerth glanced at the other knight i said we might have kept him alive as we were told and just torn out his tongue vollird sighed then he would have written out a warning message baerth looked unconvinced we could have broken the rest of his fingers hed have written using a pen stuck in his mouth vollird said exasperated we might then hed have shoved the pen up his arse vollird said loudly or found some sort of way if he was desperate enough which i judged him to be he looked at tyl loesp at any rate dead is what he is tyl loesp thought well he said i will concede that was well enough done in the circumstances however i worry that we now have a scholastery full of offended scholars theyd be easy enough to cull too sir vollird said theres a lot of them but theyre all nicely gathered and guarded and theyre all soft as a babes head i swear again true but theyll have parents brothers connections it would be better if we can persuade a new head scholar to keep them in order and say no more of what occurred vollird looked unconvinced theres no better way of ensuring a tongues held than stilling it for good sir tyl loesp gazed at vollird you are very good at pieces of the truth vollird arent you only as needs be tyl loesp the other man replied holding his gaze not to a fault tyl loesp felt sure the two knights were convinced that killing all the scholars at anjrinh would end the problem that they might have seen ferbin alive and on the run ferbin alive how entirely like that fatuous lucky idiot to stumble through a battle unscathed and evade all attempts at capture all the same tyl loesp doubted that even ferbins luck would be entirely sufficient for that he suspected the servant one choubris holse was providing the cunning the prince so evidently lacked vollird and baerth both imagined that simply excising those whod seen the prince would put an end to the matter it was the obvious soldierly way to think neither could see that all such surgery had its own further complications and ensuences this present problem was like a small boil on the hand lancing it would be quick and immediately satisfying but a cautious doctor would know that this approach might lead to an even worse affliction that could infectively paralyse the whole arm and even threaten the bodys life itself sometimes the most prudent course was just to apply some healing oils or cooling poultice and let things subside it might be the slower treatment but it carried fewer risks left no scars and could be more effective in the end well tyl loesp told the knights there is one tongue id have stilled as you propose though it must look as though the gentleman has been careless with his own life rather than had it surgeried from him however the scholars will be left alone the family of the spy who alerted us will be rewarded the family though not the boy he will already be jealoused and despised quite sufficiently already if the others truly suspect who was there if it was who we think it might have been we still cannot be sure vollird said i have not the luxury of thinking otherwise tyl loesp told him and the fugitive himself baerth asked lost for the moment tyl loesp glanced at the telegraphed report hed received that morning from the captain of the lyge squadron who had come so close to capturing or killing ferbin and his servant assuming it was them at the dnengoal tower just the night before one of their quarry wounded possibly the report said too many possibles and probables for his liking however he said smiling broadly at the two knights i too now have the documents to get people to the surface the fugitive and his helper are running away that is the second best thing they can do after dying he smiled vollird i imagine you and baerth would like to see the surface and the eternal stars again would you not the two knights exchanged looks i think wed rather ride with the army against the deldeyn vollird said the main part of the army had already left the day before to form up before the tower through which they would attack the ninth tyl loesp would leave to join them tomorrow for the descent baerth nodded aye theres honour in that perhaps weve killed enough just for you tyl loesp vollird suggested we grow tired of murdering with every second glance directed over our backs might it not be time for us to serve sarl less obliquely on the battlefield against an enemy all recognise to serve me is to serve the sarl i am the state tyl loesp wanted to say but did not not even to these two instead he frowned and pursed his lips momentarily let us three agree a compact shall we i shall forgive you for being obtuse disloyal and selfish if you two forgive me for seeming to have expressed my orders by way of a question with the implication that there is any choice whatsoever on your part what dyou say depth of field a certain lack she had been a man for a year that had been different everything had been different she had learned so much about herself about people about civilisations time she came to think in standard years eventually to her at first they were about one and a half shortyears or very roughly half a longyear gravity she felt intolerably heavy and worryingly fragile at once a treatment she had already agreed to started to thicken her bones and reduce her height before she left the eighth but even so for the time she was on the ship that took her from the surface and during the first fifty days or so after her arrival she towered over most people and felt oddly delicate allegedly the new clothes she had chosen had been reinforced to save her from breaking any bones if she fell badly in the stronger gravity she had assumed this was a lie to make her feel less frightened and just took care instead only the measures of humanscale length were roughly as she knew them strides were near enough metres and she already thought in kilometres even if shed grown up with ten raised to the power of three rather than two to the power of ten but that was just the start of it for the first couple of years after arriving in the culture she had been simply as she was save for that amendment of thickening and shortening meanwhile she got to know the culture and it got to know her she learned a lot about everything the drone turminder xuss had accompanied her from the day shed stepped from the ship shed arrived on the space vessel called lightly seared on the reality grill she found their ships names absurd childish and ridiculous at first then got used to them then thought she kind of understood them then realised there was no understanding the mind of a ship and went back to finding them annoying the drone answered any questions she had and sometimes talked on her behalf those first three years had been spent on the orbital gadampth mostly on the part called lesuus in a sort of extended teasedout city built on a group of islands scattered across a wide bay on the edge of a small inland sea the city was named klusse and it had some similarities to an ordinary city despite being much cleaner and lacking any curtain walls or other defensive components that she could discern mostly though it seemed to be a sort of vast scholastery it took her some time to work out why as she went walking about the boulevards terraces promenades and piazzas of the place she had felt not initially but gradually just when she ought to have felt herself getting used to the place an odd mixture of comfort and disturbance at the same time eventually she realised it was because in all the faces that she saw there not one held a disfiguring tumour or had been eaten half away by disease she had yet to see even a mildly disfiguring skin condition or a lazy eye similarly in all the bodies she moved among not one was limping or supporting itself on a crutch or trolley or went hobbling past on a club foot and not a single madman not one poor defective standing flecked screaming on a street corner howling at the stars she hadnt appreciated this at first because at the time she was still being amazed at the sheer bewildering physical variation of the people around her but once she had become used to that she started to notice that although there was near infinite physical variety here there was no deformity and while there was prodigious eccentricity no dementia there were more facial bodily and personality types than she could have imagined but they were all the product of health and choice not disease and fate everyone was or could be if they so desired beautiful in both form and character later she would find that as this was the culture after all of course there were people who embraced ugliness and even the appearance of deformity or mutilation just to be different or to express something inside that they felt ought to be broadcast to their peers however once she had passed over her initial sense of irritation and exasperation at such people did they not even if unknowingly mock those truly afflicted those with no choice in how hideous they looked she realised that even that deliberate adoption of unsightliness displayed a kind of societal confidence a thumbing of the collective nose at the workings of crude providence and the ancient tyranny now itself long overthrown of genetic aberration gross injury and transmissible pestilence a star named aoud shone down upon the tenmillionkilometre bracelet of the orbital this sun was what everybody else seemed to regard as a real star one which had been naturally formed to her it sounded incredibly old and absurdly almost wastefully enormous there in klusse she learned about the history of the culture and the story of the galaxy itself she learned about the other civilisations that she had been taught as a child were called the optimae they generally referred to themselves as the involveds or the inplay though the terms were loose and there was no exact equivalent of the sarl word optimae with its implication of supremacy highlevel involved was probably as close as you could get she also learned pretty much all there was to be learned about her own people the sarl their longago evolution on a faraway planet of the same name their involvement in a terrible war their condemnation exile and displacement partly for their own good partly for that of the peoples they had shared that original planet with the consensus was that they would either kill everybody else or be killed and their eventual sanctuaryinternment in sursamen under the auspices of the galactic council the morthanveld and nariscene this version felt like the truth she thought close enough to the myths and legends of her own people but less selfserving less dramatically glorious more equivocal in its moral implications this area of study turned up surprising details the fact that the deldeyn and the sarl were the same people for example the deldeyn were a subgroup of the main population who had been transported to the level below by the oct over a thousand years ago and the oct had done this without permission from their nariscene mentors that level while once supporting many peoples had seen them all evacuated millennia ago and was supposed to have been left empty of intelligent life until further notice the oct had been forced to apologise undertake never to do such a thing again and pay reparations in the form of surrendered influence elsewhere however the unauthorised movement of people had finally reluctantly been accepted as a fait accompli she learned about panhumanity about the great diasporic welter of humanlike humanish and humanoid species scattered throughout so much of the galaxy she learned about the present sociopolitical setup that existed in the galaxy and felt a sort of widespread satisfaction that there was just so much of it and almost all of it peaceful there were millions of species hundreds of different types of species even casting ones definition wide and that was without taking into account civilisations that were composed more of machines than biological beings at all ultimately the galaxy indeed the sum of the universe in its entirety was mostly nothing average it all out and it made a pretty good vacuum but within the foci of matter that were the systems the stars and planets and habitats what a cornucopia of life was there there were bogglingly large numbers just of these panhumans of which of course she was one but they still formed less than a single per cent of all the aggregated lifemass of the greater galaxy also where they did exist men and women were mostly most places most of the time equals in the culture this was even guaranteed by birthright you could be whatever gender you wished just by thinking about it she found this highly satisfactory and a kind of vindication life buzzed in fumed about rattled around and quite thoroughly infested the entire galaxy and probably almost certainly well beyond the vast ongoingness of it all somehow put all ones own petty concerns and worries into context making them seem not irrelevant but of much less distressing immediacy context was indeed all as her father had always insisted but the greater context she was learning about acted to shrink the vastseeming scale of the eighth level of sursamen and all its wars politics disputes struggles tribulations and vexations until it all looked very far away and trivial indeed she learned about contact the part of the culture that went out to discover and interact with other civilisations especially new and fastdeveloping ones and about its slightly scurrilous tentatively raffish arguably shadowy division called special circumstances it was some time before she realised that she herself was expected to have at least a chance of becoming part of this prestigious if not entirely respectable organisation this was she gathered supposed to be a most singular and unusual honour and almost the only worthwhile distinction the culture had to offer that was not available on demand however she was again instantly suspicious for some time the aspect of orbital life she marvelled at more than anything else was the geography mountains cliffs and gorges pinnacles scree and boulder fields that none of it was truly natural that it had all been designed and manufactured from debris found in the solar system when the world was made only added to her amazement she hiked the high mountains and learned to ski she took part in various sports and discovered she even enjoyed being part of a team she hadnt expected that somehow she had made friends and taken lovers when she had grown to believe that her new squat self was not hideous not all pairings worked even as it were mechanically there was a wide variety of body shapes another treatment she chose monitored her womb to alert her on the very low offchance that she mated with somebody her own physical system found sufficiently compatible for her to conceive by she had wondered if this was not a lie too but nothing ever happened she played with her own dreams and took part in shared dreams that were vast games using nothing more exoticseeming than special pillows or nightcaps to access these strange subrealities she realised that she slept much more than most of her friends missing out on a potential part of waking life she asked for another treatment which solved that problem as though it had never existed she slept deeply for a few hours each of these clockworkly regular and dependable nights and awoke thoroughly refreshed each morning she took part in other semihallucinatory experiences that seemed like games but which she knew were also lessons and evaluations submerging her entirely conscious self into simulations of reality that were sometimes based on real earlier events and experiences and sometimes were as entirely deliberately created as the orbital and its amazingly vertiginous landscape some left her troubled to know the terrible things people panhumans and beyond but all people could do to each other the implication though was that such ghastliness was an affliction and could be at least partially cured the culture represented the hospital or perhaps a whole caring society contact was the physician and sc the anaesthetic and the medicine sometimes the scalpel almost the only aspect of her new life that she adapted to without pause for thought was the total absence of money in the culture she had been a princess after all and so was perfectly used to that she watched some of her friends enter states she could not share and after great initial wariness asked for more treatments that caused glands in her body she hadnt even known she possessed to alter over a few tens of days until she possessed a simple druggland suite inside her head and a modest choice of mixtures of trace chemicals she could now choose to release into her bloodstream and brain whenever she wanted that had been interesting amongst the sarl at least on the eighth every drug had at least one unwanted and unpleasant side effect here nothing you got what you wanted no more she remained highly sceptical unconvinced such light was possible without shade she no longer needed the drone turminder xuss who went off to tend to others she used a fingerring terminal to connect with the dataverse instead she began to collect amendments treatments as one might accumulate jewellery she even had a couple of treatments rescinded just removed from her altogether simply to make sure that the processes truly were fully reversible a new tutor one who was present only rarely but seemed in some sense senior to the others a bushlike being who had once been a man called batra sounded amused when heit said she was a suspicious child amused and somehow approving she got the feeling she was supposed to feel flattered but shed been more concerned about the mild insult contained in the word child people shifted went away relationships ended she asked one of her female mentors about how one changed from female to male another treatment over most of a year she grew slightly bulked out further grew hair in strange places and watched fascinated as her genitals went from fissure to spire she did wake up a couple of nights covered in sweat appalled at what was happening to her feeling herself wondering if this was all some enormously laboured joke and she was being made a freak of deliberately for sport but there were always people to talk to who had been through the same experience both in person and via screens and sims and no shortage of archived material to explain and reassure she kept a couple of intermittent unbothered lovers even as she changed then as a man took many more mostly female it was true one made a better more considerate lover when one had once been as ones partner he woke up one morning after a strenuous night with a small group of old friends and justmets blinking in the sunshine of a brilliant new day looking out over a broad balcony and a sparkling sea to a great columnar mountain that reminded him of a tower back home and woke everybody else up with his laughter he was never sure why he decided to change back for a long time he thought to return to sursamen as a man see what they made of him then apart from anything else there had been a couple of ladies at the court he had always been fond of and now felt something more for by that point he knew his brother elime had been killed and he was the eldest child of the king the next king indeed if you looked at it in a certain way he might return claim the throne in time by then with further treatments he might have martial skills and attributes beyond those of any warrior who had ever lived on the eighth hed be unstoppable he could take the throne if he wanted that would be hilarious oh the looks on certain faces but that would be cruel at best he thought at worst the results might be something between melodrama and the bloodiest of tragedies anyway to be king of the sarl no longer seemed like the greatest thing a soul might aspire to not by some long measure he changed became a she again the lesson regarding being a considerate lover did not change she took her full name in her fathers kingdom she had been called djan seriy hauska yun pourl yun dich this translated as djan princeconsort hausks daughter of pourl of the eighth here now that she thought of herself as a culture citizen albeit still one that had been born and brought up elsewhere she took the name meseriphinesursamenviiisa djan seriy anaplian dam pourl marain the cultures exquisitely formed metalanguage used its secondary numbering series to denote shellworld levels the anaplian part came from her mothers name anaplia the word seriy indicating she had been raised to be fit to be married to a prince she kept for a laugh she expressed disappointment that there was no ceremony to mark the taking of ones full name her friends and colleagues invented one for her she had further treatments to give her control of many more aspects of her body and mind now she would age very slowly and did not really need to age at all now she was proof against any natural disease under this or any other sun and even losing something as major as a limb would prove only a temporary inconvenience as a new one would simply grow back now she had the full panoply of drug glands with all the benefits and responsibilities that entailed now she gained fully augmented senses so that for example her vision became sharper and brought her information about the infrared and the ultraviolet now she could sense radio waves now she was able to interface directly with machines via a thing called a neural lace that had grown about and through her brain like a flimsy threedimensional net now she could switch off pain and fatigue though her body seemed to scorn them anyway now her nerves changed to become more like wires shifting impulses far faster than before while her bones accreted strands of carbon to make them stronger and her muscles went through chemical and microscopically scaled mechanical changes that made them more effective and more powerful every major internal organ grew more efficient more tolerant more capable resilient and adaptable even as many of them grew smaller she became part of contact and joined the crew of the general contact unit transient atmospheric phenomenon shed had the luxury of a choice in the matter and had turned down the experiencing a significant gravitas shortfall and the pure big mad boat man just because of their ridiculous names she served with distinction for only five years aboard the gcu before the invitation to join special circumstances arrived a surprisingly short period of additional training ensued almost all the new skills she would now need were already there preimplanted she was reunited with the drone turminder xuss who had always been intended as her companion she discovered the old machine came complete with a small squadron of knife attack and scout missiles and was effectively a little arsenal of widespectrum destruction all on its own sc added its own final finessed layers of additional characteristics to her already heady mix of bodily enhancements empowering her still further here were fingernails that could lase to signal blind or kill here was a tiny reactor within her skull that amongst other things could provide the power to keep her alive and conscious for years without oxygen here was a wholebody fibre structure welded to her very bones that could sense distortions in the skein of space itself here was a level of conscious control over her own body and almost incidentally over any merely electronic machine within fifty metres which exceeded that of any rider over their mount or any champion swordsman over his blade she felt she realised one day like a god she thought then of sursamen and her old self and knew there was no going back she was going back and she was losing some of those skills and attributes some of those martial enhancements youre gelding me she said to jerle batra im sorry the morthanveld are very wary of special circumstances agents oh really she shook her head were no threat to them she looked at the man who looked like a small bush well were not are we of course not on the contrary batra made a shrugging motion its a courtesy it feels like a discourtesy to me that is unfortunate we may be overdoing the coddling thing here you know she said all the same they were on the platform quonber riding frigid waves of air above a high mountain range kilometres beneath a greywhite glacier streaked with lines of shattered rock curved and corrugated its way towards the limits of a tungsten sky the coddling djan seriy was referring to involved the almost exaggerated respect the culture as a whole had recently been showing the morthanveld the morthanveld were technologically on a par with the culture and the two civilisations had coexisted on good terms since they had encountered each other thousands of years earlier sharing extensive cultural links and cooperating on a variety of projects they were not exactly allies the waterworlders had kept scrupulously neutral during the idiran war for example but they were of a mind on most matters djan seriys discomfiture was being caused by the fact that some of the cultures more selfcongratulatingly clever minds not in itself an underpopulated category patently with far too much time on their platters had come up with the shiny new theory that the culture was not just in itself completely spiffing and marvellous and a credit to all concerned it somehow represented a sort of climactic stage for all civilisations or at least for all those which chose to avoid heading straight for sublimation as soon as technologically possible sublimation meant your whole civilisation waved farewell to the matterbased universe pretty much altogether opting for a sort of honorary godhood avoid selfdestruction recognise and renounce money for the impoverishing ration system it really was become a bunch of interfering dogooding busybodies resist the siren call of selfish selfpromotion that was subliming and free your conscious machines to do what they did best essentially running everything and there you were millennia of smug selfregard stretched before you no matter what species you had started out from so it was thought by those minds that especially concerned themselves with such matters that the morthanveld were on the cusp of going culture of undergoing a kind of societal phasechange altering subtly but significantly into a waterworlder equivalent of the culture all that would need to happen for this to be effected it was reckoned would be the morthanveld giving up the last vestiges of monetary exchange within their society adopting a more comprehensive selfconsciously benign and galaxywide foreign policy and probably most crucially granting their ais complete selfexpressive freedom and full citizenship rights the culture wanted to encourage this obviously but could not be seen to interfere or to be trying to influence matters this was the main reason for not upsetting the people who would be djan seriys hosts for the latter part of her journey back to sursamen this was why she was being stripped of almost all her sc enhancements and even some of the amendments she had chosen for herself before special circumstances had invited her aboard in the first place probably a bluff anyway she told turminder xuss grumpily looking out over the surface of cragged chevronned ice below the skies were clear and the balcony on which she stood and over which the drone silently hovered provided a calm pleasantly warm environment however a furious torrent of air was howling all around the platform as the planets jetstream swept above the high mountains force fields beyond the balconys perimeter prevented the invisible storm from buffeting and freezing them though such was the power of the screaming rush of air that a faint echo of its voice could be heard even through the field a distant thrumming wail like some animal trapped and shrieking on the ice far below when they had first taken up station here during the previous night the air had been perfectly still and you could hear the cracks and creaks and booms of the glacier as it ground against the torn shoulders of the mountains that formed its banks and scoured its way across the great gouged bed of fractured rock beneath a bluff turminder xuss sounded unconvinced yes anaplian said could it not be that the morthanveld merely pretend to be on the brink of becoming like the culture in order to keep the culture from interfering in their business hmm the drone said that wouldnt work for long even so and youd wonder why the idea that the morthanveld were poised in this manner was allowed to become so prevalent in the first place anaplian realised they had got rather rapidly to the point that all such conversations regarding the strategic intentions of the culture tended to arrive at sooner or later where it became clear that the issue boiled down to the question what are the minds really up to this was always a good question and it was usually only churls and determinedly diehard cynics who even bothered to point out that it rarely if ever arrived paired up with an equally good answer the normal almost ingrained response of people at this point was to metaphorically throw their hands in the air and exclaim that if that was what it really all boiled down to then there was no point in even attempting to pursue the issue further because as soon as the motivations analyses and stratagems of minds became the defining factor in a matter all bets were most profoundly off for the simple reason that any and all efforts to secondguess such infinitely subtle and hideously devious devices were selfevidently futile anaplian was not so sure about this it was her suspicion that it suited the purposes of the minds rather too neatly that people believed this so unquestioningly such a reaction represented not so much the honest appraisal of further enquiry as being pointless as an unthinking rejection of the need to enquire at all perhaps the minds are jealous anaplian said they dont want the morthanveld to steal even the echo of their thunder by becoming like them they patronise the waterworlders in order to antagonise them make them do the opposite of what is supposedly anticipated so that they become less like the culture because that is what the minds really desire that makes as much sense as anything ive heard so far on the matter turminder xuss said politely she was not being allowed to take the drone with her on her return to sursamen sc agent combat drone was a combination that was well known far beyond the culture although perilously close to a cliché it remained a partnership you could allegedly still frighten children and bad people with anaplian felt a faint tingle somewhere inside her head and experienced a sort of buzzing sensation throughout her body she tried clicking into her skein sense that let her monitor significant gravity waves in her vicinity and alerted her to any warp activity nearby but the system was offline flagged indefinitely inoperable though not as a result of hostile action nevertheless she could feel at least one part of her scamended neural lace protesting some automatic system forever watching for damage by stealth reacting to what it would register as the impairment of her abilities and the degradation of her inherent survivability with preprogrammed outrage the platforms own dronestandard ai was with her permission moving slowly through her suite of enhancements and gradually turning off those it was thought the morthanveld might object to click there went the electromagnetic effector ability she tried interfering with the field unit buried in the ceiling overhead which was keeping the air on the balcony insulated from the thin and wellbelowfreezing airstream coursing around the platform no connection she could still sense em activity but she couldnt affect it any more she had lived most of her life without such abilities and to date had used very few of them in anger but she experienced their going with a distinct sense of loss and even dismay she looked down at her fingernails they appeared normal at the moment but shed already thought the signal that would make them detach and fall off by the following morning there would be no pain or blood and new nails would grow back during the next few days but they wouldnt be coherent radiation emission weapons they wouldnt be lasers oh well she thought inspecting them even ordinary unamended nails could still scratch click there she couldnt radio now either no transmissions possible trapped inside her own head she tried to communicate via her lace calling up leeb scoperin one of her colleagues here and her most recent lover nothing directly she would have to go through the platforms systems just like ordinary culture people she had rather hoped to see leeb before she left but he just hadnt been able to get away from whatever it was he was doing at such short notice turminder xuss own systems must have registered something happening that you it asked she felt mildly insulted as though the drone had enquired whether shed just farted yes she said sharply that was me comms offline no need to get snappy she looked at the machine through narrowed eyes i think youll find there is she informed it my its breezy out there batra said floating in through the force field from outside djan seriy the module is here ill get my bag anaplian said please turminder xuss said allow me batra must have read the expression on her face as she watched the drone make its way to the nearest interior door i think turminder xuss is going to miss you batra said extending loops of brittlelooking twigs and branches to take hisits weight and standing headheight in front of her like a framework for the sculpture of a human anaplian shook her head the machine grows sentimental she said unlike yourself batra asked neutrally she guessed he was talking about toark the child she had rescued from the burning city the boy was still asleep she had crept into his cabin to say a onesided farewell earlier that morning stroking his hair whispering not waking him batra had agreed reluctantly to look after the child while she was away i have always been sentimental anaplian claimed the little threeseat module dropped from the sky lowered itself gently through the roof of force field bowing over the platforms flight deck and backed up towards the group waiting for it rear door hingeing open farewell djan seriy batra said extending a lessthanskeletal assemblage at chest height the extremity vaguely handshaped anaplian put her palm briefly against this sculpted image feeling faintly ridiculous you will look after the boy she said oh batra said with a sighing noise as though he were your own i am serious she said if i dont come back i want you to take care of him until you can find somewhere and someone more fitting you have my word batra told her just make sure you do come back i shall endeavour to she said you have backed up last night anaplian confirmed they were both being polite batra would know very well that she had backed herself up the platform had taken a reading of her mind state the evening before should she fail to return whether due to death or in theory any other reason a clone of her could be grown and all her personality and memories implanted into it creating a new her almost indistinguishable from the person she was now it did not do to forget that in a disquietingly real sense to be an sc agent was to be owned by sc the compensation was that even death was just a temporary operational glitch soon overcome again though only in a sense turminder xuss reappeared and deposited her bags in the module well goodbye dear girl it said try to avoid getting into any scrapes i shant be there to save you i have already adjusted my expectations anaplian told it the drone was silent as though not sure what to make of this anaplian bowed formally goodbye she said to both of them then turned and walked into the module three minutes later she was stepping out of it again aboard the eight rounds rapid a delinquentclass fast picket and exgeneral offensive unit which would take her to rendezvous with the steppeclass medium systems vehicle dont try this at home this represented just the first leg of her complicated and languidly paced journey back to her old home djan seriy was shown to a small cabin aboard the old exwarship by a shipslaved drone she would be aboard for less than a full day however she had wanted somewhere to lie down and think she opened her bag she looked at what was lying on top of her few clothes and possessions i dont recall packing you she muttered and was immediately uncertain whether she was talking to herself or not she instinctively tried to read the device with her active em sense but of course that didnt work any more she was not talking to herself well remembered the thing she was looking at said it appeared to be a dildo are you what i think you are i dont know what do you think i am i think you are a knife missile or something very similar well yes the small device said but then again no anaplian frowned certainly you would appear to possess some of the more annoying linguistic characteristics of say a drone well done djan seriy the machine said brightly i am indeed one and both at the same time the mind and personality of myself turminder xuss copied into the seasoned though still hale and hearty body of my most capable knife missile lightly disguised i suppose i ought to be gratified you chose to make your ruse known at this point rather than later ha ha i would never have been so ungallant or intrusive you hope to protect me from scrapes i take it absolutely or at least share them with you do you think youll get away with this who can say worth a try you might have thought to ask me i did you did i appear to have lost more than i thought i thought to ask you but i didnt so as to protect you from potential blame how kind this way i may take full responsibility in the i hope unlikely event you wish me to return whence i came i shall leave you when you board the dont try this at home does batra know i most sincerely hope not i could spend the rest of my contact career toting bags or worse is this even semiofficial anaplian asked she had never entirely lost her welldeveloped sense of suspicion hells teeth no all my own work the drone paused i was charged with protecting you djan seriy it said sounding more serious now and i am not some blindly obedient machine i would like to continue to help protect you especially as you are travelling so far outside the general protection of the culture to a place of violence with your abilities reduced for these reasons i duly offer my services anaplian frowned save that for which your appearance would imply you are most suited she said i accept bare night oramen lay on the bed with the girl whod called herself jish he was playing with her hair tangling long brown locks of it around one finger then releasing it again he was amused by the similarity in shape of the girls spiralled curls and the rolls of smoke she was producing from the unge pipe she was smoking the smoke rolled lazily upwards towards the high ornate ceiling of the room which was part of a house in an elegant and respectable area of the city which had been favoured by many of the court over the years not least by his brother ferbin jish passed him the pipe but he waved it away no oh come she said giggling she turned towards him to try and force the pipe on him her breasts jiggling as she moved across the broad muchtousled bed dont be a spoil she tried to jam the stem of the pipe into his mouth he turned his head moved the pipe away again with the flat of one hand no thank you he said she sat crosslegged in front of him perfectly naked and tapped him on the nose with the stem why wont the ora play wont the ora play she said in a funny croaky little voice behind her the broad fanshaped headboard of the bed was covered with a painting of mythical halfpeople the satyrs and nymphs of this world engaged in a pinktoned orgy upon fluffy white clouds peeling faintly at the edges why wont the ora play he smiled because the ora has other things to do whats to do my lovely prince she puffed briefly on the pipe releasing the grey smoke in a liquidic sheen the armys away and all is quiet everyones gone the weather is warm and theres nothing to do play with your jish why not he lay back in the bed stretching one hand went out to the glass of wine that stood on the bedside table as though about to grasp it but then it fell away again i know jish said smiling and turned half away from him breasts outlined in the smoky sunlight pouring through the tall windows on the far side of the room he could see she was pulling deeply on the pipe she turned back to him eyes bright came forward and down and holding the pipe away from the two of them placed her lips over his opening her mouth full of smoke and trying to make him breathe it from her lungs into his he blew back sharply making her draw away coughing and hacking in an unruly cloud of bitter fumes the pipe clattered to the floor and she coughed again one hand at her mouth almost sounding like she was retching oramen smiled he sat upright quickly and grabbed her hand pulling it sharply away from her and twisting his grip on her skin so that she gave a small cry of pain ferbin had told him that many women responded well to being treated roughly and though he found this bizarre he was testing this theory i would not force myself on you my dear he told her her face was unattractively reddened and tears were in her eyes you ought to reciprocate he let go her hand the girl rubbed her wrist and glared at him then sniffed and tossed her hair she looked for the pipe and saw it on the floor she levered herself half out of the bed to get it whats all this tove lomma stuck his head over the fanshaped headboard the room contained two large beds which could be sidebyside or headboardtoheadboard if one wanted just a little additional privacy tove was with another couple of girls on the other bed his big sweatylooking face beamed down at them not a tiff i hope he gazed at jishs backside as she stretched across for the pipe hmm most appreciable he looked at oramen nodding at jishs buttocks as she pulled herself back into the bed perhaps we ought to swap shortly eh my prince perhaps oramen said one of toves girls appeared at his side and stuck her tongue in his ear oramen nodded at this i think youre wanted he told tove i hear and obey tove said with a wink he and the girl disappeared oramen stared up at the ceiling how much had changed he thought how much hed grown and matured just in the month since his fathers death hed been with girls learned to smoke and drink and waved a ceremonial goodbye to an entire army he had found a few pretty words to say both to the girls though they needed no cajoling save the rattle of a purse and to the army his little speech there had been of his own devising the one tyl loesp had prepared for him had seemed vainglorious and immodest the regent had done his best to hide his displeasure well it had been mostly of his own devising he had borrowed a little from the house of many roofs by sinnel with a hint of the executioners speech in act three of baron lepessi by prode the younger and off the fabulous spread of their forces had gone under banners of bright cloth and cloudwhite steam with many a clank and hiss and whinny and roar and rattle and cheer all bound for glory destined to fall upon the now neardefenceless deldeyn and finally complete king hausks grand plan of unity across the eighth and beyond thus would come the golden age of peace his father had talked about when a prince of his that is oramens stamp might take his people on to still greater accomplishments and recognition such was the theory they had to win their battle first the army was not taking the obvious route and would be gone longer than might have been anticipated which ought to make the result all the more certain the deldeyn would presumably have most of what was left of their muchreduced forces waiting at the most obvious portal tower so would be surprised as well as overwhelmed but one still never knew for sure he hadnt been allowed to go with the army still a boy they said better not risk their last prince not after what had happened to ferbin he wasnt sure if hed wanted to go or not it would have been interesting and it seemed a pity that there would not even be one of the late kings children there to witness this last great campaign he yawned well never mind he doubted there would be more than one man in a hundred in the army who would not rather be where he was right now than where they were his father had asked him if he wanted to come to a house like this a few seasons earlier but he hadnt felt ready he had anyway not been utterly unprepared for a couple of years ferbin had been regaling him with tales of debauchery mostly centred around such houses so he knew what went on and what was required still the full experience was most surprisingly congenial it certainly beat studying hed wished shir rocasse a happy retirement and tove had been well like the best and most accommodating most encouraging and helpful friend a fellow could ever have hed told him as much and been glad to see the resulting look of pleasure on toves face jish was refilling the pipe oramen watched her for a little listening to the noises coming from the far side of the headboard then he swung gently out of the bed and started to pull on his clothes i have to go he told the girl you dont really want to go she said a sly expression on her face she nodded that doesnt want to go he looked down he was hard again thats not me he told her thats only my cock he tapped his head this wants to go she shrugged and lit the pipe he pulled on his trous then stood tucking his shirt in the girl looked darkly through wreaths of grey smoke as he turned towards the door holding his boots in one hand ferbin would have been more of a sport she said he turned and sat by the footboard reaching to pull the girl towards him and saying quietly you were with my brother he glanced up the top edge of the other beds headboard was swaying back and forth quietly he warned her a few times jish said with a sort of shy defiance he was a laugh not like theyre saying now hed have stayed i bet he would oramen said his gaze searched her eyes then he smiled and put one hand out to stroke her face i really do have to go jish another time he padded to the door boots still in one hand jish fell back on the bed staring up at the ceiling pipe out to the side as the door closed quietly a little while later tove breathing hard stuck his head round the side of the headboard and looked puzzled at jish and the otherwise empty bed piss break he asked the girl if it is the little fucks fucked off to the palace for it she told him and taken his fucking togs with him shit tove said and disappeared moments later he too was getting dressed to protests dr gillews the physician had his consulting offices in the palaces lower backing wing only a few minutes walk from the kings chambers by a couple of corridors and a long gallery under the eaves of one of the main buildings it was a surprisingly quiet place so close to the centre of things the chambers looked out over a medicinal garden tipped and terraced to catch the best of the light oramen had found the door unlocked after knocking on it a couple of times he called the doctors name again from just inside the threshold gillews was known to get very caught up in the various experiments and distillations he carried out in his principal work chamber and sometimes did not hear or affected not to hear people calling him oramen went further along the hall then through an archway into what appeared to be the doctors sitting room windows beyond looked out to the little garden distant clouds high above dr gillews he called he could see what looked like a bench in front of the windows covered in books cases phials and retorts he could hear a faint dripping sound and smell something acrid he walked through the sitting room making sure there was nobody there as he went he didnt want to disturb the doctor if he was sleeping the dripping sound came louder and the smell of something bitter grew stronger doctor he stopped staring the doctor was sitting in a wooden chair of ornately twisted carving his head lying on the bench in front of him it appeared to have hit some phials and beakers when he had fallen forward scattering some and breaking others the dripping noise came from liquids spilled from some of the smashed glassware one of the liquids fumed in the air and made a sizzling noise as it struck the wooden floor a syringe stuck out of gillews exposed left lower arm plunger fully in his eyes stared sightlessly along the equipmentstrewn bench oramen put one hand to his mouth oh dr gillews he said and sat down on the floor fearing his legs were about to give out he stood up again quickly coughing and supported himself on the bench the fumes were worse lower down he leant across and pushed open two of the windows looking over the courtyard he took some deep breaths and reached out to feel for a pulse on the doctors neck a little surprised and ashamed that his hand was shaking so gillews skin was quite cold and there was no pulse oramen looked around he wasnt really sure for what everything was untidy but that might well be the norm for such a place he could see no note or last scratched message he supposed he ought to go and inform the palace guard he looked fascinated at the syringe there was blood around the puncture wound where the needle had entered and some bruising and scratches around a handful of other small wounds as though the doctor had had some trouble finding a vein stabbing at himself before he found the right place oramen touched gillews skin again at the exposed wrist where there was a dull bruise he coughed once more throat catching on the fumes as he pulled up the cuff of the shirt covering the doctors other wrist and saw some similar bruising there the arms of the chair were quite broad and flat he pulled the cuff down again went to find a guard the oct used hundreds of their largest scendships and a halfdozen scend tubes cycling loops of vessels like stringed countingstones in the hands of merchants tallying the days takings they filled up with men beasts engines artillery wagons supplies and materiel on the eighth then dropped fast to the ninth to spill their contents and race back up the illsipine tower for another load still the process took a full longday with all the inevitable delay caused by the sheer complexity of the vast undertaking animals panicked in the scendships would not enter or would not leave hefters the most numerous of the beasts of burden seemed to be particularly sensitive roasoaril tankers leaked risking conflagrations steam wagons broke down one blew up while inside a scendship causing no damage to the vessel but killing many inside the oct took that one out of its loop to clean it up and a hundred other small incidents and accidents contrived to make the whole procedure draw itself out beyond what felt like its reasonable limit regent tyl loesp and field marshal werreber wheeled on their lyge about the dimly lit illsipine tower watching the vast army assemble on the towers only slightly brighter sun side then still accompanied by their escorting squadron landed on a hill overlooking the plain above and all around scouts on lyge and caude swung about the dark skies dimly seen shapes watching for an enemy that did not appear to know they were there the fixstar oausillac seeming to hover low over the flat plain to farpole cast a balefully red light over the scene as tyl loesp walked over to werreber taking off his flying gauntlets and clapping his hands it goes well eh field marshal it goes ill give you that the other man said letting a squire lead his lyge away the beasts breath smoked in the cool still air even the air smelled different here tyl loesp thought air smelled different across any level he supposed but that now seemed like a tactical distinction here was a strategic difference something underlying we are undiscovered tyl loesp looked out at the gathering army again that is sufficient for now we have come by an odd route werreber said we are a long way from our goal even further from home distance from home is irrelevant as long as the oct remain allies tyl loesp told him right now we are an hour away from home little more as long as the oct remain allies werreber echoed the regent looked at him sharply then slowly gazed away again you dont distrust them do you trust trust seems irrelevant they will do certain things or not and those things will match with what they have said they will do or not whatever guides their actions is hidden behind so many layers of untranslatable thought it might as well be based on pure chance their alien nature precludes human attributes like trust tyl loesp had never heard werreber give so long a speech he wondered if the field marshal was nervous he nodded one could no more trust an oct than love it still they have been true to their word werreber said they said they would deceive the deldeyn and they did tyl loesp glanced at the other man searching for any sign of irony or even wit werreber oblivious continued they said they would bring us here and they have the deldeyn might take a different view the deceived always will werreber pronounced unshakeable tyl loesp could not but think that they were now in a position very similar to that the deldeyn had been in when they had been issuing from the xiliskine tower barely a month ago convinced no doubt that the oct had allowed them special access to a normally inaccessible tower to allow them to carry out their sneak attack on the very heartland of the sarl people had they felt smug believing that the oct were now on their side had they listened to the same lectures about how the oct were direct descendants of the shellworld builders and nodded just as indulgently had they felt righteous believing that the justice of their cause was being recognised by higher powers for no doubt that was how they did think it seemed to tyl loesp everybody always thought they were right and shared too the quaint belief that the very fervency of a belief however deluded somehow made it true they were all of them fools there was no right and wrong there was simply effectiveness and inability might and weakness cunning and gullibility that he knew this was his advantage but it was one of better understanding not moral superiority he had no delusions there all that he and werreber the army and the sarl could truly rely on was somehow fitting in with the plans that the oct had and staying useful to them until matters had reached a conclusion the oct had their own reasons for wanting the deldeyn reduced and the sarl promoted and tyl loesp had an idea what those reasons were and why they were taking this route not the obvious one but he was willing to accept that for now they were all simply tools the oct were using that would change if he had any say in it but for now they were undeniably wielded change it would though there were times points when a relatively small but decisive motion could trigger a weighty cascade of most momentous consequences when the user became the used and the tool became the hand and the brain behind it too had he not been the kings right arm had he not been the very epitome of trusted valiant helper and yet when the time had been right had he not struck with all the suddenly unimpounded force of a lifetimes unjust deference and subservience he had killed his king the man to whom all around him not just the credulous masses thought he owed everything but he knew the truth which was that to be king was only to be the biggest bully in a race of bullies and bullied the greatest braggart charlatan in a species of blustering priests and cowed acolytes with nary a thought to rub between them the king had no inherent nobility or even right to rule the whole idea of inheritable dominion was nonsensical if it could throw up particles like the studiously malleable oramen and the hopelessly looseliving ferbin ruthlessness will the absolute application of force and power these were what secured authority and dominance he won who saw most clearly the way the universe really worked tyl loesp had seen that hausk was the one to take the sarl so far along their course but no further the king had not seen that too he had not realised that his most trusted helper might have plans desires and ambitions of his own and they might be best served by replacing him so hausk had trusted tyl loesp and that had been stupid that had been a misty selfdeceptive kind of seeing and on a pinnacle so exposed and high as that of monarch you paid for such foolishness so he had killed his king but that meant little it was no more wrong to kill a king than any man and most men could see that all lives were cheap and eminently disposable including their own they held that in such high regard only because it was all they had not because they thought it meant much to the universe it took a religion to convince people of that and he would make sure that the emphasis on that aspect of the sarl faith was reduced in future to the benefit of those tenets which invoked humility and obedience his only regret in killing hausk hed realised was that hausk had had so little time to appreciate what had happened to think back on what must have been going on in his faithful lieutenants mind for all those years as hed died but it was a small regret they had made the journey unharmed so far more than threequarters of the army was safely delivered and a more than sufficient force had been left on the eighth to deal with any possible desperate attack by the deldeyn they probably still had the advantage of surprise too a small outpost of lyge scouts there specifically to watch the tower and report if it ever was used to conduct an incursion had been surprised and quickly overwhelmed in the first action of this latest stage of the war a contingent of the new regents guard the very cream of the armys best units had been entrusted with this and had triumphed the deldeyn had no telegraph so their fastest communications moved by heliograph signal light carrier bird or a messenger on an air beast the elite force which had taken the little fort reported that they were sure no message had left it still the deldeyn must have felt confident at a similar stage too when they had issued from the xiliskine tower how quickly had they realised that they had not just been unlucky but deceived at what point did it dawn on them that far from being about to inflict a crushing defeat on their enemies they were about to suffer one themselves and the war would be not won on that morning but lost how deluded are we he thought how often how multiply are we used he still remembered the alienman xide hyrlis coming to them with his glum prognostications regarding the future of warfare on their level nearly a dozen longyears ago they would fall he warned them under the power of the first ruler to realise that the new discoveries in distillation metallurgy and explosives spelled the end of the old chivalrous ways the immediate future hyrlis had told them meant leaving the air to scouts messengers and hitandfly raiding forces there was an invention called the telegraph that could move information more quickly than the fleetest lyge and more reliably than by heliograph use that it would lead to still greater things later there would be some disagreement over whether hyrlis had pointed them towards an inventor who had already developed such an instrument or pointed the inventor himself in the right experimental direction abandon the great and noble tradition of wellbred men mounted on wellbred caude and lyge hyrlis said build bigger guns more guns better guns give more guns to more men train them and arm them properly mount them on animals and wheeled and tracked transports powered by steam for now and reap the benefits or pay the penalty when somebody else sensed the change in the wind before you did hausk still a young man and the inexperienced newly crowned king of a small struggling kingdom had to tyl loesps surprise and initial chagrin even disbelief fallen on these ideas like a starved man on a banquet tyl loesp had with all the other nobles tried to argue him out of the infatuation but hausk had pressed ahead in time tyl loesp heard the first rumblings of something beyond mere discontent amongst his fellow nobles and had had to make a choice it was the turning point of his life he made his choice and warned the king the ringleaders of the conspiring nobles were executed the rest had their lands seized and were disgraced tyl loesp became despised by some lauded by others and trusted utterly by his king the disputatious nobles had neatly removed the main obstacle to change themselves and hausks reforms roared ahead unstayed one victory led to another and soon there seemed to be nothing but victories hausk tyl loesp and the armies they commanded swept all before them xide hyrlis had left long before almost before any of the reforms had been effected and it seemed he was quickly forgotten few people had known about him in the first place and those who had mostly had good reason to downplay his contribution to this new age of innovation progress and neverending martial success hausk himself still paid tribute to the man if only in private but what had hyrlis left what course had he set them on were they not his tools somehow were they perhaps doing his bidding even now were they puppets playthings even pets would they be allowed to achieve only so much and then as he after all had done to the king have everything taken away on the very brink of complete success but he must not fall prey to such thoughts a little caution and some rough idea of what to do if things happened for the worst that was excusable but to wallow in doubt and presentiments of disaster only served to help bring about that which was most feared he would not give in to that weakness they were set for victory if they struck now they would wm and then the territory opened up where the oct might find themselves no longer in full control he raised his nose and sniffed there was a smell of burning in the air something unpleasantly sweet and somehow despoiled loose on the slowly strengthening breeze hed sensed this before at the battle before the xiliskine tower and noted it then the smell of warfare had a new signature that of distilled incinerated roasoaril oil battle itself now smelled of smoke tyl loesp could remember when the relevant scents had been sweat and blood how awful for you rather more so for the doctor well indeed though when you saw him he was past caring renneque looked from oramen to harne wouldnt you say maam a most unfortunate incident harne the lady aelsh sat dressed in her finest and most severe mourning red surrounded by her closest ladiesinwaiting and a further group of ladies and gentlemen who had been invited to her salon within her apartments in the main palace less than a minutes walk from the throne room and the court principals chamber it was a select group oramen recognised a famous painter an actor and impresario a philosopher a falsettist and an actress the citys most fashionable and handsome priest was present long black hair glistening eyes twinkling surrounded by a smaller semicourt of blushing young ladies a brace of ancient noblemen too decrepit to venture to war completed the company oramen watched harne absently stroking a sleeping ynt lying curled on her lap the animals fur had been dyed red to match her dress and wondered why hed been invited perhaps it was a gesture of conciliation just as likely it was to have him tell his somewhat grisly tale in person and of course he was the heir to the throne hed noticed that many people felt a need to display their faces before him as often as possible he had to keep reminding himself of that he smiled at renneque imagining her naked after jish and her friends he had a template something to go on now or there was another of harnes attendant ladies called ramile a slim blonde with tightly curled hair she had rather caught his eye and did not seem to resent his interest looking back shyly but frequently smiling he sensed renneque glancing at the younger woman then later glaring at her perhaps he might use one to get to the other he was starting to understand how such matters worked and then of course there was the lady actor who was the most beautiful woman in the room there was a refreshing directness in her look he rather liked the doctor was known to indulge himself in the more pleasantly affective cures and potions of his trade i believe the priest said then sipped his infusion they were gathered to take a variety of recently fashionable drinks most not long arrived from a variety of foreign parts all newly openedup dependencies of the greater kingdom the infusions were nonalcoholic though some were mildly narcotic he was a weak man harne pronounced if a good physician it was so written in his stars said a small man oramen had seen and half recognised harnes latest pet astrologer the philosopher sitting as far from the astrologer as practically possible gave a small snort and shook his head he muttered something to the nearest ladyinwaiting she looked blank though politely so the astrologer represented the latest fad in astrology which claimed that human affairs were affected by the stars beyond sursamen the old astrology had ascribed influences to the fixstars and rollstars of the eighth and beyond especially those of the ninth which after all swept by just under ones feet and so were technically closer than those hundreds of kilometres overhead oramen had little time even for the old stuff but it seemed more plausible to him than this new nonsense however the extrasursamen astrology for so it was termed was new and so for this reason alone he supposed possessed an irresistible attraction to a certain class of mind renneque was nodding wisely at the small astrologers words oramen wondered if he really should attempt to bed renneque the lady silbe he was troublingly aware that he would once again be following his brother the court would doubtless find out renneque and her peers were indiscreet what would people think of him for going where his wastrel brother had already been would they think he was trying to prove he had the equal of ferbins appetites or was seeking to emulate him unable to decide on his own tastes or would they even think that he sought to pay homage to him he was still worrying at this and not really listening to the conversation which appeared to have spun off into some rather selfconsciously clever talk about cures and addictions benefits and curses when harne suddenly suggested the two of them take a turn on the balcony beyond the room my lady he said when the tall shutters had swung to behind them the evening lay stretched out across the nearpole sky filling the air with purples reds and ochres the lower palace and city beyond was mostly dark just a few public lights showing harnes dress looked darker out here almost black i am told you seek the return of your mother harne said well she was direct i do he said he had written to her several times since the kings death and told her that he hoped to bring her back to pourl back to the court as soon as possible he had sent more formal telegraphed messages as well though they would have to be translated into a paper message at some point too as the telegraph wires did not extend so far round the world as the benighted spot his mother had been exiled to she often said how beautiful the place was but he suspected she dissembled to spare his feelings he supposed harne had heard through the telegraph network the operatives were notorious gossips she is my mother he told harne she should be here at my side especially once i become king and i would not seek to prevent her return had i the power please believe me harne said you thought to cause her exile in the first place oramen wanted to say but didnt that is as well he said harne appeared distracted her expression even by the uncertain light of the drawnout sunset and the candles of the room behind them patently confused and uncertain please understand that my concern is for my own place following her return i wish her no ill quite none at all but i would know if her enhancement requires my own degradation not through any choice of mine madam oramen said he felt a deliciousness in the situation he felt he was a man now but he could still too well remember being a boy or at least being treated like one now this woman who had once seemed like a queen like the strictest stepmother like a powerful capricious ogre to him hung on his every word and turn of phrase beseeching him from outside the citadel of his new and sudden power my position is secure harne asked he had thought about this he still resented what harne had done whether she had demanded outright that his own mother be banished presented the king with a choice between the two of them or just inveigled schemed and suggested her way towards the idea that such a choice must be made but his only thought was for aclyn the lady blisk his own mother would harnes reduction be to her good he doubted it harne was popular and liked and even more so now she was pitied as the tragic widow and grieving mother all in one representing in that woe something of what the whole kingdom felt to be seen to persecute her would reflect badly on him and by immediate extension on his mother too harne the lady aelsh had to be shown every respect or his mothers just advancement and restoration would be a hollow bitter thing indeed he would rather it was otherwise for in his heart he wanted to banish harne as his own mother had been banished but it could not be and he had to accept that madam your position is perfectly secure i honour you as she who was queen in all but name i wish merely to see my mother again and have her take her rightful place at court it will in no sense be at your expense you were both loved by my father he chose you over her and fate has chosen me over your son you and she are equal in that it is a sad equality it is what we have id say i would have my mother back but not above you she never could be in the affections of the people your position is unimpeachable madam id not have it otherwise well i would he thought but what would be the point in telling you i am grateful prince harne said laying one hand briefly on his arm she took a breath looking down my oramen thought how my power affects people and things being king could be highly agreeable we ought to go in harne said smiling up at him people might talk she said and gave an almost coquettish laugh such that just for an instant without in any way desiring her for himself he saw suddenly what it might be about the woman that could have so captivated his father he would banish the mother of two of his children to keep her or even just to keep her happy she paused as she put her hand to the handle of the door leading back to the room prince she said gazing up into his eyes oramen if i may of course dear lady what now he thought your reassurance perversely deserves its opposite i beg your pardon i would have a care prince regent i fail to understand you maam one always cares one always has cares what more specific specific i cannot be oramen my concerns rest on vaguenesses associations that may be perfectly innocent coincidences that may be just those and no more mere hints of rumours of gossip nothing solid or incontrovertible at all indeed only just enough to say that the prince regent should take care that is all we are all of us forever on the brink of whatever fate may hold for us even though we might not know it she put her hand to his arm again please prince regent dont think i seek to discomfit you there is no malice in this if i thought only for myself i would take what you have just told me to my great relief and say no more for i realise that what i say now may sound disquieting even allied to a threat though it is not please believe me it is not i have had the most obscure and reluctant intelligences that suggest no more all is not as it appears and so i ask you take care prince regent he wasnt sure what to say her gaze searched his eyes please say i have not offended you oramen you have done me generous service in reassuring me as you have and i would despair if i caused you to retract any part of that but such grace commands i find the last seamed scrap i have to offer in grateful return and what ive said is all i have i beg you neither to scorn it nor ignore it i fear we both might suffer from dismissal oramen still felt mightily confused and was already determined to revisit this conversation as accurately as he could when he had the leisure but he nodded gravely though with a small smile and said then be doubly reassured maam i regard you no less for what youve said i thank you for your thoughtfulness and counsel i shall think on it assuredly the ladys face lit from the side by candlelight looked suddenly careworn oramen thought her gaze flicked across his eyes again then she smiled tremulously and nodded and let him open the door for her the redcoloured ynt that had been sleeping on her lap curled out through the sliver of opening and whined and circled round her feet oh obli the lady cried stooping to scoop the animal into her arms and rubbing her nose against its cant i leave you for a moment they went back into the room they crossed a night and a region of bare at the same time it was the least propitious combination known to the superstitious and even the most practical and hardheaded amongst them felt the tension it was a long stretch but there would be no supply dumps or fortlets left here ordering men to stay in such a place was like consigning them to a living death the animals complained mightily hating the darkness and perhaps the strange smooth feel of the material beneath them the steam wagons and transports could not have been more suited to the terrain or lack of it and quickly pulled ahead good discipline orders given sternly in briefings over the days before and perhaps a degree of fear ensured that the army did not become too attenuated searchlights shone upwards to help guide the airborne escorts and returning scouts there would be three longdays of this the night was caused by a series of great vanes that both hung from the levels ceiling high above obstructing all but the faintest airglow of the fixstar oausillac to farpole and had risen like the blade of some infinite knife from the ground ten or so kilometres to their right until they sat like a slice of night above them six or seven kilometres high and hooked and curved over like some incomprehensibly colossal claw men felt appropriately tiny in the shadow of such manufactured vastness in a place like this the heads of even the most unimaginative of beings began to fill with questions if not outright dread what titans had forged such vast geographies what starencompassing hubris had dictated the placement of these enormous vanes just so like scimitared propellers from ships the size of planets what oceanic volumes of what outlandish materials could ever have required such prodigious impelment a fierce wind arose coming straight at them at first forcing the airbeasts down for shelter it scoured the last few grains of sand and grit from the bare making it entirely clear how this arid region came to be stripped not just of any ground cover but of any ground at all they were travelling across the very bones of their vast world tyl loesp thought the absolute base and fundament of all that gave them life when the wind eased a little and veered he ordered his halftrack command vehicle to stop and got down from it the machine grumbled beside him headlights picking out twin cones of creamy bare ahead of it all around the army trundled past engines blattering unseen fumes rising into the inky dark he took his glove off knelt and pressed his open palm against the bare against the pure prime of sursamens being i touch the ancient past he thought and the future our descendants might build on this mighty godthreatening scale one day if i cannot be there and the aliens had the gift of eternal life so he might be there if all went as he dared to hope then my name shall nearby in the loud darkness a supply wagons tractor had broken down a spare was being attached he put his glove back on and returned to the halftrack frankly sir its a murder weapon illis the palace armourer said he was squat and sturdy his hands were dark ingrained oramen turned the slim but allegedly powerful pistol over in his hand he had fretted about harnes warning for some days before eventually deciding to dismiss it but had then woken from a dream wherein hed been trapped in a chair while faceless men shoved knives into his arms he had been going to dismiss that too but then came to the conclusion that something inside him was worried and even if it was just to keep such nightmares at bay carrying a weapon more powerful than just his usual long knife might be advisable the gun felt heavy its mechanism was worked by a strong spring so that it could be used singlehanded and it contained ten onepiece shells arranged in a sort of staggered vertical within the handle and propelled to the firing chamber by another spring cocked by a lever that folded away after use the shells were crosscut on their tips a manstopper illis said then paused actually a hefterstopper to serve truth fair he smiled which was a little disconcerting as he had very few teeth left try to avoid accidents with it sir he said reasonably then insisted the prince practise using it in the long firing gallery attached to the armoury the gun certainly kicked like a hefter and barked louder than one oramen thought but it fired straight and true he found a place for its lightly oiled ynthide holster concealed in a plumpedout part of his tunic at the back and promised to keep its safety catch secured cumuloform it was some time before ferbin would accept he was not dead he drifted up towards some sort of awareness to find himself suspended in airy nothing beneath a vast glowing mass of frozen bubbles enormous goldtinged clouds stretched in every direction mostly up far below was a startlingly blue ocean devoid of land unchanging patterned with a ruffled weave of waves it seemed for all its oceanic blueness somehow frozen sometimes as he drifted over this apparition it did seem to change and he thought he saw tiny flecks appear on its surface but then the tiny flecks disappeared with the same microscopic slowness with which they had come into being and all was as before serene calm unchanging heavenly he had the feeling he had recently been in the ocean though it had been warm rather than cold and he had been able to breathe despite being submerged in it it was as though death was somehow like being born like being still in the womb and now he was here in this strange scape of infinite cloud and neverending ocean with only the comforting presence of slowly passing towers to reassure him he was in the appropriate afterlife and even the towers seemed too far apart he saw a face it was a human face and he knew he ought to recognise it then he was awake again and the face had gone he suspected he had dreamed the face and wondered about dreaming when you were patently dead then he seemed to fall asleep in retrospect that was surprising too he was awake and there was a strange numbness about his back and right shoulder he could feel no pain or discomfort but it felt like there was a huge hole in him covering a quarter of his torso something that he couldnt reach or feel or do anything with filling his ears was a distant roaring noise like a waterfall heard at a distance he floated over the unimpeachably perfect blueness a sunset came on slowly burnishing the huge clouds with red violet and mauve he watched a tower slide past its sallow trunk disappearing into the deepening azure mass of the sea edged with white where the surfaces met then it was dark and only distant lightning lit the ocean and the towering clouds ushering him back to sleep with silent bursts of faraway light this must he thought be heaven some sort of reward anyway ideas about what happened after you died varied even amongst the priestly caste primitives were able to have more straightforward religions because they didnt know any better once you knew even a little of the reality of the situation in the outside universe it all got a bit more complex there were lots of aliens and they all had or had once had their own myths and religions some aliens were immortal some had constructed their own fully functional afterlives where the deceased recorded transcribed ended up after death some had made thinking machines that had their own sets of imponderable and semigodlike powers some just were gods like the worldgod for example and some had sublimed which itself was arguably a form of ascension to godhead ferbins father had had the same robustly pragmatic view of religion as hed had of everything else in his opinion only the very poor and downtrodden really needed religion to make their laborious lives more bearable people craved selfimportance they longed to be told they mattered as individuals not just as part of a mass of people or some historical process they needed the reassurance that while their life might be hard bitter and thankless some reward would be theirs after death happily for the governing class a wellformed faith also kept people from seeking their recompense in the here and now through riot insurrection or revolution a temple was worth a dozen barracks a militia man carrying a gun could control a small unarmed crowd only for as long as he was present however a single priest could put a policeman inside the head of every one of their flock for ever the more comfortably off and those with real power might choose to believe or not as their personal proclivities dictated but their relatively easeful pleasant lives were their own rewards and for the highest in the land posterity a place in history itself would be their prize after death ferbin had never really bothered with thoughts of an afterlife where he was now did seem like heaven or something like it but he wasnt sure part of him wished hed paid more attention to the priests when theyd been trying to instruct him about this sort of thing but then given that he appeared to have achieved the afterlife without either faith or knowledge what would have been the point choubris holse looked down on him choubris holse that had been the name of the face hed seen earlier he stared at it and wondered what holse was doing in the land of the dead and wearing odd toolooselooking clothes too though he still had his belt and knife should holse be here perhaps he was just visiting he moved and could feel something in the place where before there had been no feeling or movement in his right upper back he looked around as best he could he was riding in something like a balloon gondola lying prone on a large subtly undulating bed naked but for a thin covering choubris holse was sitting looking at him chewing on what looked like a stringy piece of dried meat ferbin suddenly felt ravenously hungry holse belched and excused himself and ferbin experienced an odd amalgam of emotions as he realised that this was not the afterlife and that he was still alive goodday sir holse said his voice sounded funny ferbin clung briefly to this scrap of evidence that he might still be safely dead with the ferocity of a drowning man clutching at a floating leaf then he let it go he tried working his mouth his jaw clicked and his mouth felt gummy a noise like an old mans groan sounded from somewhere and ferbin was forced to acknowledge it had probably been emitted by himself feeling better sir holse asked matteroffactly ferbin tried to move his arms and found that he could he brought both hands up to his face they looked pale and the skin was all ridged like the ocean that still sailed by below like hed been too long in it or maybe just too long in a nice warm bath holse he croaked at your service sir holse sighed as ever ferbin looked about clouds ocean bubble gondola thing where is this not heaven not heaven sir no youre quite sure more than moderately positive sir this is a portion of the fourth sir we are in the realm of the beings that call themselves cumuloforms the fourth ferbin said his voice sounded odd too but we are still within great sursamen assuredly sir just four levels up halfway to the surface ferbin looked around again how extraordinary he breathed then coughed extraordinarily boring sir holse said frowning at his piece of dried meat weve been sailing over this water for the past five longdays or so and while the prospect is most impressive at first and the air bracing youd be amazed how quickly the impressiveness and the bracingness become tedious when thats all there is to contemplate all day well all there is to contemplate all day save for your good self of course sir and frankly you were no circus of boundless fun either in your sleeping state nary a word sir certainly nary a word of sense but in any event sir welcome back to the land of the living holse made a show of looking beneath his feet through a translucent membrane that showed a hazy version of the ocean far below though land as you might have noticed is the one thing this level appears to be somewhat short of definitely the fourth ferbin said he leaned up on one elbow something twinged in his right shoulder and he grimaced to look over the side of the bed he was lying on peering down through the hazy surface holse was standing on it all looked rather alarming definitely the fourth sir not that i had opportunity to count as it were but that is most certainly what its denizens term it ferbin looked at the dried meat held in holses hand he nodded at it i say dyou think i might have some of that ill get you a fresh piece shall i sir they said you were all right to eat like normal when you wanted to no no that bit will do ferbin said still staring at the meat and feeling his mouth fill with saliva as you wish sir holse handed ferbin the meat he crammed it into his mouth it tasted salty and slightly fishy and very good how did we come to be here holse he said through mouthfuls and who would be these they well now sir holse said ferbin had been badly wounded by a carbine bullet as they stumbled into the cylinder that had revealed itself on the octs access tower a lucky shot holse told him firing in near darkness from a beating airbeast at a running target even the greatest marksman would need his fair share of good fortune for a month all gathered together at once to secure a hit the two of them had fallen into the interior of the cylinder which then just sat there door still open for what had seemed like an eternity to holse he had cradled the already unconscious ferbin in his arms slowly becoming covered in blood screaming at whoever or whatever to close the door or sink the effing tube thing back down into the tower but nothing had happened until some of the men who had attacked them actually landed on the surface outside then the cylinder did finally lower itself back into the tower hed yelled and hollered for help for ferbin because he was sure that the prince was dying meanwhile he had the impression that the round room they were in was continuing to sink deeper inside the access tower the room came to a stop the doorway theyd fallen through had slid into being again and a machine the shape of a large oct had scuttled in towards them it took ferbins limp body off him and quickly turned him this way and that finding the hole in his back and the larger exit wound in his chest sealing both with some sort of squirty stuff and cradling his head with a sort of hand thing pincers on that hand had seemed to slide into ferbins neck and lower skull but ferbin had been too far gone to react and holse had just assumed and hoped that this was somehow all part of the ministering or doctoring or whatever was going on a floating platform appeared and took them along a broad hallway with whole sets and sequences of most impressive doors each easily the equal in size of the main gates to the palace in pourl which variously slid rolled rose and fell to allow them through holse had guessed that they were entering the base of the dnengoal tower itself the final chamber was a big sphere with an added floor and this had sealed itself tight and started moving possibly up it was hard to say the place had felt damp and the floor had patches of water on it the oct doctor machine continued to work on ferbin who had at least stopped bleeding a screen lowered itself from the ceiling and addressed holse who spent the next hour or so trying to explain what had happened who they both were and why one of them was almost dead from ferbins jacket he had fished out the envelopes seltis the head scholar had given them they were covered in blood and one of them looked like it had been nicked by the carbine bullet on its way out of ferbins chest holse had waved these at the screen hoping their effectiveness was not impaired by blood or having a hole in one corner he felt he was almost starting to get the hang of how to talk to an oct when some clunking and gentle bouncing around told him they had arrived somewhere else the door swung open again and a small group of real proper oct had looked in through a wall as transparent as the best glass but wobbly as a flag on a windy day holse had forgotten the name of the towermaster seltis had said the name when hed given them the travel documents but holse had been too busy trying to think what they were going to do next to pay attention he waved the travel documents again then the name just popped into his head aiaik he exclaimed it sounded like a cry of pain or surprise he thought and he wondered what he and ferbin must look like to these clever strangelooking aliens whether the towermasters name had any real effect was debatable but the two of them ferbin carried by the limbs of the oct doctor machine found themselves still on their little floating platform riding along various waterfilled corridors inside a bubble of air the oct whod been looking in at them through the wobbly glass accompanied them swimming alongside they entered a large chamber of great complexity the oct doctor machine cut the clothes from ferbin a sort of jacket was wrapped round his chest a transparent mask connected to long tubes was placed over his face other tubes fastened to his head where the doctors pincers had entered and then he was placed in a large tank one of the oct had tried to explain what was going on though holse hadnt understood much holse had been told ferbin would take time to repair still sitting on the platform that had borne them earlier hed been shown through the watery environment to a nearby room from which all the water drained away while fresh air took its place the oct hed been talking to had stayed with him its body covered in a sort of barely visible suit of moisture another set of dry rooms had opened up which seemed to have been designed for human habitation the oct had said he could live here for the few days ferbin would take to repair then left him alone hed walked over to the set of round manhigh windows and looked out over the land of the sarl as hed never seen it before from nearly fourteen hundred kilometres above the surface through the vacuum which existed above the atmosphere that covered the land like a warm blanket what a sight sir holse appeared lost for a moment then shook his head and how came we to be here on the fourth ferbin asked the oct only control the dnengoal tower up to this level as far as i can understand the matter sir they seemed reluctant to admit this as though it was the cause for some embarrassment which it may well indeed be oh ferbin said he hadnt known that the conducer peoples ever controlled only part of a tower hed just assumed it was all or nothing from core to surface and on account of the fact that beyond the ninth one is in the realm of the oversquare transference from one tower to another is not possible over what this has all been explained to me by the oct i was talking to on the screen while being bled upon by your good self and subsequently and at some length in my quarters near your place of treatment sir really then kindly explain it to me its all to do with the distances apart that the towers are sir below and up to the level of the ninth their filigree connects and the filigree is of sufficient hollowness for scendships which is the proper term for the spherical room which transported us i know what a scendship is holse well they can switch from one tower to another through their connectings in amongst the filigree but above the ninth the filigree doesnt connect so to get from one tower to another one has to travel between them through whatever exists on the relevant level ferbins understanding of such matters was like his understanding of most things vague again it would have been much less so if hed ever paid any attention to the relevant lessons from his tutors the towers supported the ceiling over each level through a great fluted outbranching of this stuff called filigree whose greater members were as hollow as the towers themselves given that the same number of towers supported each level whether it was the one closest to the core or that supporting the surface the towers would be at a greater distance from each other the closer they got to that last outward level and the filigree would no longer need to join up to support the weight above the whole of the fourth holse said is home to these cumuloform which are clouds but clouds which are in some sense intelligent in that mysterious and not especially useful way so many alien peoples and things tend to be sir they float over oceans full of fishes and sea monsters and such or rather over one big ocean which fills the whole of the bottom part of the level the way land does on our own dear eighth anyway theyre seemingly happy to transport folk between towers when the oct ask them to oh and i should say welcome to expanded version five zourd holse said looking up and around at the nebulous mass of cloud extending around and far above them for that is what this one is called indeed ferbin said goodday the voice sounded like a whole chorus of whispered echoes and seemed to issue from every part of the bubblewall around them and ah and to you good ah cumuloform ferbin said out loud looking up at the cloud above he continued to gaze expectantly upwards for a few more moments then looked back at holse who shrugged it is not what youd call talkative sir hmm anyway ferbin said sitting up and staring at holse why do the oct only control the dnengoal up to the fourth because sir the aultridia holse averted his head to spit on the semitransparent floor control the upper levels oh my god worldgod be preserved indeed sir what you mean they control the upper levels of all towers no sir but wasnt the dnengoal always an oct tower it was sir until recently this seems to be the principal cause of the embarrassment felt by the oct sir part of their tower has been taken over from them and by the vileness ferbin said genuinely horrified the very filth of god the aultridia were an upstart species recent arrivals on the involved scene who had wasted no time in establishing themselves shouldering their way to as near the front of the galactic stage as possible they were far from alone in that what distinguished them was the manner and location of their coming to sentient fruition as a species the aultridia had evolved from parasites which had lived under the carapaces and between the skin layers of the species called the xinthia xinthian tensile aeronathaurs to give them their proper name it was one of these that the sarl called the worldgod the xinthia were regarded with something approaching affection by even the most ruthless and unsentimental of the galaxys involved partly because they had done much great work in the past they had been particularly active in the swarm wars of great antiquity battling runaway nanotech outbreaks swarmata in general and other monopathic hegemonising events but mostly because they were no threat to anybody any more and a system of the galactic communitys size and complexity just seemed to need one grouping that everybody was allowed to like utterly ancient once nearinvincibly powerful now reduced to one paltry solar system and a few eccentric individuals hiding in the cores of shellworlds for no discernible reason the xinthia were seen as eccentric bumbling wellmeaning civilisationally exhausted the joke was they hadnt the energy to sublime and generally as the honoured goodasdead deserving of a comfortable retirement the aultridia were regarded as having spoiled that comfortable twilight over the space of several hundred thousand years the great airdwelling spacefaring aeronathaurs had been greatly troubled by the increasingly active creatures they were playing host to the infestation of superparasites running round the necklace of aeronathaur habitats orbiting the star chone like a disease it hadnt lasted the advantage of a truly intelligent parasite was that you could reason with it and the aultridia had long since abandoned their old ways leaving their onetime hosts alone in return for material advancement and what seemed like alien superscience to them but was like a box of broken toys discovered in a dusty attic to the xinthia they had constructed their own purposebuilt habitats and taken up the task of opening up and maintaining shellworlds this swiftly turned into a real and useful speciality it was conventionally assumed that burrowing into a shellworld was somehow something they were suited for just by their history and nature the stigma of their birthright remained however and it didnt help that the matlike aultridia stank like rotting meat to most oxygenbreathing species the only remaining suspicion regarding the aultridias present existence was that they had established at least a token presence on all the shellworlds which contained xinthians often at impractical cost and to the considerable annoyance of other conducer species like the oct to date as far as anyone knew the aultridia had never even tried to penetrate all the way down through the levels of a shellworld to a coredwelling xinthian even the more established conducer species tended to leave the ancient beings alone out of respect and possibly an almost superstitious wariness but that didnt reassure many people least of all those like the sarl who treated the xinthian at the core of the world as a god and were appalled at the idea of the ghastly aultridia worming their way down to the core to do godknewwhat to their deity only the iln the fabled and happily longdeparted species which had spent so much of their hateful existence destroying shellworlds were more despised by the sarl and all rightthinking people the oct of course had not been shy about promoting this view of the aultridia amongst their client species like the sarl arguably exaggerating both the incorrigibility of aultridian nature and the concomitant threat the species posed to the worldgod the oct were also not slow in pointing out that they were by their own claim at least directly descended from the involucra the very people who had designed and constructed the deeply wonderful shellworlds and so part of a line of almost godlike creators nearly a billion years old by comparison the aultridia were ghastly parasitic newbie slime barely worthy of the term civilised so ferbin said were floating to another tower we are still on our way to the surface i trust we are sir ferbin looked through the nearperfectly transparent bed he lay on down to the waves far below we do not seem to be moving especially quickly apparently we are however sir were going four or five times faster than even a lyge can fly though certainly not as quickly as an alien flying machine it doesnt look very fast ferbin said still staring at the ocean we are very high sir that makes our progress look slow ferbin looked up they appeared to be on the very lowest wisp of a vast mass of golden whiteness and this thing is basically just a cloud he asked it is sir though it sticks together better than the clouds were used to and it is by allegement intelligent ferbin thought about this he had never really been trained to think properly for himself or thought much of thinking as it were but over the past few days and adventures he had discovered that the pastime was not without its benefits is it not then at the mercy of the winds holse looked mildly surprised you know sir i thought that however it appears the cumuloforms can control their height with some exactness and because the level is so arranged with winds heading in different directions at different elevations they can navigate near well as a bird just by taking care how high off the ground well sea they are ferbin felt the edge of the simple sheet covering his nakedness do we still have the documents seltis gave us here sir holse said pulling them from his loosefitting tunic ferbin collapsed back on the bed exhausted is there water here im thirsty i think youll find that tube there will provide the necessary sir ferbin took a dangling transparent tube and sucked at it taking his fill of pleasantly sweettasting water then lay back he looked over at holse so choubris holse you are still with me plain as sir you did not go back even though we have now most certainly left my fathers kingdom i thought the better of it sir the gentlemen on the lyge who tried to detain us at the tower did not seem overenthusiastic regarding the niceties of establishing the innocence of one acting merely as a faithful servant it occurred to me that you might be of most use to the current regime dead if you see what i mean sir and on account of you having been already so pronounced some effort might be made to turn this incorrect statement into a true one only backdated if you get my drift your being alive does rather contradict the official version of events and it strikes me that knowledge of that fact is somewhat like an infective disease and a fatal one at that while ferbin was still thinking his way through this holse frowned cleared his throat and gathered his tunic about him and it did occur to me sir that you did somewhat save my life on that tower thing when that little lyge flier chappie was quite set it seemed to me on taking it did i ferbin asked he supposed he had he had never saved anybodys life before realising that he had was a rather agreeable sensation not that it wasnt my sticking with you that had got me into said parlous situation in the first place mind sir holse went on seeing a look of dreamy selfsatisfaction appear on ferbins pale lightly bearded face indeed indeed ferbin said he was thinking again you will be some time away from those you love i fear dear holse it has barely been three weeks sir quite possibly they have yet to miss me in any event im best to stay away until matters are sorted sir also if the palace officials work at their customary pace in such affairs my stipend will continue to be paid for a good longyear or more your wife will be able to collect it she always has sir to protect it and me from funding an overfamiliarity with such pleasures as a fellow might meet with in drinking and smoking establishments betting parlours and the like ferbin smiled still you must miss her and your children three isnt it four at the last count sir you will see them again good holse ferbin said feeling oddly tearful he smiled again at holse and put his hand out holse stared at it confused good servant take my hand we are as much friends now as master and servant and when i return to reclaim what is rightfully mine you shall be most richly rewarded holse took ferbins hand awkwardly why thats most kind sir right now id settle for a glass of something other than water and a pipe of leaf frankly but its nice to have something to look forward to ferbin felt his eyes closing seemingly of their own volition i think i need to sleep some more he said and was unconscious almost before the last word was uttered the cumuloform called expanded version five zourd drifted into the lee of the twokilometrewide vawyei tower and started elongating itself eventually extending one single trailing tip of cloud down to the surface of a much smaller though still substantial tower protruding fifty metres or so from the ocean a great swell near long as the world was round washed about it waves rising and falling back like the beat of some vast heart a fixstar sat low on the horizon staining the clouds and waves with an everlasting sunrisesunset of red and gold the air smelled sharp the circular surface of the tower was strewn with seaweed and sunbleached fish bones ferbin and holse stepped out of a hole which had appeared in the side of the lowest of the bubble chambers they had occupied for the last few days waiting for them at the centre of the tower was a raised portion like the one in which they had taken shelter back on the eighth ferbin turned and called farewell and thank you to the cloud and heard the same strange chorus of whispers say goodbye then the cloud seemed to gather itself up and spread itself out great billowing wings of cloudstuff starting to catch the wind on the edges of the towers lee and pulling the strange huge but insubstantial creature up and away they stood and watched it go fascinated until a chime sounded from the open door of the access towers raised portion better not miss the coach holse said they stepped into the chamber which took them down towards the base of the nearby tower a scendship was waiting for them at the far end of the great hall and the gleaming multifarious doors the part they could see was a simple sphere perhaps twenty metres in diameter with a transparent roof its doors closed a distant oct told them via a screen that their documents were in order without ferbin even having to take them from his pocket and brandish them the two men looked up through the roof at a vast blackness threaded with tiny lights and crisscrossed with pale struts and tubes describing a complicated set of spirals around and through the seemingly infinite space holse whistled didnt spot that last time the scendship moved smoothly away accelerating upwards into the darkness the lights flowed silently around them until they both felt dizzy and had to look away they found a dry part of the mostly still damp floor and sat there talking occasionally glancing upwards a lot for the hour or so until the scendship slowed and stopped then nudged on upwards through more enormous doors some sliding some rolling some seeming to pull back from the centre in every direction at once to another level of the colossal cylinder the scendship picked up speed again tearing silently up the lightstrewn tube of darkness and flickering tubework they stretched their legs ferbin exercised the shoulder where hed been shot it was no more than slightly stiff holse asked a patch of screen on the wall if it could hear him and was rewarded with an informative speech in an eccentric version of the sarl language which he only realised was recorded when he tried to ask it questions they were now passing the third level which was dark no land all just bare just prime and no water or atmosphere or even interior stars at all the next level up was also vacuum but it did have stars and there were things called baskers that lived there and apparently just lay about absorbing sunlight like trees the last level before the surface was vacuum again and was a seedsail nursery whatever that was or they were the scendship slowed for the final time they watched the last few lights disappear around the side of the craft thumps squelches and sighing noises announced some sort of conclusion and the door rolled open to the side they passed down one broad tall but very plain corridor and negotiated a round lift at the far end which ascended with multiple hesitations then they walked through another great corridor of what looked like very thincut sandstone lit from within whole sets of massive doors opened in front of them and closed behind them as they went they like their doors dont they sir holse observed a single oct in a glistening membrane was waiting between two of the sets of doors greetings it said it extended one limb holding a small device which beeped it extended another limb documents if pleased authority of vawyei towermaster tagratark ferbin drew himself up we would see the nariscene grand zamerin oct documents remain oct to surrendering on arrival surface is this the surface ferbin asked looking around it doesnt look like it is surface the oct exclaimed show us ferbin said on our way to the grand zamerin he tapped the pocket holding the envelopes then you shall have your documents the oct seemed to think about this to follow it said turning abruptly and heading for the doors beyond which were now opening they revealed a broad chamber on the far side of which large elliptical windows gave out on to a view of extensive gardens broad lakes and distant rocky and fabulously steep mountains creatures machines and things which might have been either moved about the vast concourse in a confusing mêlée of colour and sound see is surface the oct said it turned to them documents pleased the grand zamerin if you please ferbin said others await they cause confluence of yougrand zamerin possibility or authorised in place of additional explanatory grand zamerin not present gone off distantly documents what do you mean gone off ferbin asked what do you mean others await holse said looking around hand going to his knife dont try this at home djan seriy anaplian had been doing her homework reacquainting herself with sursamen and shellworlds and studying the various species involved she had discovered a morthanveld image she liked when in shallows we look up and see the sun it seems to centre upon us its soft rays spreading out around us like embracing arms tentacles the translation noted straight and true with celestial strength all shifting and pulsing together with the movement of each surface wave and making of the observer an unarguable focus persuading the more easily influenced that they alone are subject to and merit such solitary attention and yet all other individuals near and far so long as they too can see the sun will experience precisely the same effect and therefore likewise might be as justly convinced that the sun shines most particularly and splendidly upon them alone she sat aboard the medium systems vehicle dont try this at home playing a game of bataos with one of the ships officers the delinquentclass fast picket and exgeneral offensive unit eight rounds rapid had rendezvoused with the steppeclass msv the day before and dropped her off before heading on its inscrutable way so far nothing had been said about the stowaway knife missile with the dronequality brain in it which had made itself part of her luggage she could think of several explanations for this but was choosing to believe the simplest and most benign which was that nobody had spotted it it was possible however that this game of bataos might be the excuse for it being mentioned humli ghasartravhara a member of the ships governing board and on the rota of passenger liaison officers had befriended her over breakfast and suggested the game they had agreed to play unhelped trusting the other not to seek advice elsewhere through implants or any other addenda and not to gland any drugs that might help either they sat on tree stumps in a leafy glade of tropel trees by a small stream on the vessels topside park a blackbacked borm lay on the far side of the small clearing like a discarded cloak with legs patiently stalking each errant patch of sunlight as the vessels sun line arced slowly overhead the borm was snoring overhead children in float harnesses or suspended under balloons squealed and shrieked anaplian felt something on her head patted her short dark hair with one hand then held her palm out flat and looked up trying to see the floating children from beneath the intervening canopy theyre not peeing on us are they she asked humli ghasartravhara looked up too briefly water pistols he said then returned his attention to the game which he was losing he was an elderlylooking fellow pretty much humanbasic with long white hair held in a neat ponytail his face and upper torso revealed by some very highwaisted pantaloons of a particularly eyewatering shade of green were covered in exquisitely detailed and intensely swirly abstract tattoos the yellowwhite lines glowed bright on his dark brown skin like veins of sunlight reflected from water interesting image ghasartravhara said anaplian had told him about the morthanveld idea of sunlight seen from under water the aquatic environment he nodded quite different but the same concerns surfacing he smiled that we are and are not the focus of all reality all solipsists arguably anaplian agreed you are interested in the morthanveld ghasartravhara made a clicking noise with his mouth as the bataos board indicated it would move a piece for him if he didnt move one himself soon he folded a piece moved it set it down it unfolded itself as it settled and clicked down a few leaves of nearby pieces subtly altering the balance of the game but then anaplian thought every move did that i am going amongst them djan seriy said studying the board i thought id do a little research my privileged the morthanveld are reluctant hosts i have connections you go to the morthanveld themselves no to a shellworld within their influence sursamen my homeworld sursamen a shellworld really really anaplian moved a piece the pieces leaves clicked down producing a small cascade of further leaffalls hmm the man said he studied the board for a while and sighed fascinating places shellworlds arent they might i ask what takes you back there a death in the family sorry to hear that anaplian smiled thinly one of djan seriys earliest memories from when she had been a little girl was of a funeral she had been just a couple of longyears old maybe less when theyd buried her fathers brother the duke wudyen she was with the other children of the court being looked after by nurses back at the palace while the adults were off doing the burying and mourning and so on she was playing with renneque silbe her best friend making houses out of screens and pillows and cushions on the rug in front of the nursery fire which roared and crackled away behind its fire guard of hanging chains they were looking through the pillows and cushions to find one the right size for their houses door this was the third house theyd built some of the boys kept coming over from where they were playing near the windows and kicking their houses down the nurses were meant to be looking after them all but they were in their own room nearby drinking juice you killed your mother renneque said suddenly what djan seriy said i heard you did bet you did mamma said so you killed her why was that did you did you really did it hurt i didnt she says you did well i didnt i know you did my mamma told me didnt didnt kill her wouldnt have my mamma says you did stop it i didnt my mamma does not lie didnt kill her she just died my mamma said it was you who killed her she just died people dont just die somebody has to kill them wasnt me she just died like duke wudyen was killed by who gave him the black cough thats reason just died no you killed her didnt did so come on now djan did you did you really leave me alone she just died are you crying no is that what youre doing now are you crying not crying you are youre crying not toho kebli look djans crying humli ghasartravhara cleared his throat as he moved his next piece he wasnt really playing any longer just shifting pieces about they might have sent somebody better anaplian thought then chided herself for making assumptions will you be staying long the man asked on sursamen or with the morthanveld i dont know she made a move quick easy knowing she had won the ship you arrived on the man said he left a space she was meant to fill but anaplian just raised her eyebrows it wasnt very forthcoming thats all humli said when she refused to speak just kind of dropped you no passenger manifest or whatever they call it anaplian nodded they call it a passenger manifest she confirmed the ships a bit concerned thats all ghasartravhara said with a bashful smile he meant his ship this ship the dont try this at home is it the poor thing obviously we it would never normally be this ah intrusive paranoid lets say concerned lets however with the whole morthanveld situation you know i do he gave a nervous laugh its like waiting for a birth almost isnt it is it humli sat back slumped a little and cleared his throat again youre not really making this very easy for me ms anaplian was i supposed to why he looked at her for a while then shook his head also he said on a deep breath in i was ah asked by the ship mind to ask you about an item in your luggage were you now unusual basically a knife missile i see you are aware it is there i am aware there is something there ghasartravhara smiled at her youre not being spied on or anything its just these things show up on the scans ships do of anything and everything coming aboard are msvs always so concerned with every intimate part of a travellers luggage not normally as i say the morthanveld situation well yes let me tell you the truth mr ghasartravhara the man sat back okay he said as though preparing himself for something unpleasant i work for special circumstances she saw his eyes widen but im off duty maybe even off message and possibly off for good theyve pulled my claws humli she told him and flexed an eyebrow she held up one hand exposing her fingernails see those humli nodded ten days ago i had nails with embedded crews any one of which could have drilled a hole in your head big enough to stick a fist through mr ghasartravhara looked suitably impressed even nervous she inspected her new nails now well theyre just fingernails she shrugged theres a lot of other stuff im missing too all the really useful harmful higadgetry stuff its been taken from me she shrugged i surrendered it all because of what were calling the morthanveld situation and now im making a private visit to my home after the recent death of both my father and my brother the man looked relieved and embarrassed he nodded slowly i really am sorry to hear that thank you he cleared his throat again and said apologetically and the knife missile it stowed away it was supposed to stay behind but the drone which controls it wants to protect me she was choosing her words very carefully aw ghasartravhara said looking and sounding mawkish it is old and getting sentimental she told him sternly yeah but still still nothing it will get us both into trouble if its not careful all the same id appreciate it if the fact of that devices presence here didnt get back to sc cant imagine that will be a problem humli said smiling yes she thought grinning complicitly everybody likes feeling theyve got something over sc dont they she nodded at the board your move i think im beaten he admitted ruefully he looked at her dubiously i didnt know you were in sc when i agreed to play you she looked at him nevertheless i was playing by the same rules all the time unhelped humli smiled still uncertain then stuck his hand out anyway your game i think they pressed palms thank you he stretched looked around must be lunchtime will you join me happily they started packing away the bataos set piece by piece well she had done her best by her idiot drone she reckoned if word of its adventure did get back to sc it wouldnt be her fault anyway it sounded like she and it might both get away with the fact that it was the mind of an experienced sc drone inside the knife missile not a normal and therefore relatively dim knife missile brain it sounded like it you still never knew the msv dont try this at home was relatively small and absolutely crowded packed with people and ships in a chance convergence of itineraries building schedules and travel arrangements anaplian had been given quarters not within the crafts own accommodation but inside a ship it contained and was still building the subtle shift in emphasis a plainsclass general contact vehicle this was a relatively new class of culture ship and one that apparently couldnt make up its mind whether it was a big contact unit or a small system vehicle whatever else it was it was unfinished and anaplian occasionally had to wait for bits and pieces of the structure to be moved around inside the dont try this at homes single intermediate bay where the smaller ship was being constructed before she could move to or from her cabin even this was not really a cabin and not really part of the new ship either shed been allocated the whole of one of the gcvs modules a small shortrange transit craft which was nestled inside the vessels lower hangar with a halfdozen others the module had morphed its seating into more varied furniture and walls and she was gratified at the scale of her accommodation the module was designed to carry over a hundred people however there was nobody else quartered aboard either the rest of the underconstruction ship or any of its other modules and it felt odd to be so isolated so apart from other people on a ship so obviously crowded she didnt doubt shed been quarantined like this to make some sort of point but she didnt care to have such space in a small packed ship was something of an indulgence others might have felt they were being treated like a pariah being so prophylactically isolated from everybody else she felt privileged there were she reflected times when having been raised as a princess came in useful on her third night aboard the dont try this at home she dreamt about the time she been taken to see the great waterfall of hyengzhar a level down in the ninth when she was still little semiconscious control over ones dreams was not even an amendment more of a skill a technique one learned in childhood for those born within the culture in early adulthood for anaplian and in all but her most banal memorydetritusclearing dreams djan seriy was used to watching what was going on with a vaguely interested analytical eye and sometimes stepping in and affecting proceedings especially if the dream threatened to turn into a nightmare she had long since ceased to be surprised that one could experience surprise in ones sleep at something one was watching oneself dreaming compared to some stuff that could happen after sc gave you total control over a thoroughly amended and vastly enhanced body and central nervous network that was small doings their party disembarked from the small train she was holding the hand of her nurse and tutor mrs machasa the train itself was a novelty a long articulated thing like many land steamers all connected together and pulled by just one great engine and running not on a road but on railings shed never even heard of such a thing she found trains and tracks and stations all very wonderful and advanced she would tell her father to get some trains when they all returned to pourl and when he next returned from making the bad people stop being bad the station was crowded mrs machasa held her hand tightly they were a large party and had their own escort of royal guard her very important brother elime who would be king one day was with them which made them all special but all the same as mrs m had told her that morning as they were getting her dressed they were far away from home on another level amongst foreigners and everybody knew that foreigners was just another word for barbarians they had to be careful and that meant keeping hold of hands doing as you were told and no wandering off they were going to see the greatest waterfall in all the world and she didnt want to be swept away by all the horrible water did she she agreed she didnt want to be swept away by all the horrible water the weather was cold the hyengzhar lay in a place where the weather varied a lot and it was not unknown for the river and the great cataract to freeze mrs m fastened her into her coat and leggings and hat pulling and jerking her whole body as she tightened this and buttoned that mrs m was big and wide and had grey brows that bowed towards each other there was always something that didnt meet with her approval often something about djan seriy but she never hit her sometimes cried over her and always hugged her which was the best bit djan seriy had tried to hug her father once when he was all dressed up for business and had been laughed at by some of the men in his court her father had pushed her away anaplian felt she was floating in and out of her own younger consciousness sometimes being her earlier self sometimes watching from outside she could see most of the scene quite clearly though as usual when she was floating detached like this the one thing that was vague and unformed was her own younger self it was as if even in dreams you couldnt truly be in two places at once bobbing in the air to one side of her dream self she could not see herself as a child just a sort of vague fuzzy image of approximately the right size and shape she was already criticising her own dream had mrs machasa really been that big had their party really been that many back inside her head she watched the train huff and puff and cough out great white clouds and a smell of dampness then they were in steam carriages being taken along a road through a great flat plain there were clouds against a blue sky some trees scrubby grass that zeel her mersicor gelding would have turned his pretty nose up at all very flat and rather boring in her memory there was no warning the falls were just there snapshot of a bychildstandards interminable carriage journey probably about ten minutes then bang the hyengzhar in all their vast chaotic glory there must have been sight of the enormous river its far bank lost in its own created mists so that it appeared as though an entire sea was spilling to oblivion whole rolling billowing fleets of clouds piled above the massive curve of the colossal cataract rising without cease into the invaded sky shaled continents of banked and broiling mists disappearing to the horizon entire sheets and walls and cliffs of spray the everywhere thunder of that ocean of water tipping over the exposed rock and pounding into the dizzying complex of linked plunge pools beneath where enormous canted blocks bulging monstrous curves hollowed husks and jagged angles of jumbled debris jutted and reared she must have seen some of the monks of the hyengzharia mission the religious order which controlled the falls excavation and there must have been if nothing else all the squalor and slummery of the shanty town of evermoving buildings that was the sprawling peripatetic township called the hyengzhar settlement and all the equipment spoil and general material associated with the desperate evertimepressed excavations but she recalled none of it not before the shock of the falls themselves suddenly there like the whole world twisting and falling sideways like the sky upended like everything in the universe falling forever in on itself thrashing and pulverising all to destruction in a mad welter of elemental pandemonium here the air shook the ground shook the body shook the brain shook inside the head assaulted rattled like a marble in a jar she had gripped mrs ms hand very tightly she had wanted to shriek she had felt that her eyes were bulging out of her head that she was about to wet herself the water squeezed out of her by the sheer force and battery of the trembling air wrapped pressing all around her but mostly she wanted to scream she didnt because she knew if she did mrs m would take her away tutting and shaking her head and saying that she had always known it was a bad idea but she wanted to not because she was frightened though she was quite terrified but because she wanted to join in she wanted to mark this moment with something of her own it didnt matter that this was the single most stunning thing she had ever seen in her life and despite everything despite all the wonders even the culture had had to show her in her later years it had in all the important ways remained so that there was no matching it no measuring it no competing with it no point in even trying to be noticed by it all that mattered was that she was here it was here it was making the greatest noise in the history of everything and she needed to add her own acknowledgement to its mighty overwhelming voice her own tininess in comparison to it was irrelevant its unheeding vastness drew the breath out of her sucked the sound of screaming from her little lungs and delicate stem of throat she filled her chest to the point she could feel her bones and skin straining against her tightly buttoned coat opened her mouth as wide as it could possibly go and then shook and trembled as though shrieking for all she was worth but making no noise certainly no noise above that stunning clamour overwhelming the air so that the scream was caught and stayed clenched inside her suffusing out into her miniature being forever buried under layer after layer of memory and knowing they stood there for some time there must have been railings she looked through or perhaps climbed up on to maybe mrs m had held her up she remembered that they all got wet the rolls of mists curled up and over them and drifted this way and that on the cool energising breeze and came down soaking them it had been some time before she even noticed that the great blocks and bulges that dominated the watery landscape beneath the falls themselves were gigantic buildings when she looked properly once she knew what to look for she started to see them everywhere tilted and broken around the lakesized plunge pools tumbled amongst the mists downstream poking like bone bits out of the dark walls of falling water before they filled and blossomed with dirty grey spray that settled into white as it rose and rose and rose becoming cloud becoming sky at the time she had worried that the people of the city must be getting drowned a little later when they had been telling her it really was time to go and trying to prise her fingers off the railings she had seen the people they were nearly invisible hidden inside the mists most of the time only revealed when the walls and canopies of spray parted briefly they were at the absolute limit of the eyes ability to make out dwarfed insected by the inhuman scale imposed by the arced sweep of the encompassing falls so tiny and reduced that they were just dots unlimbed only possibly or probably people because they could not be anything else because they moved just so because they crossed flimsy microscopic suspension bridges and crawled along tiny threads that must be paths and grouped in miniature docks where minuscule boats and diminutive ships lay bobbing on the battering surface of hectic dashing waves and of course they were not the people who had built and originally inhabited the buildings of the great city being revealed by the steady encroachment of the everretreating falls they were just some of the tens of thousands maybe hundreds of thousands of looters scavengers diggers climbers breakers tunnellers bridgebuilders railway workers pathfinders mapmakers crane men hoist operators fisherfolk boat people provisioners guides authorised excavationers explorers historians archaeologists engineers and scientists who had reinhabited this everchanging unceasing ruin of torn sediment tumbling rock plunging water and scoured monumentality they peeled her fingers away one by one mrs m scolded her she didnt hear never looked round couldnt care she kept her wideopen eyes focused on that vast arena of water rock architecture and spray kept her gaze fastened on the tiny dots that were people turning all her attention and diminutive being to just that not even bothering to expend the energy on struggling or protesting until an exasperated guard finally pulled her away and put her over his shoulder marching off with her mrs m just behind wagging her finger at her she still didnt care and could not hear she looked over and past mrs machasa at the falls just grateful the guard had put her over his shoulder this way facing backwards so she could keep looking at the great cataract of hyengzhar for as long as possible until it disappeared behind the lip of the land and only the towers and spires and walls of mist and spray and cloud were left filling half the shining waste of sky the hyengzhar cataract emptied one sea into another down a river two thousand kilometres long and in places so broad one bank was invisible from the other the sulpitine river flowed smoothly and gradually across a broad plain in a series of vast loops until it came to the gorge it had created where it plunged two hundred metres into an enormous bite gouged from the surrounding land indeed into a series of bites within bites as a whole fractal series of waterfalls ate into the multiply gouged ground hundreds of ushaped falls fed in groups into a succession of huge holes shaped like shattered cups themselves set within the still greater complexity of the arc of the continually lengthening gorge the cataract had once formed part of the shore of the lower sulpine sea the remaining cliffs still wrapped around a quarter of the seas facing shore but had quickly retreated as its titanic force washed away its own foundations leaving a gorge two hundred metres deep and when djan seriy had first seen it four hundred kilometres long the gorge wore rapidly because of the nature of the stratification of the land the cap rock supporting the river at the very lip of the falls was sandstone and so itself easily worn away the layer underneath it was barely rock at all more severely compacted mud from a series of huge floods hundreds of millions of years earlier in a more intense gravity field the muds would have turned to rock as well on sursamen some stayed so soft a human hand could crumble them the whole cataract was the hyengzhar it had been called that from the time the river had first started to plummet straight into the lower sulpine sea six thousand years earlier and was still called that even though the complex of waterfalls had now retreated four hundred kilometres from its original position what the city had been called nobody knew its people had been wiped out in a cataclysm hundreds of millions of years ago and the whole level left abandoned for tens of millions of years subsequently before eventually and with some trepidation being colonised all over again by its present inhabitants they hadnt even known the city was there and certainly had no idea what its name was the oct the nariscene the morthanveld and even the allegedly nearomniscient elder cultures of the galaxy didnt appear to know either it had all been long ago and under earlier owners the responsibility of the previous management an unfortunate problem associated with the last late lamented tenants the one thing everybody did know was that the citys name wasnt hyengzhar the result was that the city came to be called the nameless city which meant of course that its very name was a contradiction the falls had been a wonder of sursamen for millennia just due to their sheer scale famed even on levels of the great world the vast majority of whose inhabitants would never see them directly even so the most prominent or important or just plain rich denizens of the kiters of the twelfth and the naiant tendrils of the eleventh and the vesiculars of the tenth and the tubers and hydrals of the fourth sometimes made the effort to come and see the hyengzhar so were transported by the oct or the aultridia up or down one or more towers and then across to the site those from profoundly different environments encased in whatever suit or vessel they required to survive to gaze usually through glass or screen or other intervening material at the thunderous majesty of the celebrated cataract when the falls began to expose the outskirt buildings of the buried city almost a hundred years before djan seriy first saw them their renown increased and spread even further and took on too an air of mystery the gradually uncovered metropolis was no mere primitives settlement albeit as more and more of it was excavated by the falls and its true scale started to become clear one of extraordinary size it was undeniably ancient but it had been highly advanced even ruined it held treasures most of the plunder was conventional in form precious metals and stones that would struggle to occur naturally on a shellworld with its lack of plate tectonics and crustal recycling some though was in the form of exotic materials that could be used for example to fashion blades and machine parts of conventionally unsurpassable sharpness or hardness and fabulous if incomprehensible works of what was assumed must be art the materials the buildings were made from themselves possessed properties almost unthinkable to the people who did the discovering on the ninth spars and beams and thin claddings could be used to build bridges of enormous strength and amazing lightness the main problem those who would use this extravagance of booty faced was that the raw materials rarely came away in handy lengths and chunks and were usually impossible to cut or trim intact or ruined the interiors of the buildings also often provided strange artifacts and occasionally useful supplies though never any bodies fossils or tombs the city grew as it was eaten away the extent of the building debris eventually spreading to beyond the width of the falls on both sides the cataract was over seven kilometres across at present and the city must be broader than that its buildings were of a hundred different types and styles to the extent that it had been suggested the city had been host to several possibly many diverse types of being doors and interior spaces were different shapes entire structures were built on disparate scales and some had basement or foundation levels of bizarre designs that went deep below the floor of the gorge base all the way down to the prime of the shellworld itself another eighty metres below so that these few buildings remained standing even after the falls had exposed them and retreated far beyond leaving them as enormous slabsided islands towering above the braid of streams that formed the reconstituted river making its way down the great gorge to the lower sea a series of wars amongst the humans who inhabited the ninth centred around the control of the falls and their supply of treasure resulted in an octbrokered peace that had held for a few decades the sarl and a few other peoples from the eighth allowed to travel to the relevant region of the ninth by the oct had taken a peripheral part in some of the wars and a greater part in the peace generally acting as honest brokers and providing relatively neutral administrational and policing contingents by then the fame of the falls had grown sufficiently that even the nariscene had taken an interest and declared the whole area a site of extraordinary curiosity effectively putting their stamp of authority on the peace deal and prodding the oct to help guarantee it at least within the limits of the general shellworld mandate decreeing that the inhabitants of each level should basically be left to get on with their odd and frequently violent little lives the deldeyn had other ideas theyd been fortunate or skilful in the conduct of distant wars not immediately associated with the issue of the hyengzhar and identifying an opportunity too good to miss plus having at the time nothing else to do with the great armies theyd built up in the course of their farflung victories had annexed the neutral zone around the falls thrown out the administrators and police forces from the other peoples and just for good measure attacked anybody who protested too loudly this latter group included the sarl it was in what the deldeyn regarded as a small punitive raid to make clear to their inferiors that they were in charge now and were not to be trifled with on the last sarlian outpost on the ninth at the foot of the peremethine tower that king hausks eldest son elime had been killed so had started the war between the deldeyn and the sarl the war between the levels anaplian woke gently from her dream of the falls surfacing to full consciousness with uncharacteristic slowness how strange to dream of the hyengzhar again after all this time she could not immediately recall the last time shed dreamt of them and chose not to use her neural lace to investigate and tell her the exact date as well as no doubt what shed eaten the evening before the disposition of the furnishings of the room shed had the dream in and any company present at the time she looked across the billowbed a young man called geltry skiltz lay cutely curled and sweetly asleep naked amongst the gently circulating wisps of soft fabric and what looked like large dry snowflakes she watched a few of the flakes swirl near his still most attractive if slightly slackjawed face each one neatly avoiding his nose and mouth and thought back to the dream and through the dream to the reality of that first visit to the cataract she had been back again after years of pleading on just one other occasion less than a year before elimes death and the start of the war that now might be approaching its end shed still been a girl really she supposed though shed thought of herself as a mature young woman at the time and been convinced that her life was already mostly behind her the hyengzhar had been no less impressive just the same though utterly different in the years between her two visits what she would now think of as about ten standard years the cataract had retreated nearly seven hundred metres upstream revealing whole new districts of fascinating and grotesquely different buildings and structures and changing its shape profoundly from the ceiling of the level it would no doubt look roughly similar that distinctive brokencup look that vast bite out of the land but close to there was nothing left to recognise from the last time all that had been there originally had been swept away flushed as silt mud sand rocks and rubble to the ever more distant sea or left crooked and askew in the great broad rush of water clogged and skirted with sandbanks and debris tailings forlorn looking back there had been signs of deldeyn intentions even then she realised just so many men in uniform and a general air of grievance that other people were allowed to tell the deldeyn what they could and couldnt do on what was now they seemed to believe their level entirely and all because of some idiot treaty signed in a time of weakness shed been just mature enough to register some of this though sadly not sufficiently so to be able to analyse it contextualise it act upon it she wondered briefly if she had been capable of realising the dangers would it have made any difference could she have warned her father alerted him to the threat there had been warnings of course sarlian spies and diplomats at the falls themselves in the regional capital of sullir and the deldeyn court itself and beyond had reported the mood and detailed some of the preparations for war but their intelligence had gone unheeded such reports always arrived in great quantity and many invariably contradicted each other some would always be simply mistaken some would always be from agents and officials trying to exaggerate their own importance or swell their retainer and some would always be deliberate misinformation sown by the other side you had to pick and choose and therein lay the potential for mistake even her father wise warrior though hed already become by then had sometimes been guilty of hearing what he wanted to hear rather what was clearly being said and at the time a potential war with the deldeyn had been the last thing hed wanted to be told about he had his hands full with his campaigns on the eighth and the armies of sarl were in no way prepared to face what were at the time the superior forces of the ninth she shouldnt deceive or blame herself her warning if shed even had the wit to deliver one would have made no difference apart from anything else she was just a girl and so her father would have taken no notice anyway she lay awake in the cabin young mr skiltz soundly asleep at her side the disguised knife missile dronemind dormant also effectively asleep safely tucked up in her bag in a cupboard she could still use her neural lace within the reach of the cultures dataverse certainly within the ship and through it she asked for an image to be thrown across the far wall of her bedroom showing the real space star field ahead of the dont try this at home the vessel was making modest speed the stars looked almost stationary she looked ahead into the swirled mix of tiny lightpoints knowing that meseriphine the star sursamen orbited would be far in the distance and most likely still invisible she didnt ask for it or its direction to be displayed she just watched the slow slow drift of onward falling stars for a while thinking of home and fell gradually into a dreamless sleep game toho a crown to your smallest coin you drop it done bastard that you are honge the gentleman in question said through gritted teeth he took the weight of the stick and tankard on his chin and stood very still as one of the laughing serving girls filled it almost to the brim with beer his friends whooped and laughed and called out insults bright sunlight from pentrls first passing since the death of the king poured through tall windows into the smoky interior of the gilders lament oramen grinned as he watched they had been here most of the day the latest game used beer sticks the galleries on either side of the laments main room and two of the serving girls whoevers turn it was had to stand beneath the gallery on one side while a girl filled a tankard full of beer then the fellow had to walk from one side of the room to the other with the glass balanced on a stick resting on his chin so that a girl on the opposite gallery could relieve him of the glass and bring it down to the assembly for the purposes of drinking it was no easier than it sounded and most of the men had spilled beer on themselves by now many to the point they were so soaked they had stripped off to the waist they were using caulked leather tankards rather than ceramic or glass ones so that it didnt hurt too much when you got hit on the head by one the game became gradually more difficult as more beer soaked into both the floorboards and the players about twenty such bravards were in the group including oramen and tove lomma the air was thick with smoke and laughter the smell of spilled beer and ribald taunts tohonlo the most senior of those present and the most highly ranked save for oramen himself pulled slowly away from the gallery and slid his way gradually across the floor the tankard wobbling and describing a tight little circle above him a small amount of ale sloshed over the side splashing on his brow the other men roared and stamped their feet but he just blinked wiped the beer away from his eyes and carried on tankard resteadied the footstamping got louder and briefly more coordinated tohonlo neared the gallery on the other side where a wellbuilt serving lass in a lowcut blouse stretched out over the balustrade one hand extended looking to grab the handle of the wobbling tankard below the men were happy to let her know the extent to which she was admired come on toho tip it on to her tits the tankard wobbled its way to the girls outstretched fingers she grasped it and lifted giving a little eek as the extra weight nearly tipped her over the edge of the gallery then she pulled herself back a great cheer went up from the men tohonlo pulled his chin back and let the stick fall he grabbed it at one end like a sword and made to thrust it at the men whod been making the most noise while hed been distracted the fellows made motions and noises of pretended fear oramen tove said slapping him on the back and thumping down on the bench beside him depositing two leather tankards of beer in front of them with a slop and slosh of spillage you should take a turn he punched oramens arm i told you i didnt want another drink oramen said raising the tankard and waving it in front of toves sweatily gleaming face tove leaned closer what it was very noisy never mind oramen shrugged he put his old drink to one side of their table and sipped at his new one you should tove shouted at him as another of their company put the balancing stick on his chin and waited for the first serving girl to fill the tankard on top meanwhile the tankard of ale tohonlo had transported from one gallery to the other was duly delivered to him by the second serving girl who then skipped back upstairs neatly avoiding most of the slaps aimed at her behind you should take a turn tove told oramen go on take a turn go on id get wet what wet oramen shouted above the din the lads were clapping loudly and rhythmically well of course its wet s the idea should have worn an older tunic you dont have enough fun tove said leaning close enough for oramen to smell his breath i dont you dont come out as often as you ought prince really i hardly see you when was the last time we went out whoring for fucks sake not for a bit ill grant you cant be fed up with it can you with what girls dont be ridiculous youre not becoming a manfucker are you indeed not you dont want to fuck men do you heaven forfend so whats the matter i have other things to do tove id love to spend more time with you but i youre not becoming some fucking manfucker are you theyre worse than fucking republicans listen no because i fucking love you prince seriously but i fucking hate fucking manfuckers i really fucking do tove i believe you it would be hard not to i do not want to fuck men please believe even just remember well then come on out with us come and have some fun i shall i promise but do you promise will you listen i promise now stop being they hadnt even seen the fight break out next thing they knew tankards and glasses were flying and men were falling over each other and themselves blades were supposed to be left at the door but in the sudden mêlée oramen thought he saw the flash of sunlight on a steel edge he and tove both instinctively sat back and grabbed their tankards as a man an especially substantial and wellbuilt man thudded back towards them half stumbling half falling their bench was joined by spars to the table in front of them so everything still went flying including them however oramen had remembered that bench and table were one even as the fellow came clattering and staggering towards them and had pulled his legs up and started swivelling on his buttocks as the mans back and head collided with the empty bench and full table in front of them oramen was able to roll out of the way as the whole assemblage went careering backwards taking tove with it crashing into another bench and table set behind causing curses oramen even saved most of his ale which was an achievement every drink still on the table and the one in toves fist went splashing back mostly over the people sitting at the table behind to their unalloyed and most vocal consternation tove and the people at the table behind were addressing each other you fucker fuck yourself oramen stood up then immediately had to duck as a thrown glass sailed through the air where his head had been tove and the people of the bench behind were still conversing oramen took a sip of his beer checked for flying objects and took a step back it was a most impressive fight he liked the way you could see the smoke sort of roll and part when people went flying through it two burly knights charged forward and came between tove and the argumentative inhabitants of the table behind getting briefly tangled up with him tove extracted himself and stumbled over to oramen wiping beer off his tunic wed better go he said follow me what oramen protested as tove grabbed his arm i was just starting to enjoy myself time for that later nows time to run away tove pulled him by the sleeve round the side of the main fight across the floor the two serving girls were screaming from either gallery encouraging disparaging throwing tankards both full and empty at the chaos of brawling bodies below towards the back door which led to the yard and the toilets but this is fun oramen yelled at tove still trying to pull his arm free some of these fuckers might be anarchists lets away a glass shattered on the wall near oramens head oh he sighed all right seeing sense late than never they clattered down some steps towards the courtyard and got to the door tove stopped in the narrow passageway and said after you pr oh get out there oramen told him pushing him onehanded they burst through a door into the intense afternoon brightness of the taverns yard oramen caught the sudden stench of a nearby tannery a man swung round from one side of the door and sank a long dagger into toves belly ripping quickly upwards not not me tove had time to bubble then he dropped as the man whod struck him stepped around him and with a second man pulled his arm back blade aimed straight at oramen oramen had had his hand at the small of his back all the way down the stairs pulling his tunic top and shirt out feeling until the warmth of the guns handle was there in his fist he hauled it out used his other hand to click the safety off as hed practised a hundred times in his bedchamber and pulled the trigger in the face of the man whod knifed tove the mans forehead formed a small round mouth which gave up a little spitting kiss of red the hair at the back of his head bounced up and out releasing a pink spray like a consumptives cough he fell back as though he was collared some charging beast just got to the end of his lead jerking rearwards and falling on his shoulder blades and head eyes staring up at the shining sky the other man flinched at the incredibly loud bang the gun made and hesitated in his lunge perhaps even took a halfstep back it was enough oramen swung his arm round and shot him he was little further away in the chest he fell back as well and stayed sitting on the strawy shitty uneven stones of the courtyard of the gilders lament the gunshots had left oramens ears ringing tove lay moving slowly leaking huge amounts of dark red blood which made a sort of rectangular graphpaper pattern along the spaces of the yards cobbles the first man lay on his back perfectly motionless eyes fixed staring upwards the man oramen had just shot still sat upright legs splayed in front of him dagger dropped to one side both his hands up at the small wound in his chest his gaze directed somewhere on to the cobblestones between him and oramen he seemed to be hiccuping oramen wasnt sure what to do and was not thinking straight so he stepped forward and shot the sitting man in the head he fell over like hed thrown himself that way as though gravity somehow wasnt enough oramen hardly noticed that bang his ears were ringing so there was nobody else about he sat down too before he fell down the courtyard seemed very quiet after all the noise tove he said tove had stopped moving the graph pattern of blood moving along the spaces between the courtyard stones was reaching out towards oramens outstretched feet he moved them before it touched them and shivered there was a roaring noise which he took to be the continuing brawl in the room above tove he said again it was surprisingly cold in the brightly sunlit courtyard eventually people came the deldeyn had dug a series of canals and broad waterfilled ditches across their land seeking to impede the landbased forces of the sarl due to the direction the sarl attacked from itself determined by the tower they had descended within only one of these new obstacles lay in their way they had already beaten off a massed attack by riflemen and grenadiers mounted on caude and lyge shortly after leaving the night they had encountered near the illsipine the deldeyn had attacked in good order and eventually had to flee in tatters those who could they fought bravely and the grenadiers in particular caused some damage and deaths especially when a roasoaril tanker exploded but they still had no answer to massed ground guns which picked the slowmoving beasts and their riders out of the air like hunters firing into a tight flock of birds the sarls own flighted forces were mostly held back until the deldeyn fliers turned away in full retreat then took off after them harrying shooting and tackling in midair where the riders were brave or foolish enough the army dusted itself down and resumed its onward progress the way marked by the commingled wreckage of dead deldeyn fliers and their airbeasts tyl loesp counted at least a dozen of the enemys to every sarlian casualty they passed one mound of shattered bone seeping gristle and leathery wing fabric lying on the dusty ground where the deldeyn rider was still alive tyl loesp himself noticed movement as they passed and ordered his command car stopped and the badly injured flier disentangled from his dead mount a process which even done without deliberate roughness still caused him to scream hoarsely they brought him aboard and set him on a litter at the rear of the open car where a doctor attempted to tend to him and an interpreter tried to question him about deldeyn morale and their remaining forces the man was near his end anyway but found the strength to push the doctor away and spit in the interpreters face before he died tyl loesp told them to push his body off the rear of the car without further ceremony the great plain stretched away to every horizon the sulpitine river was some twenty kilometres to their left high clouds of faint pink stood against the tooblue sky as they came to the single wide canal which was the last defendable barrier between them and the region which held the deldeyn capital city of rasselle the deldeyn had stationed land forces on the near side of the canal but they had mostly fled on boats during the night their trenches were shallow and unshored just as the canal was not properly lined and its banks were continually collapsing leaving beaches of sand all along its length the water was draining away in any case only a diversionary feeder canal and hastily thrownup breakwater affair further up the sulpitine had kept the improvised water barrier supplied and that had been destroyed by sarlian sappers that morning leaving the waters to drain back to the main river or just soak away into the sands desultory artillery fire from the far side of the canal from somewhere a good distance beyond it mostly fell short and anyway seemed virtually unspotted the sarls had the air now no deldeyn fliers were rising to meet their scouts and patrols and spotters the sarlian artillery was mostly still being drawn up and the first few batteries were testfiring even now finding their range tyl loesp stood on the shallow berm of excavated sand binoculars in hand and listened to the explosions the guns of the batteries fired in short order almost rhythmically like a troop of welldrilled riflemen though the reports were naturally deepervoiced such closespaced regularity was a good sign the spotters flew their grids turning and swivelling in the air signalling with heliographs where the shots from their allotted batteries were falling on the far side distant puffs of sand and veils of slowly drifting dust showed where the rounds landed werreber came up in his land steamer jumped out said good day to some of tyl loesps staff keeping a respectful distance back from their chief and strode on up to him question is he said abruptly do we wait for the water to drain or risk an attack now how long till it is drained sufficiently tyl loesp asked perhaps till the start of the next shortnight when uzretean sets thats a very short one just three hours then tresker rises the engineers are loath to commit themselves to exact times patches of the bed may remain muddy other parts might be wadeable now can we identify such variations we are trying to the field marshal nodded at a particularly large caude labouring its way low over the retreating waters two men on its back thats one of the engineers taking a look from above now they seem generally of the opinion we should wait till dawn of tresker that would be prudent even if we can find a few dry paths sooner crossing by them concentrates our attack to too pinched and vulnerable a focus better to attack broadly but would we not be well to attack sooner rather than later tyl loesp asked if we have all our forces ready i think we ought perhaps they dont seem to have a lot of men on the far side though there are reports of many roads and tracks they might be there and well dug in are not the fortifications on this side crude and shallow they are that does not mean those on the far side are the same they might even have left those on this side in such a poor state to lure us onwards we could be too cautious here tyl loesp said the longer we wait the more time they have to assemble what forces they have our own reinforcements arrive too and we can see any of theirs on their way the scouts report none so far though there is too much mist drifting from the great falls to see further than thirty kilometres down the road river mists may obscure matters here later too especially in the early morning of tresker though we may be able to use that to our own advantage i feel we should attack now tyl loesp said if the enemy are there in any numbers werreber said nodding at the far bank attacking now might lose us the war this afternoon you take too much care werreber they are broken we have the momentum and even if they are there even if we are temporarily thrown back the war would not be lost we have reached a stage where even on their homelands we can afford greater loss than they why hurry why suffer such loss at all by morning well have pounded them all night and be set for a broad attack in overwhelming force thatll trample them beneath us the men and vehicles need resting anyway tyl loesp to charge onward would be intemperate and risk severe attenuation we can repel anything they choose to face us with but only if our forces remain cohesive nevertheless to keep that momentum even if we then halt and draw breath on the far side we shall attack as soon as we have crossing points identified werreber drew himself up to his full straightbacked height staring down his hook of a nose at the other man i dont understand you tyl loesp you introduce delay by insisting on taking this circuitous route then you drive us faster than a stooping lyge it is my way of maintaining a balance tyl loesp said the field marshal looked frosty i advise against this attack tyl loesp and i note that tyl loesp smiled thinly even so werreber gazed out across the expanse of shining sand and breezeruffled waters to the far bank he sighed as you wish sir he said he inclined a small bow turned and left oh and field marshal werreber turned frowning take no prisoners tyl loesp shrugged save perhaps a few for interrogation werreber glared at him for a few moments then gave the most cursory of nods and turned away again you had not killed before fanthile asked of course not had you ever drawn blood or been in a fight oramen shook his head barely touched a sword let alone a gun my father never wanted me to be a warrior that was elimes role ferbin was his reserve in that though unsuited perhaps through an overconcentration on elime my father felt ferbin went to seed from ripeness to spoiled almost before he was fully a man i was too young to figure as a combateer when father was ascribing us our parts and planning his assault on posterity my role was always to be the studious one the thinker the analyser the futurian oramen snorted fanthile poured a little more of the sweet iced wine into oramens crystal they sat in the palace secretarys private apartments oramen had not known who to talk to after the attack eventually his steps had led him to fanthile then you did especially well did you not the palace secretary said many a man who thinks himself brave finds he is not when faced with such expeditious assault sir did you not hear i practically fainted i had to sit before i fell and i had the advantage without my pistol id not be here couldnt even defend myself like a gentleman oramen fanthile said gently you are still a youth and besides you thought to arm yourself that was wise was it not so it proved oramen drank deeply and those who attacked you were not overly concerned with etiquette indeed not i imagine they only used a knife rather than a gun because one is silent and the other reports its use over half the city unless they turn out to be strict gentlemen of course oramen said with a sneer such scorn guns reckoning blades the honourable recourse though i believe a rifle in a hunt is lately becoming allowable in even the most regressive shires and they did kill your best friend oh they killed tove well stuck him he was most surprised oramen said bitterly a small frown creased his brow most surprised he repeated hesitating then do not blame yourself fanthile was saying then it was his turn to frown what oramen shook his head just the way tove said not me when he wiped his face with one hand and before when we were at the door he stared up at the ceiling for a few moments then shook his head decisively no what am i saying he was my best friend he could not he shivered great grief the man dies in my place and i look to blame him he drank again steady young man fanthile said smiling nodding at the glass oramen looked at the glass appeared to be about to argue then set it down on the table between them the blame is mine fanthile he said i sent tove first through that door and i was stupid enough to finish off the one id hit first in the chest through him we might have discovered who sent them you think they were sent by somebody else i doubt they were just loitering around the courtyard waiting to rob the first person to come through that door then who might have sent them i dont know i have thought and on thinking realised there is a dismayingly large cast of suspects who might they be oramen stared at the other man the same people you might think of fanthile met the princes gaze he nodded indeed but who oramen shook his head deldeyn spies republicans radical parliamentarians a family with a personal vendetta against my family from this generation or one before an outofpocket bookmaker mistaking me for ferbin who knows even anarchists though they seem to exist more in the minds of those who oppose them most fervently than in awkward reality who fanthile asked would gain most from your death oramen shrugged well pursued to the absolute limits of logicality tyl loesp i suppose he looked at the palace secretary who met his gaze with a studiedly blank expression he shook his head again oh i thought of him too but if i distrust him i distrust everybody you harne tove worldgod welcome him everybody oramen made a fist and punched at the nearest cushion why did i kill that wounded one i should have kept him alive he stared at the palace secretary id have wielded the pliers and the glowing iron myself on that cur fanthile looked away for a moment your father frowned on such techniques prince he used them most rarely well oramen said discomfited i imagine these occurrences are best avoided best delegated no fanthile said he would be present but it was the only thing i ever saw make him physically sick yes well oramen said feeling suddenly awkward i doubt i really could do it i would faint or run away no doubt he lifted his glass again then set it down once more you will need a new equerry prince fanthile said looking pleased to be changing the subject i am sure one will be chosen for you doubtless by exaltine chasque oramen said tyl loesp has left him in charge of me while hes gone oramen shook his head indeed fanthile said however might i suggest you present the exaltine with your own choice already made but who oramen looked at the palace secretary you have someone in mind i have sir earl droffo he is young but he is wise earnest and reliable devoted to your late father and your family and only lately come to pourl he is how shall i put this not overly contaminated by the cynicisms of the court oramen regarded fanthile a little longer droffo yes i remember him from the day father died also sir its time you had your own dedicated servant very well arrange that too if you would oramen shrugged i have to trust somebody palace secretary i shall choose to trust you he drained his glass now i trust you will refill my glass he said and giggled fanthile poured him a little more wine the battle of the canal crossing was neither the disaster werreber had feared nor the stroll tyl loesp had anticipated they lost more men and materiel than the field marshal thought necessary to get to the far side and even then they still needed to stop and regroup and resupply for so long that they might as well have waited for the dawn to attack on a broad front after a serious overnight artillery barrage and possibly with the cover of morning mists instead they had been funnelled into three long crossings over the shallow pools of standing water and damp sands and so concentrated had suffered from the attentions of deldeyn heavy machinegunners and disguised mortar pits well dug in on the far side still the battle had been won they had traded saved unfired artillery shells for the expended lives and limbs of ordinary soldiers werreber thought this a shameful ignominious bargain when there was no pressing need to hurry tyl loesp thought it a reasonable one werreber comforted himself in the knowledge that decreeing something did not necessarily make it so on the ground knowing the order was to take no prisoners many of the sarl units chose to disarm the deldeyn they captured and let them run away werreber had chosen not to hear of such insubordination the two men quarrelled again about splitting their forces the regent wanted to send a substantial body of men to take the hyengzhar settlement while the field marshal thought it wiser to have all the troops available to attack the capital where the last significant deldeyn forces were massing the regent prevailed there too reduced by the forces assigned to take the falls the remaining army spread out splitting into three sections for the final assault on the deldeyn capital the hundredth idiot as soon as ferbin saw the knights vollird and baerth he knew they were here to kill him he knew precisely who they were they had stood on either side of the interior of the door at the abandoned factory where his father had been killed they had stood there and they had watched their king being brutally murdered by tyl loesp the shorter broader more powerfullooking one was called baerth he was the one ferbin had recognised at the time the taller skinnier knight was vollird well known to be one of tyl loesps closest allies and who ferbin was sure beyond surety had been the taller knight whose face he had not seen standing on the other side of the door from baerth gentlemen said vollird nodding fractionally and smiling thinly baerth the shorter more powerfullooking one said nothing the two had appeared on the broad crowded concourse which stretched away from the tower exit ferbin and holse had just been led from while the oct who was still demanding their documents was attempting to explain why the nariscene grand zamerin wasnt there to be met with the two knights were escorted by a nariscene in a glittering exoskeleton of gold and precious stones they were dressed in leggings and long tunics covered in tabards with sheathed swords and pistol holsters hanging from thick belts ferbin did not reply he just stared at them fixing their faces in his mind for ever he could feel himself starting to shake as his pulse quickened and a cold clenching sensation came from his guts he was furious with his body for betraying him so and did all he could to relax breathe evenly and generally display every outward sign of steady normality and you sirs holse said hand still resting on the pommel of his long knife who would you be documents if please the oct at holse and ferbins side said unhelpfully the taller knight looked at ferbin as he said do us the courtesy of informing your servant that we dont answer to the pet when the owner stands before us my servant is a man of honour and decency ferbin said trying to keep his voice calm he may address you in any form or manner he sees fit and by god you ought to be grateful for even the most meagre courtesy he accords you for you deserve less than a dry spit of it and if i were you id hoard most jealously what little comes your way for trust me sirs leaner times lie ahead if you but knew the short knight looked furious his hand twitched towards his sword ferbins mouth was very dry he was horribly aware how mismatched their two sides were in armament the taller one appeared surprised and mildly wounded these are unkind words sir to two who desire only to help you i believe i know the fate to which youd like to help us it is a condition im determined to avoid for some time yet sir the taller knight said smiling tolerantly we have been sent by the current and rightful ruler of our shared homeland who wishes you only good to aid you in your passage i regret any misunderstanding that might have led you to think ill of us before we are even correctly introduced i am vollird of sournier knight of the court my companion here is baerth of charvin also so ennobled vollird swivelled fractionally and indicated the shorter man by his side with one hand as he spoke these words though his gaze stayed fixed upon ferbin we are here at your service good sir grant us civility i beg you if for no other reason than that we are in front of our otherworldly friends here and might risk demeaning the reputation of our whole people by seeming to squabble or fret vollird waved at the brilliant static forms of the oct and nariscene at their sides his gaze still fastened on ferbin if you are at my service ferbin replied you will remove yourselves from us at once and take this message to your master who is no more the rightful ruler of our shared homeland than my last turd indeed somewhat less so i go only to return and when i do i shall treat him with all the grace and respect he showed my father at his end there was the tiniest of jerking motions at one extremity of vollirds dark brow it was the merest hint of surprise but ferbin was glad to see it he knew he could say more but also knew with a sort of fascinated certainty that this constituted one charge of powder he ought to keep aside for now there might be a moment when some further revelation of his most detailed knowledge of what had happened in the halfruined factory that evening would be of a use beyond just discomfiting these men vollird was silent for a halfmoment then smiled and said sir sir we still misunderstand each other we would help you escort you on your way away from here that is our earnest wish and most specific instruction he smiled quite broadly and made an open gesture with both hands we all of us wish the same thing which is to see you on your way you have departed the land and level to which you have belonged with some urgency and dispatch and we would merely assist you on whatever further flight you may be determined on we ought not to dispute we do not wish the same ferbin started to say but then the shorter knight baerth who had been frowning mightily for the last few moments said under his breath as though to himself enough talk sheath this whore he drew his sword and lunged at ferbin ferbin started to take a step back holse began to move in front of him his left arm making as though to push ferbin behind him at the same time holses right arm arced across his body and out the short knife tore through the air and and was whipped out of the air by one limb of the nariscene at baerths side at the same time as one of its other legs tripped up the lunging knight and sent him sprawling to the floor at holses feet holse stamped sharply on the mans wrist and scooped his sword from his broken grip baerth grunted in pain vollird was drawing his pistol stop the nariscene said stop it repeated as holse made to stab the prone knight with one hand and take his pistol with the other the sword was knocked from his hand by the oct while the nariscene turned and snapped the pistol from vollirds grip producing a sudden gasp sword and pistol went clattering to the floor in opposite directions to stop hostilities the oct said inappropriate behaviour holse stood glaring at the eightlimbed alien shaking his own right hand and blowing on it as though trying to get blood back into it on a cold day he had moved the foot hed stamped on baerths wrist with so that it now lay on the mans neck with most of holses weight on it vollird stood shaking his right hand vigorously and cursing ferbin had observed it all keeping back and low and watching with an odd detachment who had done what and where all the weapons were at each moment he found he still possessed a very clear idea of where both pistols were one over there on the floor the other still in baerths side holster a device swung down from the ceiling it looked like a bulky rendition of a nariscene in an entire symphony of coloured metals fighting is not allowed in public spaces it said loudly in oddly accented but perfectly comprehensible sarl i shall take charge of all weapons in this vicinity resistance will incur physical penalties not excluding unconsciousness and death it was already gathering up the sword and pistol from the floor swinging through the air with a whooshing sound the nariscene handed it holses long knife thank you it said it removed baerths pistol from its holster the man was still flat out under holses boot and starting to make gurgling sounds took another smaller gun from the prone knights boot and also found a dagger and two small throwing knives in his tunic from vollird now holding his right hand delicately and grimacing it took a sword a long knife and a length of wire with wooden grips at each end all unauthorised weapons have now been removed from the vicinity the machine announced ferbin noticed that a small crowd of people aliens machines whatever one might call them had gathered at a polite distance to watch the machine holding all the weapons said nariscene barbarian relational mentor tchilk present is in notional charge here until further authority arrives all involved will hold approximate position under my custody meantimes failure to comply will incur physical penalties not excluding unconsciousness and death there was a pause documents the oct said to ferbin oh have your damned documents he said and fished them from his jacket he nearly threw them at the machine but didnt in case this was taken as a violent act by the device hovering over them so the glittering nariscene said floating slowly round about them a metre or so over their heads and between two and three metres away from them you claim to be a prince of this royal family of the sarl of the eighth indeed ferbin said crisply he and holse stood within a great softly greenlit cave of a room its walls were mostly of undressed stone ferbin found this quite shockingly crude for beings supposedly so technologically advanced the complex they had been taken to was set deep within a cliff which formed part of an enormous spire of rock sitting in a great round lake a short machineflight from the concourse where they had first arrived once vollird and baerth had been taken away apparently already adjudged to have been the guilty parties without anything as crude and timeconsuming as a formal trial as vollird had pointed out quite loudly ferbin had asked one of the nariscene judicial machines if he could talk to somebody in authority after a few screen conversations with persons distant all visibly nariscene they had been brought here the nariscene officer he had been introduced as acting craterine zamerin alveyal girgetioni was encased in a kind of skeletal armour like that worn by the nariscene who had been escorting vollird and baerth he seemed to like floating above and around people he was talking to forcing them to twist this way and that to keep him politely in sight about him in the great cavern at some distance other nariscene aliens did incomprehensible things from a variety of cradles harnesses and holes in the ground filled with what looked like quicksilver this royal family the acting craterine zamerin continued is the ruling entity of your people and the executive positions are inheritable am i right ferbin thought about this he looked at holse who shrugged unhelpfully yes ferbin said less certainly and you claim to have witnessed a crime on your home level a most grievous and disgraceful crime sir ferbin said but you are unwilling to have the matter dealt with on your own level despite the fact you claim to be the rightful ruler that is absolute chief executive of this realm i am unable to do so sir were i to try i would be killed just as the two knights today tried to kill me so you seek justice where a sibling of mine is attached to the empire known as the culture i may gain help there you travel to some part ship or outpost of the culture as a first step we thought to find one human man called xide hyrlis whom we last heard was a friend of the nariscene he knew my late father he knows me he has i hope and trust still some kind sympathies for my family kingdom and people and may himself be able to aid me in my fight for justice even if he cannot help us directly he will at the least i feel sure vouch for me to the part of the culture called special circumstances within which my sibling is located allowing me to contact and appeal to them the nariscene stopped dead becoming quite perfectly stationary in the air special circumstances it said indeed ferbin said i see the nariscene resumed its orbit sailing silently through the oddly scented air while the two humans stood patiently swivelling their heads as the creature circled slowly round them also ferbin said it is imperative that i get a message to my brother oramen who is now the prince regent this would have to be done in the greatest secrecy however if it was possible and i would hope that the mighty nariscene would find this neither beneath nor beyond them that will not be possible i think the nariscene told him what why not ferbin demanded it is not our place the acting craterine zamerin said why not alveyal girgetioni stopped in the air again it is not within our remit i am not even sure i know what that means ferbin said is it not right to warn somebody they might be in mortal danger for that is mr ferbin prince if you please prince ferbin the nariscene said reinstating its slow circling there are rules to be observed in such interactions it is not the duty or the right of the nariscene to interfere in the affairs of our developing mentorees we are here to provide an overall framework within which a species like that to which you belong may mature and progress according to their own developmental timetable we are not here to dictate that timetable or hasten or delay any such advancement taking place along that timeline we merely maintain the superior integrity of the entity that is sursamen your own fates are allowed to remain your own they are in a sense within your own gift our gift is that already stated of overarching care for the greater environment that is to say the shellworld sursamen itself and the protection of your good selves from undue and unwarranted interference including and this is the focus of my point any undue and unwarranted interference we ourselves might be tempted to apply so youll not warn a young fellow he may be in mortal danger or tell a grieving mother her eldest son lives when she is in mourning for a dead husband and a son as well correct you do realise what that means ferbin said im not being mistranslated am i my brother could die and soon he will die in any event before he is of an age to inherit the full title of king that is guaranteed he is a marked man all death is unfortunate the acting craterine zamerin said that sir is no comfort ferbin said comforting was not my intention my duty is to state facts then the facts tell a sorry truth of cynicism and complacency in the face of outright evil that may seem so to you the fact remains i am not allowed to interfere is there no one who might help us if we are to accept that you will not is there anybody here on the surface or elsewhere who might i cannot say i do not know of anyone i see ferbin thought am i are we free to leave sursamen yes fully free and we may pursue our aims of contacting xide hyrlis and my sibling you may we have no money about us with which to pay our fare ferbin said however on my accession to what oh i see monetary exchange is not required in such circumstances you may travel without exchange i will pay our way ferbin said firmly only i cannot do so immediately you have my word on this however yes yes well perhaps a cultural donation if you insist i would also point out ferbin said gesturing at himself and holse that we have nothing else either save what we stand up in systems and institutions exist to aid the needy traveller the acting craterine zamerin said you will not go without i shall authorise such provisions as you may require thank you ferbin said again generous payment will be forthcoming when i have taken charge of what is rightfully mine you are welcome alveyal girgetioni told them now if you will excuse me the baengyon crater was of sursamens most common type supporting a water and landscape filled with a gas mixture designed to be acceptable to the majority of oxygen breathers including the nariscene most panhumans and a wide spectrum of aquatic species like most of the worlds craters it had an extensive network of wide deep canals large and small lakes and other bodies of water both open and enclosed providing ample living space and travel channels for seagoing creatures ferbin looked out from a high window set in a great cliff of a building poised over an inlet of a broad lake steeppitched hills and outbreaking cliffs and boulder fields were scattered everywhere amongst a landscape mostly covered in grass trees and tall oddly shaped buildings curious obelisks and pylons that might have been works of art were dotted about and various lengths and loops of curved transparent tubing lay draped between and across nearly every feature a giant sea creature trailed by a shoal of smaller shapes each twice the length of a man floated serenely along one of these conduits passing between gaudily coloured buildings and over some form of steamless ground vehicle to dip into the broad bowl of a harbour and disappear beneath the waves amongst the hulls of bizarrely shaped boats all about nariscene moved through the air in their glittering harnesses overhead an airship the shape of a sea monster and the size of a cloud moved slowly across a distant line betokening an immensely tall and steepsided ridge its barely curved top a serrated row of tiny regular jagged peaks all lay under a startlingly bright sky of shining turquoise he was looking towards the crater edgewall apparently an invisible shield held the air inside the vast bowl it was so bright because a vast lens between the sun and the crater concentrated the light like a magnifying glass much of what he looked at ferbin thought he didnt even start to understand much of it was so strange and alien he hardly knew how to frame the questions that might provide the answers which would help explain what he was looking at in the first place and he suspected that even if he did know how to ask the questions he wouldnt understand the answers holse came through from his room knocking on the wall as he entered the doors disappeared when they opened petals of material folding away into the walls decent quarters he said eh sir they will do ferbin agreed they had been escorted to this place by one of the judicial machines ferbin had been tired and finding what he took for a bed slept for a while when he woke a couple of hours later holse was inspecting a pile of supplies in the middle room of the five they had been assigned another machine had appeared with the loot while ferbin had been asleep holse reported that the door to the outside corridor was not locked they appeared to be free to go about their business if they so desired not that holse had been able to think offhand of any business to go about they had more clothes now plus luggage holse had discovered a device in the main room that brought entertainments into it as many different entertainments as there were pages in a book and seemingly there in the room with them almost all were utterly incomprehensible after hed muttered as much under his breath the room itself had talked to him and asked if he wanted the entertainments translated he had said no and been studious in not talking to himself since hed also discovered a sort of chilly wardrobe full of food ferbin found himself to be remarkably hungry and they ate well of the foods they recognised sirs a visitor would meet with you a pleasant voice from nowhere said in a wellbred sarl accent thats the voice of the room holse whispered to ferbin who is this visitor ferbin asked a morthanveld tertiary hulian spine strategic mission director general shoum of meast of zuevelous of tleish of gavantille prime pliyr morthanveld ferbin said latching on to almost the only word in all this that he actually understood she is some ten minutes away and would like to know if youd care to receive her the disembodied voice said who exactly is this person ferbin asked the director general is currently the highestranked allspecies officeholder on sursamen and most senior morthanveld official within the local galactic region she is charged with oversight of all morthanveld interests within approximately thirty per cent of the tertiary spine she is present on sursamen surface in a semiofficial capacity but wishes to visit you in an unofficial capacity is she any threat to us holse asked none whatsoever id imagine kindly tell the directing general we shall be happy to receive her ferbin said five minutes before the director general arrived a pair of strange globular beings appeared at the door of their suite the creatures were about a stride in diameter and shaped like a huge glistening drop of water with hundreds of spines inside they announced that they were the pilot team for director general shoum and asked in highly polite and almost unaccented sarl to be allowed in for a look round holse obliged them ferbin was staring thunderstruck at what appeared be an entertainment showing aliens having sex or possibly wrestling and hardly noticed the two real aliens the two morthanveld floated in wafted about for less than a minute and announced themselves satisfied that all was well a formality they explained in what sounded like cheerful tones holse was welleducated enough to know that the morthanveld were an aquatic species and he was still considering the etiquette of offering such beings a drink when the director general herself and her immediate entourage descended ferbin switched the alien pornography off and started paying attention he and the director general were introduced she and her halfdozen attendants spread out around the room making admiring comments about the furnishings and pleasant view and then the director general herself they had been informed she was a she though there was no way to tell that holse could see suggested they take a ride in her barque holse had to shrug when ferbin looked at him that would be our pleasure maam ferbin told her graciously half a minute later an enormous pancake of an air vehicle with a skin that glittered like innumerable fish scales floated down from above and presented its curved open rear to the windows which hinged down to allow them access to the barque the transparent walls and clear circles on the floor showed them rising quickly into the air soon they could see the whole of the great straggled settlement they had just left then the entirety of the circular sea on whose margins it lay then other seas and circular patches of green and brown before the view seemed to blink as they passed through some gauzy barrier they were looking down on an entire enormous circle of blue and green and brown and white with hints of what must be the dark nearlifeless surface of sursamen itself at the edges circular patches in the crafts ceiling showed tiny points of light holse supposed they must be the stars of empty space he took a funny turn and had to sit down quickly on one of a variety of couchshaped bumps on the floor all of which were very slightly damp prince ferbin the director general said indicating with one of her spines a long shallow seat near what ferbin took to be the prow of the craft some distance away from everybody else he sat there while she rested on a bowlshaped seat nearby a tray floated down to ferbins side it held a small plate of delicacies and an opened jug of fine wine with one glass thank you ferbin said pouring himself some wine youre welcome then if you please tell me what brings you here ferbin told her the short version even at this distance in time relating his fathers murder left him flushed and breathing hard boiling with fury inside he took a drink of wine went on with the rest of his tale the director general was silent until the end then said i see well then prince what are we to do with you firstly maam i must get a message to my younger brother oramen to warn him of the danger he is in indeed what else i should be grateful if you would assist me in finding our old ally xide hyrlis and perhaps my other sibling i should hope that i shall be able to assist with your onward travel the waterworlder replied this did not sound like an unequivocal yes to ferbin he cleared his throat i have made it clear to the nariscene representative i encountered earlier that i will pay for my passage though i am unable to do so at the moment oh payment is irrelevant dear prince dont worry yourself about that i was not worried maam i seek only to make it quite clear that i need accept no charity i will pay my way depend on it well shoum said there was a pause so your father is dead murdered by this tyl loesp man indeed maam and you are the rightful king by birthright i am how romantic i cannot tell you how gratified i am that you feel that way ferbin said he had obviously he realised now absorbed more courtierspeak than hed given himself credit for however my most pressing need is to warn my young brother that he is in danger of his life if it is not already too late ah the morthanveld said i have what may be news unknown to you on such matters you do ferbin sat forward your mother is well your brother oramen lives and appears to prosper and mature most quickly at court you are presumed dead though of course tyl loesp knows you are not your reputation has been traduced regent mertis tyl loesp and field marshal werreber command an army which has been lowered to the level of the deldeyn by the oct and even now is on the brink of a decisive battle with the depleted remains of the deldeyn forces which our modellers believe your people will be victorious in with less than three per cent doubt you have spies there maam no but information osmoses ferbin leant forward madam i must get a message to my younger brother but only if there is no chance of it being intercepted by tyl loesp or his people might you be able to help that is not impossible however it would arguably be illegal how so we are not supposed to take such a close and dynamic interest in your affairs even the nariscene are not supposed to and they are technically in charge here and the oct they are allowed limited influence of course given that they control so much of the access to sursamens interior and were largely responsible for making it safe though they have arguably overstepped their marked allowance by some margin already in cooperating with the sarl to deceive and so almost certainly defeat the deldeyn the aultridia have subsequently laid a charge before the nariscene mentoral court against the oct alleging just that the underlying reasons causing the oct to behave like this are still being investigated informed speculation on the matter is unusually diverse indicating that no one really has a clue at all however i must make clear my species is supposed to mentor those who mentor those who mentor your people i am layers and levels away from being jurisdictionally allowed to have any direct influence you find yourself the unintended victim of a system set up specifically to benefit people like the sarl prince a system which has evolved over the centieons to ensure that peoples less technologically advanced than others are able to progress as naturally as possible within a generally controlled galactic environment allowing societies at profoundly different civilisational stages to rub up against each other without this leading to the accidental destruction or demoralisation of the less developed participants it is a system that has worked well for a long time however that does not mean that it never produces anomalies or seeming injustices i am most sorry the stage is small but the audience is great as his father had always said ferbin thought as he listened to this but the audience was just the audience and so was forbidden from running up on to the stage and taking part and aside from a few jeers and calls and the occasional behind you they could do little to intervene without risking being flung out of the theatre altogether these are rules that you cannot bend he asked oh i can prince we are talking here in one of my own craft so that i can guarantee our privacy and we may speak freely that is already bending one rule regarding legitimate interaction between what one might term our official selves i can intervene but ought i to i do not mean present me with further reason i mean would it be right for me to do so these rules regulations terms and laws are not invoked arbitrarily they exist for good reason would i be right in breaking them you may guess my view on the matter maam i would have thought that the brutal and disgraceful murder of an honourable man a king to whom all in his realm save a few jealous treacherous murderous wretches paid grateful loving homage would seize at the heart of any creature no matter how many layers and levels distant from such humble beings as ourselves they might be we are all united i would hope in our love of justice and the desire to see evil punished and good rewarded it is as you say of course shoum said smoothly it is simply that from a further perspective one cannot but recognise that these very rules i allude to are set out so with precisely such an idea of justice at their core we seek to be just to the peoples in our charge and those that we mentor by usually declining the always obvious option of facile intervention one might intervene and interfere at every available opportunity and at every single instant when things did not turn out as any decent and reasonable creature would like however with every intervention every interference no matter how individually wellmeant and seemingly right and proper judged purely on its own immediate merits one would subtly incrementally but most certainly remove all freedom and dignity from the very people one sought only to help justice is justice maam foulness and treachery remain what they are you may pull so far away you lose sight of them but only draw back in and as soon as you see them at all you see their corruption by the very colour and shape of them when a common man is murdered it means the end for him and a catastrophe for his family beyond that and our sentimentality it affects only as far as his own importance reaches when a king is murdered and the whole direction of a countrys fate is diverted from its rightful course it is another thing entirely how such a crime is reacted to speaks loud for the worth of all who know of it and have the means to punish those responsible or by tolerating seem to authorise such a reaction beacons out its lesson for every subject forming a large part of their lifes moral template it affects the fate of nations of whole philosophies maam and may not be dismissed as a passing commotion in the kennels the director general made a dry spindly noise like a sigh perhaps it is different for humans dear prince she said sounding sad but we have found that the underdisciplined child will bump up against life eventually and learn their lessons that way albeit all the harder for their parents earlier lack of courage and concern the overdisciplined child lives all its life in a selfmade cage or bursts from it so wild and profligate with untutored energy they harm all about them and always themselves we prefer to underdiscipline reckoning it better in the long drift though it may seem harsher at the time to do nothing is always easy ferbin did not try to keep the bitterness out of his voice to do nothing when you are so tempted to do something and entirely have the means to do so is harder it grows easier only when you know you do nothing for the active betterment of others ferbin took a deep breath exhaling slowly he looked down through the nearest transparent circle in the floor it showed another crater sliding by beneath them like a lividly shining yellowbrown bruise of life on sursamens darkly barren surface it was gradually disappearing as they travelled over it leaving only that dark absence of sursamens unadorned face implied below them if you will not help me in getting a message to my brother warning him he is in mortal danger maam can you help me otherwise assuredly we can direct you to the exculture human and exspecial circumstances agent xide hyrlis and facilitate your conveyance towards him so it is true xide hyrlis is now exculture we believe he is with sc sometimes it is hard to be sure is he still in a position to help us possibly i do not know all i can solve with any certainty is your first problem which is finding him this would be a problem otherwise because the nariscene guard him jealously he works in effect for them now even when hyrlis was here on sursamen his purpose was moot his presence was requested by the nariscene and disapproved of by ourselves though we drew the line at requesting his removal a nariscene experiment perhaps possibly at the behest of the oct testing the rules regarding the transfer of technology to lessdeveloped peoples he gave you a great deal prince though he was careful to do so only in the form of ideas and advice never anything material your second problem will be persuading hyrlis to talk to you that you must do yourselves your third problem obviously is securing his services yours again im afraid well ferbin said my good fortune arrives in small change these days maam nevertheless i hope i count my gratitude in larger coin even if that is all you can offer me i am beholden we have recently come to expect that every hand will be turned against us to find mere indifference caused us joy any active help however circumscribed now seems like far more than we deserve i wish you well in your quest prince thank you ah an open tower end do you see ferbin looked down to see a small black spot on the dark brown expanse of the surface it only showed because the rest of the view was so dark situated anywhere near a shining crater the dark dot would have been invisible beneath the wash of light that dark spot yes do you know of those it is the end of a tower which leads all the way down to the machine core where your god resides it is ferbin had never heard of such a thing the spot looked too small for one thing the towers were known to taper but they were still one and a half kilometres across when they reached the surface on the other hand they were quite high up here in the director generals spacecraft they are rare she told him no more than six out of a million towers on any shellworld are fashioned so that i did not know ferbin said he watched the tiny dot of darkness slide beneath them of course there are defence mechanisms on the surface and all the way down no freak piece of random space debris or maliciously directed ordnance would make it far down there and various doors and lock systems exist at the level of the core itself however essentially when you stare straight down that shaft you are looking across twentyone thousand kilometres of vacuum to the lair of the xinthian itself the worldgod ferbin said even as one who had never been especially religious it felt strange to hear its existence confirmed by an alien of the optimae even if she did use its common dismissive name anyway i think now well return you to your quarters there is a ship leaving in half a day that will take you in the direction of xide hyrlis i shall arrange your passage ferbin lost sight of the tiny black dot he returned his attention to the morthanveld you are kind maam the view from the craft tipped all around them as it flipped over banking steeply holse closed his eyes and swayed even though he was seated beside ferbin the surface of the wine in his glass barely trembled your sibling the director general said as ferbin watched the whole world tilt about them my sibling ferbin said she is seriy anaplian that sounds like the name she too is of special circumstances dear prince apparently what of it maam that is a great deal of good connection for one family let alone one person i shant refuse any portion if good it is hmm it does occur to me that no matter how distant she may have heard about your father and the other recent events from your home level which of course includes the news of your supposed death may she as i say news osmoses and where news is concerned the culture is of a very low pressure i fail to understand you maam they tend to hear everything the nariscene ship the hundredth idiot and the orbiting transit facility parted company as gently as lovers hands holse thought he watched the process happen on a big circular screen inside one of the vessels humanpublic areas he was the only person there hed wanted to watch from a proper porthole but there werent any tubes and gantries and stretchy corridors all sort of just kissed goodbye to each other and retracted like hands inside sleeves on a cold day then the transit facility was shrinking and you could see the whole spindly knobbly shape of it and the start of the absurdly long cords that tethered it to the surface of sursamen it all happened in silence if you didnt count the accompanying screechings which were allegedly nariscene music he watched sursamen bulge darkly out across the great circle of screen as the transit facility shrank quickly to toosmalltosee how vast and dark it was how spotted and speckled with those shining circles of craters in the roughly quarter of the globe that holse could see right now he guessed there were perhaps a score of such environments glowing all sorts of different colours according to the type of atmosphere they held and how quickly it was all shrinking gathering itself in concentrating like something boiling down the ship drew further away the transit facility was quite gone now he could see all of sursamen every bit was there on the screen the whole globe encircled shown he found it hard to believe that the place where he had lived his entire life was appreciable now in one glimpse look he glanced from one pole to another and felt his eyes jerk only a millimetre or less in their sockets further away still now their rate of progress increasing now he could hold all mighty sursamen in a single static stare extinguish it with a blink he thought of his wife and children wondering if he would ever see them again it was odd that while he and ferbin had still been on the eighth and so exposed to the continual and sharp danger of being killed or travelling up from their home level and still arguably at some risk he had nevertheless been sure he would see his family again now that they were youd hope safe for the moment on this fancy shipofspace he watched his home shrink to quick nothing with a less than certain feeling that hed be safely back he hadnt even asked to get a message back to them if the aliens were disinclined to grant the request of a prince theyd surely ignore a more humble mans petition all the same maybe he ought to have asked there was even a possibility that his own request would be granted just because he was only a servant and so didnt signify news of his living might not matter enough to affect greater events the way knowledge of ferbins continuing existence might but then if his wife knew he was still alive and people in power heard of this they would undoubtably treat this as partway proof that ferbin did indeed live and that would be deemed important theyd want to know how shed come to know and that might prove uncomfortable for her so he owed it to her not to get in touch that was a relief hed be in the wrong whatever he did if they ever did get back hed certainly be blamed for turning up alive after being dependably dead senble bless her was a passably handsome woman and a good mother but she had never been the most sentimental of people certainly not where her husband was concerned holse always had the impression he somehow cluttered the place up when he was in their apartment in the palace servants barracks they only had two rooms which was not a lot when you had four children and he rarely found a place to sit and smoke a pipe or read a news sheet in tranquillity always being moved on he was for the purposes of cleaning or to let the children fight in peace when he went out to sit somewhere else and smoke his pipe and read his paper undisturbed he was usually welcomed back with a scolding for having wasted the familys meagre resources in the betting house or drinking shop whether hed actually been there or not though he had admittedly used the earlier unjust accusations as cause to excuse the subsequent commitment of precisely such contrabandly activities did that make him a bad man he didnt think so hed provided hed given senble six children holding her to him when shed wept mourning the two theyd lost and doing all he could to help her care for the four whod survived where hed grown up the proportions of live to dead would have been reversed hed never hit her which made him unusual within his circle of friends hed never hit a woman at all which by his count made him unique amongst his peers he told people he reckoned his father had used up the familys allowance of womanhitting mostly on holses poor longsuffering mother hed wished his father dead every single day for many years waiting until he grew big enough to hit him back and protect his mother but in the end it had been his mother whod gone suddenly one day just dropping dead in the field during the harvest at least hed thought at the time shed been released from her torment his father was never the same man again almost as though he missed her just possibly because he felt in some way responsible at the time holse had nearly felt himself big enough to stand up to his father but his mothers death had reduced his father so and so quickly that hed never needed to hed walked away from home one day and never gone back leaving his father sitting in his cold cottage staring into a dying fire hed gone to the city and become a palace servant somebody from his village whod made the same journey a longyear later had told him his father had hanged himself just a month earlier after another bad harvest holse had felt no sympathy or sorrow at the news at all only a kind of vindicated contempt and if he and ferbin were gone so long he was declared officially dead senble might remarry or just take up with another man it would be possible she might mourn him he hoped she would though frankly he wouldnt have put his own money on it but he couldnt imagine her tearing her hair out in an apoplexy of grief or swearing on his cold unge pipe shed never let another man touch her she might be forced to find another husband if she was thrown out of the servants quarters how would he feel then coming back to find his place taken so his children calling another man daddy the truth was that he would almost welcome the opportunity to start again he respected senble and loved his children but if they were being looked after by a decent sort of fellow then he wouldnt throw a fit of jealousy just accept and walk on might be the best idea wish all concerned well and make a fresh start still young enough to enjoy a new life but old enough to have banked the lessons hed learned from the first one did that make him a bad man perhaps though if so then arguably all men were bad a proposition his wife would probably agree with as would most of the women holse had known from his poor mother onwards that was not his fault either though most men most women too no doubt lived and died under the general weight of the drives and needs expectations and demands they experienced from within and without beaten this way and that by longings for sex love admiration comfort importance and wealth and whatever else was their particular fancy as well as being at the same time channelled into whatever furrows were deemed appropriate for them by those on high in life you hoped to do what you could but mostly you did what you were told and that was the end of it he was still staring at the screen though he hadnt really been seeing it for some time lost in this reverie of decidedly unromantic speculation he looked for sursamen looked for the place vast multilayered containing over a dozen different multitudes where he had lived all his life and left all hed ever known quite entirely behind but he couldnt find it gone shrunk away to nothing he had already asked the nariscene ship why it bore the name it did the source of my name the vessel had replied the hundredth idiot is a quotation one hundred idiots make idiotic plans and carry them out all but one justly fail the hundredth idiot whose plan succeeded through pure luck is immediately convinced hes a genius it is an old proverb holse had made sure ferbin was not within earshot and muttered i think ive known a few hundredths in my time the ship powered away in the midst of faraway stars an infinitesimal speck lost in the vast swallowing emptiness between these gargantuan cousins of the rollstars and fixstars of home seed drill quitrilis yurke saw the giant oct ship immediately ahead and knew he was about to die quitrilis was piloting his ship by hand the way you were very much not supposed to not in the presence of a relatively closepacked mass of other ships in this case a whole fleet of oct primarian craft primarians were the biggest class of regular ships the oct possessed a skeletal frame around a central core they were a couple of klicks long and usually employed more as a sort of longdistance travel aid for smaller ships than as fully fledged spacecraft in their own right there was at least a suggestion that the oct had ships of this size and nature because they felt they ought to rather than because they really needed them they were a vanity project something they seemed to think they were required to have to be taken seriously as a species as a civilisation the primarian fleet was twentytwo strong and stationed in close orbit directly above the citycluster of jhouheyre on the oct planet of zaranche in the inner caferlitician tendril they had arrived there in ones and twos over the course of the last twenty days or so joining a single primarian that had arrived over forty days before quitrilis yurke a dedicated culture traveller and adventurer away from home for a good five hundred and twentysix days now and veteran of easily a dozen major alien star systems was on zaranche to find out whatever he could about whatever there was to be found out there so far hed discovered that zaranche was a boring planet of real interest only to the oct and devoid of any humanoid life that last bit had been bad news it had seemed like really good news at first but it wasnt hed never been anywhere before where he was the only human only human on the planet that was travelling that was wandering that was exclusive hed like to see his fellow travellers beat that hed felt aloof for about a minute after that it was just boring and made him feel alone but hed told people and especially his class and village mates from back home not that they were actually at home they were mostly travelling too that he intended to stay on zaranche for a hundred days or so doing some proper studying and investigating that would lead to genuine peerreviewable publishable kind of stuff and it would feel like defeat to squilch out now of all his group he was the luckiest everybody agreed including quitrilis yurke hed looked for and found an old ship that was up for a bit of vaguely eccentric adventure late in life and so rather than just bumming around hitching cadging lifts off gsvs and smaller ships the way everybody else was going to hed basically got his own ship to play with estimable the now we try it my way had been an ancient interstellarclass general transport craft built so long ago it could remember directly like living memory when the culture had been by civilisational standards scrawny jejune positively callow the ships ai not a mind way too old and primitive and limited to be called a mind but most definitely still fully conscious and with a frighteningly sharp personality had long since been transferred into a little oneoff kind of runabout thing the sort of ship that people referred to as erraticclass even though there wasnt really any such class only there sort of was now because even minds used the term anyway in its remodelled form it had been designed to serve as a sort of glorified shuttle but faster than any ordinary shuttle shifting people and things around the kind of mature system with more than one orbital that had been semiretirement before it could get too weird or eccentric it had properly retired itself and drifted into a sort of slow sleep state inside a hollow mountain store for ships and other biggish stuff on quitrilis home orbital of foerlinteul hed done proper askingaroundoldships research to find a craft just like that following a private theory and it had worked hed lucked it had been so grade just so apropos the old ship had woken itself up after a ticklemessage from its old home msv and after only a little thought agreed to act as personal transport for this youth him naturally all his classmates had immediately tried doing the same thing but they were too late quitrilis had already found the only likely contender and won the prize and even if there had been other retired ships of a similar disposition anywhere nearby theyd likely have refused such followon requests just because it would look like setting a pattern rather than expressing ship individuality and rewarding human initiative etc etc so far the relationship had been a pretty good one the old ai seemed to find it amusing to indulge a young enthusiastic human and it positively enjoyed travelling for the sake of it with no real logic to the journeying going wherever quitrilis wanted to go for whatever reason he wanted to go there often he cheerfully confessed he had no idea himself obviously they were constrained by the ships speed to a relatively limited volume theyd hitched on a gsv to get here to the inner caferlitician tendril but that still left them with thousands of potential star systems to visit even if there was by general agreement nothing especially undiscovered in the fairly welltravelled beatentrack neighbourhood they had access to and sometimes the ship let him pilot it by hand the ai switching itself off or at least retreating inside itself and leaving quitrilis to take the controls he had always imagined that even though it claimed he was in complete control it was secretly still keeping an eye on him and making sure he wasnt doing anything too crazy anything that might end up killing them both but now right now as the primarian craft that should not have been there suddenly filled the starspecked darkness of the sky ahead spreading entirely across his field of vision he realised the old ship had been true to its word it had left him alone he really had been in full handson charge of it the whole time he really had been risking his life and he was about to lose it now twentytwo ships there had been twentytwo ships theyd agreed arranged in a pair of sort of staggered lines slightly curved in tune with the planets gravity well quitrilis had gone up to have a look at them all but they were boring just hanging there only the one that had been there from the start even showed any sign of traffic with a few smaller craft buzzing about the oct movement monitoring and control people had sort of shouted at him hed got the impression but an oct shouting was still a pretty involved incomprehensible experience and he hadnt taken much notice hed got the ship to let him have control and gone swooping and zooming and wheening about the fleet carving round them and then deciding hed have a blast right through the middle so heading some way off well off like a good half a million klicks on the far side of the planet and setting everything to very quiet what the ship called ssh mode before turning back and coming bazonging back in before they had time to shout at him again and dipping and weaving and hurtling between the parked primarians hed been bouncing up and down in the couch in the control room whooping and he thought hed done it no problem got to the end of the mass of ships and slung out from under that twentysecond ship on the way back into empty space again hed probably go visit one of the systems gas giants for a day or two to let any fuss die down when suddenly as he came out from under that last primarian or what should have been the last primarian there dead ahead bang in front of him filling the view so tall and wide and deep and fucking big he knew there was no chance he could avoid it there was another ship a twentythird ship what something flashed on the spread of retro control panel in front of him hed specced that himself quitrilis the ships voice said what sorry quitrilis had time to say as the gantried openwork innards of the oct ship expanded in front of him filling the aheadview utterly now getting down to detail maybe they could fly through he thought but knew they couldnt the internal components of the primarian were too big the spaces were too small maybe they could crashstop but they were just too damn close the now we try it my way had taken over control the hand controls had gone limp indicator overlays flashed up enginedamage levels of braking and dumpturning but it was all much too little much too late theyd hit side on and barely ten per cent slower quitrilis closed his eyes he didnt know what else to do the now we try it my way made some noises he hadnt known it could make he waited for death hed been backed up before he left home obviously but hed been away over five hundred days and changed immensely in that time he was profoundly and maturely a different person compared to the brash young lad whod sailed off in his persuadable accomplice ship this would be a very real death wow proper sinking feeling here this would be noshit serious neveragain extinction at least itd be quick there was that maybe the oct had closerange defences against this sort of thing maybe theyd be blasted out of the skies before they hit the primarian or theyd be beamed out of the way or something nudgefielded fended off with something truly stupendously skilful except the oct didnt have any of that sort of stuff the oct ships were relatively primitive oh hed just realised he was probably just about to kill lots of oct people he got a sinking feeling that outdid the earlier selfish sinking feeling oh fuck fucking major diplomatic incident the c would have to apologise and he was just starting to think that hey you really could squeeze a lot of thoughts into a second or two when you knew you were about to die when the ship said quite calmly quitrilis he opened his eyes not dead and nothing but the old starspecked depths of space ahead eh he looked back stacked ships twentyplus primarians one ultra close behind receding fast like theyd just exited from it travelling very fast indeed did we dodge that thing he said gulping no the ship said we went right through it because its not a real ship its little better than a hologram what quitrilis said shaking his head how why good question the ship said i wonder how many of the others are just pretend too im fucking alive quitrilis breathed he clicked out of the command virtuality so he was sat in the couch properly with the physical controls in front of him and the wraparound display showing in slightly less detail what hed been looking at seemingly directly were fucking alive ship he yelled yes we are how odd the now we try it my way sounded puzzled im sending a burst to my old systems vehicle about this somethings not right here quitrilis waved his arms around and waggled his toes but were alive he yelled ecstatic were alive i am not disagreeing quitrilis however wait were being target the beam from the original firstarrived primarian ship burst all around them turning the little craft and the single human inside it entirely into plasma within a few hundred milliseconds this time quitrilis yurke didnt have time to think anything at all djan seriy anaplian agent of the cultures renownednotorious delete to taste special circumstances section had her first dream of prasadal while aboard the seed drill an oceanclass gsv the details of the dream itself were not important what exercised her on waking was that it was the kind of dream she had always associated with home she had had dreams like that about the royal palace in pourl and the estate at moiliou about the eighth in general and even if you counted the dreams of the hyengzhar about sursamen as a whole for the first few years after shed come to the culture and always woken from them with a pang of homesickness sometimes in tears those had slowly disappeared to be replaced by dreams of other places where shed lived like the city of klusse on gadampth orbital where she had begun her long introduction to induction into and acceptance of the culture these were sometimes profound affecting dreams in their own way but they were never imbued with that feeling of loss and longing that indicated the place being dreamt about was home she blinked awake in the grey darkness of her latest cabin a perfectly standard ration of space in a perfectly standard oceanclass and realised with a tiny amount of horror a degree of grim humour and a modicum of ironic appreciation that just as she had started to realise that she might finally be happy to be away from and free of sursamen and all that it had meant to her she had been called back she nearly caught the ball she didnt and it hit her on the right temple hard enough to cause a spike of pain it would she was sure have floored anybody humanbasic with all her sc stuff still wired in shed have dodged it or caught it onehanded easily in fact with her sc stuff still on line she could have jumped and caught it in her teeth instead whack shed heard the ball coming caught the most fleeting glimpse of it arcing towards her but hadnt been quite quick enough the ball bounced off her head she shook her head once spread her feet wide and flexed her knees to make her more stable in case she might be about to topple but she didnt the pain flicked off cancelled she rubbed her head and stooped to pick up the hard little ball a crackball so just a solid bit of wood basically and looked for who had thrown it a guy sailed out of the group of people by the small bar shed been passing on one of the outer balcony decks you all right he asked she threw the ball to him on a soft high trajectory yes she told him he was a small round almost balllike man himself very dark and with extravagant hair he caught the ball and stood weighing it in his hand he smiled somebody said you were sc thats all i thought well lets see so i threw this at you thought youd catch it or duck or something perhaps asking would have been more effective djan seriy suggested some of the people at the bar were looking at them sorry the man said nodding at the side of her head accepted goodday she made to walk on will you let me make you a drink that wont be necessary thank you all the same seriously it would make me feel better quite no thank you i make a very good zas revenge im something of an expert really what is a zas revenge its a cocktail please stay have one with us very well she had a zas revenge it was very alcoholic she let it affect her the round man and his friends were peace faction people from the part of the culture that had split away at the start of the idiran war hundreds of years earlier renouncing conflict altogether she stayed for more zas revenges eventually the man admitted that although he liked her and found her highly personable he just didnt like sc which he referred to rather sneeringly anaplian thought as the good ship we know whats good for you its still violence he told her its still what we ought to be above it can be violent anaplian acknowledged nodding slowly most of the mans friends had drifted off beyond the balcony deck in the open air surrounding the gsvs hull a regatta for humanpowered aircraft was taking place it was all very gay and gaudy and seemed to involve a lot of fireworks we should be above that do you see i see were strong enough as it is too strong we can defend ourselves be an example no need to go interfering it is a compelling moral case you make anaplian told the man solemnly youre taking the piss now no i agree but youre in sc you interfere you do all the dirty tricks stuff you do dont you we do i do so dont fucking tell me its a compelling moral case then dont insult me the peace faction guy was quite aggressive this amused her that was not my intention she told him i was telling you excuse me anaplian took another sip of her drink i was telling you i agree with what you say but not to the point of acting differently one of the first things they teach you in sc or she belched delicately excuse me or get you to teach yourself is not to be too sure always to be prepared to acknowledge that there is an argument for not doing the things that we do but you still do them but we still do them it shames us all you are entitled to your view and you to yours but your actions contaminate me in a way that mine do not contaminate you you are right but then you are of the peace faction and so not really the same were all still culture were the real culture and youre the cancerous offspring grown bigger than the host and more dangerous than when we split but you resemble us well enough to make us all look the same to others they see one entity not different factions you make us look bad i see your point we guilt you i apologise you guilt us this some new scspeak no old sarlspeak my people sometimes use odds wordly words oddly anaplian put her hand to her mouth giggling you should be ashamed the man said sadly really were no better youre no better than the savages they always find excuses to justify their crimes too the point is not to commit them in the first place i do see your point i really do so be ashamed then tell me youre ashamed we are anaplian assured him constantly still we can prove that it works the interfering and the dirtytricking it works salvation is in statistics i wondered when wed get to that the man said smiling sourly and nodding the unquestioned catechism of contact of sc that old nonsense that irrelevance is not nonsense nor it is truth the man got down from his bar stool he was shaking his head this made his wild fawn hair go in all directions floatily most distracting theres just nothing we can do he said sadly or maybe angrily is there nothing thatll change you youll just keep doing all that shit until it collapses down around you around us or until enough of everybody sees the real truth not fucking statistics till then theres just nothing we can do you cant fight us anaplian said and laughed hilarious sorry that was cheap i apologise profusely the man shook his head again however much he said itll never be enough goodday he walked off anaplian watched him go she wanted to tell him that it was all okay that there was nothing really to worry about that the universe was a terrible utterly uncaring place and then people came along and added suffering and injustice to the mix as well and it was all so much worse than he could imagine and she knew because she had studied it and lived it even if just a little you could make it better but it was a messy process and then you just had to try you were obliged dutybound to try to be sure that you did the right thing sometimes that meant using sc and well there you were she scratched her head anyway of course they worried they were doing the wrong thing everybody shed ever met in sc entertained such thoughts and of course they satisfied themselves they were doing the right thing obviously they must or they wouldnt be in sc doing what they were doing in the first place would they maybe he knew all this anyway part of her suspected that the guy was an sc agent too or something similar part of contact perhaps or somebody sent by the ship or by one of the minds overseeing the morthanveld situation just to be on the safe side nearly cracking her skull with a solid wooden ball was one crude way of checking she had been properly disarmed she left the final zas revenge sitting on the bar undrunk were all the fucking peace faction you prick she muttered as she staggered away before she left the seed drill she researched what was known about recent events on the eighth sursamen she did some of the investigating herself and sent agents crude temporary personality constructs into the dataverse to search for more she was looking for detailed news but also for any hint that the sarl might be more closely observed too many sophisticated civilisations seemed to believe that the very primitiveness of less developed cultures and the high levels of violence usually associated with such societies somehow automatically gave them the right to spy on them even for societies some way down the civilisational techorder cascadeproduction of machines to make machines that made other machines meant it was effectively a materially costfree decision the resulting cloud of devices could each be as small as a grain of dust and yet together they could with the backup of a few larger units in space blanketsurveille an entire planet and transmit in excruciating detail almost anything that went on almost anywhere there were treaties and agreements to limit this sort of behaviour but these usually only covered the galaxys more mature and settled societies as well as those directly under their control or in their thrall the relevant tech was like a new toy for those recently arrived at the great involved table of the galactic metacivilisation and tended to get used with enthusiasm for a while societies which had only recently renounced the chronic use of force and resort to war often reluctantly were usually the most keen to watch those for whom such behaviour was still routine one of the lastresort methods of dealing with those displaying such voyeurism was to turn their own devices against them scooping the surveillance machines up from wherever they had been scattered fiddling with their software and then infesting the worlds of their creators with them concentrating on the homes and favoured recreational facilities of the powerful this usually did the trick the peoples living within sursamen especially those like the sarl who would have been both unsuspecting of and defenceless against such conceited oversight were amongst those supposedly protected against its depredations but just because something wasnt public didnt mean it wasnt happening the culture had one of the most open and inclusive dataverse structures in the galaxy but even it didnt see or know everything there were still plenty of private hidden things going on as a rule you got to hear of them eventually but by then the damage had usually been done from the eighth though so far nothing either nobody was spying or if they were they were keeping very quiet about it the morthanveld were easily capable but too proud lawabiding and anyway disdainful much like the culture then the nariscene probably thought themselves above such behaviour too and the oct well the oct didnt really seem to care about anything other than pushing their claim to be the true inheritors of the veil legacy even routine accessing of the oct parts of the dataverse meant having to suffer a recorded lecture on the history of the galaxy according to the oct the whole point of which was to highlight the similarities between the veil and the oct and emphasise what a good claim the oct had on the involucras estate to the oct this inheritance obviously included both the shellworlds themselves and the respect they felt ought to come attached respect they rightly felt they were not being accorded the cultures interface software just as routinely filtered this nonsense out the oct claim was strong only according to themselves the vast majority of trusted scholars backed by some pretty unimpeachable evidence held that the oct were a relatively recent species quite unrelated to the veil but it was always there the oct did watch over the sarl but very patchily infrequently and by agreement with centimetrescale devices things big enough for a human to see usually these were attached to machines manned by oct scendships aircraft ground vehicles and the environment suits they wore there wasnt much material publicly available from the last few hundreds of days but there was some djan seriy watched recordings of the great battle which had decided the fate of the deldeyn on the land around the xiliskine tower the commentary and accompanying data such as they were suggested that the aultridia had taken over the relevant sections of the tower and transported the deldeyn forces into a position where they could carry out their sneak attack on the sarl heartlands an scflagged dataend appended to the recording suggested aultridian involvement was a lie the oct had been in charge all the recordage was from the latter part of the battle and taken from static positions well above the action probably from the tower itself she wondered if somewhere in what she was looking at there was detail of her father being wounded and of whatever fate had overtaken ferbin she tried to zoom in thinking to instruct an agent to look for anything relevant but the recording was too coarse and lost detail well before individuals on the battlefield could be recognised she watched again as though from on high though this time the cameras were mounted on something flying as the sarl forces now under mertis tyl loesp crossed a canal in the desert near the hyengzhar its tall mists in the hazy distance and saw their final short siege and shorter attack on rasselle the deldeyn capital city that seemed to be all a proper news report or docufeature would have included victory celebrations in pourl tyl loesp accepting the surrender of the deldeyn commander piles of dead bodies consigned to pits banners going up in flames or the tears of the inconsolable bereaved but the oct hadnt thought to get even remotely artistic or judgemental just the sort of enthrallingly primitive barbaric but dashing war comfortably positioned people liked to hear about anaplian thought it was almost a pity nobody had thought to record it in all its gory detail a rapidly expanding but almost entirely vapid cloud of comment analysis speculation and exploitation was attached to the oct recording through the news and current affairs organisations which took an interest in such events many shellworld and sursamen scholars there were even people who regarded themselves as eighth scholars sarl scholars bemoaned the lack of decent data leaving so much to speculation for others this lack of detail seemed to be merely an opportunity offers to play war games based on the recent events were appended entertainments inspired by the recent thrilling events were also in preparation or indeed already available djan seriy shivered in her couch by a fragrant poolside splashing laughter the warmth of light on her skin as she lay there eyes closed watching experiencing all of this she felt suddenly as she had right at the start of her involvement with the culture back in the shockingly confusing early days when everything seemed like bedlam and clash this was all just too much to take in at once far too close to home and utterly horribly invasively alien compared to it she would leave her agents running within the dataverse in case there was some more directly observed stuff and it was just well hidden welcome to the future she thought surveying all this wordage and tat all our tragedies and triumphs our lives and deaths our shames and joys are just stuffing for your emptiness she was being melodramatic she decided she checked there was no more of use to watch clicked out stood up and went to join in a noisy game of pool tag one ship another ship from the seed drill she was passed on to the gcu you naughty monsters another batonlike transmissal took her to the xenoglossicist an airclass limited system vehicle on her last night aboard there was an allcrews dance party she threw herself into the wild music and wilder dancing like one abandoned the last culture ship to carry her before she entered the morthanveld domain was called youll clean that up before you leave a gangsterclass very fast picket and exrapid offensive unit she still hated the silly names departures oramen woke to the sound of a thousand bells blown temple horns manufactury sirens carriage hooters and justaudible mass cheering and knew immediately that the war must be over and won he looked about he was in a gambling and whore house known as botreys in the citys schtip district there was a shape in the bedclothes beside him which belonged to the girl whose name he would remember shortly droffo his new equerry who was newly married and determinedly faithful chose to turn a blind eye to oramens whoring so long as it was carried out in gambling or drinking houses an honest bordello he would not even contemplate entering his new servant neguste puibive had before hed left the farm promised his mother he would never pay for sex and was dutifully honouring this commitment to the letter though not beyond he had been modestly successful in persuading some of the more generous girls to extend their favours to him out of simple kindness as well as sympathy for one who had made such a wellmeant if hopelessly naïve promise oramens absences from court had not gone unnoticed or unremarked just the morning before at a formal late breakfast reception given by harne the lady aelsh to welcome her latest astrologer oramen had already successfully forgotten the fellows name renneque accompanied by and arminarm with ramile the pretty young thing oramen remembered from harnes earlier party with the various actors and philosophisers had scolded him why its that young fellow she had exclaimed upon seeing him look ramile i recall that pretty face if not the name after so long apart how dyou do sir my names renneque yours hed smiled ladies renneque ramile how good to see you again have i been remiss renneque sniffed ill say most unfathomably i declare there are those absent at the war whore more often at court than you oramen are we so boring you avoid us prince absolutely not on the contrary i determined myself to be so ineffably tedious i thought to remove myself from our most quotidian conduct in the hope of making myself seem more contrastedly interesting to you when we do meet renneque was still thinking this through when ramile smiled slyly at oramen but to renneque said i think the prince finds other ladies more to his liking elsewhere does he now renneque asked feigning innocence oramen smiled an empty smile it may be we are not wanted ramile suggested renneque raised her delicate chin indeed perhaps we are not good enough for the prince she said or it may be we are too good for him ramile mused how could that be oramen asked for want of anything better its true renneque agreed taking a tighter hold of her companions arm some prize availability over virtue ive heard and a tongue loosened by money rather than moved by wit ramile offered oramen felt his face flush while some he said trust an honest harlot over the most apparently virtuous and courtly of women some might out of sheer perversity said renneque whose eyes had widened at the word harlot though whether a man of judgement and honour would term one of those females honest in the first place might give rise to some controversy ones values like so much else might become infected in such company ramile suggested and tossed her pretty head and long flow of tight blonde curls i meant ladies oramen said that a whore takes her reward there and then and seeks no further advancement this time as he said whore both renneque and ramile looked startled she loves for money and makes no lie of it that is honest there are those however whod offer any favour seemingly for nothing but would later expect a very great deal of a young man with some prospect of advancement renneque stared at him as though hed lost his mind her mouth opened perhaps to say something ramiles expression changed the most altering quickly from something like anger back to that sly look then taking on a small knowing smile come away renneque she said drawing the other woman back with her arm the prince mistakes us grievously as though in a fever wed best withdraw to let the blush subside and lest we catch it too they turned away as one noses in the air he regretted his rudeness almost immediately but too late he felt to make amends he supposed he was already a little upset that mornings mail had delivered a letter from his mother all the way from fardistant kheretesuhr telling him that she was heavily pregnant by her new husband and had been advised by her doctors not to travel great distances so to voyage all the way to court to pourl was unthinkable a new husband hed thought pregnant heavily pregnant so that it was no recent thing hed heard nothing of this nothing of either she had not thought to tell him anything the date on the letter was weeks past it had suffered some serious delay in finding him or had lain unposted he felt hurt cheated somehow as well as jealous and oddly spurned he still was not sure how to respond it had even crossed his mind that it might be best not to reply at all part of him wanted to do just that so letting his mother wonder at not being kept informed making her feel uncaredfor as she had made him feel even while he was still lying there listening to the distant sounds of triumph trying to work out exactly what he felt about the wars victorious conclusion and puzzling over the fact that his immediate reaction was somehow not one of utter and untrammelled joy neguste puibive his servant ran into the room and stopped breathless at the foot of the bed luzehl the girl oramen had spent the night with was waking up too rubbing her eyes and looking dubiously at puibive a tall wideeyed bucktoothed boy fresh from the country he was full of enthusiasm and good will and had the uncommon ability of looking gangly even while asleep sir he shouted he noticed luzehl and blushed begging both your pardons sir young lady he gulped air sir still begging your pardon sir but the war is finished sir and we are victorious the news is just arrived tyl loesp great werreber they all sarl are triumphant what a great day sorry to have intruded sir ill extrude now sir neguste hold oramen said as the youth a year older than oramen but often seeming younger turned and made to go tripping over his own feet as he did so and stumbling again as he turned back on oramens command he sorted himself out and stood at attention looking blinking at oramen who asked is there any more detail neguste i heard the great news from a onearmed parliamentarian constable charged with shouting it to the rooftops sir and he wore a cocked hat the lady from the infusions bar across the road near fainted when she heard and wished her sons a safely speedy return sir oramen stifled a laugh detail within the report of the victory itself neguste nothing further sir just we are victorious the capital city of the deldeyn is taken their king is dead by his own hand and our brave boys have triumphed sir and tyl loesp and mighty werreber are safe casualties have been light oh and the deldeyn capital is to be renamed hausk city sir neguste beamed with pleasure at this thats a fine thing eh sir fine indeed oramen said and lay back smiling as hed listened to negustes breathless delivery hed felt his mood improve and gradually begin to resemble what hed have hoped it would have been from the start thank you neguste he told the lad you may go pleasure do soing sir neguste said he had yet to come up with a reliable and consistent phrase suitable for such moments he turned without tripping found the door successfully and closed it behind him he barged back in a heartbeat later and he exclaimed a telegraphical letter sir just delivered he took the sealed envelope from his apron handed it to oramen and retreated luzehl yawned is it really over then she asked as oramen broke the seal and opened the folded sheet oramen nodded slowly so it would seem he smiled at the girl and started swinging his legs out of the bed as he read id better get to the palace luzehl stretched out tossed her long black entangledly curled hair and looked insulted immediately prince the telegram brought news that he had a new halfbrother it had been written not by aclyn herself but by her principal ladyinwaiting the birth had been protracted and difficult not surprising it was stated given the lady blisks relatively mature age but mother and child were recovering that was all yes immediately oramen said shrugging off the girls hand the heat around the hyengzhar had grown oppressive two suns the rollstars clissens and natherley stood high in the sky and vied to squeeze the most sweat out of a man soon in this waterpurged extremity if the starwatchers and weather sages were to be believed the land would be plunged into near total darkness for nearly fifty shortdays and a sudden winter would ensue turning the river and the falls into ice tyl loesp looked out over the vast tiered segmented cataract of the hyengzhar blinking sweat out of his eyes and wondered that such colossal booming energy and such furious heat could be quieted stilled and chilled so soon by the mere absence of passing stars and yet the scientists said it was going to happen and indeed seemed quite excited about it and the records talked of such happenings in the past so it must be so he wiped his brow such heat hed be glad to be under the water rasselle the deldeyn capital city had fallen easily in the end after a lot of whining from werreber and some of the other senior army people and some evidence that the loworder troops were unaccountably coy on the matter of putting captured deldeyn to death tyl loesp had rescinded the general order regarding the taking of prisoners and the sacking of cities in retrospect he ought to have pressed hausk to have demonised the deldeyn more chasque had been enthusiastic and together they had tried to convince hausk the attitude of the soldiery and the populace would be improved if they could be made to hate the deldeyn with a visceral conviction but the king had typically been overcautious hausk distinguished between the deldeyn as a people on the one hand and their high command and corrupt nobility on the other and even allowed that they might altogether constitute an honourable foe he would in any event need to govern them once they had been defeated and people nursing a justified grievance against a murderously inclined occupier made peaceful productive rule impossible on this purely practical issue he judged massacre wasteful and even contrary as a method of control fear lasted a week anger a year and resentment a lifetime hed held not if you kept fuelling that fear with every passing day tyl loesp had countered but had been overruled better grudging respect than terrified submission hausk had told him clapping him on the shoulder after the discussion that had finally decided the matter tyl loesp had bitten back his reply following hausks death there had not been sufficient time to turn the deldeyn into the hated inhuman objects of fear and contempt tyl loesp thought they ought to have been from the start though he had done his best to begin the process in any event he had subsequently been left with no choice but to step back from the adamantine harshness of his earlier decrees on the taking of prisoners and cities but drew comfort from the thought that a good commander always stood ready to modify his tactics and strategy as circumstances changed so long as each step along the way led towards his ultimate goal he had anyway turned the situation to his advantage he reckoned letting it be known that this new leniency was his gift to the soldiers of the eighth and the people of the ninth graciously and mercifully countermanding the severity of action hausk had demanded from his deathbed to avenge his killing savidius savide who was the oct peripatetic special envoy of extraordinary objectives among useful aboriginals watched as the human called tyl loesp swam and was guided to the place prepared for him in the roving scendships receiving chamber the scendship was one of a rare class capable of both flight in air and underwater travel as well as the more normal vertical journeys within the vacuum of towers it was holding station in the relatively deep water of sulpitines main channel two kilometres above the lip of the hyengzhar cataract the human tyl loesp had been brought out to the submerged craft in a small submarine cutter he was dressed in an air suit and was obviously unused to such attire and uncomfortable he was floated into a bracket seat across the receiving chamber from where savide floated and shown how to anchor himself against the brackets shoulder braces using buoyancy then the oct guard withdrew savide caused a membranebuffered air channel to form between him and the human so that they could speak with something approaching their own voices tyl loesp and welcome envoy savide the human replied tentatively opening his face mask into the airtunnel rippling between them he waited a few moments then said you wished to see me tyl loesp smiled though hed always wondered if this expression actually meant anything to an oct he found the suit he had to wear strange and awkward its air smelled of something vaguely unpleasant burned the odd wormlike tube that had extended from the envoys mouth parts to his own face brought with it an additional scent of fish just starting to rot at least it was pleasantly cool here inside the oct ship he looked round the chamber while he waited for the oct to answer the space was spherical or very close to it its single wall studded with silvery spiracles and ornate tiered studs the sort of upsidedown shoulderseat he was attached to was one of the chambers plainer pieces of ornamentation he still resented having to be here summoned like a vassal when he had just taken over an entire level savidius savide might have come to see him to pay tribute to his success in the great palace at rasselle which was magnificent it made the palace at pourl look plain instead he had had to come to the oct secrecy in such matters had been the order so far and savidius savide obviously had no intention of changing this in the short term whatever his reasons were the oct tyl loesp had to own knew more of what was really going on here than he did and so had to be indulged he would like to think that he had been called here finally to learn what the last few years had all been about but he was under no illusions regarding the oct ability to obscure prevaricate and confuse he still had the very faint suspicion that the oct had overseen this entire enterprise on a whim or for some minor reason they had subsequently forgotten though even they would surely hesitate to engineer the transferral of an entire shellworld level from one group to another without outside permission and without having a good reason would they not but see here the envoys little blue mouth parts were working and a couple of his orange armlegs were moving and so he was about to speak the deldeyn lands are controlled now savidius savide said his voice expressed as a low gurgle they are indeed rasselle is secure order barely broke down at all but to the extent that it did it has been restored every other part of the deldeyn kingdom including the principalities provinces curbed lands and outlying imperial satrapies are under our control through either physical occupation by our forces or in the case of the furthest and least important colonies the unconditional acquiescence of their most senior officials then all may rejoice in said the sarl may join the oct inheritors of the mantle of those who made the shellworlds in justified celebration tyl loesp chose to assume he had just been congratulated thank you he said all are pleased im sure they are and i would thank the oct for your help in this it has been invaluable inscrutable too but invaluable beyond doubt even dear late king hausk was known to concede that we might have struggled to overcome the deldeyn without you being in effect on our side tyl loesp paused i have often asked myself what the reason might be that you have been so forthcoming with your advice and aid so far i have been unable to come to any satisfactory conclusion in celebration is found that of explicatory nature only rarely the nature of celebration is ecstatic mysteriously ebullient detaching full reason hence betokening some confusion the oct drew breath or whatever liquidic equivalent it was that oct drew explication must not become obstruction deflection savidius savide added final understanding remaining incentive is most fruitful use available some small amount of time passed during which the long silverylooking tube of air joining them gently bobbed and slowly writhed some lazy little bubbles wobbled their way upwards from the base of the spherical chamber a sequence of dull deep and distant whirring noises sounded through the enveloping water and tyl loesp worked out what the peripatetic special envoy had meant im sure it is just as you say savide he agreed eventually and see the envoy said gesturing with two legs at a bunched semisphere of screens glittering into being each projected by one of the shining spires protruding from the chambers wall the scenes displayed on the screens as far as tyl loesp could discern them through the intervening water showed various important and famous parts of the deldeyn kingdom tyl loesp thought he could make out sarl soldiers patrolling the edge of the hyengzhar cataract and sarl banners fluttering above the great towers of rasselle there were more flags shown at the side of the crater caused by the fallstar heurimo and silhouetted against the vast white pillar of steam cloud rising forever above the boiling sea of yakid it is as you say savidius savide sounded happy rejoice in such trust all are pleased the oct envoy repeated how splendid tyl loesp said as the screens blinked out agreement is agreeable agreed savide informed him he had risen slightly above the station he had been keeping until now a tiny belch or fart from somewhere behind his midtorso sent a shoal of tiny silver bubbles trembling upwards and helped reestablish the envoys position in the waters of the chamber tyl loesp took a deep tentative breath may we speak plainly no better form is known severally specifically quite tyl loesp said envoy why did you help us help you the sarl to defeat they the deldeyn yes and why the emphasis on the falls there was silence for a few moments then the oct said for reasons what reasons most excellent ones tyl loesp nearly smiled which you will not tell me will not indeed equally cannot in time such restrictions change as with all things changing power over others is the least and most of powers betruth to balance such great success with transient lack of same is fit fitness may not be beheld by subject but as object needs be trusts invoked in this trust to wait tyl loesp regarded the oct hanging in the water a few metres in front of him for a while so much done yet always so much still to do he had that day received a coded report from vollird telling of the valiant and daring attempt he and baerth had made on the life of our fugitive while on the surface only to be frustrated at the last moment by alien devilmachinery they had had to reconcile to secondbest ensuring said person left most expeditiously sailing away into the night between the eternal stars terrified and lucky to be alive tyl loesp didnt doubt vollird exaggerated the worth of his and baerths actions however killing ferbin amongst the optimae or even the optimaes immediate inferiors had always been a tall order and he would not overly censure the two knights hed have preferred ferbin dead but absent would do still what mischief might he stir out among the alien races would he loudly declaim himself the wronged and rightful heir to all whod listen or sneak to his allegedly influential sister things were never settled it seemed to tyl loesp no matter how decisively one acted no matter how ruthless one was loose ends remained and even the most conclusive of actions left a welter of ramifications any of which it seemed sometimes especially when one woke fretful in the middle of the night and such potential troubles appeared magnified might harbinge disaster he sighed then said i intend to rid us of the mission monks they get in the way and restrict more than they aid and enable i shall follow an opposite course in the capital we need the remains of the army and militia however i think it best they are balanced with some other faction and propose the heavenly host sect as that counterweight they have a selflacerating quality about their teachings which ought to chime with the current deldeyn mood of selfblame following their defeat some heads will roll obviously to that which must be attended so devote is meet and like so long as you know i intend to go back to pourl for a triumph and to return treasure and hostages in time i may remain in rasselle and there are those id have near i shall need a reliable and continually available line of supply and communication between here and the eighth may i count on that the scendships and autoscenders so devoted remain so as in the recent past so in the near future and with all appropriate contextualisationing foreseeable beyond i have the scendships already allocated they are mine to command to request the all flatters their likely or possible use as needs be so shall their presence as long as i can get up and down that tower back to the eighth back to here at any time quickly this is not within dispute i determine no less personally thus asked so give allowed and with pleasure is beinged tyl loesp thought about all this for a while yes he said well im glad thats clear steam tugs towing barges took the whole contingent of monks the entirety of the hyengzharia mission from most lowly latrine boy to the archipontine himself away from their lifes work tyl loesp fresh returned from his frustrating audience with the envoy watched the loading and went with the lead tug which was towing the three barges containing the archipontine and all the higher ranks of the order they were crossing the sulpitine a kilometre or so upriver from the nearest part of the vast semicircle of the falls the monks had been relieved of their duty they were all being taken across the river to the small town of far landing a movable port always kept some four or five kilometres upstream from the cataract tyl loesp stayed under the shade of the lead tugs stern awning and still had to use a kerchief to wipe at his brow and temples now and again the suns hung in the sky an anvil and a hammer of heat striking together inescapable the area of real shade hidden from both rollstars was minimal even under the broad awning around him the men of his regents guard watched the swirling brown waters of the river and sometimes raised their glistening heads to look up at the gauzy froth of offwhite clouds that piled into the sky beyond the lip of the falls the sound of the cataract was dull and so everpresent that it was easy not to notice it was there at all most of the time filling the languid heatflattened air with a strange underwatersounding rumble heard with the guts and lungs and bones as much as through the ears the six tugs and twenty barges tracked across the quick current making a couple of kilometres towards the distant shore though only increasing their distance from the falls by two hundred metres or so as they fought against the rivers fastflowing midsection the tugs engines chuffed and growled smoke and steam belched from their tall stacks drifting over the dun river in fadedlooking double shadows barely darker than the sandycoloured river itself the vessels smelled of steam and roasoaril oil their engineers came up on to deck whenever they could to escape the furnace heat below for the cooler furnace of the river breeze the water roiled and burst and tumbled about the boats like something alive like whole shoals of living things forever surfacing and diving and surfacing again with a kind of lazy insolence on the barges a hundred strides behind under makeshift awnings and shades the monks sat and lay and stood the sight of their massed white robes hurting the eye when the small fleet of boats was in the very middle of the stream and each shore looked as far away as the other they were barely visible at all in the heat haze just a horizoned sensation of something darker than the river and a few tall trees and shimmering spires tyl loesp himself took a twohand hammer to the pin securing the towing rope to the tugs main running shackle the pin fell clattering loudly across the thick wooden deck the loop of rope slithered drily over the deck quite slowly at first but gathering a little speed as it went before the loop itself flipped up over the transom and disappeared with hardly a sound into the busy brown bulges of the river the tug surged ahead appreciably and altered course to go directly upstream tyl loesp looked out to the other tugs to make sure their tow ropes were also being unhitched he watched the ropes flip over the sterns of all the tugs until every one was powering away upstream released waves surging and splashing round bluff bows it was some time before the monks on the barges realised what was happening tyl loesp was never really sure if he actually heard them start to wail and cry and scream or whether he had imagined it they should be glad he thought the falls had been their lives let them be their deaths what more had the obstructive wretches ever really wanted he had trusted men stationed downstream from the cataracts main plunge pools they would also take care of any monks who survived the plunge though going on the historical record even if you sent a thousand monks over the falls it was unlikely one would survive all but one of the barges just vanished in the haze falling out of sight disappointing one however must have struck a rock or outcrop right at the lip of the falls its stem tipping high into the air in a most dramatic and satisfying manner before it slid and dropped away on the way back to port one of the tugs broke down its engine giving up in a tall burst of steam from its chimney two of its fellows put ropes to it and rescued vessel and surviving crew before they too fell victim to the falls tyl loesp stood on a gantry like a halffinished bridge levered out over the edge of the nearpole cliff looking across the hyengzhar most of which was frustratingly obscured by mist and cloud a man called jerfin poatas elderly hunched darkdressed and leaning on a stick stood by his side poatas was a sarl scholar and archaeologist who had devoted his life to the study of the falls and had lived here in the great eternally temporary forever shufflingforward city of hyengzhar settlement for twenty of his thirty longyears it had long been acknowledged that he owed his loyalty to study and knowledge rather than any country or state though that had not prevented him being briefly interned by the deldeyn at the height of their war against the sarl with the monks of the hyengzharia mission gone he was now by tyl loesps decree in full charge of the excavations the brethren were cautious conservative as any good archaeologist is at an excavation poatas told tyl loesp he had to raise his voice to be heard over the thunderous roar of the falls spray swirled up now and again in great spiralling veils and deposited water droplets on their faces but they took such caution too far a normal dig waits one can afford to be careful one proceeds with all due deliberation noting all investigating all preserving and recording the placeinsequence of all discovered finds this is not a normal dig and waits for nothing and no one it will freeze soon and make life easier if colder for a while but even then the brethren were determined to do as they had in the past and suspend all excavations while the falls were frozen due to some surfeit of piety even the king refused to intervene poatas laughed can you imagine the one time in the solarmeteorological cycle in a lifetime when the falls are at their most amenable to exploration and excavation and they intended to halt it all poatas shook his head cretins just so tyl loesp said well they rule here no more i expect great things from this place poatas he told the other man turning briefly to him by your own reports this is a treasure house whose potential the monks consistently downplayed and underexploited a treasure house which they resolutely refused to explore properly poatas said nodding a treasure house most of whose doors were left unopened or were left to the privateers little more than licensed brigands to open with sufficient men that can all be changed theres many a falls merchant explorer wholl howl with rage to be denied the continuance of their easy stipend but that is to the good even they grew arrogant and lazy and lately in my lifetime more concerned with keeping others out of their concessions than fully exploiting them themselves poatas looked sharply at tyl loesp as the wind began to change theres no guarantee of finding the sort of treasure you might be thinking of here tyl loesp wonder weapons from the past that will command the future are a myth quell that thought if its what exercises you he paused tyl loesp said nothing the veered wind was blowing a hot desertdry stream of air across them now and the clouds and mists were beginning to shift and part before them in the great still mostly unglimpsed gorge but whatevers here to be found well find and if it needs ripping out of some building the brethren of the mission would have left intact then so be it all this can be done if i have enough men youll have men tyl loesp told him half an army my army and others some little more than slaves but theyll work to keep their bellies full the clouds throughout the vast complexity confronting them were rolling away from the new wind lifting and dissipating at once slaves do not make the best workers and who will command this army this army which will like as not expect to go home to their loved ones now they think their jobs done here you you return to the eighth do you not the armies are well used to foreign travel and distant billets however i shall in prudent portions leaving nowhere unmanned so allowance them with loot and easy return theyll either beg to see the ninth again or be each one a most zealous recruiting sergeant for their younger brothers for myself i return to pourl only briefly i intend to spend half each year or more in rasselle it is the traditional seat of power and of infinite elegance compared to our poor everonwardtramping township here but whether by train or caude it is two days away more in bad weather well we shall have the telegraph line soon and while i am not present you have my authority here poatas i offer you complete power over the entire falls in my name tyl loesp waved one hand dismissively in bookish legality it may be in the name of the prince regent but he is still little more than a boy for the moment and it may in time seem a long moment his future power is mine now entirely you understand me poatas smiled parsimoniously my whole life and every work has taught me there is a natural order to things a rightful stratification of authority and might i work with it sir never seek to overthrow it good tyl loesp said that is as well i have in addition thought to provide you with a titular head of excavations someone id rather have quite near to me but not at my side when im in rasselle indeed their presence here might aid the recruitment of many a sarl but they would be above me in theory not in effect i emphasise their seniority to yourself will be most strictly honorary and who would this person be poatas asked why the very one we just talked of my charge the prince regent oramen is that wise you say hes a boy the falls can be a pestilential place and the settlement a lawless dangerous one especially with the brethren gone tyl loesp shrugged we must pray the worldgod keeps him safe and i have in mind a couple of knights i intend to make the essence of his personal guard they will take all care of him poatas thought for a moment nodding and wiped a little moisture from the stick he leant on will he come he asked doubtfully looking out towards the great gradually revealing spaces of the hyengzhars awesomely complicated twentykilometrewide gorge of recession tyl loesp looked out to the gorge complex and smiled he had never been here until their armies had invaded and having heard so much about its peerless beauty and fabulous humbling grandeur from so many people had been determined not to be impressed when he did finally see the place the hyengzhar however seemed to have had other ideas he had indeed been stunned awestruck rendered speechless he had seen it from various different angles over the past week or so including from the air on a lyge though only from on high and only in the company of experienced fallsfliers and still he could entirely understand why it was such a dangerous place to fly the urge to explore to descend and see better was almost irresistible and knowing that so many people had died doing just that caught in the tremendous rolling currents of air and vapour issuing from the falls hauling them helplessly down to their deaths seemed like an irrelevance poatas himself expressed some astonishment at the falls latest show truly they had never been more spectacular certainly not in his life and from all that he could gather from the records at no point in the past either a plateau perhaps originally some sort of vast high plaza in the nameless city kilometres across was being slowly revealed by the furiously tumbling waters as they exposed what was by the general agreement of most experts and scholars the very centre of the buried city the falls in their centre section four or five kilometres across were in two stages now the first drop was of a hundred and twenty metres or so bringing the waters crashing and foaming and bursting down across the newly revealed plateau and surging among the maze of buildings protruding from that vast flat surface holes in the plateau many small several a hundred metres across or more drained to the darkened level beneath dropping the mass of water to the gorge floor through a tortuous complexity of bizarrely shaped buildings ramps and roadways some intact some canted over some undercut some altogether ruptured and displaced fallen down and swept away to lie jammed and caught against still greater structures and the shadowy bases of the mass of buildings towering above by now the mists had cleared away from nearly half the falls revealing the sites latest wonder the fountain building it was a great gorgebaselevel tower by the side of the new plateau it was still perfectly upright appeared to be made entirely from glass was a hundred and fifty metres tall and shaped like a kind of upwardly stretched sphere some chance configuration of the tunnels and hidden spaces of the falls upstream had contrived to send water up into it from underneath and at such an extremity of pressure that it came surging out in great muddily white fans and jets from all its spiralled levels of windows bursting with undiminished force even from its very summit showering the smaller buildings tubes ramps and lower water courses all around it with an incessant battering rain well sir poatas demanded will he this boyprince of yours will he come tyl loesp had sent the command to aclyns husband just two days earlier informing the fellow that he was to be the new mayor of the city of rasselle this would be a permanent position and he must bring his entire household with him from far kheretesuhr with the utmost dispatch on pain of losing both this onceinalifetime promotion and the regents regard oh i think he will tyl loesp said with a small smile the current emergency bilpier fourth of the heisp nariscene colony system is small solid coldcored habiformed to nariscene specifications within the last centieon dynamically o atmosphered one hundred per cent nariscene and seventyfour per cent surface bubblehived holse and ferbin were lounging in the sitting area of their generously proportioned suite of cabins within the hundredth idiot being kept fed and watered by a variety of subservient machines and entertained by images on wall screens they knew they were going to bilpier and the hive city of ischuer and the journey would take ten days though that was all theyd been told since director general shoum had secured their passage on a ship leaving only a day after she and ferbin had spoken ferbin had thought to ask the ship for more information hmm he said little the wiser i seek a man called xide hyrlis he continued do you know if he is there in this bilpier place i do not the hundredth idiot replied it is doubtful that he is you have preferential clearance to be conveyed to this person as requested with emphasis by the morthanveld tertiary hulian spine director general i can now confirm you are booked for onward travel from ischuer bilpier aboard the morthanveld vessel fasilyce upon waking a cat swellhull its destination is not a matter of public record ferbin and holse exchanged looks this was news you have no idea how long our journey will be after we leave bilpier ferbin asked given you travel aboard a cat swellhull your destination is unlikely to be within the heisp system the ship replied the cat swellhull is a longrange interstellar class ferbin nodded thoughtfully oh he said as though just thinking of something and can you get a message to a fellow named oramen house of hausk city of pourl the eighth sursamen that is within a mandated nariscene protectorate the ship interrupted smoothly and so subject to special clearance provisions regarding direct contact between individuals specific instructions forming part of your associated travel particulars mean that i may not even begin the relevant message process i am sorry ferbin sighed he went back to watching screenage of batlike aliens hunting flying twisty gossamery things in a towerless place of soaring yellowpink canyons beneath pastel clouds worth a try sir holse told him then returned to his own screen which showed a sort of mapwithdepth called a hologram depicting the courses of nariscene and associated spaceships the galaxy was linked like chain mail he thought it was all loops and circles and long joinedup threads and looked like that oldfashioned stuff some old knights from the deepest darkest shires and valleys still wore when they ventured to court even if they rarely polished it in case it got worn away the hundredth idiot settled smoothly into a valley between two huge dark bubbles kilometres across in a landscape that was nothing but more of the same the foam of enormous blisters covered threequarters of bilpiers surface enclosing continents smothering oceans arcing over mountain ranges and leaving only so much of the planets original swamps and jungles exposed as seemed fit to the nariscene aesthetic sense ferbin and holse were shown some impressive domes covering bulbously orange things that seemed to be half trees and half buildings they met a nariscene zamerin and had to listen to some nariscenic music for nearly an hour within a local day they were standing on some worryingly open webbing high over more giant orange buildingtrees at the lofty seam between two vast bubbles in the halfkilometrelong shadow of a sleekly bulbous spaceship nestling in the open air of the valley formed by the two giant blisters they were greeted by a morthanveld who introduced herself as liaison officer chilgitheri they were carried for nearly thirty days on the fasilyce upon waking it was a less pleasant journey than that on the nariscene ship they had to don suits to investigate the vast majority of the mostly waterfilled ship their quarters were smaller and worst of all the ship kept increasing its gravity field to prepare them for wherever it was they were going the morthanveld being aquatic seemed rather to scorn gravity but were gradually ramping up the apparent effect of that force felt on the ship to acclimatise their human guests they were the only nonmorthanveld aboard and as holse said they should have felt flattered to be so indulged but it was hard to feel much gratitude when your feet and back and almost everything else ached so much the fasilyce upon waking carried a dozen smaller ships arranged like rotund seeds around its waist and rear one of these was the cat slimhull now turning to reason its just sweetness it was this craft that took ferbin and holse on the final leg of their journey they shared two smallish cabins and would have spent almost all their time lying down if chilgitheri hadnt chivied them into standing up and walking around and even doing a few undemanding exercises in the ships impersonation of gravity which was still slowly increasing not increasing slowly enough holse observed groaning the now turning to reason its just sweetness bellied in towards a fractured broken land of rock and cinder this liaison officer chilgitheri informed them was what was left of the country of prille on the continent of sketevi on the planet bulthmaas in the chyme system as the ship closed with this wasteland of grey and brown the final increment of gravity that had settled like lead epaulets on the two sarl men lifted the morthanveld ships had deliberately made them experience a gravity field slightly greater than the one they would be stepping out into so that the real thing wouldnt feel quite so bad a mercy so small as to be microscopic holse muttered better than nothing chilgitheri informed them count your blessings gentlemen come on they found themselves on the flat fused base of a great freshlooking crater outside the ships rotated lower access bulge the air smelled of burning a cold keen wind swirled in the depressions circular base raising pillars and veils of ash and dust the atmosphere caught at their throats and the air was shaken by what sounded like continual thunder from far away a small bulbous thing like a carriage compartment made mostly of glass had ridden the access bulge with them as it had cycled round to present them to this ghastly place ferbin had wondered if this thing was some sort of guarding device thankfully it was merely their means of conveyance they would not have to walk any distance in this awful crushing grip smell that air chilgitheri told them as they settled into the welcoming couches of the transparent device it closed its doors and the sounds from outside ceased youll smell nothing unfiltered for a while but that is the authentic scent of bulthmaas it stinks holse said yes there may still be a few of the later widespectrum pathogens around but they ought not to affect you ferbin and holse looked at each other neither had any idea what pathogens were but they didnt like the sound of them the little bubble vehicle lifted silently and they crossed the glassy surface of the crater to a construction made of thick metal plates jutting out from the jumbled debris of the lower crater wall like some monstrous iron flower growing from that riven deathgrey geography a set of ponderously massive doors swung open and the dark tunnels swallowed them they saw war machines waiting darkly in alcoves lines of dim lights stretching away down shadowy sidetunnels and ahead the first in a succession of enormous metal shutters which opened before them and closed behind a few times they saw pale creatures which looked vaguely like men but which were too small squat and stunted to be human as they understood the term they passed one nariscene floating in a complex metallic harness bristling with extra appendages that might have been weapons then they began descending a spiralled ramp like a hollow spring screwing its way into the bowels of the world they halted eventually in a large gloomy chamber crossbraced with thick struts it was almost filled with parked vehicles squashed gnarled misshapenlooking things their little madeofnearnothing car settled amongst them like a downy seed blown amongst lumps of clinker time to use those legs chilgitheri cried cheerfully the cars doors swung open the two men unfolded themselves from the transparent conveyance holse hoisted the two small bags of clothing they had with them and groaned as they made their way to another opening door and up up a short narrow ramp to a smaller dimly lit chamber where the air smelled stale yet with a medicinal tang the ceiling was so low they had to walk and stand slightly stooped which made the effects of the high gravity even worse holse dumped both bags on the floor at his feet one of the short squat men sat in a chair behind a metal desk dressed in a dark grey uniform a nariscene in one of the complicatedlooking harnesses floated off to one side behind and above the mans shoulder seemingly regarding them the squashed excuse for a human creature made a series of noises you are welcome the nariscene translated my responsibility and that of the morthanveld ends here chilgitheri told the two sarl men you are now in nariscene jurisdiction and that of their client species here the xolpe good luck to you take care goodbye ferbin and holse both bade her well the morthanveld turned and floated away down the narrow ramp ferbin looked round for a seat but the only one in the chamber was occupied by the man behind the metal desk some papers issued from a slot in it the man pulled them out checked and folded them bashed them with bits of metal and then pushed them across the desk towards the two sarl men these are your papers the nariscene said you will carry them at all times their papers were covered in tiny alien symbols the only thing either man could recognise was a small monochrome representation of their own face more sounds from the squashed little man you will wait the nariscene told them here this way to wait follow me more cramped corridors took them to a small dimly lit room with four bunk beds and nothing else the nariscene closed the door which made loud locking noises holse checked it was locked a smaller door at the other end of the cell gave access to a tiny toilet compartment they took the two lower bunks and lay there breathing hard grateful to have the weight off their legs and backs they had to lie folded the bunk beds were too short for them to stretch out a greyblue suit of clothes hung on the end of each bunk these were their uniforms the nariscene had told them they had to be worn at all times what sort of place is this sir a terrible one holse id formed that impression myself sir try to sleep holse its all we can do it may be our only escape from this shithole holse said and turned his face to the wall chilgitheri had not been forthcoming regarding what would happen after they were delivered here this was where xide hyrlis ought to be and their request to see him had been forwarded to the relevant authorities but whether they would be allowed to see him and how and even if they would leave this world she had confessed she did not know ferbin closed his eyes wishing he was almost anywhere else why are you here the nariscene translated the creature talking to them might have been the one whod shown them to their cramped quarters they had no idea introductions might have been in order ferbin thought but obviously things were done differently here he and holse were dressed in the uniforms they had been given the uniforms were both too short and too wide for the sarl men making them look ridiculous and they were in another small chamber facing another small stump of a man behind another metal desk though at least this time they had chairs to sit in we are here to see a man called xide hyrlis ferbin told the nariscene and the small pale manthing there is no one of that name here what there is no one of that name here that cannot be true ferbin protested the morthanveld who brought us here assured us this is where hyrlis is they could be mistaken the nariscene suggested without waiting for the man to speak i suspect they are not ferbin said icily kindly be so good as to tell mr hyrlis that a prince of the sarl the surviving son of his old good friend the late king nerieth hausk of the eighth sursamen wishes to see him having travelled amongst the stars all the way from that great world at the express favour with emphasis of our friends the morthanveld with the specific mission of meeting with him as affirmed by director general shoum herself see to it if you would the nariscene appeared to translate at least some of this the man spoke followed by the nariscene state full name of the person you wish to see full name ferbin had had time to think of this on many occasions since hed formed this plan back on the eighth xide hyrlis full name had been a chant amongst some of the children at court almost a mantra for them he hadnt forgotten stafllepoortsa xide ozoal hyrlis dam pappens he said the stunted man grunted then studied a screen set into his desk its dull green glow lit his face he said something and the nariscene said your request will be transmitted through the appropriate channels you will return to your quarters to wait i shall report your lack of proper respect and urgency to mr hyrlis when i see him ferbin told the nariscene firmly as he got painfully to his feet he felt absurd in his illfitting uniform but tried to summon what dignity he could tell me your name no there is no mr hyrlis you will return to your quarters to wait no mr hyrlis dont be ridiculous could be an issue of rank sir holse said also rising and grimacing you will return to your quarters to wait very well i shall inform general hyrlis you will return to your quarters to wait or field marshal hyrlis or whatever rank he may have attained you will return to your quarters to wait they were awoken in the middle of the night both of them from dreams of weight and crushing and burial theyd been fed through a hatch in the door not long before the light in their room had dimmed the soup had been almost inedible you will come with us the nariscene said two of the squat pale uniformed men stood behind it holding rifles ferbin and holse dressed in their preposterous uniforms bring possessions the nariscene told them holse picked up both bags a small wheeled vehicle took them a short way up another spiral ramp more doors and dimly lit tunnels brought them to a greater space still dark where people and machines moved and a train sat humming poised between two dark holes at either end of the chamber before they could board the floor beneath their feet shook and a shudder ran throughout the huge chamber causing people to look up at the dark ceiling lights swayed and dust drifted down ferbin wondered what sort of cataclysmic explosion would be felt so far beneath this much rock embark here the nariscene told them pointing at a shuttered entrance into one of the trains cylindrical carriages they heaved themselves up a ramp into a cramped windowless compartment the nariscene floated inside with them and the door rolled back down there was just enough room for them to sit on the floor between tall boxes and crates a single round ball in the ceiling guarded by a little metal cage gave out a weak steady yellow light the nariscene hovered over one of the crates where are we going ferbin asked are we going to see xide hyrlis we do not know the nariscene said they sat breathing the stale lifeless air for a while then there was a lurch and some muffled clanking as the train moved off how long will this take ferbin asked the nariscene we do not know it repeated the train rattled and buzzed around them and they both soon fell asleep again to be woken from the depths once more confused and disoriented and hustled out knees and backs aching down a ramp and into another squat vehicle which took them and the accompanying nariscene along yet more tunnels and down another spiral to a large chamber where a hundred or more tanks of liquid each twice their height glowed blue and green in the general darkness each tank held the bodies of a halfdozen or so of the short stubbylooking men all quite naked they looked asleep a mask over each face hoses snaking up to the surface of the tanks their bodies were quite hairless and many had been badly injured some were missing limbs some had obvious puncture wounds and others displayed extensive areas of burned skin ferbin and holse were so fascinated looking at this unnerving ghoulish display that it was some time before they realised they appeared to be alone the little wheeled vehicle had disappeared and seemingly taken the nariscene with it ferbin walked over to the nearest of the tanks close up it was possible to see that there was a gentle current in the pale slightly cloudy liquid tiny bubbles rose from the floor of the tank and headed to the sealed caps of the cylinders dyou think theyre dead ferbin breathed not wearing those masks holse replied they look a bit like you did sir when the oct were healing you perhaps they are being preserved for something ferbin said or medicined holse suggested theres not one without an injury ive seen yet though many seem to be healing you could say were healing them someone said behind them they both turned ferbin recognised xide hyrlis immediately he had barely changed at all given that nearly a dozen longyears had passed this ought to have seemed strange though it was only later ferbin realised this xide hyrlis was a tall man by the standards of the dwarfish people hereabouts though he was still shorter than ferbin or holse he was denseseeming somehow and dark with a broad face a large mouth with teeth that were both too few and too wide and bright piercingly bluepurple eyes his eyes had always fascinated ferbin as a child they had an extra transparent membrane that swept across them meaning that he never had to blink never needed to stop seeing the world however briefly from the moment he woke to the moment he slept and he did little enough of that his hair was black and long and kept in a tidy ponytail he had a lot of facial hair neatly trimmed he wore a bettercut version of the grey uniform worn by most of the people theyd seen so far xide hyrlis ferbin said nodding it is good to see you again i am prince ferbin son of king hausk good to see you again prince hyrlis said he looked to one side and seemed to address somebody they could not see the son of my old friend king hausk of the sarl of the eighth sursamen hyrlis returned his attention to ferbin and said you are much grown prince how are things on the eighth holse glanced at ferbin who was staring straight at hyrlis ferbin was a hiphigh child last time i saw him hyrlis added to whatever imaginary being was at his side there really was nobody else anywhere near them and nothing obvious that he could be addressing i have much to tell you hyrlis ferbin said little of it good but first tell me how i ought to address you what rank do you hold hyrlis smiled he glanced to one side a good question dont you think he looked at ferbin adviser you might say or supreme commander its so hard to know choose one sir holse suggested theres a good gent allow me ferbin said coldly as he looked at holse who was smiling innocently to present my servant choubris holse mr holse hyrlis said nodding sir and sir will do hyrlis said thoughtfully its what everybody else calls me he caught some sudden tension from ferbin prince i know youll only ever have called your father sir since your majority however humour me in this i am a king of sorts in these parts and command more power than ever your father did he grinned unless hes taken over the whole shellworld eh he turned his head again for yes such sursamen is those of you slow to reference he said to his unseen companion as ferbin still holse thought looking a little glassyeyed said as i say sir i have much to relate hyrlis nodded at the bodies bobbing gently in the tanks behind them captured enemy he said being kept alive partially repaired we wash clear their minds and they become our spies or assassins or human bombs or vectors of disease come well find you a place to flop and better clothes you look like twig insects in those they followed him to one of the opensided runabouts and as they did dark figures left various shadows all about them dissociating from the darkness like parts of it humans in some nearblack dark camouflage suits and armed with uglylooking guns ferbin and holse both jerked to a stop as they saw the four shadowy figures closing swiftly silently in on them but hyrlis without even looking round just waved one hand as he took the driving seat of the little wheeled vehicle and said my guard dont worry jump on once he knew the dark figures were no threat ferbin was quite pleased to see them hyrlis must have been talking to them for some reason that was a relief xide hyrlis kept a very fine table beneath the kilometres of mountain rock the chamber was domeshaped the servants young men and girls glided silently the stone table they sat around was loaded with highly colourful and exotic foodstuffs and a bewildering variety of bottles the food was entirely delicious for all its alien nature and the drink copious ferbin waited until they had finished eating before telling his story hyrlis heard ferbin out asking one or two questions along the way at the end he nodded you have my sincere sympathies prince i am even sorrier at the manner of your fathers passing than at the fact of it nerieth was a warrior and both expected and deserved a warriors death what youve described is a murder both cowardly and cruel thank you hyrlis ferbin said he looked down sniffing loudly hyrlis did not seem to notice he was staring at his wine glass i remember tyl loesp he said he was silent for some moments then shook his head if he harboured such treachery then he fooled me too he looked to one side again and do you watch there he asked quietly this time there was definitely nobody present for him to be talking to the four darkly camouflaged guards had been dismissed when theyd entered hyrlis private quarters and the servants had just minutes earlier been told to stay outside the dining chamber until summoned is that part of the entertainment hyrlis said in the same quiet voice is the kings murder recorded he looked back to ferbin and holse choubris tried to exchange looks with ferbin but the other man was staring glassyeyed at their host again holse wasnt having it excuse me sir he said to hyrlis from the corner of his eye he could see ferbin trying to attract his attention well the hell with it might i ask who youre talking to when you do that holse ferbin hissed he smiled insincerely at hyrlis my servant is impertinent sir no he is inquisitive prince hyrlis said with a small smile in a sense holse i do not know he said gently and it is just possible that i am addressing nobody at all however i strongly suspect that i am talking to quite a number of people holse frowned he looked hard in the direction hyrlis had directed his latest aside hyrlis smiled and waved one hand through the air as though dispelling smoke they are not physically present holse they are or i suppose i must allow they might be watching at a very considerable remove via spybots edust nanoware whatever you want to call it i might call it any or all sir im none the wiser at those words holse if you cant conduct yourself like a gentleman ferbin said firmly youll eat with the other servants ferbin looked at hyrlis i may have been too indulgent with him sir i apologise on his behalf and my own no apology required prince hyrlis said smoothly and this is my table not yours id have holse here for what you call his impertinence in any event i am surrounded by too many people unwilling to call me on anything at all a dissident voice is welcome ferbin sat back insulted i believe that i am watched holse hyrlis said by devices too small to be seen with the human eye even ones like mine which are quite keen if not as keen as they once were enemy spies sir holse asked he glanced at ferbin who looked away ostentatiously no holse hyrlis said spies sent by my own people holse nodded though with a deep frown hyrlis looked at ferbin prince your own matter is of course of far greater importance however i think i ought to digress a little here to explain myself and my situation ferbin gave a curt nod when i was with you amongst you on the eighth advising your father ferbin hyrlis said glancing to the prince but generally addressing both men i was employed at the behest of the nariscene by the culture the mongrel panhuman and machine civilisation which is one of what you term the optimae those civilisations in the first rank of the unsublimed nonelder groupings i was an agent for the part of the culture called contact which deals with foreign affairs you might say contact is charged with discovering and interacting with other civilisations which are not yet part of the galactic community i was not then with the more rarefied intelligence and espionage part of contact coyly called special circumstances though i know that sc thought at the time the specific part of contact i represented was arguably encroaching on their territory hyrlis smiled thinly even galaxyspanning anarchist utopias of stupefying fullspectrum civilisational power have turf wars within their unacknowledged militaries hyrlis sighed i did later become part of special circumstances a decision i look back on now with more regret than pride his smile did indeed look sad when you leave the culture and people do all the time you are made aware of certain responsibilities you are deemed to have should you venture into the kind of civilisation that contact might be interested in i was missioned to do what i did by contact which had modelled the situation on the eighth exhaustively so that when i passed on some strategic plan to king hausk or suggested sabots and rifling to the royal armourers it was with a very good and highly reliable idea of what the effects would be in theory a reasonably wellread culture citizen could do the same with no control no backup and no idea what they were really doing or worse with a very good idea they might want to be king or emperor or whatever and their knowledge would give them a chance of succeeding hyrlis waved one hand its an exaggerated concern in my opinion knowledge in the culture is cheap beyond measuring however the ruthlessness required to use that knowledge proficiently in a less forgiving society is almost unheard of nevertheless the result is that when you leave the culture to come to a place like this or the eighth you are watched devices are sent to spy on you and make sure youre not getting up to any mischief and if a person does get up to mischief sir holse asked why they stop you mr holse they use the devices theyve sent to spy or they send people or other devices to undo what youve done and as a last resort they kidnap you and bring you back to be told off hyrlis shrugged when you leave sc as i did further precautions are taken they take away some of the gifts they originally gave you certain abilities are reduced or removed altogether so that you have fewer advantages over the locals and the surveillance is more intense though even less noticeable hyrlis looked to the side once more i trust my evenhandedness is appreciated here i am generous to a fault he looked back at the two men i understand most people like to pretend that such oversight doesnt exist that it isnt happening to them i take a different view i address those i know must be watching me so now you know and i hope understand were you worried i was mad not at all ferbin protested immediately as holse said it did occur sir as youd expect hyrlis smiled he swirled some wine around in his glass and watched himself doing so oh i may well be mad mad to be here mad to be still involved with the business of war but at least in this i am not mad i know i am watched and i will let those who watch me know that i know we do ferbin said glancing at holse understand good hyrlis said casually he leaned forward putting his elbows on the table and clasping his hands under his chin now back to you you have come a very long way prince i assume to see me indeed that i have and with more intended than simply bringing me the news that my old friend nerieth has been murdered honoured though i am to hear from a real person rather than a news service indeed ferbin said and pulled himself up in his seat as best he could i seek your help good hyrlis i see hyrlis nodded looking thoughtful ferbin said can you will you help in what way will you return to the eighth with me to help avenge my fathers murder hyrlis sat back he shook his head i cannot prince i am needed here committed here i work for the nariscene and even if i wanted to i could not return to sursamen in the near or medium future are you saying you do not even want to ferbin asked not hiding his displeasure prince i am sorry to hear your father is dead sorrier still to hear of the manner of it you have said so sir ferbin told him so i say it again your father was a friend of mine for a short while and i respected him greatly however it is not my business to right wrongs occurring deep inside a distant shellworld ferbin stood up i see i misunderstood you sir he said i was told you are a good and honourable man i find i have been misinformed holse stood up too though slowly thinking that if ferbin was to storm out though god knew to where he had best accompany him hear me out prince hyrlis said reasonably i wish you well and tyl loesp and his coconspirators an undignified end but i am unable to help and unwilling ferbin said almost spitting yours is not my fight prince it should be the fight of all who believe in justice oh really prince hyrlis said amused listen to yourself better than listening to you and your insulting complacency hyrlis looked puzzled what exactly did you expect me to do something anything not nothing not just sit there and smirk and why arent you doing something ferbin hyrlis asked still reasonable might you not have been more effective staying on the eighth rather than coming all this way to see me i am no warrior i know that ferbin said bitterly i have not the skills or disposition and i have not the guile to go back to the court and face tyl loesp and pretend i did not see what i did to plot and plan behind a smile id have drawn my sword or put my hands on his throat the instant i saw him and id have come off the worse i know that i need help and i came here to ask you for it if you will not help me kindly let us go from here and do whatever you might be able and willing to do to speed my journey to my sibling djan seriy i can only pray that she has somehow escaped infection by this cultural disease of uncaring prince hyrlis sighed will you please sit down there is more to discuss i might help you in other ways plus we should talk about your sister hyrlis waved one hand at ferbins seat please i shall sit sir ferbin told him doing so but i am grievously disappointed holse sat too he was glad of this the wine was very good and it would be a criminal shame to have to abandon it hyrlis resumed his earlier pose hands under chin a small frown creased his brow why would tyl loesp do what he has done i care not ferbin said angrily that he did it is all that matters hyrlis shook his head i must disagree prince if you are to have any chance of righting this wrong youd be well advised to know what motivates your enemy power of course ferbin exclaimed he wanted the throne and hell have it the moment hes had my young brother killed but why now why not ferbin said clenched fists hammering at the unforgiving stone of the great table my father had done all the work the battles were all won or as good as thats when a coward strikes when the glory might be stolen without the bravery that afforded it still it is often easier to be the second in command prince hyrlis said the throne is a lonely place and the nearer you are to it the clearer you see that there are advantages to having great power without ultimate responsibility especially when you know that even the king does not have ultimate power that there are always powers above you say tyl loesp was trusted rewarded valued respected why would he risk that for the last notch of a power he knows is still enchained with limitations ferbin sat boiling with frustration but had resolved not to say anything this time this only gave occasion for hyrlis to look to the side and say quietly do you know do you look there are you allow ferbin could stand it no longer will you stop talking to these phantoms he shouted springing up again this time so quickly his chair toppled over holse having taken the opportunity to sip from his glass at what had seemed a handily quiet moment had to gulp and stand quickly too wiping his mouth with his sleeve these imagined demons have stolen what wits you ever had sir hyrlis shook his head would that they were imaginary prince and if there are similar systems of observation within sursamen they might hold one key to your difficulty what in the world are you talking about ferbin hissed through clenched teeth hyrlis sighed again please prince do sit down again no no ill stand he said changing his mind lets all stand and let me show you something please come with me there is more to explain the airship was a giant dark blister riding the poisoned air above a still glowing battlefield they had been brought here in hyrlis own small svelte air vehicle which had lifted silently from the bottom of another giant crater and flown whispering through clouds and smoke then clearer weather chasing a ruddy sunset into a night whose far horizon was edged with tiny sporadic flashes of yellowwhite light below them rings and circles of dull and fading red covered the dark undulating land the airship was bright all strung with lights lit from every side and covered in reflective markings it hung above the lividbruised land like an admonition the little aircraft docked in a broad deck slung underneath the giant ships main body various other craft were arriving and departing all the time arriving full of injured soldiers accompanied by a few medical staff and departing empty save for returning medics quiet moans filled the warm smokescented air hyrlis led them via some spiralled steps to a ward full of coffinlike beds each containing a pale squat unconscious figure holse looked at the lifelesslooking people and felt envious at least they didnt have to stand up walk around and climb stairs in this awful gravity you know there is a theory hyrlis said quietly walking amongst the gently glowing coffinbeds ferbin and holse at his rear the four darkdressed guards somewhere nearby unseen that all that we experience as reality is just a simulation a kind of hallucination that has been imposed upon us ferbin said nothing holse assumed that hyrlis was addressing them rather than his demons or whatever they were so said we have a sect back home with a roughly similar point of view sir its a not uncommon position hyrlis said he nodded at the unconscious bodies all around them these sleep and have dreams inflicted upon them for various reasons they will believe while they dream that the dream is reality we know it is not but how can we know that our own reality is the last the final one how do we know there is not a still greater reality external to our own into which we might awake still holse said whats a chap to do eh sir life needs living no matter what our station in it it does but thinking of these things affects how we live that life there are those who hold that statistically we must live in a simulation the chances are too extreme for this not to be true there are always people who can convince themselves of near enough anything seems to me sir holse said i believe them to be wrong in any case hyrlis said you have been thinking on this i take it then asked ferbin he meant to sound arch i have prince hyrlis said continuing to lead them through the host of sleeping injured and i base my argument on morality do you now ferbin said he did not need to affect disdain hyrlis nodded if we assume that all we have been told is as real as what we ourselves experience in other words that history with all its torturings massacres and genocides is true then if it is all somehow under the control of somebody or some thing must not those running that simulation be monsters how utterly devoid of decency pity and compassion would they have to be to allow this to happen and keep on happening under their explicit control because so much of history is precisely this gentlemen they had approached the edge of the huge space where slanted downlooking windows allowed a view of the pocked landscape beneath hyrlis swept his arm to indicate both the bodies in their coffinbeds and the patchily glowing land below war famine disease genocide death in a million different forms often painful and protracted for the poor individual wretches involved what god would so arrange the universe to predispose its creations to experience such suffering or be the cause of it in others what master of simulations or arbitrator of a game would set up the initial conditions to the same pitiless effect god or programmer the charge would be the same that of nearinfinitely sadistic cruelty deliberate premeditated barbarism on an unspeakably horrific scale hyrlis looked expectantly at them you see he said by this reasoning we must after all be at the most base level of reality or at the most exalted however one wishes to look at it just as reality can blithely exhibit the most absurd coincidences that no credible fiction could convince us of so only reality produced ultimately by matter in the raw can be so unthinkingly cruel nothing able to think nothing able to comprehend culpability justice or morality could encompass such purposefully invoked savagery without representing the absolute definition of evil it is that unthinkingness that saves us and condemns us too of course we are as a result our own moral agents and there is no escape from that responsibility no appeal to a higher power that might be said to have artificially constrained or directed us hyrlis rapped on the clear material separating them from the view of the dark battlefield we are information gentlemen all living things are however we are lucky enough to be encoded in matter itself not running in some abstracted system as patterns of particles or standing waves of probability holse had been thinking about this of course sir your god could just be a bastard he suggested or these simulationeers if its them responsible that is possible hyrlis said a smile fading those above and beyond us might indeed be evil personified but it is a standpoint of some despair and all this pertains how exactly ferbin asked his feet were sore and he was growing tired of what seemed to him like pointless speculation not to mention something dangerously close to philosophy a field of human endeavour he had encountered but fleetingly through various exasperated tutors though long enough to have formed the unshakeable impression that its principal purpose was to prove that one equalled zero black was white and educated men could speak through their bottoms i am watched hyrlis said perhaps your home is watched prince it is possible that tiny machines similar to those that observe me spy upon your people too the death of your father might have been overseen by more eyes than you thought were present and if it was watched once it can be watched again because only base reality cannot be fully replayed anything transmitted can be recorded and usually is ferbin stared at him recorded he said horrified my fathers murder it is possible no more hyrlis told him by whom the oct the nariscene the morthanveld hyrlis suggested perhaps the culture perhaps anybody else with the means which would include some dozens of involved civilisations at least and this would be done holse suggested by the same unseen agents that you address from time to time sir by things most similar hyrlis agreed unseen ferbin said contemptuously unheard untouched unsmelled untasted undetected in a word figmented oh we are often profoundly affected by unseeably small things prince hyrlis smiled wistfully i have advised rulers for whom the greatest military service i could perform had nothing to do with strategy tactics or weapons technology it was simply to inform them of and persuade them to accept the germ theory of disease and infection believing that we are surrounded by microscopic entities that profoundly and directly affect the fates of individuals and through them nations has been the first step in the ascendancy of many a great ruler ive lost count of the wars ive seen won more by medics and engineers than mere soldiery such infective beings too small to see assuredly exist prince and believe me so do those designed made and controlled by powers beyond your grasping ferbin opened his mouth to say something but hyrlis went on your own faith holds the same idea centrally prince do you not believe that the worldgod sees everything how do you think it does that ferbin felt baulked tripped up it is a god he said blustering if you treat it as such then such it is hyrlis said reasonably however it is unarguably a member of a longdeclining species with a clearly traceable galactic lineage and evolutionary line it is another corporeal being prince and the fact that your people have chosen to call it a god does not mean that it is particularly powerful allseeing even within the limitations of sursamen or indeed sane ferbin wanted to speak but hyrlis held up one hand no one knows why xinthians inhabit shellworld cores prince theories include them being sent there by their own kind as a punishment or to isolate them because they have become infectiously diseased or mad some speculate theyre there because the individual xinthians concerned are simply fascinated by shellworlds another guess has it that each seeks somehow to defend its chosen shellworld though against what nobody knows and the truth is that tensile aeronathaurs are not in themselves especially powerful creatures and seem to scorn the kind of highlevel weaponry that might compensate for that lack all in all not much of a god prince we claim it as our god sir ferbin said frostily not as some mythical universal creator he glanced at holse looking for support or at least acknowledgement holse wasnt about to get involved in any theological arguments he looked serious and nodded hoping this would do hyrlis just smiled so you are saying we have no privacy ferbin said feeling angry and dismayed oh you may have hyrlis shrugged perhaps nobody watches you including your god but if others do and you can persuade them to share that recording then you will have a weapon to use against tyl loesp but sir holse said given such fantastical apparatus might not anything and everything be faked it might but people can be quite good at spotting what has been faked and the effect on people who do not know that anything can be faked is usually profound revealed at the right moment such a recording if it exists may so visibly shake tyl loesp or his coconspirators that their immediate reaction leaves no doubt in the unprejudiced mind that they are guilty and how might we discover whether such a recording exists ferbin asked it still all sounded absurdly farfetched to him even in this entire hierarchical realm of farfetched world beyond farfetched world it may be as simple as just asking the right people hyrlis said he was still standing beside the downsloped windows something flashed white far away on the dark plain below briefly illuminating one side of his face some part of the initial illumination remained fading slowly to yellow find someone sympathetic in the culture and ask them your sister prince would seem an obvious choice and being in special circumstances she would stand a good chance of being able to find out the truth even if it is hidden and even if it is not the culture itself that is doing the observing look to your sister prince she may hold your answer given your own refusal to help i have little choice sir hyrlis shrugged well family should stick together he said casually another flash lit up his face and away in the distance a great rolling rising glowing cloud of yellow surged with an unstoppable slowness into the night air the orangeruddy light from the huge climbing cloud lit up distant hills and mountains rubbing them bloodcoloured you might have imparted this information in your own quarters ferbin told the man why bring us here amongst these wretches and above this savagery to tell us something you might have told over dinner so that we might appropriately observe prince hyrlis said he nodded at the landscape below we look down upon all this and perhaps are looked down on in turn it is entirely possible that everything we see here is only taking place at all so that it may be observed meaning what sir holse asked when ferbin didnt also their host looked as though he had no mind to add any more he just gazed languidly out through the slanted windows over the red underlit clouds and the sparkinfested darkness of the cratered landscape beneath hyrlis turned to holse meaning that this whole conflict this entire war here is manufactured it is prosecuted for the viewing benefit of the nariscene who have always regarded waging war as one of the highest and most noble arts their place among the involveds of the galactic community sadly precludes them from taking part in meaningful conflicts themselves any more but they have the licence the means and the will to cause other mentored client civilisations to war amongst themselves at their behest the conflict we observe here in which i am proud to play a part is one such artificial dispute instigated and maintained for and by the nariscene for no other reason than that they might observe the proceedings and draw vicarious satisfaction from them ferbin made a snorting noise holse looked sceptical that really true sir he asked i mean as acknowledged by all concerned hyrlis smiled a great distant rumbling roaring sound seemed to make the airship shiver on the wind oh you will find many a superficially convincing excuse and casus belli and there are given and seemingly accepted justifications everything modelled to provide pretexts and keep people like the culture from intervening to stop the fun but it is all dressing disguise a feint the truth is as i have said depend on it and you are proud to take part in what you effectively describe as a travesty a showwar a dishonourable and cruel charade for decadent and unfeeling alien powers ferbin said trying to sound and to some degree succeeding in sounding contemptuous yes prince hyrlis said reasonably i do what i can to make this war as humane in its inhumanity as i can and in any case i always know that however bad it may be its sheer unnecessary awfulness at least helps guarantee that we are profoundly not in some designed and overseen universe and so have escaped the demeaning and demoralising fate of existing solely within some simulation ferbin looked at him for a few moments that is absurd he said nevertheless hyrlis said casually then stretched his arms out and rolled his head as though tired lets go back shall we the nariscene ship hence the fortress a venerable cometclass star cruiser lifted from a deep ravine where a poisoned stream of black water moved like liquefied shadow the craft rose above the rim of the fissure into light airs moving quietly across a landscape of livid sands beneath a softlooking grey overcast it accelerated into the darker skies above finding space within minutes the ship carried a cargo of several million human souls held petrified within a variety of nanoscale storage matrices and two human males the gravity was back to what the nariscene regarded as normal and so was much more acceptable to both men they had to share one small cabin extemporised for human occupation from some storage space but were uncomplaining being mostly just thankful to be away from the oppressive gravity of bulthmaas and the unsettling presence of xide hyrlis they had stayed only two more days and nights as far as such terms meant anything in the warren of deeply buried caverns and tunnels where theyd been kept hyrlis had appeared casually unbothered when they professed a desire to be away as soon as possible after hed told ferbin he was unable to help the morning after hed taken them to the great airship full of the wounded hyrlis summoned them to a hemispherical chamber perhaps twenty metres in diameter where an enormous map of what looked like nearly half of the planet was displayed showing what appeared to be a single vast continent punctuated by a dozen or so small seas fed by short rivers running from jagged mountain ranges the map bulged towards the unseen ceiling like a vast balloon lit from inside by hundreds of colours and tens of thousands of tiny glittering symbols some gathered together in groups large and small others strung out in speckled lines and yet more scattered individually hyrlis looked down on this vast display from a wide balcony halfway up the wall talking quietly with a dozen or so uniformed human figures who responded in even more hushed tones as they murmured away the map itself changed rotating and tipping to bring different parts of the landscape to the fore and moving various collections of the glittering symbols about often developing quite different patterns and then halting while hyrlis and the other men huddled and conferred before returning to its earlier configuration theres a nariscene vessel scheduled to call in a couple of days time he told ferbin and holse though his gaze was still directed at the great bulge of the dully glowing display where various numbers of the glittering symbols which ferbin assumed represented military units were moving about it was clear now that some of the units coloured greyblue and shown fuzzily and in less detail than the rest must represent the enemy itll take you to syaungun hyrlis said thats a morthanveld nestworld one of the main transfer ports between the morthanveld and the culture his gaze roamed the huge globe never resting should find a ship therell take you to the culture i am grateful ferbin said stiffly he found it difficult to be anything other than formally polite with hyrlis after being rejected by him though hyrlis himself seemed barely to notice or care the display halted then flickered showing various endpatterns in succession hyrlis shook his head and waved one arm the great round map flicked back to its starting state again and there was much sighing and stretching amongst the uniformed advisers or generals clustered around him holse nodded at the map all this sir is it a game hyrlis smiled still looking at the great glowing bubble of the display yes he said its all a game does it start from what you might call reality though holse asked stepping close to the balconys edge obviously fascinated his face lit by the great glowing hemisphere ferbin said nothing he had given up trying to get his servant to be more discreet from what we call reality as far as we know it yes hyrlis said he turned to look at holse then we use it to try out possible dispositions promising strategies and various tactics looking for those that offer the best results assuming the enemy acts and reacts as we predict and will they be doing the same thing as regards you undoubtably might you not simply play the game against each other then sir holse suggested cheerily dispensing with all the actual slaughtering and maiming and destruction and desolating and such like like in the old days when two great armies met and counting themselves about equal called up champions one from each their individual combat counting by earlier agreement as determining the whole result so sending many a frightened soldier safely back to his farm and loved ones hyrlis laughed the sound was obviously as startling and unusual to the generals and advisers on the balcony as it was to ferbin and holse id play if they would hyrlis said and accept the verdict gladly regardless he smiled at ferbin then to holse said but no matter whether we are all in a still greater game this one here before us is at a cruder grain than that which it models entire battles and sometimes therefore wars can hinge on a jammed gun a failed battery a single shell being dud or an individual soldier suddenly turning and running or throwing himself on a grenade hyrlis shook his head that cannot be fully modelled not reliably not consistently that you need to play out in reality or the most detailed simulation you have available which is effectively the same thing holse smiled sadly matter eh sir matter hyrlis nodded and anyway where would be the fun in just playing a game our hosts could do that themselves no they need us to play out the greater result nothing else will do we ought to feel privileged to be so valuable so irreplaceable we may all be mere particles but we are each fundamental hyrlis sounded close to laughing again then his tone and whole demeanour changed as he looked to one side where no one was standing and dont think yourselves any better he said quietly ferbin tsked loudly and turned his head away as hyrlis continued what is the sweet and easy continuance of all things cultural if not based on the cosy knowledge of good works done in ones name far away eh he nodded at nobody and nothing visible what do you say my loyal viewers aye to that contact and sc they play your own real games and let the trillions of pampered sleepers inhabiting all those great rolling cradles we call orbitals run smoothly through the otherly scary night unvexed youre obviously busy ferbin said matteroffactly to hyrlis may we leave you now hyrlis smiled yes prince get to your own dreams leave us with ours by all means be gone ferbin and holse turned to go holse hyrlis called choubris and ferbin both turned to look back sir holse said holse if i offered you the chance to stay here and general for me play this great game would you take it it would be for riches and for power both here and now and elsewhere and elsewhen in better less blasted places than this sorry cinder dyou take it eh holse laughed course not sir you fun me sure you must of course hyrlis said grinning he looked at ferbin who was standing looking confused and angry at his servants side your man is no fool prince hyrlis told him ferbin stood up straight in the grinding pulling gravity i did not think him so hyrlis nodded naturally well i too must travel very soon if i dont see you before you go let me wish you both a good journey and a fair arrival your wishes flatter us sir ferbin said insincerely hyrlis was indeed not there to see them off when they departed over thirteen long days during which ferbin and holse were left to themselves by the ship and its crew and spent most of their time either sleeping or playing games the star cruiser hence the fortress took them to the nariscene globular transfer facility of sterut a morthanveld tramp ship with no name just a long serial number they both forgot picked them up from there on one of its semiregular semicircular routes and took them onwards to the great morthanveld nestworld of syaungun dispatches oramen was standing by the window looking out over the city from his chambers in the palace in pourl the morning was bright and misty and neguste singing noisily but tunelessly was next door running him a bath when fanthile rapped at the door neguste who patently believed that volume was the ideal compensation for being tonedeaf didnt hear the door so oramen answered it himself he and fanthile stood out on the apartment balcony while oramen read a note the palace secretary had brought rasselle he said the deldeyn capital fanthile nodded your mothers husband has been ordered there as mayor they will arrive during the next few days oramen let out a deep breath and looked first at fanthile and then out at the city canals glinted in the distance and banners of steam and smoke rose from a scattered forest of factory chimneys you know that tyl loesp suggests i go to the falls of the hyengzhar he said not looking at the palace secretary i have heard sir they are a few days from rasselle im told i would be in charge of the excavations oramen sighed tyl loesp believes it would help the bringing together of the people and institutions of the ninth and the eighth that my presence there would help the effort to recruit more sarl to the great project of the investigation of the mysterious ruins there also it would give me a serious and proper purpose in life so improving my reputation with the people you are the prince regent sir the palace secretary said that might be thought reputation enough by some by some perhaps but these are changed days fanthile perhaps they are even the new age that my father talked about when feats of practical business matter more than those of arms there are reports that certain far dependencies dispute with various of tyl loesps decrees sir werreber already wants to form a new army to help instil some provincial discipline the gentleman we speak of would be wise not to disband all the forces tyl loesps clamorous triumph had been held just a few days earlier parts of the city were still recovering it had been a celebration on a scale and of an intensity pourl had never seen before certainly not under the late king tyl loesp had provided for banquets in every street a weeks free drink from every public house and a bounty for every inhabitant within the walls games sports competitions and concerts of every sort all freely open to all had taken place and a patchwork of small riots had broken out in various sections of the city requiring quelling by constables and militia an enormous parade had been staged consisting of the victorious army all bright and polished smiling and whole under a sea of fluttering banners complete with wildly caparisoned warbeasts and a host of captured deldeyn soldiery artillery pieces military vehicles and war engines streets had been widened buildings knocked down and rivers and gullies covered over to provide a thoroughfare long and wide enough to accommodate the great procession tyl loesp had ridden at the head werreber and his generals a little behind in the parade field where the kilometreslong procession had ended up the regent had announced a year without tax this later turned out to mean a shortyear without certain mostly rather obscure taxes an amnesty for minor criminals the disbandment of various ancillary regiments with the release with pensions of nearly one hundred thousand men and an extended mission to the ninth that would mean that both he and the prince regent would spend significant time in rasselle and the deldeyn provinces bringing the benefits of sarl rule and wisdom to that reduced but highly fruitful and promising land oramen sitting in the shade of the flagfluttering parade stand with the rest of the nobility had been warned of this last provision only an hour before and so was able not to look surprised he had felt an initial burst of fury that he had been simply told this rather than consulted or even asked but that had gone quickly hed soon started to wonder if such a move such a break with pourl might not be a good idea all the same to be so instructed you might refuse to go sir fanthile pointed out oramen turned away from the view over the city i might in theory i suppose he said thats the bath ready sir oh hello mr palace secretary sir neguste called marching into the room behind them thank you neguste oramen said and his servant winked and retreated fanthile nodded at the note in oramens hand does this make the decision for you sir i had already decided i might go oramen said he smiled the very idea of the hyengzhar fascinates me fanthile he laughed it would be something to control all that power in any sense fanthile refused to be impressed may i speak bluntly sir yes of course tyl loesp might worry that leaving you here while he tightens his grip on rasselle would allow you to build too independent a foundation of regard amongst the nobles the people and even parliament here removing you to somewhere so out of the way however impressive that place might be as an attraction could appear to some almost like a form of exile you could refuse to go sir youd be within your rights by some arguments your place is here amongst the people who might love you all the better with greater acquaintance i have heard who will be there around you this general foise for one he is entirely tyl loesps man they all are all his men i mean they are loyal to him rather than to sarl or your fathers memory or you oramen felt relieved hed been expecting a scolding or something equally disagreeable that is your bluntest dear fanthile he asked smiling it is as i see things sir well tyl loesp may arrange me as he sees fit for the moment ill play along let him have his time these men you mention may see their loyalty as lying with him but as long as he is loyal in turn which he most unquestionably is then theres neither difference nor harm i shall be king in due course and even allowing for all our new age talk of parliamentary oversight ill have my time then that gentleman might grow used to arranging things to his liking he may wish to extend his time perhaps so but once i am king his choices become limited dont you think fanthile frowned i certainly know id like to think that sir whether i can in honest conscience allow myself to hold such a views another thing he nodded at the note which oramen still held i think the fellow may be forcing your actions in this sir and i believe he may come to enjoy the habit of doing so if he does not already oramen took a deep breath the air smelled so good and fresh up here unlike the depths of the city where annoyingly so much of the fun was to be found he let the air out of his lungs oh let tyl loesp enjoy his triumph fanthile hes continued my fathers purpose as he himself might have wished and id be a churl and look one too in the eyes of your precious people if i tantrummed now while i am still in so many eyes an untried youth he smiled encouragingly at the troubledlooking face of the older man ill bend with tyl loesps current while its at its strongest it might be bruising not to ill beat against its ebb when i see fit he waved the letter fanthile had given him ill go fanthile i think i need to but i thank you for all your help and advice he handed the note back to the palace secretary now old friend i really must go to my bath open your eyes prince fanthile said for a moment astoundingly not standing aside to let the prince regent past i do not know what ills been done about us since your fathers death sir but theres a smell that hangs over too much thats happened we need all take care not to be infected by its noxiousness it might prove each one of us all too mortal he waited another moment as though to see whether this had sunk in then nodded a bow and head still lowered stood to one side oramen didnt know what to say that wouldnt embarrass the fellow further following such an outburst so he just walked past him on his way to his toilet a week later he was on his way to the hyengzhar what with all the preparations and general fuss caused by the move he hadnt seen fanthile again before leaving pourl the morning of the day he was due to go shortly after hed heard he was to have his very own personal guard of two stalwart knights hed received a note from fanthile asking to see him but there hadnt been time jerle batra took the signal during a break in the peace negotiations these were proving protracted he wasnt directly involved in the haggling of course it boggled one to think what the indigents would make of a cross between a talking bush and an expanding fence but he was overseeing while some of the others in the mission did their best to keep people focused in the end it had to be the natives themselves who made this work but a bit of judicious prodding helped on occasion he rose a couple of kilometres into the air from the marquee in the middle of the great tent city on the grassy swell of plain where the negotiations were taking place up here the air smelled fresh and clean it felt deliciously cool too you experienced changes in temperature so quickly in this form you felt the wind blow through you there was nothing quite like it my dear old friend he communicated the signal was passing from and to the excursion platform quonber currently almost directly overhead but on the fringes of space to what etc jerle ruule batra said a familiar voice goodday the its my party and ill sing if i want to was an escarpmentclass gcu which had been strongly associated with special circumstances for nearly as long as jerle batra himself batra had no idea where the ship actually was in a true physical sense but the old craft had gone to the trouble of sending a workingscale personality construct to talk to him here on prasadal this implied a matter of more than passing importance to you too he sent wherever thank you how goes your peace conference slowly having exhausted the possibilities of every other form of massmurder they could possibly employ against each other the natives now appear intent on boring each other to death they may finally have discovered their true calling still cause for optimism my congratulations to all and im told you have a child i most certainly do not have a child i am looking after a child for a colleague that is all nevertheless that is more than one might have expected of you she asked i could hardly refuse how interesting however to business by all means listen to this there followed a compressed version of the message sent by the now we try it my way to its old home msv the qualifier describing its odd encounter with what had appeared to be an oct ship above the planet zaranche but hadnt been very well this was only mildly interesting and batra did not see how it might involve him and it is believed that the whole oct fleet above zaranche save for one primarianclass ship probably the first arrived was not really there it was a ghost fleet the oct are at that stage though arent they batra sent theyre still trying to puff themselves up still trying on parents shoes making themselves look bigger batra immediately knew somebody somewhere in sc was going to be reading all sorts of paranoid nonsense into something like this ghost ships pretend fleets scary except it wasnt it couldnt be the oct were an irrelevance better still they were the morthanvelds irrelevance or the nariscenes irrelevance depending on where you chose to draw the line an equivtech involved getting up to this sort of misdirection might mean something significant the oct doing the same thing was profoundly sowhattish they were probably just trying to impress their nariscene mentors or had left a switch on they shouldnt or something but sc took this sort of random dross terribly seriously the finest minds in the culture had an almost chronic need for serious stuff to involve them and this patently was their latest dose we make our own problems batra thought weve seeded the fucking galaxy with travellers wanderers students reporters practical ethnologists peripatetic philosophers handson exsociologists footloose retirees freelance ambassadors or whatever theyre called this season and a hundred other categories of far too easily amazed amateur and theyre all forever reporting back stuff that looks like deeply weird shit to them that wouldnt pass the first filter of even the least experienced contact units data intake systems weve filled the known universe with credulous idiots and we think weve sneakily contributed to our own safety by making it hard for anything untoward to creep in under our sensor coverage whereas in fact weve just made sure we harvest zillions of false positives and probably made the really serious shit harder to spot when it does eventually come flying no the gcus construct sent we dont think the oct are trying to look more impressive than they are not in this case wind moved through batras bushy body like a sigh what happened after the close encounter he asked dutifully we dont know havent been able to contact the erratic since could have been captured conceivably even destroyed a ship a warship no less has been sent to investigate though its still eight days away destroyed batra suppressed a laugh seriously are we within capabilities here the oct primarianclass has the weaponry and other systems to overwhelm a cobbledtogether exgtc mongrel yes but are we within likelihood batra asked are we even still within the realm of anything other than paranoid lunacy what is imagined to be their motive in doing whatever might have been done to this erratic to stop this getting out but why to what end whats so important about this zaranche place theyd even try to kidnap any culture ship hopeless old junkyard oddball or not nothing about zaranche rather what this has led to which would be what a subtle but thorough investigation into oct ship movements and placements over the last fifty days or so which has involved quite a few contact sc and even vfpwarships dropping everything and hightailing off to a variety of obscure backwood destinations many well within the morthanveld sphere i am suitably impressed it must be regarded as awfully important for us to risk annoying our sosensitive coinvolveds at such an allegedly delicate time and what was the result of all this highspeed highvalueasset sleuthing there are lots of ghost fleets what for the first time batra felt something other than a sort of amused studied disdain some legacy of his human form buried in the transcribed systems that held his personality made him suddenly feel the coldness of the air up here just for an instant he was fully aware that a naked human exposed to this temperature would have hairs standing up on their skin now the ghost fleet above zaranche is one of eleven the ship continued the others are here a glyph of a portion of the galaxy perhaps three thousand light years in diameter displayed itself in batras mind he swam into the image looked around pulled back played around with a few settings thats quite a large part of what one might call oct space he sent indeed approximately seventythree per cent of the entire oct prime fleet would seem not to be where it appears to be why are they bunched like that why those places all the locations all the places where these ghost fleets had drawn up were out of the way isolated planets backwater habitats and seldomfrequented deepspace structures it is believed they are grouped where they are to avoid detection but theyre being open about it theyre telling people where they are i mean detection of the fact they are ghosts the cover story as it were is that a series of special convocations is taking place which will lead to some profound new departure for the oct some new civilisational goal perhaps possibly one linked to their continuing attempts at betterment and advancement upon the galactic stage we suspect however that this is only partially true the convocations are a ruse to excuse the departure of so many frontline ships had they better technology the gcus personality construct continued the oct would one imagines have kept their ghost ships appearing to carry out normal duties while the real ones left for wherever it is they have in fact left for their ability so to deceive is limited however any highinvolved ship certainly one of ours or the morthanveld for example and possibly most nariscene craft would be able to tell that what they were looking at was not a real oct ship so the genuine craft left the normal intercourse of galactic ship life and these rather crude representations were assembled in locations specifically chosen so that the ships lack of authenticity would most likely go unnoticed had he still inhabited human form batra would at this point have frowned and scratched his head but why to what end are these maniacs going to war we dont know they have outstanding disputes with a few species and there is a particular and recently inflamed gripe with the aultridia but the whole of oct society does not appear to be presently configured for hostilities it is configured for something unusual certainly batra could hear puzzlement expressed in the ships voice possibly including some sort of hostile or at least dynamic action but not allout war the aultridia are taken to be their most pressing potential adversaries but they would almost certainly defeat the oct as matters stand at present the models show ninetyplus per cent likelihood very consistently so where are the real ships that old chum is very much the question batra had been thinking and why am i being included here more modelling using the pattern of affected snuckaway ships and a preexisting profile of oct interests we have drawn up a list of likely destinations for the real craft another layered diaglyph blossomed in batras mind ahha he thought the marginally most likely disposition is a distributed one or rather one of two not dissimilar choices in each the primarians and other strategic craft take up various different positions either defensive or offensive depending the defensive model implies a more even spread of forces than the offensive one which favours greater concentration these represent options one and two respectively in the modelled plausibility grading there is however a third option shown here the other layers fell away but batra had already spotted the pattern and the place within it that was its focus they could be gathering round sursamen he sent the general contact unit its my party and ill sing if i want to still sounded puzzled well quite the integrity of objects inspiral coalescence ringdown the interior of the morthanveld great ship inspiral coalescence ringdown was generally experienced virtually even by those for whom it was designed and who had built it externally the ship was a flattened sphere fifty kilometres in diameter it resembled a vast droplet of blue ice whose surface had been blasted with several million jewels about half of which had subsequently fallen out leaving behind small craters its main internal space was enormous bigger than anything on a culture gsv the best way to think of it anaplian had been told by skalpapta her morthanveld liaison officer was as if youd got nineteen balloons full of water each nearly ten kilometres in diameter arranged them into a rough hexagon so that they formed as near a circle as possible then squished them all together so that the walls between them flattened out then you added another two layers of seven spheres one above and one below under the same principle finally you removed all those flat separating walls the whole space was crisscrossed by strands and cables supporting hundreds of millions of polyplike living quarters and multitudinous travel tubes many with a vacuum inside to speed up transit times as on most morthanveld ships the water was generally kept as clean as desirable by fixed and static scrubbing units nevertheless the fact was that the bait species and accrescent flora the morthanveld liked to feed on needed water with nutrients in it and the morthanveld themselves regarded having to visit some special place to relieve oneself of waste as the mark of a species insufficiently at home with itself or gasbreathing which was almost as embarrassing the water they lived swam worked and played within then was not perfectly unclouded however it was always pleasant to have a clear view especially in such a vast space the morthanveld very much approved of themselves and the larger the numbers of their kind there were present the more selfapproval they felt being able to see the hundreds of millions of their fellows a great ship normally carried was generally regarded as an extremely good thing so rather than rely on their naked eyes to see their way round a space as vast as that of a great ships interior they used thinfilm screens covering their eyes to present them with the view theyd be able to see had the water been perfectly clear djan seriy had decided to adopt the same strategy and so swam with a modified thinfilm screen over her own eyes she moved through the water in a dark suit like a second skin around her neck was what looked like a necklace made of fluttering green fronds a gill arrangement that provided oxygen to her nose through two small transparent tubes this was somewhat ignominious to her as with her old upgrades her skin would have ridged and puckered over whatever area was required to absorb the gases she needed straight out of the water the thinfilm screen was stuck across her eyes like a flimsy transparent bandage she had switched off her blink reflex the alternative was to let the screen bulge out far enough for her to blink normally but the airgap introduced unwanted distortions the screen provided her with the virtual view of the real space showing the cavernous semispherical spaces of the great ship like some staggeringly vast cave system she could have patched directly into the ships internal sensory view to achieve the same effect or just swum with her own senses and not bothered with the greater seemingly clear view but she was being polite using the thinfilm screen meant that the ship could keep an eye on her seeing no doubt what she could see and so knowing that she wasnt getting into any special circumstancesstyle mischief she could also have used any one of several different kinds of public transport to get to where she was going but had opted instead for a small personal propulsion unit which she held on to with one hand as it thrummed its way through the water the sex toy that was really a knife missile that was really a drone had wanted to impersonate such a propulsion unit so staying close to her but she reckoned this was just the machine fussing and had instructed it to remain in her quarters djan seriy powered up and to the left to avoid a forecurrent found a helpful aftcurrent curved round a set of long bulbous habitats like enormous dangling fruits and then struck out towards a tall bunch of greenblack spheres each between ten and thirty metres across hanging in the water like a colossal strand of seaweed she switched off the prop unit and swam into one of the larger spheres through a silvery circle a couple of metres across and let the draining water lower her to the soft wet floor gravity again she was spending more time aquatic than not even including sleeping as she explored the huge space vessel this was her fifth day aboard and she only had another four to go there was still much to see her suit until now coating her body as closely as paint promptly frizzed up forcing the water to slide off and letting it assume the look of something a fashionable young lady would choose to wear in an airbreathing environment she stuffed her necklace gill into a pocket and as the suits headpart flowed downward to form an attractive frilled collar flicked one earring to activate a temporary static field this sorted her hair which was today blonde she kept the thinfilm screen on she thought it looked rather good on her vaguely piratical djan seriy stepped through the clingfield into the rd aliens lounge where thumping music played loudly and the air was full of drug smoke and incense she was quickly greeted by a small cloud of tiny brightly coloured creatures like small birds each thrown by one of the bars patrons some sang welcomes others fluttered strobed messages across their hazy wings and a few squirted scent messages at her this was currently the latest greetingfad for new arrivals at the rd aliens lounge sometimes the lobbed creatures would carry notes or small parcels of narcotics or declarations of love or they would start spouting insults witticisms philosophical epigrams or other messages as djan seriy understood it this was meant to be amusing she waited for the cloud of flittering creatures to start dissipating thinking all the time how easy it would have been to bat grasp and crush every one of the twentyeight little twittering shapes around her had she been fully enabled she plucked the most lately arrived of the creatures out of the air and looked severely at the oldlooking purpleskinned humanoid who had thrown it yours sir she said as she passed his table handing it to him he mumbled a reply others nearby were calling out to her the denizens of the rd were gregarious and got to know people quickly she was already regarded as a regular after only three visits she refused various offers of company and waved away some especially thick and pungent drug smoke the rd was something of a widespectrum humanoid stoners hangout she acknowledged a few people as she walked to the circular bar in the middle of the lounge sitting glowing in the darkened space like a giant halo shjan youre here shouted tulya puonvangi who was what passed as the cultures ambassador on the inspiral coalescence ringdown djan seriy regarded the man rather as she did the fluttering creature fad immature and vaguely annoying he had introduced himself shortly after shed arrived and done his best to make himself a nuisance more or less ever since puonvangi was obese pinkish bald and fairly humanbasic on the surface save for two long fanglike incisors which distorted his speech he couldnt manage the hard d sound at the start of her first name for example plus he had an eye in the back of his head which he claimed was fully functional but was apparently really no more than an affectation he often as now kept it covered with an eye patch though the eye patch again as now was frequently clear he also hed told her after a remarkably short time during their first meeting had exquisitely altered genitalia which hed offered to show her she had demurred hello jear puonvangi said clutching at her elbows and bringing her close to kiss her cheeks she allowed this to happen while remaining stiff and unresponsive he smelled of brine tangfruit and some sweet unashamedly psychotropic scent his clothes were loose voluminous ever gently billowing and showed slowmotion scenes of humanoid pornography his sleeves were rolled up and she could see from the thin fiercely glowing lines incised on his forearms that he had been grazing tattoo drugs he released her how are you looking raiant as ezher heresh the young fellow i wanted you to meet he pointed at the young longlimbed man sitting by his side shjan sheree araprian this is krasri kruike krasri say hi the young man looked embarrassed how do you do he said in a quiet deep deliciously accented voice he had gently glowing skin of something between deep bronze and very dark green and a mass of shining ringleted black hair he wore perfectly cut utterly black closefitting trous and a short jacket his face was quite long his nose fairly flat his teeth were normal but very white and his expression beneath hooded eyes was diffident amused perhaps a little wary though modulated by what looked like a permanent smile he had laughter lines which made someone so otherwise younglooking appear oddly vulnerable chevroncut brows and moustache looked like something new he was trying and was unsure he was getting away with those eyes were dark flecked with gold he was almost unbearably attractive djan seriy had therefore naturally gone instantly to what she regarded as her highest alert state of suspicion i am djan seriy anaplian she told him how is your name properly pronounced he grinned glanced apologetically at a beaming eyebrowwaggling puonvangi klatsli quike he told her she nodded pleased to meet you klatsli quike she said she took the bar stool on the far side of him putting the young man between her and puonvangi who looked disappointed though only briefly he slammed the bar with the flat of one hand bringing a serving unit zinging over on shining rails strung along the far side of the bar jhrinks shmokes shnorts inshisions she agreed to drink a little to keep puonvangi company quike lit up a small pipe of some fabulously fragrant herb purely for the scent as it had no known narcotic effect though even the aroma was almost druglike in its headiness puonvangi ordered a couple of styli of tattoo drugs and when both djan seriy and quike refused to join him grazed one into each of his arms from wrist to elbow the drug lines glowed so brightly at first they coloured his pink face green he sighed and sat back in his high seat exhaling and closing his eyes going slack while their host was enjoying his first rush quike said youre from sursamen he sounded apologetic as though he wasnt supposed to know i am she said you know it of he said shellworlds are a subject of mine i study them i find them fascinating youre not alone in that i know actually i find it perplexing that everyone doesnt find them utterly fascinating djan seriy shrugged there are many fascinating places yes but shellworlds are something special he put his hand to his mouth long fingers he might have been blushing im sorry you lived there i dont need to tell you how fabulous they are well for me it is was just home when one grows up in a place no matter how exotic it may seem to others it is still where all the usual banalities and indignities of childhood occur home is always the norm it is everywhere else that is marvellous she drank he puffed on his pipe for a bit puonvangi sighed deeply eyes still closed and you she said remembering to be polite where are you from may i ask your full name astlechulinisa klatsli lp quike dam uast lp she said the letters l and p the letters l and p he confirmed with a small nod and a mischievous smile do they stand for something they do but its a secret she looked at him doubtfully he laughed spread his arms im well travelled ms seriy a wanderer i am older than i look i have met many people and given and shared and received many things i have been most places at a certain scale i have spent time with all the major involveds i have talked to gods shared thought with the sublimed and tasted as far as a human can something of the joy of what the minds call infinite fun space i am not the person i was when i took my full name and i am not definable just by that any more a nested mystery in the centre of my name is no more than i deserve trust me djan seriy thought about this he had called himself a wanderer they were talking marain the cultures language it had a phoneme to denote upper case there had always been a proportion of people in the culture or at least people who were from the culture originally who termed themselves so she found it difficult not to think of them as a class they did indeed just wander most doing so within the culture going from orbital to orbital place to place travelling on cruise ships and trampers as a rule and on contact vessels when they could others travelled amongst the rest of the involved and aspirant species existing when they encountered societies shockingly unenlightened enough not to have cast off the last shackles of monetary exchange through intercivilisational cosupportive understandings or by using some vanishingly microscopic fraction of the allegedly infinite resources the culture commanded to pay their way some cast their adventures wider still which was where problems sometimes occurred the mere presence of such a person in a sufficiently undeveloped society could change it sometimes profoundly if that person was blind to what their being there might be doing to those they had come to live among or at least look at not all such people agreed to be monitored by contact during their travels and even though contact was perfectly unabashed when it came to spying on travellers who strayed into vulnerable societies whether they liked it or not it did sometimes miss individuals there was a whole section of the organisation devoted to watching developing civilisations for signs that some socalled wanderer had with prior intent opportunistically or even accidentally turned into a local mad professor despot prophet or god there were other categories but these four formed the most popular and predictable avenues peoples fantasies took them along when they lost their moral bearings down amongst the prims most wanderers caused no such problems however and such itinerants normally found somewhere to call home eventually usually back in the culture some though never settled anywhere roaming all their lives and of these a few a surprisingly large proportion compared to the rest of the cultures population lived effectively for ever or at least lived until they met some almost inevitably violent irrecoverable end there were rumours usually in the form of personal boasts of individuals who had been around since the formation of the culture itself nomads whod drifted the galaxy and its near infinitude of peoples societies civilisations and places for thousands upon thousands of years trust me he had said i think i do not she told him at last narrowing her eyes a little really he asked looking hurt im telling the truth he said quietly he seemed half small boy and half untroubled ancient darkly selfpossessed im sure it appears so to you she said arching one eyebrow she drank some more she had ordered a zas revenge but said concoction was unknown to the bar machine which had made its own speciality it served quike took another pipe of incense herb and youre from the eighth quike said coughing a little though with a broad smile wreathed in violet smoke i am she said he smiled shyly and hid behind some smoke youre well informed she told him thank you he suddenly mugged an expression of what might have been pretended fear and an sc agent too yes i wouldnt get too excited she told him i have been demilitarised he grinned again almost cheekily all the same djan seriy would have sighed if she had felt able to she had a feeling she was being set up here mr quike was so handsome and attractive it was positively suspicious she just wasnt sure yet by whom they lett puonvangi at the rd in the company of a riotous party of binlisi conventioneers the birilisi were an avian species and much given to excessive narcoticism they and puonvangi were guaranteed to get on there was much fluttering they suited up and went to a place quike knew where the aquaticised gathered these were humanoids fully converted to waterdwelling the space was full of what looked like every kind of watergoing species or at least those below a certain size the warm hazy water was full of skin scents incomprehensible sounds of every appreciable frequency and curious musical pulsations they had to stay suited up and laughed bubbles as they tried drinking underwater using smart cups and selfsealing straws they talked via what was basically a preelectricity speaking tube they got to the end of their drinks together she was looking away from him watching two thin flamboyantly colourful fabulously frilled creatures three metres tall with great long expressionless but somehow dignified heads and faces they were floating a short distance away from her poised facing each other just out of the touching range of their frills which waved so fast they flickered she wondered were they talking arguing flirting quike touched her arm to attract her attention shall we go he asked theres something youve got to see she looked down at his hand still resting on her arm they took a bubble car through the enclosed galaxy of the great ships main internal space to where his quarters were they were still suited up sat side by side in the speeding car communicating by lace as the gaudily bewildering expanses of the ships interior swept around them you really must see this he said glancing at her no need to overstate she told him i am already here going with you she had never been very good at being romantic wooing and seduction even played as a kind of game seemed dishonest to her somehow again she blamed her upbringing though she wouldnt have argued the point too determinedly if pressed on it ultimately she was prepared to concede that maybe at some level beyond even childhood indoctrination it was just her his living space was a trio of fourmetre spheres bunched in with thousands of others on a kilometreslong string of alien habs situated near the vast curved wall of the main spaces outer periphery the room was entered by entirely the stickiest slowestworking gel field lock shed ever encountered inside it was rather small and brightly lit the air tasted clean almost sharp nothing in it looked personalised furniture or fittings of debatable utility lay scattered about the floor and wall the general colour scheme was of green components over cerise backgrounds not to djan seriys eye a happy combination there was a sort of glisteny look to a lot of the surfaces as though a film or membrane had been shrinkwrapped around everything another drink he suggested oh i suppose so she said i have some chapantlic spirit he said digging in a small floor chest he saw her run a finger along the edge of what appeared to be a spongecovered seat frowning as her skin encountered something slick and smooth coating it and said sorry everything is sort of sealed in covered all a bit antiseptic i do apologise he looked embarrassed as he waved a couple of glittering goblets shaped like inverted bells and a small bottle i picked up some sort of weird allergy thing on my travels and they can only fix it back in the culture wherever i live i need it to be pretty clean ill get it dealt with but for now well djan seriy was not at all convinced this was true is it in any way infectious she asked her own immune system still fully functioning and well into the comprehensive end of the spectrum of congenital culture protection had signalled nothing amiss after a couple of hours in such close proximity to mr quike there would have been at least some hint of any untoward virus spore or similar unpleasantness no he said motioning her to sit down they sat on opposite sides of a narrow table he poured some of the spirit it was brown and highly viscous the seat djan seriy was sitting on felt slidey a tiny new suspicion had entered her head had the fellow thought to bring her here for something other than sex she found the shrinkwrapped nature of the fittings in the mans quarters disturbing what was really going on here ought she to be worried it was almost beyond imagining that any civilian in their right mind might think to offer some sort of mischief or mistreatment to an sc agent even a defanged one but then people were nothing if not varied and strange who knew what strangenesses went on their heads just to be on the safe side she monitored the great ships available systems with her neural lace the living space was partially shielded but that was normal enough she could see where she was in the ship and the ship knew where she was a relief she supposed the younglooking mr quike offered her a crystal bellgoblet it rang faintly the instant she touched it theyre meant to do that he explained the vibrations are supposed to make it taste better she took the little goblet and leant forward lp quike she said what exactly are your intentions she could smell the spirit albeit faintly he looked almost flustered first a toast he said holding up his bellgoblet no she said lowering her head a little and narrowing her eyes first the truth her nose was reporting nothing unexpected in the fumes rising from the goblet of spirit in her hand but she wanted to be sure giving bits of her brain time to do a proper processing job on the chemicals her nasal membranes were picking up tell me what it was you wanted to show me here quike sighed and put down his bellgoblet he fastened her with his gaze i picked up an ability to read minds on my travels he said quickly possibly a little annoyed i just wanted to show off i suppose read minds djan seriy said sceptically ship minds could read human minds though they were not supposed to specialist equipment could read human minds and she imagined you could make some kind of android machine embodying the same technology that could do so too but an ordinary human being that seemed unlikely this was depressing if klatsli quike was a fantasist or just mad then she was certainly not going to have sex with him its true he told her he sat forward their noses were now a few centimetres apart just look into my eyes you are serious djan seriy asked oh dear this was not turning out as shed wished at all i am perfectly serious djan seriy he said quietly and something in his voice persuaded her to humour him just a little longer she sighed again and put the bellgoblet of spirit down on the narrow table by now it was clear the drink was highly alcoholic though otherwise harmless she looked into his eyes after a few moments there was the hint of something there a tiny red spark she sat back blinking the man in front of her smiling faintly looking quite serious and not at all pleased with himself put his finger to his lips what was going on she ran what was basically an internal systems check to reassure herself that she hadnt been unconscious even for a moment or that she hadnt performed some movement or function she hadnt been aware of or that less time had elapsed than she assumed nothing out of kilter nothing wrong she seemed to be okay djan seriy frowned leant forward again the red spark was still there in his eyes almost vanishingly faint it was she realised coherent light one single pure narrow frequency it flickered very quickly something approaching what approaching where had that thought come from what was going on here she sat back again blinking fast and frowning deeply running her systems check again still nothing untoward she sat forward once more ah she was starting to guess what was going on the flickering red spark came back and she realised he was indeed signalling her a section of his retina must be a laser capable of sending a beam of coherent light through his eye and into hers the signal was expressed in nonary marain the ninepart binary base of the cultures language shed heard of this ability in sc training though purely as an aside it was a multimillenniaancient now almost neverused amendment long made redundant by the technology behind the neural lace it was even something she could have made herself capable of with a few days notice before shed had her claws pulled she concentrated pta he was signalling a permission to approach burst it was a ship signal originally it had been adopted as a sort of acronymic shorthand by culture people wanting to get in closer contact with other people they werent sure would welcome them pta she nodded very slightly djan seriy the signal said i think you are receiving me but please scratch your right cheek with your left hand if you are understanding all of this scratch once if this is too slow a rate of transmission twice for acceptable and three times for too fast the information was coming in faster than it could have been spoken intelligibly but not ungraspably quick she gently scratched her right cheek with her left hand twice wonderful allow me to introduce myself properly the lp you asked about earlier stands for liveware problem i am not a properly normal human being i am an avatoid of the liveware problem a streamclass superlifter a modified deltaclass gcu a wanderer of the ship kind and technically absconded ah she thought an avatoid a ships avatar of such exquisite biomimicry it could pass for fully human a ship wanderer and an absconder absconders were ships that had chosen to throw off the weight of cultural discipline and go off on their own even so a proportion were known or at least strongly suspected to be using this state of selfimposed exile purely as a disguise and were still fully committed to the culture allegedly adopting absconder status as cover for being able to carry out actions the main part of the culture might shrink from the granddaddy the exemplary hero figure the very god of such vessels was the gsv sleeper service which had selflessly impersonated such eccentric indifference to the culture for four decades and then some twentyplus years ago now suddenly revealed itself as utterly mainstreamcultureloyal and handily harbouring a secretly manufactured instantly available war fleet just when the culture most needed it before disappearing again she allowed her eyes to narrow a little she was fully aware this was her own signature signal suspicion distrust sorry about all the subterfuge the air in here is kept scrubbed to remove the possibility of nanoscale devices watching in on such eyetoeye communication and the rooms coverings are themselves wrapped in film for the same reason even the smoke i inhaled at the bar contains an additive which clears my lungs of any such possible contamination i was only able to get close enough to contact you after youd arrived on board the inspiral coalescence ringdown and of course everybody is being so wary of upsetting the morthanveld i thought it best to adopt the trappings of ultracaution im aware of course that you cant reply in kind to me so let me just tell you why im here and why im contacting you in this way she raised her brows a fraction i am as i say an absconder though only technically i spent three and a half thousand years faithfully tugging smaller ships around systems vehicles throughout the greater galaxy and saw active service during the idiran war serving if i may say so with some distinction especially in the first few desperate years after all that i decided i was due a protracted holiday probably a retirement to be quite honest though i reserve the right to change my mind i have wandered the galaxy for the last eight hundred years seeing all i could of other civilisations and peoples there is always more to see of course the galaxy renews and reforms itself faster than one can make ones way round it anyway i am truly fascinated by shellworlds and have a particular interest in sursamen not the smallest part of which concerns your level the eighth when i heard rumours regarding your fathers death and please accept my condolences in that regard and the events surrounding this sad occasion including the death of your brother ferbin i immediately thought to make myself available to help the sarl and the children of the late king in particular id assumed youd be going back home with many of your powers removed or reduced i know that you return with no ship or drone or other aid about you and so id like to offer my own services not as a daytoday servant or courier or anything like that our morthanveld hosts would not tolerate such a thing but as a last resort if you will certainly as a friend in case of need sursamen and especially the eighth seems like a dangerous place these days and a person travelling alone no matter how able may need all the friends they can muster i that is the ship am currently some distance off but keeping pace with the inspiral coalescence ringdown to stay in reasonable proximity to this avatoid and facilitate its speedy retrieval should i need to do so however it is my intention shortly to make my way to sursamen directly and this avatoid or another for i have several will be there it and myself are ready to afford you such assistance as you may require you need not respond now please think about this at your leisure and make your mind up in your own time when you meet my avatoid on sursamen you can let me know what you think then through it i shall completely understand if you want nothing to do with me that is entirely your right however please be assured of my continuing respect and know that i am dear lady entirely at your service i shall end this signal shortly please decide whether you wish to pretend i have in any way read your mind just on the offchance we are somehow being observed signal ends at implied zero four three two one djan seriy stared into the eyes of the young man sitting opposite her she was thinking dear shafted worldgod all my potential bedfellows are machines how depressing only about half a minute had passed since theyd started staring into each others eyes she sat back slowly smiling and shaking her head i think your trick does not work on me sir quike smiled well it doesnt work with everybody he said he raised his goblet it emitted a high pleasant ringing tone perhaps i might be permitted to try again some other time perhaps they clinked bellgoblets the twin sound was surprisingly mellifluous she had dismissed the idea of taking seriously the offer hed just made before the glasses had stopped ringing she engaged him in conversation for some time after that listening to him recount tales of various explorations and adventures during his many travels it was not unpleasant she did not have to pretend interest and it was amusing to try to work out in his stories which parts were probably true and had been experienced by the ship concerned directly assuming there really was a ship involved which parts had been lived by the avatoid while the ship had looked on and which might have been entirely made up to try to fool anybody listening that all this related to a real human not a shipplusavatarinhumanform in exchange she related something of her life on sursamen as a child and adolescent and answered most of the eagerly asked questions quike had though she steered clear of certain areas and tried not to give any indication of how she would eventually react to his offer but of course she would reject his help the ships help if the liveware problem was working completely alone then it was probably either hopelessly naïve or quietly insane neither inspired confidence if not then it presumably represented a part of sc or something even more rarefied and it was just pretending to be hopelessly naïve or quietly insane which was even more worrying and if quike and the liveware problem were sc then why hadnt she been briefed about them turning up before shed left prasadal or at least before shed left the last vestige of the culture proper and been batonned onwards to the morthanveld what was going on here all she wanted to do was go back home and pay her respects to her late father and her presumeddeceased brother reconnect with her past a bit and perhaps lay something to rest she was not entirely sure what but maybe that would come to her later she doubted shed be able to provide much help to her surviving brother oramen but if she could offer some small service or other she would but that was kind of it after that shed be off away back to the culture and if theyd take her back to sc and the job that for all its frustrations dilemmas and heartbreaks she loved why was a culture ship trying to get involved in her returning to sursamen in the first place at most this was still all about a pretty paltry thing a grubby dispute regarding the succession of power within a very minor and embarrassingly violent and undemocratic tribe whose principal claim on the interest of others was that they happened to live inside a relatively rare and exotic worldtype was she expected to do something on sursamen if so what what could she be expected to do unbriefed lacking any specified mission and defanged well she didnt know she strongly suspected shed be crazy to do anything other than keep her head down do what shed said she was going to do and no more she was in enough trouble already just for quitting the mission on prasadal and heading home on compassionate leave without adding to the chargesheet sc training was full of stories of agents whod gone dramatically offpiste and had taken on bizarre missions all of their own devising they usually ended badly there were only a few stories leaning in the other direction of agents who had passed up obvious opportunities to make some beneficial intervention unbriefed without some specific mandate or instruction the implication was as ever to stick to the plan but be prepared to improvise also listen to your drone or other companion they were expected to be more levelheaded less emotional than you that was one of the main reasons they were there stick to the plan not just obey orders if you were being asked to do something according to a plan then the way the culture saw it you should have had at least some say in what that plan actually was and if circumstances changed during the course of trying to follow that plan then you were expected to have the initiative and the judgement to alter the plan and act accordingly you didnt keep on blindly obeying orders when due to an alteration in context the orders were in obvious contradiction to the attainment of whatever goal it was you were pursuing or when they violated either common sense or common decency you were still responsible in other words it sometimes seemed to sc trainees and especially to sc trainees coming to the organisation having been raised in other societies that those people sworn just to obey orders had the easier time of it being allowed to be singleminded in whatever purpose they pursued rather than having to do that and wrestle with its ethical implications however as this difference in approach was held up as one of the principal reasons that the culture in general and sc in particular was morally superior to everybody else it was generally regarded as a small operational price to pay for the allegedly far greater reward of being able to feel well ahead in the ethics stakes compared to ones civilisational peers so she would stick to the plan and the plan was go home behave return apply herself that ought to be fairly simple ought it not she joined in mr quikes laughter as he reached the end of a story shed been barely half listening to they drank more of the spirit from the delicate tinkling little bellgoblets and she felt herself grow pleasantly tipsy her head ringing in a sort of woozy complicit sympathy with the crystals well she said at last i had better go it has been interesting talking to you he stood up as she did really he said he looked suddenly anxious even hurt i wish youd stay do you now she asked coolly kind of hoping you would he confessed he gave a nervous laugh i thought we were getting on really well there he looked at the puzzled expression on her face i thought we were flirting you did she said she felt like rolling her eyes this was not the first time this had happened it must be her fault well yes he said almost laughing he waved one arm to an internal door my sleeping quarters are more well welcoming than this rather spare space he smiled his littleboy smile im sure they are she said she noticed the room lights were dimming a little late she thought so another aboutturn she inspected her own feelings and knew that despite the abruptness and the fact she was tired she was at least a little interested he came up to her and took one of her hands in his djan seriy he said quietly no matter what image of ourselves we try to project upon the world upon others even back upon ourselves we are still all human are we not she frowned are we she said we are and to be human to be anything like human is to know what one lacks to know what what one needs to know what one must look for to find some semblance of completeness amongst strangers all alone in the darkness she looked into his languidly beautiful eyes and saw in them well being cold about it more precisely in the exact set of his facial features and muscle state a hint of real need even genuine hunger how close to fully messily imperfectly human did an avatoid have to be to pass the close inspection afforded by an equivtech civilisation like the morthanveld perhaps close enough to have all the usual failings of metahumanity and the full quota of needs and desires whether he was a sophisticated avatar constructed from the cellular level up a subtly altered clone of an original human being or anything else mr quike it seemed was still very much a man and in looking into his eyes and seeing that craving desperation that anxious desire with its undertone of preprepared sullenness aching yearning ready to become hurt contempt on the instant of rejection she was only experiencing what untold generations of females had experienced throughout the ages and oh that smile those eyes that skin the warm enveloping voice she thought a real culture girl would definitely say yes at this point she sighed regretfully however i am still deep down and for my sins both my fathers daughter and a sarl perhaps some other time she told him she left in an allspecies pod taxi she sat there in the damp strangesmelling air closed her eyes and laced in to the great ships public information systems to review the next few days there had been no recent schedule changes they were still on course for the morthanveld nestworld of syaungun due there in two and a half days she considered looking at humanoid datingquickcontact sites there were over three hundred thousand humanoids aboard youd think there would be somebody but still felt both too tired and restless in the wrong way she returned to her own quarters where the twicedisguised drone whispered good night to her she thought good night back to it then lay eyes closed but unable or unwilling to sleep continuing to use her neural lace to interrogate the ships dataverse she checked up at a remove over distances and system translations that introduced delays of five or six seconds on the agents shed left running in the cultures dataverse she was both slightly disappointed and highly relieved to find that there was no known intrusive closeobservational recordage from the eighth or indeed any of sursamens interior levels whatever happened there happened once and was never seen again she clicked out of the cultures interface one last roving agent system was waiting to report back from the local dataverse it told her that her brother ferbin was not dead after all he was alive he was on a morthanveld tramp ship and he was due to arrive on the nestworld of syaungun less than a day after her ferbin in the hushed darkness of her cabin her eyes blinked suddenly open many worlds a strange thing had happened to choubris holse he had become interested in what was if he understood such matters rightly not a million strides away from being philosophy given ferbins unrestrainedly expressed views on that subject this felt tantamount to treason it had started with the games that they had both been playing on the nariscene ship hence the fortress to pass the time on the way to the nestworld of syaungun the games were played floating inside screenspheres which were linked to the brain of the ship itself such ships holse had realised were not merely vessels that is empty things you put stuff into they were things beings in their own right at least as far as a mersicor lyge or other mount was a being and perhaps a lot more so there were even more realistically fashioned diversions available games in which you really did seem to be awake and moving physically around talking and walking and fighting and everything else though not peeing or shitting holse had felt he had to ask but those sounded daunting and overly alien to both men as well as unpleasantly close to some of the disturbing stuff xide hyrlis had been bending their ears about back on the disputed burned husk that was bulthmaas the ship had advised them on which games they would find most rewarding and theyd ended up playing those whose pretended worlds were not all that different from the real one theyd left behind on sursamen war games of strategy and tactics connivance and daring holse had taken at first guilty and then unrestrained delight in playing some of these games from the point of view of a prince later he had discovered works analyses and comments related to such games and intrigued started to read or watch these too which was how he came to be interested in the idea that all reality might indeed be a game most specifically as this concept related to the infinite worlds theory which held that all possible things had already happened or were happening now all together this alleged that life was very like a game or simulation where every possible course and outcome has already been played out noted down and drawn up as though on an enormous map with the beginning of the game before a piece has been moved or a move has been made in the centre and every single possible end state arranged along the outer fringe of this implausibly stupendous chart by this comparison all that one does in mapping out the course of one particular game is trace a path from that central beginning of things out through more and more branches chances and possibilities to one of the near infinitude of ends at the periphery and there you were the further likeness being drawn here unless holse had it completely arsebeforecock was that which held as game so life and indeed as game so entire history of whole universe bar nothing and nobody everything had already happened and in every single possible way too not only had everything that had already happened happened everything that was going to happen had already happened and not only that everything that was going to happen had already happened in every single possible way that it possibly could so if say he played a game of cards with ferbin for money then there was a course a line a way through this already written previously happened universe of possibilities which led to the outcome that involved him losing everything to ferbin or ferbin losing everything to him including ferbin suffering a fit of madness and betting and losing his entire fortune and inheritance to his servant ha there were universelines where hed kill ferbin over the disputed card game and others wherein ferbin would kill him indeed there were tracks that led to everything that could be imagined and everything that would never be imagined by anybody but was still somehow possible it seemed at first glance like utter madness yet it also when one thought about it appeared somehow no less implausible than any other explanation of how things truly were and it had a sort of completeness about it that stifled argument assuming that every branching fork on the universe map was taken randomly all would still somehow be well the likely things would always outnumber the unlikely and vastly outnumber the ludicrous so as a rule things would happen much as one expected with the occasional surprise and the very rare moment of utter incredulity pretty much as life generally was in other words in his experience this was at once oddly satisfactory mildly disappointing and strangely reassuring to holse fate was as fate was and that was it he immediately wondered how you could cheat signal to utaltifuhl grand zamerin of sursamennariscene khatach solus assumed location kindly forward from morthanveld shoum meast zuevelous tleish gavantille prime pliyr director general of the morthanveld strategic mission to the tertiary hulian spine inmission peregrinatory signal details hidden check to release o cherished friend i hope this finds you well and that the everlasting queens th great spawning continues both apace and favourably to yourself your immediate family subsept sept clanlet clan and kinkind i am well firstly worry not this signal is sent under the provisions and in keeping with the terms of the morthanveldnariscene shellworld management coprosperity agreement subsection sursamen i communicate at such distance to inform you only of a dispositionary detail further to the greater good and security of the mutually beloved world within our charge this is that an uncrewed highai defensive entity in form similar to a cat compresshull accompanied by one dozen minor slaved codefensive entities will be emplaced by ourselves within the sursamen upper core space also known as the machine space or machine core under the auspices of the morthanveldxinthian shellworld management cosecurity agreement subsection sursamen with the full knowledge and cooperation of the sursamen xinthian probably not later than within the next three to five petacycles although not required to do so by the terms of our highly pleasing and mutually beneficial agreement or indeed by the general treaty framework existing between our two most excellent peoples i am both as a profound admirer of our nariscene friends and allies and as a personal expression of the love and respect felt between yourself and me either of which consideration would naturally entirely and wholly constitute an unarguable reason for said happy to inform you that this minor and surely by mutual consent intrinsically untroubling asset relocation has been made necessary by the deterioration in the relationship between the nariscenes client species the octinheritors and the aultridia said dispute remaining at the moment fortunately still specific to the subject shellworld while not of course in any way wishing to anticipate any measure or precaution our vastly esteemed and wise colleagues the nariscene might wish to put in place and entirely in the blessed and happy knowledge that whatever action we might seek as here to carry out to ensure the continuing viability and security of sursamen will be but of a piece with and complementary to those the nariscene will doubtless themselves wish to consider it was felt that inaction at this point by ourselves might conceivably be seen if subject to the most painstaking and rigorous one might almost label it officious scrutiny to constitute a dereliction of duty and would therefore be of course as unconscionable to ourselves as it would be to you i know and am personally delighted to acknowledge that such is the assiduousness and seriousness with which the dutiful and admirable nariscene people take their stewardship of sursamen and so many other shellworlds that they would expect no less corresponding sedulity from their morthanveld friends and allies such diligence and precautionary care is your byword and we have joyously made it ours our inexhaustible and perpetual thanks for providing such inspiration and shining example this minor and purely preclusionary resource location adjustment will arguably lose some of its efficacy if bruited unduly about our greater society of involved galactic copartners and so i beg that you restrict disclosure of this to the absolute minimum of knowledgees i also specifically request most strongly that you ensure that while the orders and arrangements required to ensure the smooth transition of our vessel and its accompanying units are of course made and carried out with all due correctness and the studied meticulousness for which the nariscene are rightly famed no subsequent record of these orders and arrangements remains in any part of your data system specific to sursamen itself formal notification of such matters will of course be shared acknowledged and recorded by the morthanveld and nariscene respective exemplary council and high command entirely obviating as i am sure you are bound to agree any requirement that such minor and operationally noncritical details need be fixed within the informational matrices of the very fine and efficient nariscene operational nexus command on sursamen itself that is all no more i beseech you to allow me to share with you the indisputable fact that i am so blissfully happy that something so small and unimportant nevertheless confers upon me the elationary privilege of addressing you my good and faithful friend joy to you your ever sincere patron and most dutiful colleague sigiled shoum translated original in morthanveld language added by grand zamerin utaltifuhl distant undernephew by marriage there you have it thats us told i shall on my return be fascinated to hear in some detail from you your version of the events which have compelled our civilisational dominates to make this unprecedented intervention your having one less thing to explain to me will be ensured by doing just as shoum demands you personally will see to it that this is carried out in duty utaltifuhl deputy acting zamerin yariem girgetioni deputy acting zamerin of all sursamen the esteemed yariem girgetioni as he liked to be known the added bit was not official nariscene nomenclature though yariem was firmly of the opinion it ought to be viewed the forwarded signal with some distaste and not a little nervousness though he was careful to hide the latter emotion from the duty lieutenant who had delivered the flimsy bearing the signal he was in his personal cloudcraft floating over the shaped greenery and bluery of sursamens twinned crater he was lounging in a wholebody micromassage cradle watching erotic entertainments and being fed dainty sweetmeats by attractively identical pleasurewhelps he flicked the offending flimsy back at the duty lieutenant just so see to it ah sir it does say that you personally precisely we personally are ordering you to make sure that all that is detailed here is carried out to the very letter or we personally shall crack you from your exoskeleton and fling you into the hydrochloric lagoons is that personal enough for you abundantly sir how splendid now leave the nestworld of syaungun was located in the region of space known as the th pendant floret and seemed almost farcically enormous to ferbin he could understand something the size of a shellworld for all that his background was one of relative primitiveness compared to others within the greater galactic hierarchy he was not a savage he might not understand how the spaceships of the optimae worked he was not even privileged to know quite how the far more crude and limited scendships of the oct operated but he knew that they did and he accepted it he knew that there were levels of science and technology and of understanding and wisdom well above those he was privy to and he was not amongst those who chose simply to disbelieve in their existence nevertheless the measure of the engineering behind morthanveld nestworlds structures built on such a scale that engineering and physics started to become the same thing quite defeated him the nestworld was an ordered tangle of massive tubes within gigantic braids forming colossal ropes making up stupefyingly vast cables constituting loops almost beyond imagining and despite the fact that the transparent outer casing of each tubular component was metres thick it all twisted turned and revolved easy as a length of thread the nestworlds principal components were giant tubes full of water they varied in diameter between ten metres and many tens of kilometres and any individual tube might range over its length from the narrowest gauge to the greatest they were bundled together without touching into larger braids which were contained within encompassingly greater pipes measuring a hundred kilometres or so across also waterfilled these too revolved independently and were also bundled within yet greater cylinders by now on a scale of tens of thousands of kilometres and more and were frequently covered in engraved designs and patterns many scores of thousands of kilometres across the average nestworld was a great gathered crown of tangled tubes within tubes within tubes within tubes a halo world tens of thousands of years old millions of kilometres across and set circumferenceon to its local star its every millionkilometrelong strand twisting and revolving to provide the tens of billions of morthanveld within the vast construction with the faint pleasant tug of gravity they were used to syaungun was not average it was half a million years old the greatest world in the morthanveld commonwealth and amongst the metrescale species of the involveds one of the most populous settlements in the entire galaxy it was three hundred million kilometres in diameter nowhere less than a million klicks thick contained over forty trillion souls and the whole assemblage rotated round a small star at its centre its final open braid of cylinders altogether easily constituted sufficient matter to produce a gravity well within which a thin but significant opportunistic atmosphere had built up over the decieons of its existence filling the open bracelet of twisted habitatstrands with a hazy fuzz of waste gas and debrisscatter the morthanveld could have cleaned all this up of course but chose not to the consensus was that it led to agreeable lighting effects the hence the fortress dropped them into a nariscenerun satellite facility the size of a small moon a sand grain next to a globeencircling sea and a little shuttle vessel zipped them across to the openwork braid of the vast corded world itself slipstream whispering against its hull the star at the worlds centre glinting mistily through syaunguns filigree of cables each stout enough it seemed to anchor a planet this was ferbin thought the equivalent of a whole civilisation almost an entire galaxy contained within what would in a normal solar system be the orbit of a single planet what uncounted lives were lived within those dark unending braids how many souls were born lived and died within those monstrous curling twists of tubing never seeing perhaps never feeling the need to see any other worlds transfixed for ever within the encompassing vastness of this unexplorably prodigious habitat what lives what fates what stories must have taken place within this starsurrounding ring forever twisting folding unfolding they were delivered into a chaoticseeming port area full of transparent walls both concave and convex and curving caissons and tubing the whole set like a gassy bubble within one huge waterfilled cylinder and all arranged to suit airbreathing people like the nariscene and themselves a machine about the size of a human torso floated up to them announced itself as being nuthe b an accredited morthanveld greeting device belonging to the first original indigent alien deep spacefarers benevolent fund and told them it would be their guide it sounded helpful and was jollily coloured but ferbin had never felt further from home or more small and insignificant we are lost here he thought as holse chatted with the machine and passed on to it their pathetically few possessions we might disappear into this wilderness of civility and progress and never be seen again we might be dissolved within it for ever compressed reduced to nothing by its sheer ungraspable scale what is one mans life if such casual immensity can even exist the optimae counted in magnitudes measured in light years and censused their own people by the trillion while beyond them the sublimed and the elder peoples whom they might well one day join thought not in years or decades not even in centuries and millennia but in centieons and decieons at the very least and centiaeons and deciaeons generally the galaxy meanwhile the universe itself was aged in aeons units of time as far from the human grasp as a light year was beyond a step they were truly lost ferbin thought with a kind of coreenfeebling terror that sent a tremor pulsing through him forgotten minimised to nothing placed and categorised as beings far beneath the lowest level of irrelevance simply by their entry into this thunderously stunningly phenomenal place perhaps even just by the full realisation of its immensity it came as something of a surprise then for ferbin and holse to be greeted before holse had finished chatting to the morthanveld machine by a short portly smiling gent with long blond ringletty hair who called them by name in excellently articulated sarl and entirely as though they were old friends no to a morthanveld a nestworld is a symbol of homeliness intimacy their new friend informed them as they rode a little tubecar along a gauzily transparent tunnel threaded through one of the klickthick hab tubes bizarrely he added the man had given his name as pone hippinse he too was an accredited greeter he said albeit only gaining this distinction recently for a machine nuthe b did a very good impression of being annoyed by hippinses arrival the nest a male morthanveld weaves when hes trying to attract a mate is a sort of torus of seaweed twigs hippinse continued kind of a big circle he showed them what a circle looked like using both hands they were on their way to another port area for what hippinse described as a short hop in a spaceship round a small part of the vast ring to a suitable humanoid guest facility the facility the th degree fifthstrand to most people was most highly recommended by hippinse strictly speaking nuthe b began so to a morthanvelder one of these things hippinse said ignoring the little machine and waving his arms about to indicate the whole nestworld is a sort of symbol of their being wedded to the cosmos see theyre making their conjugal bower in space itself expressing their connectedness to the galaxy or whatever its quite romantic really vast place though i mean truly mindboggling vast there are more morthanveld on this one nestworld than there are culture citizens anywhere did you know that he gave the impression of looking stunned on their behalf i mean even including the peace faction the ulterior the elench and every other splinter group casually connected associate category and loosely affiliated bunch of hangerson who just happen to like the name culture amazing anyway just as well i came along he made a strange face at ferbin and holse that might have been meant to be friendly comforting conspiratorial or something else entirely holse was looking at pone hippinse trying to figure the fellow out i mean to remove you guys from the attentions of the media the news junkies and aboriginistas people like that hippinse belched and fell silent ferbin used the opportunity to ask where exactly are we going to the facility hippinse said with a glance at nuthe b someone wants to meet you he winked someone ferbin asked cant tell you spoil the surprise ferbin and holse exchanged looks holse frowned and turned deliberately to the morthanveld machine hovering in the air to one side of the three seated humans this facility were heading for he began its a perfect place for hippinse started to say but holse now sitting sideon to him held up one hand to him held it almost into his face and said if you dont mind sir im talking to this machine well i was just going to say hippinse said tell us about it holse said loudly to the machine tell us about this facility were supposed to go to you can hole up there unmolested hippinse continued the th degree fifthstrand or is a humanoid transfer and processing facility the machine told them as hippinse finally fell silent holse frowned what sort of processing identity establishment inworld alien behaviour legal agreementmaking knowledgesharing what does that mean knowledgesharing holse had once helped a town constable with his enquiries regarding the theft of some tableware from the local county house it had been a considerably rougher and more painful experience than the phrase helping with enquiries implied he was worried that knowledgesharing might be a similar lie dressed up pretty any data held is requested to be shared with the knowledge reservoirs of the nestworld nuthe b said on a philanthropic or charitable basis as a rule holse still wasnt happy does this process hurt he asked of course not the machine said sounding shocked holse nodded carry on the th degree fifthstrand facility is a culturesponsored facility the machine told them ferbin and holse both sat back and exchanged looks i was coming to that hippinse exclaimed in a sudden release of pentup exasperation waving his arms about they transferred to the facility in a fat little ship which swallowed the car they were riding in whole the ship lurched and they were away a screen showed them the view ahead for the duration of the twentyminute journey hippinse chattered continually pointing out sights especially famous or wellexecuted patterns of cables or designs engraved on the cables noteworthy spacecraft arriving and departing stellaratmospheric effects and a few of the favela structures which were not officially part of the world at all but which had been constructed within syaunguns surrounding network of cylinders and inside the partial protection both physical and symbolic afforded by the lattice of mighty cylinders and their accompanying wrap of gases the th degree fifthstrand was a kind of fully enclosed miniorbital fashioned to look as much like the nestworld itself as possible it was only eight hundred kilometres across and until you were right up at it it looked quite insignificant within the loops and swirls of the giant worlds main cylinders just a tiny fingerring lost amongst the openwork vastness of the braided supercables submerged in their accidental haze of found atmosphere close up the facility looked a little like a pushbike wheel they docked at the hub nuthe b stayed aboard it wished them well hippinses long blond hair floated about his head like a curly nebula and he pulled it back and bunned it with a little hairnet their car was released from the stubby ship and floated into and down a curved hollow spoke like a thin twisted tower keen on being able to see through things arent they holse said staring down through the clear floor of the car the transparent side of the hollow spoke and the seemingly nonexistent roof of the miniature habitat below the morthanveld have this thing about clarity hippinse told them the culture wouldnt think of being so rude as to fashion their own places any differently he snorted shook his head inside the facility was a little ribbonworld of its own a rotating loop of landscape dotted with parkland rivers lakes and small hills the air above filled with delicatelooking flying machines ferbin and holse both felt the gravity building up as they descended halfway down approaching a conglomeration of what looked like huge halfsilvered glass beads stuck on to the spoke like some aquatic accretion the car began to slow it fell out of the hazy sunshine into darkness and drew smoothly to a stop deep inside the cluster of silvery globes gentlemen hippinse announced clapping his chubby hands together our destination they entered the gently lit pleasantly perfumed interior opening before them and walked along a curved broadening corridor the gravity was a little more than they were used to but entirely tolerable to an open space dominated by enormous rocks small streams and broad pools all overseen by a host of giant yellowgreen and bluebrown plants joined together by nets of foliage silvery birds flitted silently across the scene overhead the twisted lattice of the nestworld revolved with a silent steady monumental grace humans of a variety of bodytypes and skin colours were scattered amongst the plants streams and pools one or two glanced casually over in their direction then away again a few were entirely naked a lot were mostly so they appeared to a man and woman to be in excellent physical condition even the more alienlooking ones somehow gave off an impression of glossy health and so relaxed in their demeanour that the sight of their nudity wasnt quite as shocking to the two sarl men as they might have expected still ferbin and holse glanced at each other holse shrugged a man and a woman each wearing only jewellery walked past them smiling ferbin glanced at holse again and cleared his throat would appear to be permitted he said so long as its not compulsory sir holse replied a small machine shaped like a sort of squaredoff lozenge floated up to them it said again in perfect sarl prince ferbin choubris holse lp hippinse welcome they said their various hellos a woman compactly elegant darkhaired clad in a long plain blue shift that left only her arms and head exposed was walking towards them ferbin felt himself frown was it really her older so different she walked right up to him the others around him were silent even hippinse as though they knew something he didnt the woman nodded once and smiled in a guarded but not unfriendly way he realised it really was djan seriy an instant before she opened her mouth to speak the falls this is currently our most impressive sight jerfin poatas said waving his stick at the bizarre building looming out of the dim bronze mists the fellow had to raise his voice to be heard above the thunderous cacophony of the falls though he did so with a kind of ease that implied he didnt even know he did it himself oramen thought the fountain building was indeed impressive they were approaching it in a little covered carriage rattling along one of the many light railways which threaded their precarious and often dangerous ways across the islets sandbars parts of fallen buildings and anchored pylons set into the foaming waters themselves the roof and side of the rail car were made from salvage gleaned from the unnamed city a substance like glass but lighter flexible far more clear than any glass oramen had ever seen outside of a telescope or microscope and without flaws he drew one fingertip down the interior surface of the material it did not even feel cold like glass he put his glove back on the weather was chilly in the sky far to facing almost directly down the gorge of the sulpitine after the river had tumbled away from the falls the rollstars clissens and natherley had dropped to the horizon clissens seeming to graze it natherley already halfhidden by it and only the fading rollstar kiesestraal was left to shed any new light on the hyengzhar rising from the direction clissens and natherley were setting kiesestraal shed a weak waterylooking bluewhite light but provided almost no warmth rollstars had a life of less than half a billion years and kiesestraals was almost over nearly burned out it probably had only a few thousand years until extinguishment altogether whereupon it would drop falling from the ceiling fourteen hundred kilometres above to come crashing down through the atmosphere producing one last brief awful burst of light and heat to smack on to the surface of the ninth somewhere along its course and if the star sages and catastrophists astrologers and scientists had been mistaken in their calculations or if their warnings went unheeded cause utter catastrophe where it fell potentially killing millions even with nobody present directly underneath the fall of a dead star especially on to a level featuring a majority of solid ground was an apocalyptic event pulverising earth and rock to dust and fire sending projectiles the size of mountains soaring like shrapnel all about it to produce still further terrible impacts which would themselves birth smaller and smaller successions of crater ejecta and debris until finally all that was left was wasteland its centre scoured to bare to the very bone of the world and clouds of dust and gas and years of spreading dissipating winters terrible rains failed crops and screeching dustfilled winds the world itself rang to such impacts even directly beneath the ceiling of a floor being so struck a human might struggle to notice any effect the structure of a shellworld was so strong but machines throughout every level from core to surface registered the blow and heard the world ring like a vast bell for days afterwards the worldgod it was said heard the starfall and grieved thankfully such catastrophes were rare the last one suffered by sursamen had been decieons ago they were also apparently part of the natural life of a modified shellworld so the oct and aultridia and other shellworld conducer species claimed all such destruction led to forms of creation they assured producing new rocks landscapes and minerals and stars could be replaced new ones emplaced and kindled even though such technology was seemingly beyond species like the oct and aultridia who relied on the good graces of the optimae for these actions this fate awaited kiesestraal and whatever part of the ninth it fell upon for now though as if it was a great wave drawing the waters back before charging furiously back in the star gave out a thin attenuated seep of light and over the whole course of the sulpitine and well beyond including the great inland seas at both ends of the river a partial winter was making itself felt first the air cooling and then the land and waters too as they radiated their heat away into the encroaching darkness soon the sulpitine would start to freeze over and even the vast unending chaos of the falls would be stilled it seemed impossible unbelievable oramen thought looking about at the sudden sporadic visions of madly dancing waters and waves which the eccentricities of fallscreated wind and pummelling walls of spray afforded and yet it had happened in centuries past and would surely happen again the rail car was slowing it was racketing along a raised section of narrow unevenlooking track held above a shallow sandbar by tall pylons the sandbar was surrounded by sweeps and curves of dashing booming waters which looked like they could change course at any moment and wash the sands and pylons away a gale seemed to shake the little rail car briefly pulling away some of the surrounding mist and spray the fountain building soared above them now bursting with curved fountains of water that turned to spray and rain and came dropping all around in an unceasing torrent that was starting to drum and beat upon the roof of the rail car shaking it bodily a chill wind moaned through spaces in the rail cars body and oramen felt the cold draught on his face he wondered if the barrages and veils of water hitting the car would turn to snow as the winter came on but before the whole falls froze he tried to imagine this how magnificent it would look these partial winters were almost unknown on the eighth on that level the ceiling above was nearly completely smooth so that a star whether a fixstar or a rollstar shed its light freely casting its rays in every direction save where the horizon itself intervened here on the ninth for reasons known only to the veil themselves and implied by the equations of whatever fluid physical figurings they employed the ceiling and in places the floor too was much interrupted by the great vanes blades and channels required to make the shellworlds work according to their mysterious original purpose these features generally extended kilometres or tens of kilometres from the floor or ceiling and frequently right across the horizon some ceiling strakes were known to stretch halfway round the world itself the result was that the light of a star was often much more localised here than it was on the eighth so that bright sunshine shone along one line of landscape while just to the side the rest would be held in deep shade receiving only the light reflected from the general spread of the shining sky itself some benighted lands usually those caught between tall surface vanes received no direct sunlight whatever at any time and were truly barren the little rail car chuffed and steamed its way to a halt shuddering to a stop in a screech of brakes some few metres shy of a set of damagedlooking buffers the water crashing and bursting across the cars roof and sides rocking it like a demented cradle steam rolled up from its wheels oramen looked down they were poised above the side of a great tipped fallen building made of or at least clad in material much like that which provided the rail car with its sides and roof the rail tracks rested on trestles like wedges attached to the side of the building itself making it feel more secure than the flimsylooking pylons they had recently traversed metres beyond the buffers the edge of the building fell away sharply to reveal between this upended edifice and the still upright fountain building a cauldron of wildly swirling mist and spray fifty metres or more deep at the base of which on the rare occasions when the clouds of vapour were torn apart sufficiently for such a view to be opened giant surging waves of browntinged foam could briefly be glimpsed a large platform of wood and metal extended from the rail tracks on the downslope side awash with the nearsolid torrents of water falling from the fountain building one or two bits of machinery lay scattered about the platforms surface though it was hard to imagine how anyone could work on the platform in this stunning downcrashing deluge parts of the platforms edges seemed to have broken off presumably washed away by the sheer weight of the falling water this was a staging platform for workings within the building beneath us poatas said until whatever cavein or tunnel collapse upstream caused the building before us to become the fountain building poatas sat alongside oramen behind the rail cars driver the seats behind were taken up by droffo oramens equerry and his servant neguste puibive oramen could feel the fellows bony knees pressing into his back through the seats thin back whenever neguste shifted his long legs in the last row were the knights vollird and baerth they were his personal guard specifically chosen by tyl loesp and most highly recommended and able hed been told but hed found them somewhat prone to surliness and their presence vaguely offputting hed rather have left them behind he found excuses to whenever he could but there had been space in the rail car and poatas had talked darkly of needing all the weight in the little conveyance they could muster to help keep it anchored to the tracks the platform looks in some danger of being washed away oramen shouted perhaps a little too loudly to poatas no doubt it is the small hunched man conceded but this will not happen quite yet one hopes for now it provides the best view of the fountain building he jabbed his stick up at the tall improbably sprayplumed structure which is quite a sight oramen conceded nodding he gazed up at it in the bronze wash of sunsetgloom folds and waves of water came crashing down on the rail cars roof a particularly heavy clump slamming off the near invisible material protecting them and causing the whole car to quiver making it seem that it was about to be thrown off the tracks beneath and hurled across the waterdrenched surface of the railingless platform doubtless to be dashed to smithereens somewhere far below three balls of god neguste puibive blurted sorry sir he muttered oramen smiled and held up one hand forgiving another wave of solid water hit them making something on one lower side of the seats creak chire poatas said tapping the driver on the shoulder with the end of his stick i think we might reverse a way oramen held out one hand i thought i might try standing outside for a bit he said to poatas poatas eyes went round and try is all youd do sir youd be battered down and swept away before you drew a single breath and sir youd get awfully wet neguste pointed out oramen smiled and looked out at the maelstrom of crashing water and swirling wind well it would only be for a moment or two just to experience something of that fabulous power that mighty energy he shivered with the anticipation of it by that logic sir droffo said sitting forward to talk loudly into oramens ear one might experience something of the power and energy of a piece of heavy artillery by positioning ones head over the barrel just as the firing lanyards pulled however id venture to suggest the resulting sensation would not remain long in ones brain oramen grinned looking round at droffo and then back at poatas my father warned all his children there would be times when even kings must allow themselves overruled i suppose i must prepare for such moments i accept the judgement of my parliament here gathered he waved one flat hand from poatas to the driver who was looking round at them chire was that your name indeed sir please do as mr poatas says and lets retreat somewhat chire glanced at poatas who nodded the train clanked gears and then went huffing slowly backwards in clouds of steam and a smell of hot oil droffo turned round to vollird and baerth you are well gentlemen never better droffo vollird replied baerth just grunted you seem so quiet droffo said not sickened by the rocking are we it takes rather more vollird told him with an insincere smile though i can sicken well enough with sufficient provocation of that im sure droffo said turning away from them again the falls are what ten thousand strides across oramen asked poatas as they withdrew poatas nodded bank to bank straight across one has to add another two thousand if one follows the curve of the dropoff and about a thousand strides of that is without water is that right where islands in the stream upriver block the flow nearer two thousand strides poatas said the figure changes constantly so much here does at any one time there might be three or four hundred separate falls within the greater cataract so many i read of only two hundred poatas smiled a handful of longyears ago that was true his smile might have looked a little brittle the young sir has obviously done his book research but it has to cede authority to that which actually pertains of course oramen yelled as a howling gust of rainfilled wind shook the rail car how quickly it all changes eh as i say sir so much here does the mayoral residence in rasselle had been sacked and burned during the taking of the city oramens mother and her new family were staying in the old ducal palace of hemerje while the repairs and renovations were effected built on a wide fertile plain the deldeyn capital had grown according to quite a different plan compared to pourl on its hill with broad treelined boulevards separating a variety of extensive enclaves noble estates palaces monasteries league and guild trading yards and public commons rather than city walls the inner city was ringed with a double set of canals overseen by six great towers tall forts which were the highest buildings in the city and remained so by statute the citadel near the great palace was a giant barrelshaped barracks purely a place of last resort with no pretensions towards luxury in the same way that the great palace was purely a great royal house with little intrinsic defendability every element of the city had been linked through the boulevards and originally by canals later railways before that change after the merchants revolt parts of the boulevards had been built over leaving mere streets between the enclave walls and the new buildings and a muchreduced central avenue in what had been the centre of each boulevard three generations later some of the nobles still complained the ducal palace of hemerje was an imposing tallceilinged solidfeeling building with dark thick heavysounding wooden floors the compounds high walls enclosed an ancient garden full of shaped lawns shady trees tinkling rills quiet ponds and an abundant kitchen garden aclyn the lady blisk oramens mother met him in the hall rushing up to him and taking him by the shoulders oramen my little boy can it really be but look at you how youve grown so much like your father come in come in my masyen would have loved to see you but he is so busy but you must come to dinner perhaps tomorrow or the day after my masyen is dying to meet you and him mayor mayor really of this great city i ask you whod have thought it mother oramen said taking her in his arms ive longed to see you how are you i am well i am well stop now you silly or youll crush my dress she told him laughing and pressing him away with both hands aclyn was older and heavier than hed pictured her he supposed this was inevitable her face though more lined and puffier than it had been both in her portraits and his imagination seemed to glow she was dressed as though she was going to a ball albeit with an apron over her gown her auburn hair was piled and powdered in the latest fashion of course she said im still recovering from little mertis that was dreadful you men you have no idea i told my masyen he was never to touch me again though i was only saying that of course and the journey here was simply ghastly it went on for ever but this is rasselle so much to see and do so many arcades and shops and receptions and balls who would be in low spirits here will you eat with us she asked the rhythm of the days here is so bizarre we still dine at odd times what must people think of us we were about to sit down to lunch in the garden the weather is so mild be our guest will you gladly he told her taking off his gloves and handing those and his travelling cloak to neguste they walked along a welllit hall the dark floors swaddled in thick carpets he adjusted his pace to hers slowing servants were carrying heavylooking boxes out of another room they stood back to let oramen and his mother pass books aclyn said with what sounded like distaste all completely incomprehensible of course even if one did want to read them were turning the library into another receiving room well try selling those old things but well just burn the rest have you seen tyl loesp i thought i might oramen said peeking into the top of one of the bookfilled boxes however im told now he has just left rasselle to visit some distant province our communications here would appear still to be erratic isnt he a marvel tyl loesp is such a fine man so brave and dashing such authority i was most impressed you are in safe hands there oramen my little prince regent he loves you dearly do you stay in the great palace i do though only my baggage has made arrival there so far so you came here first how sweet this way come and meet your new little brother they walked down to the scented terraces oramen stood on a high tower within the vast gorge of recession formed by the hyengzhar looking out to another great building which was if the engineers and excavationers had it right about to fall finally and fatally undermined by the surging water piled frothing round its base much of it descending from the fountain building nearby this would be the second construction whose fate that bizarre edifice had hastened the building he stood on was thin and daggershaped allegedly still well founded the little circular platform beneath him sat at the top like a fingerring lowered on to the very tip of the dagger the building he was looking at was tall and thin too but flat like a sword blade its edges glinting in the tenuous greyblue light of kiesestraal the fading star was almost the only light left now a thin band of sky just a lining across the horizon shone to farpole in the direction of rasselle to facing where clissens and natherley had disappeared some days earlier only the most imaginative eye could detect any remnant of their passing a few people perhaps with slightly different eyesight to the norm claimed they could still glimpse a hint of red left over there but nobody else did still oramen thought ones eyes adjusted or ones entire mind did the view was dull under kiesestraals meagre light but most things remained visible the twinned effect of clissens and natherley being in the sky together had been to make the weather oppressively hot at their zenith hed heard and the light had been too much for many eyes to bear they might be better off under this more rationed portion of illumination he shivered pulled his collar up as a biting wind snagged itself round the towers thin summit there had been snow though it had not lain the river was cold ice starting to form upstream in the quieter pools along its banks further upstream at its source reports had it that the higher sulpine sea the first part of the river system to experience the complete disappearance of the two rollstars from its skies was beginning to freeze over the air was rarely still now even well away from the falls themselves where the stupendous weight of falling water created its own crazed turmoil of forever swirling gusts these could and did focus themselves into lateral tornadoes capable of sweeping men and equipment whole sections of railway track and entire trains of carriages away with almost no warning now as the great wide strip of land on the ninth denied all but kiesestraals light gradually cooled while the rest of the continent about it remained temperate winds blew nearly constantly whining gears in the vast engine of the atmosphere as it attempted to balance chilled and heated parcels of air creating gales that lasted for days on end and great sandstorms that lifted whole landscapes of sand silt and dust from hundreds of kilometres away and threw them across the sky robbing the land of what little light there was and hindering work on the falls excavations as the generators power lines and lights struggled to pierce the encompassing gloom and machines ground to a stop workings jammed with dust the larger sand blizzards were capable of dumping so much material into the river upstream that according to the latest storms direction and the colour of the desert from which it had lifted its cargo of swirling grains the waters of the cataract turned dun grey yellow pink or dark blood red today there were no veils of sand or even ordinary cloud the day might have been dark as night the river still plunged over the cap rock and into the gorge in an ocean of falling and its roaring shook the rock and air though oramen had noticed that in a sense he hardly heard the noise now and had quickly become used to modulating his voice to the right level to be heard without thinking about it even in his quarters a small compound in the settlement a kilometre from the gorge he could hear the voice of the cataract his accommodation formerly that of the archipontine of the hyengzharia mission the man in charge of the monks who had chosen death rather than exile from their posts was formed from several luxuriously appointed railway carriages surrounded by a set of sturdy but movable barbed walls which could be shifted across the sands and scrub to keep pace with the carriages as they were needed a whole system of broadgauge tracks lay beside the gorge and formed the most organised and disciplined district of the mobile city as the gorge recessed and the falls moved upstream more tracks were laid ahead and every fifty days or so the official part of the settlement almost all of it on carriages and rail trucks moved to follow the cataracts unstoppable progress upriver the remainder of the city the unofficial districts of merchants miners and labourers and all their associated supporting crews of bar people bankers suppliers prostitutes hospitals preachers entertainers and guards moved in its own spasmodic jerks roughly in time with the settlements bureaucratic heart oramens compound always lay near the canal that was forever being dug along the bank parallel with the river ahead of the falls retreat keeping pace with the railway tracks the canal provided drinking and toilet water for the settlement and power for the various hydraulic systems which lowered and raised men and equipment into and out of the gorge and removed plunder at night on the odd occasions when the winds were stilled oramen thought he could hear even above the distant thunder of the falls the canals quiet gurglings how quickly he had become used to this strange forever temporary place he had missed it bizarrely during the five days he had spent in rasselle and the four days it had taken travelling there and back it was something like the effect of the cataracts stupendous voice that vast neverending roar you got so used to it so quickly that when you left the place its absence seemed like an emptiness inside he perfectly understood why so many of the people who came here never left not for long not without always wanting to come back again he wondered if he ought to leave before he too became habituated to the hyengzhar as though to some fierce drug he wondered if he really wanted to the mist still climbed into the slate skies the vapours curled and twisted round the exposed towers most plumbly upright many tipped just as many fallen of the nameless city beyond the doomed height of the flatbladed building the fountain building still stood like some insane ornament from a gods garden scattering slow billows of water all around it on the far side of that building visible now and again through the spray and mist could be seen the horizonflat darkskirted edge which marked the start of the great plateau situated halfway up the height of the taller buildings and which many of the falls scholars and experts thought marked the centre of the longburied alien city a wall of water tipped over that edge falling like a pleated curtain of dark cream to the base of the gorge raising yet more spray and mist as oramen watched something flashed dim blue behind the waters lighting them up from inside he was startled for a second the explosions of the quarriers and blasters were usually only heard not seen when they were visible in the darkness the flash was yellowwhite sometimes orange if a charge did not explode fully then he realised it was probably a cutting crew one of the more recent discoveries the deldeyn had made was how to slice through certain metals using electric arcs this could produce ghostly blue flashes like the one hed just seen on the other hand the excavationers and plunderers an easily unnerved and highly superstitious bunch at the best of times by all accounts had reported seeing even more strange and unusual things than they normally did now that the only external light came from kiesestraal and the focus of so much of their work and attention had shifted to the buildings under the kilometreswide plaza where it would have been dark enough even had the days been of normal brightness working in that doubled darkness by crude unreliable lights in an environment that could change at any moment and kill you in so many sudden ways surrounded by the ghostly remains of buildings of near unimaginable antiquity the wonder was that men ventured there at all not that they experienced or imagined anything outoftheordinary this was an outoftheordinary place oramen thought few places hed heard of were more so he raised the heavy binoculars to his eyes and searched the view for people whenever you looked wherever you looked carefully enough the falls so vast so impersonal so furiously of a scale indifferent to that of humanity proved to be swarming with human figures animals and activity he searched in vain though the field glasses were the best available with great wide lenses at the front to gather as much light as possible so that if anything they made the view lighter than it really was but even so it was still too dim to see in sufficient detail to make out individual humans here you are sir you give us the slip and the conniptions in equal measure running off like that neguste puibive arrived on the viewing platform holding various bags and a large umbrella he leaned back to the doorway hes here he shouted down the stairs earl droffo also in attendance sir he told oramen happily not messrs v b though oramen smiled neguste was no more a friend to vollird and baerth than he was oramen had told both knights that their presence was unnecessary he didnt really see the need for such closely dedicated guarding the main dangers posed in the gorge itself were not caused by people and he just didnt go into the parts of the settlement where the violence happened still the two men accompanied him sullenly whenever he didnt take particular care to lose them claiming as excuse that if anything did happen to oramen tyl loesp would crack their skulls like eggs oramen spent quite a lot of time avoiding people he found disagreeable general foise who was in overall charge of the security and guarding of the settlement and the falls was one such the man fanthile had described as entirely tyl loesps was in no way sinister and gave nary a hint that he was anything less than a loyal functionary of the army and the state he was however boring he was slight shortsighted behind thick glasses had a thin neversmiling face and a quiet monotonous voice he was nondescript in most other ways and seemed more like a merchants chief clerk than a true general though his record in the recent wars had been creditable if unspectacular the junior officers around him were similar efficient but uninspiring managerial rather than swashbuckling they spent a lot of time working on plans and contingencies and determining how best to guard the highest number of sites with the lowest number of men oramen was happy to leave them to it and tended to keep out of their way you must stop sprinting off like that sir neguste said opening the large umbrella and holding it over oramen there was a fair bit of spray around oramen supposed every time i lose sight of you i think youve fallen off a building or something sir i wanted to see this oramen said nodding at the great flat building across the miststrewn waste of frothing waters the engineers say it could go at any moment neguste peered forward wont fall this way will it sir apparently not hope not sir between the bladebuilding and the fountain building another flash of blue lit up the curtain of water falling from the vast plaza set across the buildings beyond see that sir yes second one since ive been here ghosts sir neguste said emphatically theres proof oramen looked briefly round at him ghosts he said really sure as fate sir ive been talking to the tinks scrimps blasters and the rest sir oramen knew that neguste did indeed frequent the notoriously dangerous bars smoke tents and music halls of the settlements less salubrious areas thus far without injury they say theres all sorts of terrible weird uncanny things in there under that plaza thing what sort of things oramen asked he always liked to hear the specifics of such charges oh neguste said shaking his head and sucking in his cheeks terrible weird strange things sir things that shouldnt be seeing the light of day or even night he said looking round the darkened sky its a fact sir is it now oramen said he nodded at droffo as the other man appeared droffo kept to the inside of the platform next to the wall he was not good with heights droff well done your turn to hide ill count to fifty sir the earl said with a weak smile coming to stand behind him droffo was a fine fellow in many ways and possessed of a dry sense of humour of his own but rarely found oramens jokes funny oramen leant on the platform parapet and looked over the edge not that far down droff far enough prince droffo said looking up and away as oramen leaned further out wish you wouldnt do that sir me too for all it may be worth sirs neguste said looking from one man to another a gust of wind threatened to pull him off his feet neguste oramen said put that contraption down before you get blown off the damn building the sprays mostly coming upwards anyway its no use rightoh sir neguste said collapsing and furling the umbrella have you heard of all the strange occurrences sir he asked droffo what strange occurrences the earl asked neguste leaned towards him great sea monsters moving in the waters upstream from the falls sirs upsetting boats and tearing up anchors others seen downstream too moving where no boat could ever go spirits and ghosts and strange appearances and people being found frozen into stone or turned to no more dust than you could hold in the palm of one hand sir and others losing their minds so that they dont recognise nobody who is even their nearest and dearest and just wander the ruins until they step off an edge or people who see something in the ruins and excavations that makes them walk to the nearest electric light and stare into it until their eyes go blind or stick their hands in to touch the spark and die all jerky smoking and flaming oramen had heard all this he might he realised have contributed a strange occurrence of his own just ten hours earlier hed been woken from the middle of his sleep by a strange insistent little noise hed turned the cover on the candlelamp and looked round the carriage in the newly increased light trying to trace the source of the trilling sound he hadnt heard any noise quite like it before it sounded like some curious metallic bird call he noticed a soft green light blinking on and off not in the sleeping compartment itself but through the ajar door into the carriages study and reception chamber xessice the girl hed favoured most since hed been here in the settlement stirred but did not wake he slipped out of bed shucking on a robe and taking his gun from underneath the head bolster the light and the sound were coming from a delicately ornate and beautifully turned world model sitting on the desk in the study it was one of the few ornaments oramen had kept from when the carriage had belonged to the archipontine he had admired it for its exquisitely executed fashioning and been almost physically unable to throw the thing out even though he suspected it was in some sense a foreign religious artifact and therefore not wholly suitable for a good worldgodrespecting sarlian to possess now the object was emitting this strange aliensounding warble and a green light was pulsing from its interior it had changed too it had been reconfigured or it had reconfigured itself so that the halfopen cutaway parts of each of the shells had aligned creating a sort of spiky hemisphere with the green light pulsing at its heart he looked round the study the green light gave quite sufficient illumination for him to see by then quietly closed the door to the sleeping chamber and sat down on the seat in front of the desk he was thinking about prodding the green central light with the barrel of the gun when the light blinked off and was replaced by a soft circle of gently changing colours which he took to be some sort of screen hed sat back when this had happened he leant tentatively forward again and a soft androgynous voice said hello to whom do i speak are you sarl yes prince oramen i am warned is so who is talking oramen answered who wishes to know a friend or with more accuracy one who would be friend if so was allowed i have known many friends not all were as they might have seemed which of us is we are all mistaken against there are so many barriers about us we are too separated i seek to remove some of those barriers if you would be my friend it might help to know your name from your voice i am not even sure you are male call me friend then my own identity is complicated and would only confuse you are the prince of sarl called oramen are you call me listener oramen suggested titles names they can mislead as we seem already to have agreed i see well listener i express my fine good wishes and utmost benevolence to you in hope of understanding and mutual interest these things please accept oramen filled the pause thank you i appreciate your good wishes now that clarified our anchor embedded as it were i would talk with you to give you a warning would you now i would in this i do there is caution needed in the burrowings you make the burrowings oramen asked frowning at the softly glowing screen the colours continued to shift and change yes your excavatory workings in the great city these must be approached with caution humbly wed petition to be allowed to advise on such not all that is hidden from you is so hidden from us i think too much is hidden here who would you be what us do we talk about if you would advise us begin by advising who you might be those who would be your friends listener the asexual voice said smoothly i approach you because we believe you are untrammelled you listener are believed to be capable of ploughing your own course unrestricted to the furrows of others you have freedom to move to turn about from incorrect beliefs and unfortunate slanders directed against those who would only help not hinder they mislead themselves who accept the traducement of others by those who have only their own narrowed interests at heart sometimes those who seem most funnelled are most free and those who are most hold there let me guess you are from the oct are you not ha the voice said then there was a pause that would be mistaken good listener you doubtless think i am of that kind because it might appear that i seek to deceive you this is an understandable mistake but a mistake nevertheless oh their lies go deep to the core they are most fastly tunnelled we have much to untangle here show your face creature oramen said he was becoming more and more sure of the kind of being he was talking to here sometimes we must prepare ourselves for important meetings ways must be smoothed gradients negotiated a blunt fronton approach might suffer rebuff while a more curved and gentle path though seeming less honestly direct will break through finally to success and mutual understanding and reward show your face being oramen said or ill think you a monster that dares not there are so many levels of translation listener are we really to say that a face is required to be a moral creature must goodness or evil be configured about eatingparts is this a rule that persists throughout the great emptiness surrounding us many are the tell me now who you are or i swear ill put a bullet straight through this device listener i swear too i am your friend we are we seek only to warn you of the dangers deny you are aultridia oramen said jumping up from the chair why would any deny being one of that misunderstood maligned race so cruelly slandered oramen pointed the gun at the world model then put it up again the shot would terrify xessice and doubtless bring neguste hurtling through from his quarters tripping over himself and probably wake or galvanise any nearby guards by those who theft our very purpose listener prince do no violence i beg you this prefigures what we wish to warn you about talismans our worries that he clicked the safety catch held the gun by the barrel and brought the butt whacking down on the exposed centre of the world model it crumpled and shot sparks some tiny pieces flew skittering across the surface of the desk though still the cloudy screen pulsed with slow strange colours and the voice though weakened now warbled on incomprehensible he hit it hard again it seemed wrong to strike a model of any shellworld wrong to destroy something so beautiful but not as wrong as allowing himself to be talked to by an aultridian he shivered at the very thought and slammed the gun down again on the still glowing world model a blaze of tiny sparks and a puff of smoke and it was finally silent and dark he waited for xessice or neguste to appear or make some noise but neither did after a few moments he lit a candle then found a bin pushed the smashed world model into it and poured a jug of water over the remains he went back to bed beside the gently snoring xessice he lay awake unsleeping waiting until it was time for breakfast staring into the darkness by god they had been proved even more right to have smashed the deldeyn and he no longer wondered at the mass suicide of the brethren sending themselves over the falls there were rumours in the settlement that it had not been suicide some people even spoke of a few surviving monks whod been washed up far downstream with tales of treachery and murder he had started to doubt tyl loesps account of mass suicide but he doubted it no longer the wonder was that the wretches had lived with themselves at all rather than that they had chosen death if this was what they had buried in their conscience all the time an alliance with the aultridia contact with them at the very least with the foulness that conspired against the worldgod itself he wondered what conspiracies lies and secrets had passed between the archipontine of the hyengzharia mission and whatever aultridian master had been on the other end of the communication channel that ended at the world model he had just destroyed had that hideous race even directed matters here at the falls the monks of the mission had controlled the workings supervised and licensed all the excavations and largely policed them certainly they had kept a tight hand upon the main official excavations had the mission been in effect controlled by the aultridia well they were in control no longer and would remain so disempowered as long as he had any sort of say in matters he wondered who to tell about what had passed between him and the nameless and no doubt faceless aultridian he had spoken to the very thought turned his stomach should he tell poatas or general foise poatas would probably find a way to blame oramen for what had happened hed be horrified hed broken the communication device oramen doubted general foise would even understand hed tell nobody not for now he considered taking the world model to the cliff above the gorge and throwing it in but was concerned that it would just be dredged up again by some collector in the end he had neguste carry the thing to the nearest foundry and had them melt it down while he watched the foundrymen were amazed at the temperatures required to slag it and even then there was still some unmelted debris left both floating above the resulting liquid and sunk to its base oramen ordered the whole split into a dozen different ingots and delivered to him as soon as theyd cooled that morning on his way to watch the demise of the bladebuilding hed thrown some into the gorge he consigned the rest to latrines well it all sounds most unpleasant droffo said he shook his head you hear all sorts of ridiculous stories the workers are full of them too much drink too little learning no more than that sir neguste told him these are facts i think i might dispute that droffo said all the same sir facts is facts that itselfs a fact well lets go and see for ourselves shall we oramen said looking round at the other two tomorrow well take the narrowgauge and cableways and britches boys or whatever we need to take and well go and have a look under the great ghostly spooky plaza yes tomorrow well do it then well droffo said looking up into the sky again if you feel you have to prince however begging pardon sir neguste said nodding behind oramen buildings falling over what oramen said turning back again the great blade of a building was indeed falling it pivoted turning fractionally towards them still moving slowly at first whirling gradually through the air the edge of its summit parting the mists and clouds of spray and making them whorl around its surfaces and sharpnesses as it leant diagonally away from the plaza and the main face of the waterfall behind picking up speed and turning further like a man starting to fall on his face but then twisting to lead with one shoulder one long edge came down hitting the spray and the sandbanks beneath like a blade chopping through a childs dam on a beach the rest of the building following on to it parts finally starting to crumple as the whole structure slammed into the waves raising enormous pale fans of muddy water to half the height of their own vantage point finally some sound arrived a terrible creaking tearing screaming noise that forced its way out of the encompassing roar of the falls topped with a great extra rumble that pulsed through the air seemed to shake the building beneath their feet and briefly outbellowed the voice of the hyengzhar itself the poised halfcollapsed building fell over one last time settling from its side on to its back collapsing into the chaotic waste of piling waves with another great surge of foaming outrushing waters oramen watched fascinated immediately the first shocked pulse of waves fell washing back from the heights around the impact site the waters began to rearrange themselves to accommodate the new obstruction piling up behind the shattered hulk of the fallen building and surging round its edges while foamcreamed waves went dancing backwards slapping into others still falling forwards their combined shapes climbing and bursting as though in some wild celebration of destruction nearby sand bars that had been five metres above the tallest waves were now sunk beneath them those ten metres above the waters were being swiftly eroded as the swirling currents cut carving into them their lives now counted in minutes looking straight down oramen could see that the base of the building they were in was now almost surrounded by the backedup surge of spray and foam he turned to the others neguste was still staring at where the building had fallen even droffo looked rapt standing away from the wall vertigo temporarily forgotten oramen took another glance towards the waters surging round their tower gentlemen he said wed best go liveware problem sister ferbin said as the woman in the plain blue shift walked up to him it was djan seriy he hadnt seen her for fifteen of their years but he knew it was her so changed though a woman not a girl and a wise utterly poised and collected woman at that ferbin knew enough about authority and charisma to recognise it when he saw it no mere princess little djan seriy rather a very queen among them ferbin she said stopping a stride away and smiling warmly she nodded how good to see you again are you well you look different he shook his head sister i am well he could feel his throat closing up sister he said and threw himself at her wrapping her in his arms and hooking his chin over her right shoulder he felt her arms close over his back it was like hugging a layer of soft leather over a figure made of hardwood she felt astoundingly powerful unshakeable she patted his back with one hand cupped the back of his head with the other her chin settled on his shoulder ferbin ferbin ferbin she whispered where exactly are we ferbin asked in the middle of the hub engine unit hippinse told him since meeting with djan seriy hippinses manner had changed somewhat he seemed much less manic and voluble more composed and measured are we boarding a ship then sir holse asked no this is a habitat hippinse said all culture habitats apart from planets have engines have had for nearly a millennium now so we can move them just in case they had come here straight after meeting back up one of the tubes to the very centre of the little wheelshaped habitat they floated again seemingly weightless within the narrow but quiet gently lit and pleasantly perfumed spaces of the habitats bulging centre another corridor and some rolling sliding doors had taken them to this place where there were no windows or screens and the circular wall looked odd like oil spilled on water colours ever shifting it appeared soft somehow but when ferbin touched the surface felt hard as iron though strangely warm a small floating cylindrical object had accompanied djan seriy it looked rather like a plainsword handle with no sword attached it had produced five more little floating things no bigger than a single joint in one of ferbins smallest fingers these had started to glow as theyd entered the corridor and were now their only source of light the section of corridor they were floating in he holse hippinse and djan seriy was perhaps twenty metres long and blank at one end ferbin watched as the doorway they had entered by closed off and slid in towards them inside an engine ferbin said glancing at djan seriy the massive plug of door continued to slide down the corridor towards them a glittering silver sphere the size of a mans head appeared at the far end of the evershortening tube it started flickering djan seriy took his hand it is not an engine relying on any sort of compression she told him she nodded at the still slowly advancing end of the corridor that is not a piston it is part of the engine unit which slid out to allow us to enter here and is now sliding back in to provide us with privacy that thing at the other end she indicated the pulsing silvery sphere is removing some of the air at the same time so that the pressure in here remains acceptable all to the purpose of letting us speak without being overheard she squeezed his hand glanced around it is hard to explain but where we are now exists in a manner that makes it impossible for the morthanveld to eavesdrop upon us the engine exists in four dimensions hippinse told ferbin like a shellworld closed even to a ship ferbin and holse exchanged looks as i said djan seriy told them hard to explain the wall had stopped moving towards them they were now floating in a space perhaps two metres in diameter and five long the silvery sphere had stopped pulsing ferbin mr holse djan seriy said sounding formal youve met mr hippinse this object here is the drone turminder xuss she nodded at the floating sword handle pleased to meet you it said holse stared at it well he supposed this was no more strange than some of the oct and nariscene things theyd been treating as rational talktoable persons since before theyd even left sursamen goodday he said ferbin made a throatclearing grunt that might have been a similar greeting think of it as my familiar djan seriy said catching the look on ferbins face youre some sort of wizardess then maam holse asked you might say that mr holse now djan seriy glanced at the silvery sphere and it disappeared she looked at the floating sword handle we are thoroughly isolated and we are all free of any devices that might report anything that happens here we are for the moment existing on the air we have around us so lets not waste words ferbin she said looking at him briefly if you would what brings you here the silvery sphere came back before he was finished even keeping it as succinct as he could ferbins account had taken a while holse had filled in parts too the air had grown stuffy and very warm ferbin had had to loosen his clothing as he told his story and holse was sweating hippinse and djan seriy looked unbothered djan seriy held up her hand to stop ferbin a moment before the sphere appeared ferbin had assumed she could summon it at will though later he discovered that she was just very good at counting time in her head and knew when it would reappear the air cooled and freshened then the sphere disappeared again his sister nodded and ferbin completed his tale oramen still lived last i heard she said once he had finished she looked stern ferbin thought the wise knowing smile that had played across her face was gone now her jaw set in a tight line lips compressed her reaction to the manner of their fathers death had been expressed at first not in words but in a brief widening of her eyes then gaze narrowing it was so little in a way and yet ferbin had the impression he had just set something unstoppable implacable in motion she had he realised become formidable he remembered how solid and strong she had felt and was glad she was on his side tyl loesp really did this she said suddenly looking at him directly almost fiercely ferbin felt a terrible pressure from those clear startlingly dark eyes he felt himself gulp as he said yes on my life she continued to study him for a moment longer then relaxed a little looking down and nodding she glanced at the thing she had called a drone and frowned briefly then looked down again djan seriy sat crosslegged in her long blue shift floating effortlessly as did the blackclad hippinse ferbin and holse just floated feeling ungainly limbs spread so that when they bumped into the sides they could fend themselves off again ferbin felt odd in the absence of gravity puffed up as though his face was flushed he studied his sister while he guessed she thought there was an almost unnatural stillness about her a sense of immovable solidity beyond the human djan seriy looked up very well she nodded at hippinse mr hippinse here represents a ship that should be able to get us back to sursamen with some dispatch ferbin and holse looked at the other man hippinse turned his smile from them to djan seriy at your disposal dear lady he said a little oilily ferbin thought he had decided he did not like the fellow though his new calmness was welcome i think we have little choice but to take this offered help and ship djan seriy said our urgencies multiply happy to be of service hippinse said still smiling annoyingly ferbin djan seriy said leaning towards him mr holse i was returning home anyway having heard of our fathers death though of course not of its manner however mr hippinse brought news regarding the oct which has meant that ive been asked to make my visit what you might call an officially authorised one one of mr hippinses colleagues contacted me earlier with an offer of help i turned that first offer down but on arrival here i discovered a message from those one might term my employers asking me to take a professional interest in events on sursamen so i have had to change my mind she glanced at hippinse who grinned first at her then at the two sarl men my employers have even seen fit to send a representation of my immediate superior to the ship to assist in planning the mission she added a personality construct of jerle batra had been emplaced within the liveware problems mind if that wasnt a sign that the ship was a secret asset of sc she didnt know what would be though they were still denying this officially something may be amiss on sursamen djan seriy said something of potentially still greater importance than king hausks death however terrible that may be to us something that involves the oct what it is we do not know she nodded to ferbin whether this is linked in any way to our fathers murder we also do not know she looked at ferbin and holse in turn returning to sursamen might be dangerous for you both in any event returning with me may be much more dangerous i may attract more trouble than youd have discovered yourselves and i will not be able to guarantee your safety or even guarantee that i can make it my priority i am going back now on business i shall have duties do you understand you do not have to accompany me you would be welcome to stay here or be taken to some other part of the culture there would be no dishonour in that sister ferbin said we go with you he glanced at holse who nodded sharply anaplian nodded she turned to hippinse how soon can you get us to sursamen five hours inshuttle to clear syaungun and synch the pickup after that seventyeight hours to a stop over sursamen surface djan seriy frowned what can you cut off that hippinse looked alarmed nothing thats already enginedamage speed need an overhaul damage them a bit more book a bigger overhaul if i damage them any more i risk breaking them altogether and leaving us reduced to warp or limping in on burst units what about a crashstop five hours off journey time but bang goes your stealthy approach everybodyll know were there might as well spell it out with sunspots still option it she frowned bring the ship in afap and snap us off the shuttle whats that save three hours off the front adds one to journey time wrong direction but a highspeed displ do it please she nodded briskly the silvery sphere reappeared the door that had slid towards them started to slide back again almost immediately djan seriy calmly unfolded herself and looked round the three men we speak no more of any of this until were on the ship itself agreed they all nodded djan seriy pushed herself away towards the retreating plug of door lets go they were being given exactly ten minutes to get themselves together ferbin and holse found a place nearby in the hub section that had a tiny amount of gravity windows looking out to the vast slowly twisting coils of the great nestworld of syaungun which surrounded them and a little bar area with machines that dispensed food and drink djan seriys drone thing went with them and showed them how everything worked when they dithered it made choices for them they were still expressing amazement at how good it all tasted when it was time to go the displace may show up a crashstop certainly will the personality construct of jerle batra told anaplian as she watched first the little microorbital th degree fifthstrand and then syaungun itself shrink in size on the modules main screen the two structures shrank at very different rates for all that the little twelveseat craft they were in a shuttle off the liveware problem was accelerating as fast as morthanveld statutes allowed th degree fifthstrand disappeared almost immediately a tiny cog in a vast machine the nestworld stayed visible for a long time at first it seemed almost to grow bigger even more of it coming into view as the shuttle powered away before along with its central star syaungun finally started to shrink too bad djan seriy replied if our morthanveld friends are insulted then so be it weve pittypatted round the morthanveld long enough i grow tired of it you assume a deal of authority here seriy anaplian the construct currently housed in the shuttles ai matrix told her it is not for you to make or remake culture foreign policy djan seriy settled in her seat at the back of the shuttle from here she could see everybody i am a culture citizen she replied i thought it was entirely my right and duty you are one culture citizen well in any case jerle batra if my elder brother is to be believed my other brothers life is in severe danger the coldblooded murderer of my father a potential tyrant is lord of not one but two of sursamens levels and of course the majority of the oct frontline fleet may be converging on my home planet for reasons still unclear i think i am entitled to a little leeway here talking of what is the latest on the oct ships the ones that may or may not be heading for sursamen were picking up nothing untoward so far last i heard i suggest you update when youre on the liveware problem you arent coming with us my presence even in construct form might make this look too official i wont be coming with you oh this probably meant the construct was going to be wiped from the matrix of the shuttle too it would be a kind of death the construct didnt sound too upset about it you do trust the liveware problem i assume she sent we have no choice batra replied it is all we have available you are still denying it is officially sc the ship is what it says it is batra told her however to return to the subject the trouble is that we dont have any ships in the relevant volumes to be able to check on what the oct are really doing the morthanveld and nariscene do have the ships and dont seem to have spotted anything either but then theyre not looking perhaps it is time we told them to start looking perhaps it is its being discussed im sure would this involve lots of minds blathering it would suggest that they blather quicker one other thing yes djan seriy i am switching on all my systems again all those that i can at least those i cant reinstigate myself ill ask the liveware problem to help with always assuming of course that it is familiar with sc procedures you are not being ordered to do this batra replied ignoring what might have been sarcasm yes i know personally i think its a wise move so do i didnt you notice sir never breathed not for the whole time we were in there save for when the glittery thing was there when it wasnt she didnt breathe at all amazing holse was speaking very quietly aware that the lady concerned was only a couple of rows behind them in the shuttle hippinse was a row in front seemingly fast asleep holse frowned you quite sure shes really your sister sir ferbin only remembered thinking how still djan seriy had seemed in the strange tube of corridor back on the little wheelhabitat oh she is my sister holse he glanced back wondering why shed chosen to sit there away from him she nodded at him in a distracted way he smiled and turned away at any rate i must take her to be he told holse as she in return must take me at my word regarding the fate of our father oh yes i can feel you doing it the drone sent shed just told the machine she was refanging herself switching back on all those systems that she was able to batra happy with that happy enough i wonder how fanged the liveware problem is the drone sent the machine was lodged between anaplians neck and the seat its appearance had changed again when theyd arrived on the th degree fifthstrand facility it had morphed its surface and puffed out a little to look like a kind of batondrone oh i think it might be quite fanged djan seriy sent the more ive thought about it the more strange its come to seem that the ship described itself as absconded that struck me as odd at the time too turminder xuss sent however i put it down to elderly ship eccentricity it is an old ship anaplian agreed but i do not think it is demented however certainly it is old enough to have earned its retirement it is a veteran superlifters at the start of the idiran war were the fastest ships the culture had and the closest things to warships that were not actually warships they held the line and took a preponderant share of the punishment few survived so it should be an honoured citizen it should have the equivalent of medals pension free travel however it is describing itself as absconded so maybe it refused to do something it was supposed to do like be disarmed hmm the drone replied obviously unconvinced jerle batra does not clarify its status correct anaplians eyes narrowed as the few immediately available systems she could control just by thinking about it came back on line and started checking themselves so it has to be an old sc machine or something very similar i suppose we should hope so we should she agreed do you have any more to add not for now why im going to leave you for a bit turminder i should go and talk to my brother steam water ice fire tyl loesp found the boiling sea of yakid a disappointment it did indeed boil in the centre of the great crater that held it but it was not really that impressive even if the resulting steams and mists did indeed assault the very vault of heaven some ancient poet he was glad he couldnt remember which one every forgotten lesson was a victory over the tutors whod tried so hard under the express instructions of his father to beat the knowledge into him with the wind in the wrong direction all the boiling sea had to offer was the sensation of being in a thick bank of fog hardly a phenomenon worth walking out of doors to sample let alone travelling for many days through frankly undistinguished countryside the hyengzhar was far more striking and magnificent tyl loesp had seen the boiling sea from the shore from the water in a pleasure steamer as he was now and from the air on a lyge in each case one was not allowed to get too close but he suspected even genuinely dangerous proximity would fail to make the experience especially interesting he had brought what was effectively his travelling court here establishing a temporary capital in yakid city to spend a month or so enjoying cooler weather than that afflicting rasselle allow him to visit the other famous sites yakid was roughly at the centre of these and put some distance between him and both rasselle and the hyengzhar to put distance between him and oramen being honest about it he had moved his departure from rasselle forward only a day or so to avoid meeting the prince regent certainly it let the fellow know who was boss and this was how hed justified it to himself originally but he knew that his real motive had been more complicated he had developed a distaste for the youth young man whatever you wanted to call him he simply did not want to see him he found himself bizarrely awkward in his company experienced a strange difficulty in meeting his gaze he had first noticed this on the day of his triumph in pourl when nothing should have been able to cloud his mood and yet this odd phenomenon somehow had this could not possibly be a guilty conscience or an inability to dissemble he was confident he had done the right thing did not his ability to travel round this newly conquered level as its king in all but name not attest to that and he had lied fluently to hausk for twenty years telling him how much he admired him and respected him and revered him and would be forever in his debt and be the sword in his right hand etc etc etc so it must simply be that he had come to despise the prince regent there was no other reasonable explanation it was all most unpleasant and could not go on it was partly for this reason he had arranged for matters to be brought to a conclusion at the hyengzhar while he was away so he was here some rather more than respectable distance from any unpleasantness and he had seen their damned boiling sea for himself and he had indeed seen some other spectacular and enchanting sights he was still not entirely sure why he had done this again it could not be simply because he wished to avoid the prince regent besides it did no harm anyway for a new ruler to inspect his recently conquered possessions it was a way of imposing himself upon his new domain and letting his subjects see him now that he was confident the capital was secure and functioning smoothly hed got the strong impression the deldeyn civil service was genuinely indifferent to who ruled all they cared about was that somebody did and they be allowed to manage the business of the realm in that persons name he had visited various other cities too of course and been though he had taken some care not to show it impressed by what he had seen the deldeyn cities were generally bigger better organised and cleaner than those of the sarl and their factories seemed more efficiently organised too in fact the deldeyn were the sarls superiors in dismayingly many areas save the vital ones of military might and martial prowess the wonder was that they had prevailed over them at all again though the people of the ninth or at least the ones that he met at ducal house receptions city chambers lunches and guildhall dinners seemed rather pathetically keen to show that they were glad the war was over and thankful that order had been restored to think that he had once thought to lay waste to so much of this to have the skies filled with flames and weeping and the gutters and rivers with blood and all in the cause of besmirching hausks name how limited how immature that desire seemed now these people barely knew or cared who hausk had been they had been at war and now they were at peace tyl loesp had the disquieting yet also perversely encouraging impression that the deldeyn would adapt better to the state of peace as the defeated than the sarl would as victors he had started to dress like the deldeyn reckoning that this would endear him to them the loose almost effeminate clothes billowy trous and frock coat felt odd at first but he had quickly grown used to them he had been presented with a fine manyjewelled watch by the timepiece makers guild of rasselle and had taken to wearing that too in the pocket cut into his coat specifically for such instruments in this land of railways and timetables it was a sensible accoutrement even for one who could command trains and steamers to run or not as his whim dictated his temporary palace was in the ducal house of dillser on the shores of the sea the pleasure steamer paddles slapping at the water funnel pulsing smoke and steam was heading for the much beflagged dock now beating through waters that were merely warm and gently misted beneath a windcleared sky far mountains ringed the horizon a few of their round rolling summits snowtopped the slender towers and narrow spires of the city rose beyond the ducal house and the various marquees and pavilions now covering its lawns tyl loesp drank in the cool clear air and tried not to think of oramen would it be today had it already happened how surprised ought he to act when the news came through how would it actually be done turning his thoughts instead to dinner that evening and the choice of girl for the night we make good time sir the steamers captain said coming to join him on the flying bridge he nodded to tyl loesps immediate guard and senior officials gathered nearby the currents are favourable tyl loesp asked more the lack of any oct underwaterships the captain said he leant on the railing and pushed his cap up he was a small jolly fellow with no hair they are normally a hazard tyl loesp asked movable sandbanks the captain said laughing and not very quick about getting out of the way either dented a few vessels sunk a couple not by ramming them but by the oct ship moving up underneath and capsizing the steamer few people been drowned not intentional of course just poor navigation youd think theyd do better being so advanced the captain shrugged maybe they just dont care but not a hazard to navigation today tyl loesp said the captain shook his head not for about the last twenty days havent seen a single one tyl loesp frowned as he looked out at the approaching quay what normally brings them here he asked who can say the captain said cheerfully weve always assumed its the boiling might be even more impressive down at the bottom of the sea if you had a craft that could get you down there and back again and could see whatever it is that goes on the oct never get out of their submarine craft so we cant ask them the captain nodded at the quayside well better get us docked excuse me sir he walked back under the covered bridge to the wheelhouse shouting orders the steamer started to turn and the engine exhausted a plume of smoke and steam through its tall funnel before falling back to a steady idling puffpuffpuff tyl loesp watched the waves of their wake as they curved away behind them the last ragged extended cloud of steam from the funnel settling over the creamy crease of sparkling water shadowing it twenty days or so he said quietly to himself he beckoned his nearest aide strike our camp he told him we return to rasselle an uncanny stillness had settled over the hyengzhar allied with the darkness it seemed like a form of death the river had frozen across its breadth the middle channel last still the water had continued to fall across the nameless city and into the gorge even if at a much reduced rate appearing from underneath the cap of ice to plunge wreathed in mist to the landscape of towers ramps plaza and water channels beneath the roar was still there though also much lessened so that now it seemed a fit partner for the glimmer that was the weak paltry light of the slowmoving rollstar kiesestraal then one night oramen had woken up and known something was wrong he had lain there in the darkness listening unable to tell what it was that was so disturbing a kind of terror afflicted him when he thought it might be another device left behind from the archipontines time here awake again now calling him but there was no sound he listened carefully but could hear nothing and no winking lights green or otherwise showed anywhere he turned the cover around the thick night candle letting light into the compartment it was very cold he coughed one more fading remnant of a typical settlement affliction that had laid him low for a few days and watched his breath fume out in front him it had taken him a while to work out what seemed so wrong it was the silence there was no sound from the falls he walked out at the start of the next working period into the perpetualseeming halfnight droffo neguste and the two surly knights were with him all around the usual crowds and teams of men and animals were marshalling themselves ready for their descent into the gorge a few more today than the day before just as it had been every day since oramen had arrived here shuffling and stamping and shouting and bellowing they made their slow way to the lifts and cranes dotted along the cliff edge for kilometres down the sheer edge of the gorge an army dropping into the abyss the skies were clear the only mist rose from the broad backs of some beasts of burden hauling heavy carts and larger items of machinery chunsel uoxantch and ossesyi oramen hadnt even known these great warbeasts could be tamed sufficiently for the work of hauling and carrying he was glad he wouldnt have to share a hoist platform with any of those massively impressive but frightening beasts from the gorge side the falls were a fabulous disturbing sight no water ran no clouds obscured any part of the monumental gulf the waters had formed in the land the view was uninterrupted startlingly clear frozen curtains and shawls of solidified water lay draped over every cliff the channels at the foot of the gorge each of which would have been a great river in its own right anywhere else were sinuous black wastes half covered by sprinkled frosts and snows oramen felt as though he was looking out to a site of some vast butchery an eaten landscape chewed into by an animal of unimaginable scale which had then suffered further diminishing but still enormous quarryings as that first monsters young had come along and each also bitten into the greater semicircle after which some smaller monsters had taken still tinier nips out of the perimeters of those secondary bites leaving bite upon bite upon bite all torn from the landscape all devoured and swept away by the waters and then in all that structured desolation that tiered advancement of fractured chaos was revealed a city beyond the skills and fashioning of any portion of humanity oramen had ever encountered a city on a scale that beggared belief a city of glassy black towers bonewhite spires twisted obsidian blades outrageously curved bizarrely patterned structures of indecipherable purpose and huge sweeping vistas leading to canyons and strata and ranks of glistening glittering edifices one after another after another until only the vertical gorge wall on the far side of the silent falls ten kilometres away intervened half the view was sliced across by the plaza the spaces beneath now also shuttered in by the frozen walls of water draped unmoving over its edges well they can get anywhere now droffo said oramen looked over to where the cranes hoists and lifts were already ferrying whole platforms of men animals and equipment down into the chasm a few were coming back up quitting their own shifts yes they can he said he looked over at where vollird and baerth were both leaning on the railing staring into the gorge even they seemed impressed vollird coughed a sharp hacking choking noise then he gathered phlegm in his mouth and spat it into the gorge are you all right vollird oramen called never better sir the fellow replied then cleared his throat and spat again by god they are a hard couple to like droffo muttered the mans not well oramen said tolerantly droffo sniffed even so this latest cold was affecting everybody in turn the field hospitals were full of those it was striking most fiercely and the scrubby ground on the very outskirts of the settlement part of what was claimed to be and probably was the longest cemetery in the world was filling up with those it had not spared but yes they can get to the centre oramen said staring out to the revealed city nothing hinders them now it does seem to be their focus droffo said oramen nodded whatevers there the latest briefing by the falls scholars and gentlemen engineers had been fascinating oramen had never seen them so animated though of course he hadnt been here long hed checked with poatas who had he said of course they were wild with excitement what did the young prince expect they approached the centre of the nameless city how could they not be agitated this was their summit their climax their apogee from here on the city would likely be just more of the same and gradually less of it as they left its centre behind a slow dying away a diminishing meanwhile what treasure there were structures at the citys very centre deep under the plaza above of a type they had never encountered before every effort was being made to investigate and penetrate that dark frozen heart and for once they had the luxury of time and some surety that the ground would not shift beneath their feet on an instant the falls would not quicken again and the waters wash all away once more for another forty or more days it was auspicious a piece of luck to be grabbed with both hands and exploited to the full meanwhile more of tyl loesps reinforcements his new toilers were arriving with every incoming train eager for work there would never be a better time this was the very peak and centre of the whole history of the excavations of the nameless city indeed the falls themselves it deserved their every energy and resource poatas was personally true to his word having made a new headquarters down in the gorge itself and quartered himself and his staff there in a portion of building deep under the plaza near one of the recently discovered artifacts that appeared by its size and central location to be of particular importance oramen had been given the distinct impression that his own presence at the focus of all this furious activity was not required and indeed might only hinder matters given that when he was around additional guards had to be deployed to ensure his protection and a proportion of people would always stop work to gawp at a prince so inhibiting the expeditious and efficient progress of the great works being undertaken nevertheless he had been determined to see what was going on and had already visited various parts of the excavations even while the ice had been spreading and the waters falling back he had gone unannounced with as few people in attendance as he could seeking to cause as little disruption by his presence as possible he was certainly not going to be stopped from seeing closer up what was going on now that the waters had frozen solid altogether and he especially wanted to see something of this new class of artifact that was turning up he felt he had been kept in ignorance of their importance by poatas as though this latest revelation was none of his business he would not could not tolerate such disrespect they would be flying down on caude the animals complained about the cold and low levels of light but their handlers assured oramen and his party the creatures had been fed a couple of hours before and were warmed and ready to fly they mounted up vollird cursing as his first attempt was wrecked by a fit of coughing it had been so long since oramen had flown he had thought about asking for a practice groundflight getting the beast to pad along the flat and rise up a little giving him time to recall his old flying lessons in relative safety but that would have been demeaning a sign of weakness he had the biggest of the caude and had offered to take neguste with him saddled in behind but the lad had begged to be excused he tended to throw up oramen had smiled and given him the morning off they launched into the air beyond the cliff oramen taking the lead hed forgotten quite how alarming was the stomachlurching drop at the start of a flight as the airbeast fell before starting to gain height the cold wind bit at the exposed parts of oramens face as the caude dropped stretching its wings out even with a scarf over his mouth and nose and wearing flying goggles he felt the chill enter him he pulled on the caudes reins worrying that it seemed sluggish and felt slow to answer the beast pulled slowly up shifting beneath him fretfully as though not yet fully awake they were still falling too fast he glanced up and saw droffo staring down at him from a good ten metres higher vollird and baerth were a little further up still the caude shook itself and started beating across the chasm finally catching the air and levelling out oramen watched it raise its great long face and swivel its gaze to each side as it looked groggily up at its companions the beasts course changed fractionally with each gesture as the creatures head acted like a sort of forward rudder its tail doubtless twitching in instinctive compensation with each movement it gave a deep bellowing cry and beat harder slowly rising to join the others and they flew together for a few minutes oramen used the opportunity to look around for as long as he could drinking in the view and trying to fix it in his mind knowing that seeing the nameless city so close up from a flying beast was a rare privilege then they all went gliding down together towards the temporary landing ground set up near the lumpenly frozen foot of the secondary fall which formed a great dark wall climbing to the edge of the plaza level high above theyd passed over the remains of the fountain building the sheer weight of ice accumulated on its surfaces had brought it crumpling crashing down shortly before the freeze had become complete this is one of ten such littler structures all spotted round the big one in the middle the one theyre calling the sarcophagus where theres most attention as youd expect the foreman told them as they walked down a shallowsloped tunnel towards one of the latest diggings is there any more on the sarcophagus oramen asked broft a bald trim upright figure in neatly pressed dungarees with a conspicuously displayed pocket pen shook his head not really on any of them sir as i understand it the adit sloped downwards into the bowels of some longfallen building following a passage that had silted up when the city had first been buried a string of flickering electric bulbs did their best to light their way though a couple of the foremans men carried meshed lanterns as well this was as much for the forewarning the lanterns gave sometimes of noxious gases as for the light they cast though that too was welcome the air about their little party had turned from chilly to mild as theyd descended oramen and foreman broft led the way flanked by the two men bearing lanterns droffo and a small gaggle of workers some on their way to their labours came behind tailed by vollird and baerth oramen could hear vollirds muffled coughing now and again the passage was smooth save for kneehigh ribs running across the floor every fifteen steps or so these had once been part of the passage walls the building had fallen on its back and they were walking down what had once been a vertical shaft stout wooden boards had been placed across these ribs to provide a level path one corner of it given over to cables and pipes this one is the deepest having fallen from the plaza level sir broft said we are investigating all such anomalous structures out of stratigraphic orderliness for once paying little heed to the integrity and placeinsequence of all discovered objects mr poatas is normally very strict on his integrity of objects but not here they were nearing the pit where the artifact had been discovered the walls here ran with dampness and the air felt warm water gurgled beneath the boards at their feet pumps sounded ahead companions to those theyd passed at the entrance to the adit to oramen the machines were like the men at either end of a twoman saw passing it to and fro cutting into some great trunk many are the theories as you might imagine prince sir regarding the objects especially the large central one my own thoughts oramen was only half listening he was thinking about how hed felt when the caude had dropped away beneath him as theyd left the clifftop he had been terrified first he had thought that he had forgotten how to fly then that the creature wasnt properly awake hearty breakfast or not or ill caude took ailments as men did and there was enough sickness around the settlement he had even wondered just for an instant if the beast might have been drugged was he being preposterous he didnt know ever since the conversation with fanthile the day that tove had been murdered and he had shot the two assassins hed been thinking of course there were people who wanted him dead he was a prince the prince regent future leader of the people who had conquered these people and his death of course would suit some tyl loesp even who would gain most from his death fanthile had asked he still could not believe tyl loesp wanted him dead he had been too sure and absolute a friend of his fathers for far too long but a man of such power was surrounded by others who might act on his behalf thinking that they did what he might wish but could not request even those awful few moments in the courtyard of the inn when tove had died had been poisoned for him thinking about it the fight had started very easily and tove had pulled him out of it and sobered up very quickly well drunken fights did start over nothing and the prospect of violence could sober a man up in a heartbeat but then tove had tried to send him out of that door first and seemed surprised even alarmed when oramen had pushed him out of course hed want his friend to get to safety before he did he thought the danger was all behind them back in the bar and then his words not me or something very like that why that why exactly those words with the implication perhaps that the assault itself had been expected but it should have happened to whoever was with him not tove himself he had just had a knife rammed into his guts and ripped up towards his heart was he to be suspicioned because he failed to scream fie murder or o sire thou dost kill me like some mummer in a play and dr gillews seemingly by his own hand but why gillews and if gillews he shook his head foreman broft glanced at him and he had to grin back encouragingly for a moment before resuming his thoughts no that was taking supposition too far however it worked out he was sure that this morning he should have tested the caude it had been foolish not to admitting his flying might be a little rusty would have been no great disgrace next time he would do the sensible thing even if it meant running the risk of embarrassing himself they came out on to a platform above the pit looking down from halfway up the curved wall into the focus of all the attention a nightblack cube ten metres to a side lying tipped in a moat of dirtylooking water at the bottom of a great shored chamber at least thirty metres in diameter the cube seemed to swallow light it was surrounded by scaffolding and clambering people many using what looked like pieces of mining equipment blue and orange flashes lit the scene and hissing clattering steam hammers sounded as various methods were attempted to gain entry into the cube if it could be entered or at least to try to chip pieces off in all the noise and hubbub though it was the object itself that always drew the eye back to it some of the labourers theyd accompanied filed on to a hoist attached to the main platform and waited to be lowered into the pit still resisting broft said shaking his head he leaned on the makeshift railing a pump fell silent and oramen heard cursing as though in sympathy the light nearest them on the wall of the chamber to the side of the adit flickered and went out cant get into these things broft said turning and tutting at the extinguished light he looked at one of the lantern men and nodded at the lamp the fellow went to inspect it though the object might be judged worth lifting out broft continued the brethren would have left it here to rot or not rot probably as it hasnt already but however under our new and may i say much more enlightened rules sir we might offer the object to a third party which is to say what the lantern man had muttered something into brofts ear he made a tsking noise and went to look at the dead light it was relatively quiet in the chamber for a moment the squeaking noises of the pulleys lowering the first group of workers towards the pit floor was the loudest sound even vollird seemed to have stopped coughing oramen hadnt heard the knights cough for a little while now without warning he felt an odd chill well he heard broft say it looks like a blasting wire but how can it be a blasting wire when theres not any blasting today thats just ridiculous oramen turned to see the foreman tugging at a wire strung with some of the other wires looped along the wall between the light fixtures the wire led down the wall to disappear behind the planking at their feet in the other direction it disappeared into the tunnel theyd just walked down vollird and baerth werent on the platform he felt suddenly sweaty and cold at once but no he was being silly absurd to react as he suddenly wanted to react would be to make himself look fearful and stupid in front of these men a prince had to behave with decorum calmness bravery but then what was he thinking of was he mad what had he decided only a few minutes earlier have the bravery to risk looking foolish oramen swivelled took droffo by the shoulders and forced him to turn with him and step towards the adit come he said forcing droffo forward he began pushing through some of the workers waiting to descend excuse me excuse me if you would excuse me thank you excuse me he said calmly sir he heard broft say droffo was dragging his feet prince he said as they approached the entrance to the adit a glance up it showed no trace of vollird and baerth run oramen said not loudly im ordering you to run get out he turned to the men remaining on the platform and bellowed run get out then he pushed the uncomprehending droffo forward darted past him and started running as fast as he could pounding uphill the boards slamming and quaking under his feet after a few moments he heard droffo following his feet too hammering on the boards whether because he also thought there might be danger or because he saw oramen running away and thought he ought to stay with him regardless oramen did not know how slowly one ran he thought when ones mind was racing so much faster he could not believe that he could run any quicker his legs were pistoning beneath him his arms swinging and his chest pulling the air into his lungs with an instinctive functionality no mentation would improve upon but he felt cheated that his furiously working brain could in no further way contribute to the effort it might be a doomed effort of course looking at it logically rationally it probably was he had been too trusting naïve even one paid for such laxness sometimes one got away with it escaped just punishment rather as hed escaped and tove had paid that day in the courtyard of the gilders lament and maybe tove had not paid unjustly but one did not escape every time nobody did now he had no doubt was when he paid embarrassment he had worried about being embarrassed because he might overreact to some perceived perhaps misperceived threat how much more embarrassing to have missed all clues to have wandered through this violent kinetic world with a babes wideeyed innocence and trust to have ascribed innocence and decency when he should have seen duplicity and iniquity i should just have tugged at the blasting wire he thought tried to pull it free what a fool what a selfish fool together we might the explosion was a dirty yellow blast of light followed almost immediately by what felt like a warbeast kicking him hard in the back with both hind legs he was lifted off his feet and propelled through the air up and along the adit so that it seemed like a vertical shaft he was falling into he was upright and flailing for a long moment then suddenly tumbling limbs shoulders behind head and hip smacking off the surrounding surfaces in an instant cacophony of pain as though a dozen accurate kicks had all been landed at once he blinked up at a ceiling rough wood right above him his nose was pressed against it he might be crushed perhaps he was in a coffin his ears were ringing where had he just been he could not remember there was a crazed ringing sound in his head and the air smelled wrong he rolled over making a small noise as bruised broken parts of his body protested the real ceiling was visible he was lying on his back now the floor beneath him this must be some part of the palace he hadnt encountered before where was fanthile dim yellow lights flickered on the wall linked by loops of wire the loops of wire meant something he knew hed been doing something something he ought to keep doing what had it been he tasted blood he brought one hand up to his face and felt stickiness he squinted at his hand raising his head off the floor on quivering complaining neck muscles his hand looked very black he used it to support himself and peered down the corridor it was very black down there too smoke or steam or something was creeping up the tipped ceiling gradually obscuring the lights further down somebody was lying on their side down there it looked like that whatdidyou droffo it was earl droffo what was he doing here that cloud of smoke was creeping up the ceiling above him droff had lost some of his clothes he looked a bit tattered altogether and not moving the realisation the memory came crashing back on him as though the ceiling had caved in which he thought might be exactly what was about to happen he dragged himself to his knees and then his feet coughing still the cough he thought still the cough he could hear it in his head but not through his still ringing ears he staggered down the tunnel to where droffo lay he himself seemed to be as poorly clad as the young earl in rags all torn and shredded he had to keep his head down out of the dark overcast of smoke still drifting up the adit he shook droffo but the man didnt move his face looked pale and there was blood coming from his nose the smoke was getting lower down all the time oramen bent took droffo by the armpits and started hauling him bodily over the boards he found it hard going so much hurt even the coughing pained him he wished droffo would wake up and that his hearing would return the smoke coming up all quiet and dark from down below seemed to be catching up with him again he wondered if he might have to let droffo go and run away to save himself if he did and theyd both have died otherwise it would be the sensible thing to do if he did and they might both have survived it would be the wrong thing to do how simple that seemed he decided to keep on dragging droffo for the time being hed think about dropping him if he really couldnt see and breathe his back hurt he thought he felt something through his feet but his ringing ears let him down by the time he realised that what he was feeling through his feet might be footsteps it was too late you pay he had time to think next thing he knew there was a rough hand round his nose mouth and chin and a terrific thudding sensation in his back possibly a shouted curse he found he had dropped droffo he wrenched himself away from whoever had grabbed him their grip seemed to have loosened he turned round and saw baerth standing there looking thunderstruck a broken longknife in his hand its blade lay between them on the wooden boards in two pieces that was careless oramen thought he felt round to the small of his back through the remains of tattered clothing found the gun that had stopped the blow and tugged it free you broke it on this he shouted to baerth as he brandished the gun and shot the fellow with it three times just to be sure then after the knight had collapsed to the boards once more through one flickering eyelid just to be even more sure baerth had had a gun too a hand on it at his waist should have used it earlier oramen was glad his ears were already ringing meant he didnt have to suffer the sound of the gun going off four times in such a confined space that would really have hurt he went back to droffo who was moving on his own now youre going to have to get up droff he shouted then hefted the fellow onearmed under his armpit side by side this time so that he could see where they were going and not be surprised by murderous fuckers with longknives droffo seemed to be trying to say something but oramen still couldnt hear the tunnel ahead looked long and hazy but otherwise empty he kept his gun in his hand all the same people came down the tunnel eventually and he didnt shoot them ordinary labourers and a couple of guards they helped him and droffo out back at the adit entrance in the looming darkness of the underplaza all studded with little lights they got to sit and lie down in the little encampment round the tunnel mouth and he thought he heard muffled as though his ears were full of water that somebody had run away you poor sir look at you oh you poor sir a blotting paper neguste puibive was helping oramens nurse to dress him neguste was shocked at the extent of his masters bruising camouflaged you are sir i swear ive seen trucks and things all scattered with dibs and daubs of paint with less of a mixturing of colours than your poor skin no more colourful than your comparisons neguste oramen said hissing in pain as the nurse lifted his arm and his servant fitted his undershirt over it oramens ears still rang he could hear well enough now but the ringing even if much reduced remained and the doctors could not guarantee it would ever fully stop that might be his only lasting damage and he counted himself lucky droffo had suffered a badly broken arm as well as a puncturing of the membrane in one ear leaving him permanently halfdeaf the doctors reckoned his arm could be made whole again they had an embarrassment of experience with every form of human injury in the infirmaries of the settlement oramen had been fairly surrounded by doctors for too much of the time at one stage hed thought a group of sarl doctors was going to come to blows with another clutch of deldeyn medics over some abstruse point regarding how to treat extensive bruising he wondered if they were just keen to be able to say they had once treated a prince general foise had been to see him he had wished him well politely enough though oramen had the distinct impression the fellow was looking at him as he might at a piece of malfunctioning military equipment he was thinking about having junked poatas had sent his regards by note thankfully claiming great and urgent busyness occasioned in no small part by the necessary reexcavation of the chamber partially collapsed by the explosion oramen dismissed the nurse a prim middleaged woman of some formidability and with much grunting and wincing let neguste alone help him complete dressing when they were about done and oramen dressed formally was ready to make his first public appearance since the explosion three days earlier he drew his ceremonial sword and asked neguste to inspect its tip holding it out level with the fellows eyes almost at his nose the effort of it hurt oramens arm neguste looked puzzled a little comical too with his eyes crossed focusing on the swords tip so close to his face what do i look for sir that is my question neguste oramen said quietly what do you look for sir neguste looked mightily confused he started to put his right hand up to touch the tip of the sword leave it be oramen said sharply neguste let his hand fall back are you really so sicked by riding in the air neguste sir negustes brows were furrowed like a field sufficiently deep oramen thought to cast shadows that was a canny absence you had there fellow just when all closest to me were marked to die sir neguste said again looking like he was about to start crying stop saying sir oramen told him gently or i swear ill stick this point through either one of your idiot eyes now answer me sir i lose my latest meal near on sight of an airbeast i swear ask anyone id not wish you harm sir not me you dont think i had any part in this do you sir neguste sounded horrified shocked his face drained of colour and his eyes filled with tears oh he said faintly and crumpled his back sliding down the wall his backside thumping heavily down on the floor of the carriage his knees splayed on either side oramen let the tip of the sword follow him down so that it was still angled at his nose oh sir he said and put his face in his hands he started sobbing oh sir sir kill me if it pleases you id rather you did that and found me innocent later than live apart from you accused even just in your heart a free man a limb to a hair sir i swore that to mr fanthile when he instructed me i was to be your last sticking shield as well as your most faithful servant id lose arm or leg than see a hair on your littlest toe unkindly plucked oramen looked down at the crying youth the prince regents face was set his expression neutral as he listened through the ringing to the fellows handmuffled sobs he sheathed the sword that hurt too a little then leant down to grasp negustes hand slippery and hot with tears and pulled the lad to his feet he smiled at him negustes face had some blood in it now all reddened with crying his eyes already puffed he wiped his nose on one sleeve sniffing strenuously and when he blinked tiny beads of moisture arced from his eyelids calm yourself neguste oramen said clapping him gently on his shoulder you are my shield and my conscience too in this im poisoned by this tooslowseen conspiracy against me im late inoculated against it and suffering a fever of suspicion that makes every face around me look mean and every hand even those that would help seem turned against but here take mine i offer apology ascribe my wronging you as your share of my injury we infect those closest in the very act of caring for us but mean them no harm neguste gulped and sniffed again then wiped his hand on his britches and took oramens offered hand sir i swear hush neguste oramen told him no mores to say indulge me in silence believe me i long for it he drew himself up his very bones protesting at the movement and gritted his teeth now tell me how do i look neguste sniffed and a small smile broke across his face very well sir most smart id say come then ive my poor face to show to the people vollird too had started down the adit carbine drawn then turned back hed been challenged by some surface official shot and killed the fellow then made off into the dark landscape of the underplaza followed by or taking with him reports varied the diggings blasting marshal this man was found later a short way off also shot only a handful of men had survived the blast and subsequent fire in the chamber at the bottom of the adit which had been badly damaged and had partially collapsed the excavations on that black cube mercifully itself probably undamaged had been set back many days poatas seemed to regard this as oramens fault entirely oramen was holding court in the greatest marquee available hed summoned everybody he could think of poatas was there fretting and vexed at this forced absence from the diggings but commanded to attend with the rest and obviously judging it unwise to resist the authority of a prince who had so recently escaped murder understand that i do not accuse tyl loesp oramen told the assembly coming towards the end of his address i do accuse those who have his ear and think they have his interest at heart if mertis tyl loesp is guilty of anything it may only be failing to see that some around him are less honourable and devoted to the rule of law and good of all than he is himself i have been most unjustly preyed upon and have had to kill not one but three men merely to protect my own existence and while i have been lucky or blessed in escaping the fate these wretches have desired for me many around me have suffered in my stead through no fault of their own oramen paused and looked down he took a couple of deep breaths and bit his lip before looking up again if those present chose to interpret this as emotion close to tears then so be it a season ago i lost my best friend in the sunshine of a courtyard in pourl this company lost fifty good men in the darkness of a pit in the underplaza not four days ago i ask the forgiveness of their shades and survivors for allowing my youthfulness to blind me to the hatefulness that threatened me oramen raised his voice he felt weary and sore and his ears still rang but he was determined not to let this show all i can offer in return for their hopedfor forgiveness is the vow that i shall not let my guard down again and so endanger those close to me he paused and looked around the whole gathering he could see general foise and the other people tyl loesp had put in charge of the settlements security and organisation looking distinctly worried at how this was going so it is that i ask you all to be my sentinels i shall constitute a formal watch of some of the most trusted veterans here amongst you to protect me most closely from harm and to preserve the rightful continuance of our heritage but i ask you all to play whatever part you can in the proper security of my being and our purpose i have also sent a messenger to field marshal werreber informing him of the attack upon me here and requesting both a pledge of his continuing and undoubted loyalty and a contingent of his finest troops to protect us all you are engaged in great works here i have come late to this mighty undertaking but it has become part of who i am as it has become part of who you are and i well know i am privileged to be here when the unbaring of the city approaches its zenith i would not think to tell you how to do what you do jerfin poatas knows better than i what needs be done and you yourselves know better than anybody how to do it all i ask is that you remain vigilant as you go about your works for the betterment of all of us by the worldgod i swear we do labour here the like of which will never be seen again in the whole history of sursamen he gave a single deep nod as though he saluted them then before he could sit down and while only the vaguest hint of sound as yet unidentifiable in its import was forming in the throats of those present neguste puibive seated at the side of the dais leapt to his feet and shouted at the top of his lungs worldgod save the good prince regent oramen prince regent oramen the whole assembly or very nearly the whole assembly shouted in a great ragged cheer oramen who had been expecting quietly grudging respect at best and querulous alarm and hostile questioning at worst was genuinely surprised he had to blink back tears he remained standing so that before anybody else there he saw the messenger dash into the rear of the marquee hesitate and stop patently momentarily bewildered by the tumult then collect himself and rush forward to jerfin poatas who tipped his head to listen to the message over the continuing sound of cheering before hobbling with his stick closer to the dais guards at the front veterans of the sarl army barred his way but looked round to oramen who nodded poatas through and stepped down to him to hear his news shortly he strode back raising both arms into the air gentlemen your various duties await the object at the centre of the underplaza the very focus of all our energies an artifact we believe has been buried there for deciaeons has shown signs of life i command and beseech you to work the levels the liveware problem had started out life as a relatively slim d delta shape like an elegantly pointed pyramid after conversion to a superlifter a glorified tug really it took on a blocklike brutality three hundred metres long squaresectioned slabsided only the vaguest implication of its older more slender shape remained it had not cared about such aesthetic considerations then and it did not care now the petalled surround of its field complex abundant as any party dress wrapped in dozens of gauzy layers could bestow a kind of beauty on it if the viewer chose to look for it and its hull skin could take on any design hue or pattern it desired all that was irrelevant anyway the transformation had made it powerful the transformation had made it fast and that was before special circumstances came calling it swung through hyperspace on what was in effect a nearstraight attack path to the star meseriphine deviating only to keep the chances of detection low it had snapped the humans and its own avatoid off the shuttle without incident and scourturned about to head back in the direction of sursamen at something uncomfortably over its designparameter maximum allowed sustainable velocity it felt the damage accruing to its engines like a human athlete might feel a cramp or a shin splint starting to develop but knew it would get its little cargo of souls to sursamen as fast as it sensibly could after some negotiation with anaplian they had agreed it would push its engines to a profile consistent with a one per cent possibility of total failure thus shaving another hour off their eta though even a one in one hundred and twentyeight chance seemed quite shockingly risky to the ship with this in mind it had massaged its own performance parameters and lied the time saving was real but the failure profile was better than one in two hundred and fifty there were some advantages to being a selfcustomised oneoff based on an ancient modified in one of the two small lounges that was all its rather miserable allocation of accommodation could afford the ships avatoid was explaining to the sc agent anaplian the extent to which the liveware problem would be limited in its field of operations if it had actually to enter sursamen it still hoped rather fervently this would not be necessary its a hypersphere in fact its a series of sixteen hyperspheres the avatoid hippinse told the woman four d i can no easier jump into it than an ordinary nonhscapable ship can i cant even gain any traction off the grid because itll cut me off from that too didnt you know this the avatoid said looking puzzled its their strength its how the heats managed how the opacity comes about i knew shellworlds were fourdimensional anaplian admitted frowning it was one of those things that shed learned only long after leaving the place in a sense knowing this before shed left would have been fairly meaningless a sowhat fact when you lived in a shellworld you just accepted them for what they appeared to be same as if you lived on the surface of an ordinary rocky planet or within the waters or gases of a waterworld or a gas giant that shellworlds had such a profound and extensive fourdimensional component only made any difference once you knew what fourdimensionality implied and allowed in the first place access to hyperspace in two handy directions contact with the universesseparating energy grids so that ships could exploit their many fascinating properties and the easy ability of anything with the appropriate talent to shift something entirely into hyperspace and then make it reappear in threedimensional space through any amount of conventional solidity as though by magic you got used to that sort of capability in a sense the more inexplicable and supernatural these skills seemed before you learned how they were done the less you thought about them afterwards they went from being dismissible due to their essential absurdity to being accepted without thought because thinking cogently about them was itself so demanding what i had not realised anaplian said is that that means theyre closed off to ships theyre not closed off hippinse said i can move about inside them as freely as any other threedimensional entity of my size its just that i cant move about in the extra fourth dimension that im used to and designed for and i cant use my main engines so youd rather stay out precisely what about displacing same problem from outside i can displace down into open towerends lineofsight within a level is possible too if i can get inside somehow but thatd be all and of course once inside i couldnt displace back to outside but you can displace items short distance yes anaplian frowned what would happen if you did try to displace into d matter something a lot like an am explosion really good as not recommended wouldnt want to break a shellworld they are not easily broken not with all that d structure what are in effect a shellworlds operating instructions say you can let off thermonuclear weapons inside them without voiding the warranty as long as you steer clear of secondary structure and anyway the internal stars are basically thermonukes and a bundle of exotic matter the most elderly of which have been trying to burn their way through the ceiling of their shell for deciaeons all the same antimatter weaponry is banned inside and a misplaced displace would have a highly similar profile if and when i do have to do any displacing itll be very very carefully is antimatter banned entirely anaplian asked sounding worried most of the highend gear i work with uses am reactors and batteries she scratched the back of her neck grimacing i even have one inside my head in theory as long as its not weaponry its allowed the ship told her in practice i wouldnt mention it very well anaplian said sighing your fields will they work yes running on internal power so limited and you can go in if you have to i can go in the ship confirmed through hippinse sounding unhappy im preparing to reconfigure engine and other matter to reaction mass reaction mass djan seriy said looking sceptical to be used in a deeply retro fusion drive im also putting together hippinse said with an embarrassedsounding sigh he was himself looking reconfigured becoming taller and less rotund with every passing day oh dear anaplian said thinking it seemed called for yes the ships avatoid said with evident distaste i am preparing to turn myself into a rocket theyre saying some terrible things about you sir where they mention you at all any more thank you holse however i am scarcely concerned with the degree to which my own reputation has been defamed by that tyrantinwaiting tyl loesp ferbin said lying the state of our home and the fate of my brother is all that matters to me just as well sir holse said staring at the display hovering in midair in front of him ferbin sat nearby inspecting another holoscreen holse shook his head theyve painted you as a proper rapscallion he whistled at something on the screen now i know youve never done that holse ferbin said sharply my brother lives tyl loesp goes unpunished and disports himself round the ninth the deldeyn are entirely defeated the army is partially disbanded the nameless city is more than half revealed and were told the oct gather round sursamen these things are of far greater import would you not agree course i do sir holse agreed then to those things attend not gossip germed by my enemies just as you say sir they were reading material about sursamen and the eighth and now the ninth from news services run by the oct the nariscene and the morthanveld as commented upon by people artificial minds and what appeared to be nonofficial but somehow still respected organisations from within the culture all of it expressed in commendably succinct and clear sarlian ferbin hadnt known whether to be flattered that they drew so much attention or insulted that they were so spied upon he had searched in vain or at least he had asked the ship to search for unsuccessfully any sort of verbatim recordings of the sort xide hyrlis had suggested might exist of what had happened to his father but had found none djan seriy had already told him such records did not appear to exist but he had wanted to check all highly interesting ferbin agreed sitting back in his almost excessively accommodating seat they were in the ships other small lounge area one short sleep and a halfday into their journey i wonder what the latest information is regarding the oct ships ferbins voice trailed off as he inadvertently read another vicious exaggeration regarding his own past behaviour what do you want to know the ships voice asked making holse jump ferbin collected himself the oct ships he said are they really there around sursamen we dont know the ship admitted have the morthanveld been told the oct might be gathering there ferbin asked it has been decided that theyll be told very shortly after we arrive the ship said i see ferbin nodded wisely how very shortly afterwards holse asked the ship hesitated as though thinking very very shortly afterwards it said would that be a coincidence holse enquired not exactly he died in his armour in that sense he died well ferbin shook his head he died on a table like a spayed cur djan seriy he told her like some traitor of old broken and cruelled made most filthy sport of he would not have wished upon himself what i saw happen to him believe me his sister lowered her head for a few moments they had been left alone after their first substantial meal aboard the liveware problem sitting in the smaller lounge on a conversation seat shaped like a sine wave she looked up again and said and it was tyl loesp himself i mean at the very it was his hand sister ferbin looked deep into djan seriys eyes he twisted the life from our fathers heart and made all possible anguish in his mind too in case that in his breast was somehow insufficient he told him he would order massacre in his name both that day on the battlefield around the xiliskine and later when the army invaded the deldeyn level he would claim that father had demanded such against tyl loesps advice all to blacken his name he scorned him in those last moments sister told him the game was always greater than hed known as though my father was not ever the one to see furthest djan seriy frowned momentarily what do you think he meant by that she asked the game was always greater than hed known ferbin tutted in exasperation i think he meant to taunt our father grasping anything to hand to hurt him with hmm djan seriy said ferbin sat closer to his sister he would want us to revenge him of that im sure djan seriy im sure he would i am not illusioned in this sister i know it is you who holds the power between us but can you will you what kill mertis tyl loesp ferbin clutched at her hand yes no she shook her head took her hand away i can find him take him deliver him but this is not a matter for summary justice ferbin he should suffer the ignominy of a trial and the contempt of those he once commanded then you can imprison him for ever or kill him if thats still how we do these things but its not my place to murder him this is an affair of state and ill be present on that level in a purely personal capacity the orders i have now have nothing to do with him she reached out squeezed her brothers hand hausk was a king before he was a father ferbin he was not intentionally cruel to us and he loved us in his own way im sure but we were never his priority he would not thank you for putting your personal animosity and thirst for revenge above the needs of the state he made great and expected his sons to make greater will you try to stop me ferbin asked sounding bitter should i take aim at tyl loesp djan seriy patted his hand only verbally she said but ill start now do not use the death of this man to make you feel better use his fate whatever it may be to make your kingdom better i never wanted it to be my kingdom ferbin said and looked away taking a deep breath anaplian watched him studying the set of his body and what she could still see of his expression and thought how much and how little he had changed he was of course much more mature than he had been fifteen years ago but he had changed in ways that she might not have expected and probably had changed quite recently just due to all the things that had happened since their father had been killed he seemed more serious less selfobsessed and much less selfish in his pleasures and aims now she got the impression especially after a few brief conversations with choubris himself that holse would never have followed the old ferbin so far or so faithfully what had not changed was his lack of desire to be king she wondered how much he thought she had changed but knew there was almost no comparison she still had all her memories of childhood and early adolescence she appeared vaguely similar to how shed looked when shed left and she could contrive to sound much like her old self but in every other regard she was another person altogether she used her neural lace to listen in to the liveware problems systems talking to each other quickly took in a compensated view of the gulf of space ahead of the rushing ship updated herself on any news from sursamen and then from elsewhere shared a casual handshake with turminder xuss quiescent in her cabin and then monitored her brother closely listening to his heartbeat sensing his skin conductivity his blood pressure implied core temperature and temperature distribution as well as the state of his slightly tense tautened muscles he was grinding his teeth though he probably wasnt aware of it himself she felt she ought to jolly ferbin out of what might be a dark mood but was not sure she herself was in the mood to do so she glanded sperk and soon was is director general shoum still on sursamen anaplian asked no hippinse said left fortyplus days ago continuing her tour of morthanveld possessions and protectorates in the lesser spine but she is contactable once were down there definitely at the moment shes here in transit between asulious iv and grahy on the cat cleavehull on first seeing jhiriit due to arrive grahy fourteen hours after we make sursamen without the crashstop hippinse added archly the avatoid had changed further just in the last day and was now positively muscular he still looked burly compared to the two sarl men but he appeared far fitter and athletic than he had when theyd first met him a few days earlier even his blond hair was cropped and businesslike similar to djan seriys the central holodisplay they were seated around spun to show where shoums ship was now then rotated smoothly back to where it had been holse remembered the display of the dreadful planet bulthmaas and xide hyrlis face lit from below the display was falsecoloured all the stars were white sursamen was a gently blinking red dot hard by its star meseriphine the liveware problem was an even tinier strobing blue point trailing a fading aquamarine wake the positions of other major ships where known were also shown colourcoded morthanveld craft were green the oct colour was blue their possible presence was implied by a faint tinge all around sursamen djan seriy looked at ferbin you think shoum will facilitate our travel to the eighth if we have any problems with the nariscene or the oct she took some considerable interest in our plight ferbin said it was she who arranged our conveyance to xide hyrlis for all that that proved a futile expedition ferbin did not try to suppress a sneer she found my quest for justice romantic i recall he looked at his sister and shook his head she might be termed sympathetic however it could be just a passing sympathy i cannot say djan seriy shrugged still this is worth keeping in mind i think she said shouldnt be an issue hippinse said with luck the oct systems will be breezeable and the nariscene wont be alerted i should be able to drop you straight into a lift maybe even a scendship that as you say is with luck anaplian said i am thinking about if luck is not with us she looked quizzically at hippinse oramen is still at the falls is that correct last we heard yes the ship said through its avatoid though the information is eight days old at least the octaultridia tussling between levels is making communications unreliable how bad is this socalled tussling anaplian asked about as bad as it can get before the nariscene would be obliged to step in the avatoid paused im a little surprised they havent already anaplian frowned do they shoot at each other no hippinse said theyre not supposed to within the towers or near any secondary structure mostly the dispute involves taking over towers using blocking scendships and remote reconfiguring of doorcontrol fidelities is this going to help or hinder us could go either way multiplier rather than a valuer djan seriy sat back very well she said this is what will happen we four descend together to sursamen surface we have to try and get down through the levels before anybody works out we shouldnt have got to the meseriphine system so quickly and starts asking what ship brought us she nodded at hippinse the liveware problem believes it can get us down and inserted into the nariscene traveladmin system without anybody noticing but short of trying to take over the whole nariscene ai matrix on sursamen arguably an act of war in itself it cannot stop us getting spotted as anomalous eventually so we attain the level of the hyengzhar expeditiously we find oramen at the falls hopefully we tell him he is in danger if he does not know already we also get a message to him while were on our way if possible we do what we can to make him safe or at least safer if necessary then we deal with tyl loesp deal with the ship asked through hippinse anaplian looked levelly at the avatoid deal with as in apprehend capture hold or ensure is held until a properly formulated court can decide his fate i would not anticipate a royal pardon ferbin said icily meanwhile djan seriy continued the ship will be attempting to find out what the oct are up to by seeing if all these missing ships really are turning up around sursamen though of course by then the morthanveld and nariscene will have been informed of our suspicions regarding the oct ship concentration and will doubtless be formulating their own responses we can but hope these will complement the liveware problems though it is not impossible they will be antagonistic anaplian looked at ferbin and holse if the oct are there in force then both hippinse and i may have to leave you alone on minimal notice im sorry brother but that is how it has to be we must all hope it doesnt come to that but if it does well leave you with what advantage we can and what would that be ferbin asked looking from anaplian to hippinse intelligence said djan seriy better weaponry the ship told them they popped into existence within a vacant oct scendship its doors had just closed unexpectedly as far as the cloudily aware brain of the tower traffic control was concerned then it rechecked and found that the door closure was not unexpected after all an instruction demanding just such an action had been there for some time so that was all right a very short time later there was no longer memory or record of it having found anything unexpected in the first place that was even better the scendship was one of over twenty attached to a great carousel device which hung directly above the gaping fourteenhundredmetrediameter mouth that was the top of the pandilfwa tower the carousel was designed to load the selected scendship like a shell into an immense gun into one of the secondary tubes bundled within the main tower which would allow the vessel to drop to any of the available levels the octs tower traffic control computer executed a variety of instructions it was under the completely erroneous impression had been properly authorised and the carousel machine ninety metres beneath it duly dropped the scendship from the access ring above to another ring below this swung the ship over one of the tubes the capsule craft was lowered fitted and then grasped by what were basically two gigantic if sophisticated washers fluids drained and were pumped away lockrotates opened and closed and the ship shuffled down until it hung in vacuum dripping directly above a dark shaft fourteen hundred kilometres deep and full of almost nothing at all the ship announced it was ready to travel the tower traffic control machine gave it permission the scendship released its hold on the side of the tube and started to fall powered by nothing more than sursamens own gravity that had been as anaplian had warned ferbin and holse the easy bit the oerten crater on sursamens surface stood directly over the fluted mouth of the pandilfwa tower and was separated from it only by secondary structure the ship had had no difficulty once it had checked its coordinates several thousand times and displaced a few hundred microscopic scout motes placing them straight into the scendship coopting the octs computer matrices they barely merited the term ais had been for the mind of the liveware problem a trivial matter they had chosen a stealthy approach arriving without fanfare or as far as they were aware detection above sursamen less than half an hour earlier the liveware problem had spent the days of their approach modelling and rehearsing its tactics using the highly detailed knowledge of nariscene and oct systems it already had it had grown confident it could put them straight into a scendship and remove the need for any exposure to the surface itself arriving it found pretty much what it had expected and sent them straight in djan seriy had spent the same time giving ferbin and holse a crash course in the use of certain culture defensive and offensive technologies up to the level she thought they could handle it was a truism that some of the more rarefied culture personal weapon systems were far more likely to kill an untrained user than anybody they were ostensibly aimed at but even the defensive systems while they were never going to kill you that was rather obviously the one thing they were designed above all else to prevent could give you a bowelloosening fright too just due to the speed and seeming violence with which they could react when under threat the two men quickly got used to the suits theyd be wearing the suits were default sootblack their surfaces basically smooth once on but much straked and belumped with units accoutrements and subsystems not all of which ferbin and holse were even allowed to know about the face sections could divide into lower mask and upper visor parts and defaulted clear so that facial expressions were readable what if we get an itch holse had asked hippinse i got an itch wearing a morthanveld swimming suit when we were being shown round one of their ships and it was disproportionately annoying they were on the hangar deck it was crowded even by hangar deck standards but it still provided the largest open space the ship had for them to gather in you wont itch the avatoid told him and ferbin the suit deadens that sort of sensation on interior contact you can sense touch and temperature and so on but not to the point of pain its partly about damping distractive itching partly about preemptive firstlevel damage control how clever ferbin said these are very clever suits hippinse said with a smile not sure i like being so swaddled sir holse said hippinse shrugged you become a new hybrid entity in such a suit there is a certain loss of absolute control or at least absolute exposure but the recompense is vastly heightened operational capability and survivability anaplian standing nearby looked thoughtful ferbin and holse had been willing and attentive pupils though ferbin had been just a little niggled at something he would not specify and his sister could not determine until the ship suggested she equip him with one more weapon or perhaps a bigger one than his servant she asked ferbin to carry the smaller of the two hypervelocity kinetic rifles the ship just happened to have in its armoury she had the larger one after that all had been well shed been impressed with the quality of the suits very advanced she commented frowning hippinse beamed thank you it seems to me anaplian said slowly scanning the suits with her reenhanced senses that a ship would either have to have these suits physically aboard or if it was going to make them itself from scratch have access to the most sophisticated and dare i say it most severely restricted patterns known only to some very small and unusual bits of the culture you know the bits generally called special circumstances really hippinse said brightly thats interesting they floated over the floor of the scendship the water started to fall away about them as the ship descended draining to tanks beneath the floor within a couple of minutes they were in a dry if still dampsmelling near semispherical space fifteen metres across ferbin and holse pushed the mask and visor sections of their suits away well sir holse said cheerily were home he looked round the scendships interior after a fashion djan seriy and hippinse hadnt bothered with masks they were dressed like the two sarl men in the same dark closefitting suits each of which djan seriy had claimed in all seriousness was several times more intelligent than the entire oct computational matrix on sursamen as well as sporting all those odd lumps and bumps the suits each carried small streamlined chest and back pouches and both hippinse and djan seriys suits held long straked bulges on their backs which turned into long dark weapons it was hard even to identify as guns ferbin and holse each had things half the size of a rifle called crews which fired light and a disappointingly small handgun ferbin had been hoping for something rather more impressive however hed been mollified by being given the hypervelocity rifle which was satisfyingly chunky their suits also had their own embedded weapon and defensive systems which were apparently far too complicated to leave to the whims of mere men ferbin found this somewhat disturbing but had been informed it was for his own good that too had not been the most reassuring thing he had ever heard in the unlikely event we do get involved in a serious firefight and the suits think youre under real threat djan seriy had told the two sarl men theyll take over highend exchanges happen too fast for human reactions so the suits will do the aiming firing and dodging for you shed seen the expressions of dismay on their faces and shrugged its like all war months of utter boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror its just the moments are sometimes measured in milliseconds and the engagements often over before youre aware it has even begun holse had looked at ferbin and sighed welcome to the future sir djan seriys familiar the drone thing called turminder xuss had been displaced attached to one thigh of her suit another lozenged bulge it had floated away as soon as theyd been displaced in and was still floating around above them now that the water was all gone seemingly inspecting the dripping interior of the scendship holse was watching the little machine closely following it round the ship squinting up at it the drone lowered itself in front of the man can i help you mr holse it asked i always meant to ask he said how do things like you float in the air like that why with ease the drone said ascending away from him again holse shrugged and chewed on a little crile leaf hed persuaded the liveware problem to make for him djan seriy sat crosslegged near the centre of the floor eyes closed enclosed by the tight black suit only her face exposed she looked oddly childlike though her shape was certainly womanly enough as even ferbin noticed is my sister asleep ferbin asked hippinse quietly the avatoid a compact powerfullooking figure now smiled shes just checking the scendships systems ive already done that but it does no harm to verify so are we successfully on our way ferbin asked he noticed that the avatoid had rolled the head part of his suit right back to form a collar freeing his whole head he did likewise yes successfully so far and are you still the ship or do you function independently yet you can still talk direct to the ship through me until we transfer hippinse told him djan seriy had opened her eyes and was already looking at the avatoid theyre here arent they she said hippinse nodded thoughtfully the missing oct ships he said yes three just discovered all at once lined up above the end of the open tower nearest to me strong suspicion the rest will be here or on their way too but we keep going djan seriy said frowning hippinse nodded theyre here thats all nothing else has changed yet im signalling now i imagine the morthanveld and the nariscene will know something of the oct dispositions fairly shortly he looked round at all of them we keep going the transfer took place halfway down the first section of the tower seven hundred kilometres from the surface the scendship slowed and stopped they were fully suited up again the drone had returned to attach itself to anaplians thigh the air was pumped from the scendships interior the door swung open silently a last puff of atmosphere dissipated into the vacuum and they followed it down a broad corridor their shadows advancing hugely in front of them when the scendships door closed all normal light was cut off and they were left with a ghostly image built up from the faint radiations given off by the chilly walls and surfaces around them this was the point at which the ship no longer directly controlled hippinse and the avatoid was newly as alone in his own head as any normal human was in theirs ferbin watched for him to stumble or for his expression to change but saw nothing two sets of thick double doors rolled open in sequence taking them to a great semicircular aperture which opened on to a broad oval balcony forty metres or more across a hard steely light returned picking out several small sleek craft sitting on cradles on the floor of the platform there was no wall or railing the view dropped away for another seven hundred kilometres seemingly to dark nothing above tiny bright stars hung untwinkling level one was a seedsail nursery seedsails were some of the galaxys most ancient biologicals depending which authority you listened to they had been around for either about half a dozen aeons or nearly ten the debate over whether they had evolved naturally or had been created by an earlier civilisation was equally unsettled only arguably selfaware they were some of the galaxys greatest true wanderers migrating across the entire lens over the eons centiaeons and deciaeons it took for them to tack and run and spinnaker their way from star to star powered by sunlight alone they came with their own barely smarter predators anyway but had in addition been exploited hunted and slaughtered over time by those who might have known better though they had been followed revered and appreciated too the present day was a good time for them they were seen as a part of a greater natural galactic ecology and a generally good thing so there was civilisational credit to be garnered by being nice to them sponsored in this case by the nariscene the first or attic level of many a shellworld was given over to seedsail nursery space where the creatures could grow and flourish in their vacuum groundgrowing phase under the relatively gentle light of the fixstars and rollstars before their magnetic coilroots catapulted them upwards they still had to be helped on their way after that caught and held before they could hit the ceiling above by specialist craft which took them to one of the few open towers and then ejected them from there into the harsher environment of their true home outer space ferbin and holse stood a couple of metres back from the abrupt edge looking out at the view while djan seriy and hippinse busied themselves with a couple of the slender little craft sitting cradled on the wide balcony holse offered his hand to ferbin who clasped it they were observing communications silence but when the suits touched they could talk undetected not really that much to see eh sir just the stars ferbin agreed they gazed out over the emptiness they were beckoned over to the two small craft djan seriy and hippinse had been working on the dark curved canopies of the craft like sections cut from a huge seashell stood raised they were motioned to sit inside the craft were built to carry six nariscene rather than two humans but the suits made them as comfortable as possible impersonating seats djan seriy and hippinse piloted one each the craft rose silently from the balcony and darted straight out into the darkness accelerating hard enough initially to take ferbins breath away djan seriy reached back and touched his ankle with one finger are you all right ferbin she asked perfectly well thank you he told her so far so good brother we are still within the main sequence of our plan delighted to hear it the two little craft tore across the dark landscape far below curving lazily round intervening towers half an hour and a twelfth of the world away they slowed and dropped approaching the base of a tower ferbin was ready to get out but the two little craft sat hovering a metre above the bare surface in front of a great dark ellipse inscribed on the fluted base at the towers foot they sat there for some time ferbin leaned forward to touch djan seriys shoulder and ask what they were waiting for but she held one hand up flat to him without turning round and just as she did so the dark shape ahead fell away revealing a still darker tunnel behind the twin craft went slowly tentatively down it this bit is fractionally dangerous djan seriy told her brother reaching back to touch his suit with hers again as the two little craft dropped down one of the minor tubes within the tower the ship will be working the surface systems to keep us clear but not everything is handled from there matrices further down and even on individual scendships might take it into their own little circuits to send something up or down here she paused nothing so far she added the two craft flitted from one tower to another over the next two levels the next one down was vacuum baskers territory the home of creatures of several different speciestypes which like the seedsails absorbed sunlight directly unlike the seedsails they were happy enough to stick roughly where they were all their lives rather than go sailing amongst the stars apart from the occasional surface glint there wasnt much to be seen there either another dark transition took them to another tower and across the perfectly black and completely vacant vacuumlevel below the baskers still all right brother djan seriy asked her touch on his ankle was oddly comforting in the utter darkness and near total silence a little bored ferbin told her talk to the suit get it to play you music or screen you something he whispered to the suit it played soothing music they ended up on another midlevel tower balcony similar to the one theyd left from abandoning the two little craft tipped on the floor beside some already occupied cradles one corridor several doors and many ghostly images later they stood by the curved wall of a scendship tube while djan seriy and hippinse both carefully placed the palms of their hands on position after position on the wide wall as though searching for something djan seriy raised one hand hippinse stepped away from the wall a short while later anaplian also stepped back from the wall and a little later still the wall revealed a door which rolled up releasing creamy purple light from beneath like a flood that lapped round feet calves thighs and torsos until it reached their masked faces and they could see that they were facing a scendship interior full of what looked like barely solidified glowing purple cloudstuff they stepped into it it was like walking through a curtain of syrup into a room full of thick air the suit masks provided a view the partially solidified cloud and the everywherepurple light inside it made it impossible to see past the end of ones nose on normal sight djan seriy beckoned them all to stand together hands resting on shoulders be glad you cant smell this gentlemen she told the two sarl men this is an aultridian scendship holse went rigid ferbin nearly fainted it was not even to be a short journey though it might be relatively quick the scendship hurtled down the tower past the level of the cumuloforms where ferbin and holse had been transported over the unending ocean by expanded version five zourd months before past the level beneath where pelagic kites and avians roamed the airs above a shallow ocean dotted with sunlit islands past the one beneath that where naiant tendrils swarmed through a level pressured to the ceiling with an atmosphere from the upper levels of a gas giant then past the one beneath that where the vesiculars monthian megawhales swam singing through a mineralrich methane ocean that did not quite touch the ceiling above they went plunging past the eighth they were sat on the floor by djan seriy who stood the feet or hands of their suits all touched home proper were passing sir holse said to ferbin when djan seriy relayed this information ferbin heard him over some very loud but still soothing music he was having the suit play him he had closed his eyes earlier but still could not keep out the unspeakable purple glow then hed thought to ask the suit to block it which it did he shivered with disgust every time he thought of that ghastly purple mass of aultridian stuff stuck cloyingly all around them infusing them with its hideous smell he didnt reply to holse they kept going flashing beneath their home level the aultridian vessel didnt even start to slow until it had fallen to a point level with the top of the atmosphere covering what had been the deldeyns lands still slowing gradually it fell past the floor of that level too coming to a halt adjacent to the matrix of filigree immediately beneath it jostled itself sideways the floor tipping and the whole craft shuddering djan seriy one hand attached to a patch on the scendships wall near the door was controlling its actions her knees flexed and her whole body moved with what looked like intensely practised ease as the craft shook and juddered beneath her then they felt the craft steady before starting to move smartly sideways and up gradually levelling off moving into the filigree now hippinse told ferbin and holse the aultridia have spotted all is not well with one of their scendships djan seriy told them sounding distracted you mean this one maam holse asked mmhmm theyre following us hippinse confirmed what ferbin squeaked he was imagining being captured and peeled from his suit by aultridia precautionary hippinse said unworried theyll try and block us off somewhere ahead too once weve narrowed our options a bit but well be gone by then dont worry if you say so sir holse said though he did not sound unworried this kind of thing happens all the time hippinse reassured them scendships have brains just smart enough to fool themselves they take off on their own sometimes or people get into them and borrow them for unauthorised excursions there are separate safety systems that still prevent collisions so it isnt a catastrophe when a scendship moves without orders more of a nuisance oh really ferbin said tartly you are an expert on our homeworld now are you certainly am hippinse said happily the ship and i have the best original specification overview secondary structure plans accrued morphology mappings full geo hydro aero bio and data system models and all the latest fullspectrum updates available right now i know more about sursamen than the nariscene do and they know almost everything what do you know they dont holse asked a few details the oct and aultridia havent told them hippinse laughed theyll find out eventually but they dont know yet i do such as ferbin asked well where were going hippinse said theres an inordinate amount of oct interest in these falls and the aultridia are getting curious too high degree of convergence intriguing the avatoid sounded both bemused and fascinated now theres a pattern for you dont you think oct ships outside clustering round sursamen and oct inside focusing on the hyengzhar hmmhmm very interesting ferbin got the impression that inhuman avatar of a godlike optimae superspaceship or not the being was basically talking to itself at this point by the way mr hippinse holse said is it really all right to wet oneself in these things absolutely hippinse said as though holse had proposed a toast all gets used feel free ferbin rolled his eyes though he was glad that holse probably could not see oh thats better were here djan seriy said ferbin had fallen asleep the suit seemed to have reduced the volume of the music it had been playing it swelled again now as he woke up he told it to stop they were still surrounded by the horrible purple glow good navigating hippinse said thank you djan seriy replied a drop then so it would appear anaplian agreed brother mr holse we were unable to make the landfall we wanted to too many aultridian scendships trying to block us and too many doors closed off she glanced at hippinse who had a blank expression on his face and seemed to have lost his earlier good humour plus something alarmingly capable of procedural corruption and instruction manipulation appears to be loose in the data systems of this part of the world she added she grinned in what was probably meant to be an encouraging manner so instead weve transited to another tower ascended it and then made off into its filigree and come to a dead end were in an oversquare level so theres no onward connections a dead end ferbin said were they never to be released from this cloying purple filth yes so we have to drop drop walk this way djan seriy said turning the scendships door rolled up revealing darkness they all got to their feet pushed through the thickfeeling curtain at the entrance and were suddenly free of the glutinous purple stuff filling the scendships interior ferbin looked down at his arms chest and legs expecting to see some of the ghastly material still adhering to him but there was happily no trace he doubted theyd shrugged off the notorious smell so easily they were standing on a narrow platform lit only by the purple glare from behind the wall above curved up and over them following the shape of the scendships hull djan seriy looked at the bulge on her thigh the drone turminder xuss detached itself and floated up to the dark line where the door had buried itself in the ships hull it twisted itself slowly into the material as though it was no more substantial than the glowing purple mass beneath long hanging strands of hull and other material worked their way out along the little machines body and drooped down swaying the drone rosily glowing folds of light pulsing about its body finished by stationing itself midway between the scendships hull and the wall of the chamber and floating there for a moment there was an alarming groaning noise and the hull of the ship around the hole bulged inwards by about a hands span exactly as though an invisible sphere a metre across was being pressed into it the wall directly opposite made creaking popping noises too try closing that turminder xuss said with what sounded like relish djan seriy nodded this way they passed through a small door into the closedoff end of the channel the scendship travelled within a twentymetrediameter concavity at whose centre up some complicated steps that were more like handrails another small round door was set they entered it and found themselves inside a spherical space three metres or so across struggling to stand up all at once on its bowled floor djan seriy closed the door theyd come through and pointed to a similar one set straight across from it that one leads to the outside thats where we drop from one at a time me first hippinse last this drop maam holse said were fourteen hundred kilometres above the deldeyn province of sull anaplian told him we ambientdrop not using ag through nearly a thousand klicks of nearvacuum and then hit the atmosphere then its an assisted glide to the hyengzhar again leaving suit antigravity off it could show she looked at ferbin and holse you dont have to do a thing your suits will take care of everything just enjoy the view were still in comms blackout but dont forget you can always talk to your suit if you need to ask any questions about whats going on okay lets go there had not ferbin reflected as his sister swung open the circular door really been enough time between the okay and the lets go bits of that last sentence for anybody to say very much at all outside it was dark until you looked down then the landscape shone in great stripes separated by a central band of grey neardark no stars were visible hidden by vanes and ceiling structures djan seriy squatted on the sill one hand holding on to the top edge of the inwardopening door she turned to ferbin and touched him with her other hand you come straight out after me all right brother dont delay yes of course he said his heart was hammering djan seriy looked at him for a moment longer or you could just go limp and the suit will do it all for you climbing up and out i mean with your eyes closed i shall do it myself never fear ferbin said trying to sound braver and more certain than he felt she squeezed his shoulder see you down there then she threw herself out of the doorway ferbin pulled himself up to squat where his sister had feeling holses hands helping to steady him then he swallowed as he looked down at the impossible drop below him he closed his eyes after all but he flexed legs and arms and threw himself out curling into a ball the view was tumbling about him when he opened his eyes again lightdark lightdark light then the flickering sequence started to slow as the suit whirred gently teasing his limbs out his breath sounded terribly loud in his head after a few moments he was falling in an x shape feeling almost relaxed as he lay looking back up at the shady mass of filigree and vaning hanging from the ceiling above he tried to see where he had thrown himself from but couldnt he thought he caught a glimpse of another tiny dark dot far above also falling but could not be sure can i turn over and look down he asked the suit yes it will be advisable to return to this orientation for entry into the atmosphere the suit told him in its crisp asexual voice or it is possible to transmit the view downward to your eyes in your present orientation is that better yes do that then suddenly it was as though he was dropping down into the distant landscape beneath rather than falling away from the view above he felt disoriented and dizzy for a moment but soon adapted he looked in vain for djan seriy falling somewhere below but could see no sign of her can you see my sister he asked she is probably within this area the suit said creating a thin red circle over part of the view she is camouflaged it explained how far have we fallen so far six kilometres oh how long did that take fifty seconds over the next fifty seconds we shall descend another twenty kilometres we are still accelerating and will continue to do so until we encounter the atmosphere when does that happen in about ten minutes from now ferbin settled back and enjoyed the topsyturvy view trying to spot the hyengzhar cataract then attempting to trace the course of the sulpitine river and finally settling for working out where the upper and lower sulpine seas might be he wondered if it was all still frozen theyd been told it would be though he found that hard to believe the view expanded slowly in front of him there was that one of the seas it looked too small was that the other too small and too close to the other one it was so hard to tell the gloom beneath was gradually filling more and more of his field of vision leaving the bright sunlit lands on the edges of the view by the time he was sure those had been the two seas he had begun to realise how high up they had been when theyd started falling how small even two substantial seas and a mighty river could look from a great altitude and how enormous the world he had lived in all his life really was the landscape beneath was bulging up towards him how were they to stop the suit started to grow around him extending a mass of bubbles from every part save that he must be looking through the bubbles enlarged some slowly broke and kept on extending becoming a delicatelooking tracery of what appeared like an insects neartransparent wings or the infinitely fragilelooking skeleton structure that was left when a treeleaf had lost all trace of its lightgathering surface and only the sustaining filigree of its saptransporting veins was left the top of the atmosphere imposed itself as a very slowly increasing sense of returning weight pushing against his back so that as he continued to look downwards even though he was actually on his back he experienced the vertiginous sensation of being propelled even faster towards the ground beneath a faint whispering sound transmitted itself through the suit the push grew harder and the whisper swelled to a roar he waited to see the red yellow and white glow which he had heard things meeting atmospheres produced about them but it never appeared the suit twisted rotating so that he was actually facing downwards now the tracery and the bubbles collapsed back in towards the suit and became crescent wings and thin fins protruding from his arms sides and thighs the suit had been gently reconfiguring his body so that his arms were stuck out ahead of him now as though he was about to dive into a river his legs were splayed behind him and felt as though they were connected by some sort of tether or membrane the landscape was much closer now he could see tiny dark rivers and hints of other surface features picked out in blacks and pale greys in the gloom far beneath however the ground was no longer rushing up towards him but sliding past beneath the feeling of weight had shifted too and the air was whispering about him he was flying anaplian dropped back to touch with hippinse as they flew worked out whats messing with the local systemry she asked hippinse was monitoring the disturbance in the surrounding levels data complexes and analysing data theyd collected earlier while in the aultridian scendship not really the avatoid confessed sounding both embarrassed and concerned whatevers corrupting it is almost untouchably exotic genuinely alien unknown in fact right now unknowable id need the ships whole mind to start attacking this shit anaplian was silent for a moment what the fuck is going on here she asked quietly hippinse had no reply to that either anaplian let go and flew ahead ferbin and the suit dipped passing close enough to the ground to see individual boulders bushes and small scrubby trees all tailed by narrow deltas of the same pale grey as though casting strange shadows gullies and ravines shone palely too as if filled with softly shining mist is that snow he asked yes the suit said something lightly grasped his ankle are you all right ferbin djan seriys voice said yes he said starting to twist round to look back but then stopping himself just as she said there is no point looking back brother you wont be able to see me oh he said so you are behind me i am now i have been flying ahead of you for the last two minutes we are in a diamond formation you are in the righthand position turminder xuss flies a kilometre ahead of us oh listen brother while we were in the tube just before we dropped we picked up repeated signals from an oct news service talking about the falls and oramen they say that oramen lives and is well but there was some sort of attempt on his life nine days ago an explosion in the excavations andor an attempt to knife him it may not have been the first attempt on his life either he is aware he is in danger and may already have accused people around tyl loesp if not tyl loesp himself of being responsible but he is well lightly injured but well enough tyl loesp in turn accuses oramen of impatience in trying to wrest the crown from the properly appointed regent before he is legally of an age to do so he returns from travels elsewhere on this level and has signalled forces loyal to him to gather just upstream from the falls werreber in charge of the greater army has been contacted by both oramen and tyl loesp and has not declared for either side yet he is on the eighth though and is ten or more days away even flying his ground forces would be many weeks behind that again ferbin felt a chill we are not quite too late then he said trying to sound hopeful i dont know there is more some artifact long buried in the nameless city was reported to be showing signs of life and all attention had been turned to it but that was five days ago since then there has been nothing not just no news service but no fresh signals at all from the vicinity of the falls or the settlement or anywhere else within this section the data networks all around this area are in a state of lockedin chaos that is odd and worrying plus we are picking up curious anomalous indicators from the nameless city itself is that bad djan seriy hesitated this worried ferbin all by itself possibly then she added well set down on the city outskirts downstream in about twenty minutes tell the suit if you need to talk to me in the meantime all right all right dont worry see you soon his ankle was patted once then the pressure on it was removed he assumed she was resuming her position ahead of him in their diamond formation but he couldnt see her pass him or spot her flying in front they zoomed over a small hill without losing speed and ferbin realised that they were doing more than just gliding they were under power he asked to look back and was given a view from the back of his head there was a membrane filling the v between his legs and two small fat cylinders sticking out from his ankles the view through them was a blur he looked ahead again just as they went hurtling over what looked like a road some old railway lines and a drained canal then the ground just fell away and he was staring at a flat icy landscape another two hundred metres further beneath a shadowy wasteland of broad frozen waterways slim sinuously curved channels rounded banks and mounds of sand and snow the whole linear winterbound plain punctuated at random by a variety of misshapen shards stumps of arbitrary debris and jagged wreckage from what looked like ruined buildings or sunken ships all sticking chaotically aslant broken and alone from the pitted frozen surface they swooped dipping in towards the centre of this new and pitiless landscape contained by the sheer and distant cliffs on either side when they got to the nameless city arriving over increasing amounts of fractured haphazardly jumbled detritus trapped within the ice and the frozen wastes of sand and snow and mud they could see many thin trails of smoke leading up into the sky from their left above the cliffs on that side hard against the cliffs visible under modest magnification they could make out zigzagging traceries of stairways and the open lattices of lift shafts nothing save the smoke was moving drifting slowly upwards into the quiet windless dim in front of them the city rose its highest spires and towers still some kilometres distant they crossed the first outskirt jumble of short fewstorey buildings and began to slow the suit released ferbin from its gentle grip letting his arms and legs free moments later he felt himself tipped forward slowing still further as his legs swung underneath him and he was lowered and positioned as though about to start walking a small open space in front of him seemed to be their target he realised that the fewstoreyhigh buildings were actually much taller their lower floors buried in the frozen mud and ice his sister holse and hippinse blinked into relative visibility hazily indistinct shapes each ten metres or so away as they set down in the icy little clearing and finally though it might have been in a strange place under no appreciable sun on the wrong level and through soles that would doubtless have insulated him from anything down to absolute zero ferbins feet again touched the ground of home the sarcophagus the object now being called the sarcophagus lay almost in the dead centre of the nameless city it was located deep beneath the underplaza within a building as fat and tall and impressive as any in the ancient longburied metropolis the citys heart was now accessed along a freshly directed rail track the engineers had taken advantage of the freeze to build lines where they never could have before over frozen expanses of river that would have swept any trestles or pylons away in an instant had they still held water rather than ice and straight across sand and mudbanks that would have shifted sunk and reappeared somewhere else in the course of a shift had the rapids still been roaring from the thronging chaos of the railhead an arclit station deep under the plaza whose traffic volume would have done justice to a terminus in a major city the welltramped way led past whistling roaring bellowing machines and piles and coils of pipe and cable along a thoroughfare twenty metres across crowded with pack creatures warbeasts pressed into service as haulage animals steam and oilpowered traction engines narrowgauge trains and more than anything else with rank after rank and row after row and group and company and detail and shift and gang of workers labourers engineers guards specialists and professionals of a hundred different types on a vast raised round structure that lay at the focus of a dozen ramps and roadways original to the nameless city the great packed street split in a score of different directions conveyor belts tramways and aerial wagonways spun off with the roadways all dotted with faint oil lamps hissing gas fixtures and sputtering electric lights what had been the busiest ramp attended by cableways conveyors and funicular lines like toosteep railways with jagged stairways at their centres led across a filledin lake and a broad roadway of thick planking down to the great bulbous building housing the sarcophagus through what had been a gigantic elongated formal entrance a hundred metres across and forty high flanked by a dozen soaring sculptures of cutaway shellworlds and leading to a still taller mouthshaped atrium within the torrent of men machines animals and material had poured that torrent had slowed to a trickle now as oramen and the party which had come directly from the gathering he had held in the great marquee descended to the focus of the city and the excavations the greatest concentrations of effort were elsewhere now principally targeting the ten smaller artifacts similar to the one oramen had gone to inspect when the attempt on his life had been made that particular black cube was subject to the most intense exertions of all due to the partial collapse of the chamber which had been excavated around it the central chamber housing the sarcophagus was similar to but far larger than that around the black cube oramen had seen the excavations had emptied a huge cavity within the building removing mud silt sand and assorted debris that had collected there over uncounted centuries to reveal what had always been an enormous central arena over a hundred metres across rather than an extemporised void blasted and torn from smaller rooms and spaces at its centre brightly lit by arc lights and cluttered by layers levels and platforms of scaffolding and latticed by the resulting shadows lay the sarcophagus itself a pale grey cube twenty metres to a side its corners and edges subtly rounded for nearly twenty days while it was fully excavated a controlled chaos had swirled about the artifact a storm of men machines and movement attended by shouts bangs sparks animal roars gouts and bursts of steam and exhaust smoke now though as oramen finally looked upon it the chamber around the object was quiet and hushed and the atmosphere almost reverential though possessed unless oramen was imagining it of a certain tension it does not look very alive from here oramen said he and poatas stood surrounded by guards at the main entrance to the central chamber a wide doorway stationed ten metres above the base of the shallow bowl at the centre of which the sarcophagus sat on a round plinth raised by about five metres well you should come closer poatas said oramen smiled at the man that is exactly what we are going to do mr poatas they walked towards it oramen found the thing in many ways less intimidating than the pure black cube hed taken an interest in earlier the chamber was far larger and less oppressiveseeming partly no doubt he was simply appreciating the lack of clamour and the object itself though much larger than the one hed seen just a few days before seemed less intimidating just because it was a relatively unthreatening shade of grey rather than the lightdefying black that had so repelled and fascinated him in that other object nevertheless it was large and he was seeing it from below rather than above so that it appeared more massive still he wondered how much he was still suffering from the effects of his injuries he might have stopped another day in bed his doctors had recommended it but he had been more concerned at losing the trust of the people and especially the exsoldiers of the settlement he had had to rise had to show himself to them had to address them and then when the messenger had entered with news that the sarcophagus had shown signs of life he had had no choice but to accompany poatas and his closest aides to the focus of their excavations he felt breathless sore in too many places to count and his head hurt plus his ears still rang and he had to struggle to hear what people said sometimes as though he was an already old man but he was doing his best to appear well and hearty and unconcerned the sarcophagus gave off it seemed to him as he walked up to it an aura of utter solidity of settled stolid almost crushing containment and impassivity of indeed timelessness as though this thing had witnessed the passing of ages and epochs ungraspable by men and yet still somehow was more of the future than of the past oramen assured the makeshift personal guard of concernedlooking rather fearsome exsoldiers whod accumulated around him since his speech an hour or so earlier that he would be all right on the scaffolding with just one or two to look after him dubrile a grey grimlooking oneeyed veteran from many of hausks campaigns who seemed to have been acclaimed their leader by the many exsoldiers whod rallied about him detailed two others to accompany him in looking after oramen this is not necessary you know poatas told oramen while the guards were negotiating all this amongst themselves you are in no danger here i thought as much three days ago poatas oramen said with a smile when i went to view the other object he let the smile fade and dropped his voice and do try to remember poatas you address me as sir both in front of the men and when we are alone he put the smile back again there are niceties to be observed after all poatas looked like hed suddenly discovered a frozen turd in his britches he drew himself up the staff wavered in his hand as though he was putting more weight on it than he was used to and he nodded getting out a rather strangledsounding well yes indeed sir with the guards sorted oramen nodded to the great grey object in front of them now shall we they ascended the ramps to a point at the centre of one of the cubes faces where a dozen or so men in neat white overalls moved hidden from the rest of the chamber by grey sheets shrouding the scaffolding behind them clustered about the platform were various delicate mysteriouslooking machines and instruments of a sophistication patently beyond the capacity of both the sarl and deldeyn they all seemed to be connected to each other by thin wires and cables of a variety of colours even these looked somehow advanced almost alien where does this come from oramen asked waving at the equipment these were traded from the oct poatas said with relish sir he added along with a little facial twitch he positioned himself so that he stood between oramen and the rest of the people on the platform oramen saw dubrile shift behind him perhaps to guard against the unlikely possibility that poatas would seek to push the prince regent off the scaffolding poatas frowned but went on voice dropped almost to a whisper the oct have shown a new interest in our excavations and were most keen to help when they realised we had discovered objects of such advancement sir oramen frowned one assumes their nariscene mentors approved one assumes what one wishes to i dare say sir poatas said quietly the oct i understand through some of the merchants who deal with them would offer us much more help if wed but let them sir do they now oramen said such help was disdained by the deldeyn when they ran the excavations as on the eighth the octs licence here runs no deeper than those who hold the level wish it to and the deldeyn led by the late monks of the mission refused any such aid citing pride and an overpunctilious reading of the articles of inhabitation which someone perhaps wishing to limit themselves and their people in their natural desire and right for advancement both technical and moral a right which surely any enough poatas enough oramen said quietly clapping the fellow lightly on the shoulder the stooped grey man whose voice and manner had grown maniacally intense and feverish in the course of just that single gasped unfinished sentence ceased talking looking pained and stricken so poatas oramen said louder now so that all could hear again show me what brought my little gathering to such an abrupt conclusion of course sir poatas whispered and hobbled off staff echoing on the boards to speak with a couple of the technicians sir if you would one of the whitesuited men said to oramen the fellow was middleaged pallid and nervouslooking though he also seemed excited energised he indicated that oramen should stand at a particular point on the platform in front of a panel on the sarcophagus that looked a shade lighter than the rest of the visible structure sir poatas said may i present senior technician leratiy another man bowed to oramen he was more fully built though just as pallid he wore a set of overalls that looked better and more generously cut than those of his colleagues prince regent an honour sir i should warn you however he said that the effect is one of being read somehow and then having images of well the fellow smiled i ought to let you see for yourself i cannot tell you quite what to expect because everyone who has experienced this phenomenon thus far has encountered something rather different from everybody else though common themes do seem to predominate in the results it would be wrong of me in any case to prejudice your impressions if you will only remember to attempt to recall what it is that you experience and then be willing to communicate whatever that may be to one of the technicianrecorders i should be most extremely grateful please step forward the focus appears to be about here there was a rough square marked on the boards beneath oramens feet he stepped into it one of the technicians came forward with what looked like a small flat box but senior technician leratiy waved him away with one imperious hand the prince regent is of sufficient height he muttered then checking that oramens feet were within the square he said please sir merely stand there a little while if you please the senior technician took out a large pocket watch and inspected it the process usually begins after approximately one halfminute with your permission sir i shall time events oramen nodded he looked quizzically at the patch of light grey in front of him for some few moments there was nothing nothing happened at all except that he started to wonder if this was all some elaborate joke or even a convoluted and overorganised attempt again to kill him he was stood in one obviously very wellworkedout spot might this be where an assassins rifle shot was targeted perhaps even through the grey curtains obscuring this part of the platform from the rest of the chamber the experience began as a tiny dizziness he felt oddly imbalanced for a moment then the dizziness itself seemed to steady him somehow as though compensating for its own disruptive effects he felt a strange sensation of weightlessness and carelessness all at once and for an instant was utterly unsure where he was or when and how long he had been wherever he was then he was fully aware once more but could feel a sort of rushing in his head and a cacophonous medley of everything hed ever heard or felt or seen or known seemed to tear through him he felt like a man sitting in a sunlit room watching a gaudy parade that represented in some detail every aspect of his life since birth all rushing past outside taking only a few seconds to pass and yet allowing him to see and recognise individual bursts and fragments of that longstored mostly forgotten life then it was gone how quickly over then yearning yearning for a lost mother a crown and a whole kingdom craving the love of all and the return of a longdeparted sister mourning a dead brother and the unrecoverable love respect and approval of a departed father he stepped out of the square breaking the spell he took a couple of deep breaths then turned and looked at senior technician leratiy after some moments he said you may tell your technicianrecorder i experienced a sense of loss and a sense of longing both expressed in terms of personal experiences he looked round the others on the platform all of them watching him there were one or two smiles nervousseeming oramen nodded at senior technician leratiy an interesting experience i take it that what i felt was on a par with the sensations others had loss yearning leratiy confirmed those are indeed the emotions felt in common sir you think this qualifies it as being in any way alive oramen asked glancing frowning at the grey surface it is doing something sir poatas said to be doing anything after so long buried is perfectly astounding no other object in the excavations has ever worked in this manner before it could be working as a waterwheel might work or a windmill might work dug out of a similar caking of mud or dust oramen suggested we think it is something more than that sir leratiy said well then what would be your next step leratiy and poatas exchanged looks we believe sir senior technician leratiy said that the object is trying to communicate but can only do so at the moment through crude images the strongest ones the human soul experiences those of loss and yearning amongst them we believe that it may be possible to allow the object to communicate more fully by quite simply teaching it to speak a language what shall we talk babytalk to it oramen asked if it could hear and speak sir leratiy said it probably would have tried to talk to us by now a hundred or more labourers engineers technicians and other experts have been speaking in its vicinity since well before we discovered the curious property you have just experienced what then oramen asked leratiy cleared his throat the problem facing us here sir is unique in our history but not that of others it has been experienced many times before over many eons and by a multiplicity of peoples facing an uncounted number of similar relics and artifacts there are established and highly successful techniques employed by peoples from the optimae down which may be employed to establish communication with just such an object indeed oramen said he looked from leratiy to poatas have we access to such techniques at a remove sir yes poatas said an enabler machine can be ours to command an enabler machine oramen asked we would rely on the oct to provide and operate the equipment involved sir leratiy said though it would of course he added quickly be under our most diligent and intense supervision all would be noted recorded tabulated and filed on any subsequent occasions it may well be that we would be able to employ the same techniques directly ourselves thus our benefit would be twofold or indeed of an even higher order we both poatas began glancing at the senior technician feel it is of the utmost importance again oramen interrupted is not this sort of technology transfer this kind of help banned though he looked at the two men in turn they both looked awkward glancing at each other leratiy cleared his throat again the oct claim that if they operate it sir then as it is being directed at something that in effect already belongs to them the answer is no it is not banned indeed poatas said lifting his chin defiantly they claim this thing oramen asked glancing at the cube this was a new development not formally sir leratiy replied they accept our prior claim however they believe it may form part of their ancient birthright so take a particular and profound interest in it oramen looked around i see no oct here how do you know all this about them they have communicated through a special emissary by the name of savide sir poatas said he has appeared within this chamber on a couple of occasions and been of some consultant help i was not informed of this oramen pointed out you were injured confined to bed sir poatas said studying the planking at his feet for a moment that recently i see oramen said poatas and leratiy both smiled at him gentlemen oramen said smiling back if it is your judgement we should allow the oct to help us then let them have them bring their wonderful techniques their enabler machines though do what you can to find out how they work very well he asked the two men looked both surprised and delighted indeed sir senior technician leratiy said sir poatas said lowering his head oramen spent the rest of the day organising what were in effect all the trappings of a small state or at least looking on as others did the actual organising apart from anything else they were resurrecting a disbanded army turning the men who had been soldiers and had become excavationers back into soldiers again there was no shortage of men only of weapons most of the guns that had equipped the army were stored in armouries back in pourl they would have to do the best they could with what they had the situation ought to improve a little some of the workshops in the settlement were already turning their forges and lathes to the production of guns though they would not be of especially high quality the people he entrusted to oversee this were all from relatively junior ranks almost his first action had been to gather together all the senior people tyl loesp had put in place including general foise and send them off to rasselle allegedly as a delegation to explain oramens actions but in reality just to be rid of people he was no longer sure he could trust some of his new advisers had cautioned that he was sending able officers with a clear idea of the precise strengths and weaknesses of oramens own forces straight to their enemy but he was not convinced this was sufficient reason to let them stay and was reluctant to attempt to intern or imprison them foise and the others had departed reluctant but obedient on a train only a few hours earlier another train had followed half an hour behind it was full of soldiers loyal to oramen carrying plentiful supplies of blasting material with instructions to mine and guard every bridge between the falls and rasselle that could be attained without opening hostilities oramen made his excuses from the planning meeting as soon as he decently could and retired to his carriage for a muchneeded nap the doctors still wanted him to take more days off but he would not could not he slept for an hour and then visited droffo who was recovering in the principal hospital train youve moved quickly then droffo said he was still bandaged and looked dazed various cuts had been cleaned on his face and left to heal in the air though a couple on one cheek had needed stitches foise went quietly he shook his head then grimaced probably off to plot with tyl loesp you think theyll attack us oramen asked he sat on a canvas chair drawn up beside droffos bed in the private compartment i dont know prince droffo said is there any news yet from tyl loesp none he is not even in rasselle he may not have heard yet id be wary of going to meet with him i know that you think he himself is behind this who else i thought perhaps people around him such as who droffo said bleye tohonlo people like that droffo shook his head they havent the wit oramen couldnt think of anybody else by name with the possible exception of general foise surely not werreber chasque he was not so sure about but then the exaltine was not connected between tyl loesp and any further layers of underlings he was as it were off to one side oramen was used to seeing tyl loesp surrounded by other people mostly army officers and civil servants but no now droffo mentioned it there were few regular identifiable people around him he had functionaries lackeys those who did his bidding but no real friends or confidants that oramen knew of hed assumed they existed but he just didnt know them but maybe they didnt exist at all oramen shrugged but tyl loesp he said frowning mightily i just cant vollird and baerth were his men oramen i know is there any news on vollird none still missing another ghost to haunt the diggings and tyl loesp recommended tove lomma to you as well didnt he tove was an old friend oramen said but one who owed tyl loesp his advancement just be careful i am belatedly oramen told him this thing the sarcophagus is it really all they say it seems to communicate the oct want to try and teach it to talk oramen said they have a thing called an enabler machine which the optimae use to talk to such dugup curiosities perhaps its an oracle droffo said smiling lopsidedly stretching his stitched cuts and grimacing again ask it whats going to happen next what happened next was that two shifts later on what was in effect the following day tyl loesp sent word by telegraph from rasselle that there must have been some terrible misunderstanding vollird and baerth must themselves have been victims of a conspiracy and persons unknown were patently plotting to drive a wedge between the regent and the prince regent for their own ignoble ends tyl loesp thought it best that he and oramen meet in rasselle to discuss matters reassure themselves of their mutual love and respect and arrange all subsequent dealings in a manner such as would lead to no more rash actions nor unsubstantiated hintedat accusations oramen after discussing this signal with droffo dubrile and the halfdozen or so junior officers who had become his advisers all acclaimed by their men rather than owing their advancement to tyl loesp replied that he would meet tyl loesp here at the falls and he must bring no more than a dozen men with him lightly armed they were still waiting on a reply then in the middle of what most people were treating as the night news came that the sarcophagus was speaking and the oct had appeared in force in the chamber around it arriving via submarine vessels which had found or created channels in the sulpine river which were still liquid water rather than ice there was some confusion over whether they had taken over the chamber or not work was apparently continuing but they were there in unprecedented numbers and they were demanding to see tyl loesp or whoever was in charge i thought they were just coming to use this languageteaching device oramen said as he pulled on clothes wincing with each stretch of arm and leg neguste held out his jacket and helped him into it droffo who was ambulatory if far from fully recovered and who had intercepted the messenger bringing the news held oramens ceremonial sword belt in his one good hand his other arm was cradled by a sling perhaps when the thing spoke it said something disagreeable he suggested it might have chosen a more agreeable time thats sure oramen said accepting his sword belt dear worldgod oramen said when he saw the interior of the great chamber at the nameless citys heart he and droffo both stopped in their tracks neguste following behind determined to go wherever his master went to ensure he shared whatever fate awaited and never again be thought either frightened or disloyal failed to stop in time and bumped into them begging pardon sirs he said then saw between them to the chamber well fuck me upside down he breathed there were hundreds and hundreds of oct in the chamber blue bodies glistened under the lights thousands of red limbs shone as though polished they had entirely surrounded the sarcophagus arranging themselves on the cleared floor of the great space in concentric circles of what looked like prostrated devotion even adoration the creatures all appeared motionless and might have been mistaken for dead had they not been so neatly and identically arranged all were equipped with the same kind of bodyencompassing suit that ambassador kiu had worn oramen caught the same strange scent he had smelled all those months ago the day hed heard his father had been killed he remembered encountering ambassador kiu on his way to the mounting yard and that curious smell faint then it was strong now around oramen his personal guard commanded by dubrile jostled into position trying to leave no gap they surround me oramen thought while the oct surround that but why the guards too were distracted by the sight of so many oct glancing nervously as they took up their positions around oramen whitecoated technicians still moved about the chamber and along the scaffolding levels seemingly untroubled by the presence of the oct on the platform where oramen had stood earlier and experienced the sarcophagus seemingly trying to communicate with him the covers had been drawn back so that it was possible to see what was going on two oct were there along with some whitesuited human figures oramen thought he recognised both leratiy and poatas a guardsman was reporting to dubrile who saluted oramen and said sir the oct just appeared their ships are somewhere behind the ice of the falls they melted their way through they came in some through here others floating in from places up in the walls the guards didnt know what to do we never thought to have orders to cover such a thing the oct seem unarmed so i suppose we are still in control but they refuse to move thank you dubrile oramen said poatas was waving wildly from the platform lets go and see whats happening shall we oramenman prince one of the oct said when oramen arrived on the platform its voice was like dry leaves rustling again like meetings meet in time and spaces as our ancestors the blessed involucra who were no more to us always were and now are again without denial so we are met once more think you not ambassador kiu oramen asked the ambassador and another oct hung unsupported in front of the light patch of grey on the cubes surface poatas and senior technician leratiy stood nearby gazing on with expressions of barely controlled excitement they looked oramen thought as though they could not wait to tell him something i have that privilege ambassador kiutopourl said and to he i you introduce savidius savide peripatetic special envoy to sursamen the other oct turned fractionally to oramen oramenman prince of hausk pourl it said oramen nodded dubrile and three of the guards were positioning themselves at the corners of the platform making it almost crowded i am pleased to meet you envoy savidius savide welcome friends he said may i ask what brings you here he turned to look round and down at the hundreds of oct arranged in glittering circles round the sarcophagus and in such numbers greatness prince kiu said drifting closer to oramen dubrile went to interpose himself between but oramen held up one hand unparalleled greatness an occasion of such importance we are made as nothing the other oct said these here our comrades we two we are nothing no fit witness no worthy acolytes utterly insufficient nevertheless deserving or not we are here kiu said of incomprehensible privilege is this to all present we thank you boundlessly for such you put us forever in your debt no lives lived to the end of time by billions trillions of oct could so repay our chance to witness witness oramen said gently smiling indulgently looking from the two oct to poatas and leratiy witness to what that the sarcophagus has spoken it has sir poatas said stepping forward flourishing his stick waving it at the pale grey patch on the objects surface he gestured at one of the pieces of equipment on a tall trolley this device simply projected images and sounds and a sequence of invisible wavefronts through the ether into the face of what we have called the sarcophagus and it spoke sarl deldeyn oct several optimae languages repetitions at first so that we were disappointed thinking that it only recorded regurgitated had no mind after all but then then prince then it spoke in its own voice poatas turned to the pale grey square and bowed will you indulge us once more sir our most senior person is present a prince of the royal house which commands two levels he who is in charge here to see a voice said from the grey square it was a voice like a long sigh like something being expelled waved away with every syllable come come sir poatas said beckoning oramen forward it would see you here sir into the focus as before oramen held back simply to be seen why into this focus again he was concerned that now this thing seemed to have found a voice it still might need to see into peoples minds you are the prince the voice said levelly oramen stepped round so that had the grey patch been some sort of window he might be visible to whatever was inside but he did not step into the focal point he had stood in earlier i am he said my name is oramen son of the late king hausk you distrust me prince that would be too strong oramen said i wonder at you you must be something quite remarkable and strange to be so long buried and yet alive what might your name be so quickly we come to regret my name with so much else is lost to me i seek to recover it with so much else how might you do that oramen asked it there are other parts parts of me belonging scattered together brought i may be made whole again it is all i value now all i miss all i yearn for senior technician leratiy stepped forward we believe sir that some of the other cubes the smaller ones are repositories of this beings memories and possibly other faculties they would have been situated nearby but not together with this being you see sir poatas said to ensure some would survive all the cubes oramen asked not all i think though i cannot yet know the sighing voice said three or four perhaps some others may be merely symbolic poatas added what are you then oramen asked the sarcophagus what am i prince to which people do you belong what species why gentle prince i am involucra i am what i understand you sometimes call veil our ancestor survives savidius savide exclaimed the veil they who are who made us as well as all shellworlds are in one being returned to bless us to bless all but to bless us the oct the truly now undeniably inheritors mertis tyl loesp fretted around the imperial chambers feeling pursued by the pack of advisers and senior military people at his back who all wanted to offer advice he had resumed his sarl clothing taking up mail tabard and a sword belt again putting aside the more delicate deldeyn civilian attire but feeling wrong out of place almost ridiculous this was meant to be the new age fighting disputation was supposed to be finished with was he to be forced to take up arms again because of a misunderstanding because of a pair of bungling idiots why could no one else do their job properly this is still a young man barely more than a child he cannot be our problem sir we must seek and identify whoever has his ear and so guides his actions knowing that is the key only insist that he attends you sir he will come the young will often put up a most fervent resistance at least in words and then their point having been made their independence established sufficiently in their own eyes they will with all natural truculence see sense and come round to a more adult view renew your invitation as an instruction bring the young fellow to heel once in rasselle confronted with your own obvious authority and good will all will be resolved satisfactorily he is wounded in his pride too sir he has the impatience of youth and knows that he will be king in time but at such an age we often cannot see the point in waiting therefore we must compromise meet him between here and the falls on the edge of the area where the shadow presently falls let that symbolise the new dawn of good relations between you go to him sir show the forbearance of power go to him not even with a dozen men but with none leave your army camped beyond of course but go to him purely alone with the simplicity and humility of justice and the right that is on your side he is a child in this punish him sir princes require discipline as much as any other children more they are too usually indulged and require regular correction to maintain a fit balance of indulgence and regulation make all haste to the hyengzhar with your greatest force arrayed in full battle order hell not come out against you and even if he did think to there must be wiser heads around him wholl know to counsel otherwise the presentation of force settles such matters sir all silly plans and fancies evaporate faced with it only provide that and your problems cease they have men but not arms sir you have both merely display such and all settles it will not come to a fight impose your will do not be taken as one who can suffer such implied accusations lightly you feel justly offended at being so unjustly accused show that you will not tolerate such insult tyl loesp stood on a balcony looking out over the trees of the royal enclosure surrounding the great palace in rasselle clutching at the rail and working his hands round and round it while behind him clamoured all those who would tell him what to do he felt at bay he turned and faced them foise he said picking out the general whod arrived only a few hours earlier from the hyengzhar they had already spoken but only for foise to deliver a brief report your thoughts sir foise said looking round the others present sarl military and nobility mostly though with a few trusted deldeyn civil servants and nobles who had always been sympathetic to the sarl even when their peoples had been at war i have not thus far heard an unwise word here there was much serious nodding and many an expression of pretended modesty only those who had not yet actually spoken looked in any way unimpressed with this latest contribution however it is as true today as it always has been that we cannot follow every line of advice therefore i would suggest that bearing in mind the most recent information which we have to hand of which i am the humble bearer we look at what we know to be the most lately pertaining situation of the object of our deliberations there was some more nodding at this tyl loesp was still waiting to hear anything of import or indeed new but just listening to foises voice seemed to have calmed something in him he felt able to breathe again but what would you suggest that we do foise he asked what he does not expect sir foise said tyl loesp felt back in charge he directed a smile round everybody else in the group and shrugged general he said he does not expect me to surrender and admit i was wrong some blackhearted traitor we shall not be doing that i assure you there was laughter at his words foise smiled too like a brief echo of his superiors expression of course sir i mean sir that we do not wait do not gather our forces strike now what we have just heard said about the prince and those around him seeing sense on the presentation of force will be no less true strike now tyl loesp said again glancing at the others he took a stagey look over the balcony rail i do not seem to have the prince regent immediately to hand for that strategy more laughter indeed sir foise said unflustered i mean that you should form an aerial force take as many men and weapons as all available lyge and caude within the city will bear and fly to the falls they do not expect it they have not the weaponry to reduce an aerial attack their the region is dark one of the other military people pointed out the beasts will not fly they will foise said levelly i have seen oramen himself trust his life to them just a few days ago ask the beasts handlers they may need using to it but it can be done the winds are too great they have fallen back lately foise said and anyway do not normally persist longer than a shortday without sufficient pause foise looked at tyl loesp and spread his arms from the elbows saying simply it can be done sir we shall see tyl loesp said lemitte uliast he said naming two of his most hardheaded generals look into this sir sir it takes the name nameless then savidius savide said our dear ancestor this sanctified remainder surviving echo of a mighty and glorious chorus from the dawn of all thats good assumes the burden of this everconsecrated city as we take on the burden of long absence everpresent loss how cruel a night has been upon us thats lasted decieons the shadows back half of for ever a night now glimmering to dawn at last oh how long we have waited all rejoice another part of the great community is made whole who pitied now may no must with all good reason and bounteous wishes rejoice rejoice and rejoice again for we who are reunited with our past it is our parent kiu added producing all itself produced by this citywide birthing dross swept away the past uncovered all jibes abandoned all disbelief extinguished oramen had never heard the ambassador sound so excited or even so comprehensible sympathy again kiu exclaimed for those who doubted the oct scorned us for our very name inheritors how they will rue their lack of belief in us on this news being carried in joy in truth absolute unshakeable undeniable to every star and planet hab and ship of the great lens fall the falls silent frozen in tremulous expectation in calm in fit and proper pause before the great climactic chords of fulfilment realisation celebration you are so sure it is what it says it is oramen asked they were still on the platform around the lighter grey patch on the front of the sarcophagus which might or might not be a kind of window into the thing oramen had wanted to talk further elsewhere but the two oct ambassadors would not leave the presence of whatever was in the sarcophagus he had had to settle for bringing the two of them to the far edge of the platform possibly out of range of the window possibly not and asking everybody else to leave poatas and leratiy had removed themselves only as far as the next layer of scaffolding down and that reluctantly oramen talked quietly in the vain hope that this would encourage the two oct to do the same but they would not both seemed enthused agitated almost wild they had each taken a turn facing that window experiencing it for themselves others had too including poatas and leratiy they reported that the experience was now one of joy and hope not loss and yearning a feeling of euphoric release filled whoever stood or floated there along with an aching earnest desire that one might soon be made whole of course sure it is what it says why anything other savidius savide asked the alien voice sounded shocked that any doubt might be entertained it is what it says that it is this has been presaged this is expected who doubts such profundity you were expecting this oramen said looking from one oct to the other for how long all our lives before we lived truly kiu said waving his upper limbs around as this will resound forever forwards in time so the expectation has lasted the forever of not just individuals but our selves as one our self our species kind savidius savide added but for how long have you thought the answer was here at the falls specifically oramen asked unknown time kiu told him party we are not savidius savide agreed who knows what lessons learned futures foretold intelligences garnered down timelines older than ourselves we are sure pursued to produce plans courses actions not i nor kiu agreed oramen realised that even if the oct were trying to give him a direct answer hed be unlikely to understand it he just had to accept this frustration the information which you transferred from the enabler machine into the nameless he said trying a new tack was it what one might call neutral regarding whatever you expected to discover here better than exclaimed kiu needless hesitancy savide said cowardice of reproachable lack of will decisiveness expellence upon all such gentlemen oramen said still trying to keep his voice down did you tell the being in here what you were looking for that you expected it to be an involucra how can its true nature be hidden from itself savide said scornfully you ask impossibles kiu added it is as it is nothing can alter that savide said we would all be advised lessons similar ourselves doubly to learn taking such templated oramen sighed a moment please unowned making unbestowable all share the one moment of now kiu said just so oramen said and stepped away from the two oct indicating with one flat hand that he wished them to stay where they were he stood in front of the pale grey patch though closer than its focus what are you he asked quietly nameless came the equally subdued reply i have taken that name it pleases me for now until my own may be returned to me but what sort of thing are you truly veil the voice whispered back i am veil i am involucra we made that within which you have ever lived prince you made sursamen yes and we made all those that you call shellworlds for what reason to cast a field about the galaxy to protect all know this prince to protect from what what is your own guess i have none would you answer my question what did you seek to protect the galaxy from you misunderstand then tell so that i understand i require my other pieces my scattered shards i would be whole again then i might answer your questions the years have been long prince and cruel to me so much is gone so much taken away i am ashamed at how much blush to report how little i know that did not come out of that device that let me learn how to talk to you you blush do you blush can you what are you in there i am less than whole of course i blush not i translate i speak to you and in your idiom to the oct the same and so quite differently all is translation how could it be otherwise oramen sighed heavily and took his leave of the sarcophagus he left the two oct returning to their positions in front of it again on the floor of the chamber some way beyond the outer circle of the devotional oct oramen talked to poatas and leratiy another couple of men who were oct experts had arrived yawning too and some of his new crop of advisers sir poatas said leaning forward in his seat both hands clutching at his stick this is a moment of the utmost historicity we are present at one of the most important discoveries in recent history anywhere in the galaxy you think it is a veil in there oramen asked poatas waved one hand impatiently not an actual involucra that is unlikely but not impossible leratiy added not impossible poatas agreed there could be some sort of stasis mechanism or effect pertaining one of the younger experts suggested some loop of time itself he shrugged we have heard of such things the optimae are said to be capable of comparable feats it scarcely matters whether it is a real involucra though i repeat that it is most unlikely to be one poatas exclaimed it must be an awoken machine of optimae sophistication to have survived so long it has been buried for centiaeons perhaps deciaeons rational interrogatable entities of that antiquity turn up in the greater galaxy not once in the lifetime of any one of us we must not hesitate the nariscene or the morthanveld will take it from us if we do even if they do not then the waters will return all too soon and sweep whoknowswhat away can you not see how important this is poatas looked feverish his whole body clenched and expression tormented we are dabbling about on the fringe of something that will resound throughout all civilised space we must strike we must make busy with every possible application or lose this priceless opportunity if we act we live for ever more every optimae will know the name of sursamen of the hyengzhar of this nameless city its single nameless citizen and we here we keep talking about the optimae oramen said hoping to calm poatas down by seeming sober and practical himself should we not involve them the morthanveld would seem the obvious people to ask for help they will take this for themselves poatas said anguished we will lose it the oct have already half taken it droffo said they are here but they do not control poatas said sounding defensive i think they could control if they wished droffo insisted well they do not poatas hissed we work with them they offer us that they have little choice leratiy told oramen they fear what the nariscene judgement would be of their actions whose judgement would the morthanveld fear their peers among the optimae i imagine oramen said who can do nothing only register their socivilised disapproval leratiy said contemptuously that is without point they might at least know what it is we are dealing with oramen suggested we do poatas said almost wailing we may not have any more time leratiy said the oct have no interest in telling anyone else whats happening here however the news will out soon enough and then the nariscene or indeed the morthanveld may well come calling meanwhile the senior technician said glancing at poatas who seemed almost to be trying to climb out of his skin i agree with my colleague sir we must move with all possible speed we must poatas shouted calm yourself poatas leratiy said we can throw no more men at the three other cubes without the extra just getting in the way of those who already know what theyre doing three cubes oramen asked our nameless one insists that its memories and perhaps a few other faculties lie in three specific cubes out of the ten black objects we know about sir leratiy said it has identified them we are preparing to bring them here to it it must be done and quickly poatas insisted while we still have time oramen looked at the others is this wise he asked there were some concerned looks but nobody seemed prepared to identify such actions as unwise he looked back at leratiy i was not informed of this time again sir senior technician leratiy said smiling and sounding both regretful and reasonable of course you will be informed of everything but this was in my judgement a scientific matter which had to be arranged with all possible haste also knowing something of the situation pertaining outside this place i mean in effect between you and regent tyl loesp we did not want to add to your burden of cares before any physical movement of the cubes had actually taken place you were always sir but of course going to be informed of our intentions once the moves were ready to be made and when will this happen oramen asked when will they be ready leratiy took out his watch the first in about six hours time sir the second in eighteen to twenty hours the last one a few hours after that the oct press us to do so sir poatas said addressing oramen but glancing sullenly at the senior technician they offer to help with the manoeuvring we might move faster still if wed only let them i disagree leratiy said we should move the cubes ourselves if we slip they will insist poatas said leratiy frowned we shall not slip a messenger arrived and passed a note to droffo who presented it to oramen our furthest airborne scouts report an army moving towards us gentlemen from rasselle oramen told them they will not be here for another week or more travelling by road so we have that time well army or meltwater we must have our result before we are inundated poatas said dubrile oramen said to his guard captain would this be a better place to defend than my carriages at the settlement he nodded to indicate the great chamber they stood within most definitely sir dubrile replied he looked at the massed oct however then i shall pitch my tent with our allies the oct oramen said addressing all i stay here he smiled at neguste mr puibive see that everything necessary is brought would you neguste looked delighted probably at being called mister certainly sir it was a quiet time in the chamber at the end of another long shift most of the lights had been turned off leaving the whole huge space seeming even greater in extent than it appeared when lit the oct were taking turns to return to their ships for whatever reasons occupied them but still over nine out of ten of them remained in the places they had occupied when oramen had first seen them arranged in neat concentric circles of blue bodies and red limbs all perfectly still surrounding the scaffolded sarcophagus you think it will reveal itself and be like you that it is actually an alive example of your forebears oramen asked savidius savide they were alone on the platform the others were absent on other duties or sleeping oramen had woken in his hurriedly throwntogether tent fashioned from some of the same material that had shrouded parts of the scaffolding round the sarcophagus and come up here to talk with the being that called itself nameless he had discovered savide just floating there in front of the pale grey patch it is as us mere form is irrelevant have you asked it whether you truly are its descendants that is not required oramen stood up ill ask it this cannot be relevant savide said as oramen went to stand before the sarcophagus nameless oramen said again taking up a position closer than the focal point oramen the voice whispered are the oct your descendants all are our descendants well that was a new claim oramen thought the oct more than others he asked all do not ask who is more than who else as of now without my memories my abilities i cannot even tell those who call themselves the inheritors believe what they believe i honour them and that belief it does them no end of credit the exactitude of it that is another matter i am of the involucra if they are as they say then they are of my kind too at however great a remove i cannot pass judgement as i do not know only restore me to my proper capacity and i may know even then who can say i have been in here so long that whole empires speciestypes panplanetary ecosystems and shortsequence suns have come and gone while i have slept how should i know who grew in our shadow you ask me in ignorance ask me again in some fit state of knowingness when you are restored what will you do then i shall be who i am and see what is to be seen and do what is to be done i am of the involucra and as i understand things i am the last and all that we ever thought to do is either fully done or no longer worth doing i shall have to determine what my correct actions ought to be i can only be what i always was i would hope to see what remains of our great work the shellworlds and see what is to be seen in the galaxy and beyond while acknowledging that the need for the shellworlds themselves has passed now i must accept that all has changed and i can be but a curio a throwback an exhibit perhaps an example a warning why warning where are the rest of my people now gone unless we are injuriously mistaken quite gone so a warning but all peoples go oramen said gently as though explaining something to a child no one remains in full play for long not taking the life of a star or a world as ones measure life persists by always changing its form and to stay in the pattern of one particular species or people is unnatural and always deleterious there is a normal and natural trajectory for peoples civilisations and it ends where it starts back in the ground even we the sarl know this and we are but barbarians by the standards of most then i need know more of the manner of our going and mine was our end natural was it normal was it if it was not natural deserved i do not yet even know why i am within here why so preserved was i special and so glorified or excessively ordinary and so chosen to represent all due to my very averageness i recall no vice or glory of my own so cannot think i was specified for great achievement or committed depravity and yet i am here i would know why i hope to discover this shortly what if you discover you are not what you think you are why should i not be i dont know if so much is in doubt let me show you what i do know the quiet voice murmured may i show me step again into the place where we may better communicate if you would oramen hesitated very well he said he stepped backwards found the square daubed on the planking he glanced back saw savidius savide floating nearby then faced forward towards the light grey patch on the sarcophagus surface the effect appeared to take less time than it had before very soon it seemed he experienced that curious dizziness again following the momentary feeling of imbalance came the sensation of weightlessness and carelessness then that of dislocation wondering where he was or when he was then he knew who he was and where and when he felt that he was in that strange sunlit room again the one where he had seemed to be earlier when hed had the sensation of all his memories whirling past outside he seemed to be sitting on a small crudely fashioned wooden chair while sunlight blazed brightly outside too bright for him to be able to make out any details of whatever landscape lay beyond the doorway a strange lassitude filled him he felt that he ought to be able to get up from the little chair but at the same time had no desire to do so it was far more pleasant to simply sit here doing nothing there was somebody else in the room behind him he wasnt concerned about this the person felt like a benign presence it was browsing through books on the shelves behind him now he looked carefully about the room or just remembered it better he realised that it was entirely lined with books it was like a tiny library with him in the middle he wanted to look round and see who his guest actually was but still somehow could not bring himself to do so whoever they were they were dropping the books to the floor when they were finished with them this did concern him that was not very tidy that was disrespectful how would they or anybody else find the books again if they just dumped them on the floor he tried very hard indeed to turn round but could not he threw every part of his being into the effort just to move his head but it proved impossible what had seemed like a kind of laziness a feeling of not being able to be bothered which had been perfectly acceptable only moments earlier because it was something that was coming from within himself was now revealed as an imposition something forced upon him from outside he was not being allowed to move he was being kept paralysed by whoever this was searching through the books behind him this was an image he realised the room was his mind the library his memory the books specific recollections the person behind him was rifling through his memories could this be because he had had a thought earlier it had barely registered scarcely been worth thinking further about because it had seemed both so irrational and so needlessly horrendous and alarming was that thought that word somehow connected to what was happening now he had been tricked trapped whoever was searching the room the library the shelves the books the chapters and sentences and words that made up who he was and what his memories were must have suspected something he almost didnt know what it was certainly didnt want to know what it was and felt a terrible compulsion comical in another context utterly terrifying here and now not to think of then he remembered and the being behind him which was searching his thoughts and memories found it at the same time the very act of remembering that one fleeting thought of exposing that single buried word confirmed the horror of what this thing might really be youre not he thought youre he felt something detonate in his head a flash of light more brilliant and blinding than that outside the door of the little room more incandescent than any passing rollstar brighter than anything he had ever seen or known he was flying backwards as though hed thrown himself a strange creature sailed past he only glimpsed it an oct of course with a blue body and red limbs its filmy surfaces all glittering then something whacked into the small of his back and he was spinning somersaulting falling away into space falling over and over he hit something very hard and things broke and hurt and all the light went away again and this time took him with it there was no awakening not in any sudden nowhereiam sense instead life if life it could be called seemed to seep back into him slowly sluggishly in tiny increments like silse rain dripping from a tree all accompanied by pain and a terrible crushing weight upon him that prevented him from moving he was in that booklined room again stricken immobile in that little seat he had imagined that he was free of it that he could rise from it but after a brief vivid sensation of sudden unwanted movement here he was again paralysed laid out spread prone across the ground helpless he was a baby once more he had no control no movement could not even support his own head he knew there were people around him and was aware of movement and yet more pain but nothing showed its true shape nothing made sense he opened his mouth to say something even if it was just to beg for help for an end to this grinding fractured pain but only a mewl escaped he was awake again he must have fallen asleep he was still in terrible pain though it seemed dulled now he could not move he tried to sit upright tried to move a limb twitch a finger just open his eyes but nothing sounds came to him as though from under water he lay on something soft now not hard it was no more comfortable what had he been thinking something important he swam back up through the watery sounds around him helplessly aware of the noises he was making wheezing whining gurgling what had he thought of the waters parted like a hazy curtain drawn aside he thought he saw his friend droffo he needed to tell him something he wanted to grasp droffos clothing drag himself upright scream into his face issue a terrible warning then there was neguste he had tears on his face there were many other faces concerned businesslike neutral dreading dreadful he was awake once again he was clutching at droffos neck only it was not really droffo dont let it destroy mine the chamber bring it down dont let he was asleep in his seat an old man perhaps lost in the end of his days such days shuffled in this slow fading of the light from him genteel confusion he relied on others to tend to him somebody was behind him searching for something they always stole was this what hed ever wanted he was not his fathers son then he tried to turn round to confront whoever was trying to steal his memories but could not move unless this sensation was a memory too he felt he might be about to start crying the voice went on whispering into his ear into his head he could not make out what it was it was saying old age came with great pain which seemed unfair all other senses were dulled but pain was still bright no that was not true the pain was dulled too here it was being dulled again what is he trying to say we dont know we cant make it out awake again he blinked looked up at a ceiling he had seen before he tried to remember who he was he decided he must be droffo lying here in the hospital train no look here was droffo he must be somebody else then he needed to say something to droffo who were all these other people he wanted them gone they had to understand but go understand then go things needed to be done urgent work he knew and he had to tell them that he knew they had to do what he could not now stroy he heard himself say through the ruins ring it all down it then his voice faded away and the light went again this darkness enveloping how quickly the rollstars moved how little they illuminated he needed to tell droffo needed to get him to understand and through him everybody else he blinked back same room medical compartment something was different though he could hear what sounded like shooting was that the smell of smoke burning he looked up droffo but not droffo it looked like mertis tyl loesp what was he doing here help he heard himself say no tyl loesp said with a thin smile theres no helping you prince then a mailed fist came crashing down into his face obliterating light tyl loesp strode down the ramp into the chamber housing the sarcophagus heavily armed men at his heel the grey cube was surrounded by concentric circles of oct they seemed hardly to have noticed that dead and dying men lay scattered about the chamber the dying were being helped on their way by those charged with dispatching the wounded tyl loesp had been told that a few of the defenders might still be able to put up a fight the wounded might not all have been accounted for and the chamber was still dangerous however he had been impatient to see this thing for himself and had flown straight here on his already tired lyge after theyd taken the settlements centre and discovered the broken prince regent lying dying on his hospital bed poatas savide he said as they approached him through the mass of oct he looked back at the chamber entrance where a great black cube ten metres to a side was being manoeuvred to the top of the ramp from the tunnel beyond a couple of distant shots rang out echoing round the chamber tyl loesp smiled to see poatas jerk as though hed been shot himself you have been busy he said to the old man our prince didnt delay matters did he no sir poatas said looking down progress has been all we might have wished it is good to see you once more sir and know that you are victorious yes yes poatas all very loyal savide you approve of all thats happening here all is approval we would help further let us assist do so by all means awake again yet more pain he heard his own breathing it made a strange gurgling sound somebody was dabbing at his face hurting him he tried to cry out could not sir no sounds would come he could see his servant with one eye now again as though through a hazy curtain where was droffo he had to tell him something oh sir neguste said sniffing still alive prince he got the single good eye to open even this action was not without pain it was mertis tyl loesp neguste stood somewhere behind head down sobbing he tried to look at tyl loesp he tried to talk he heard a bubbling sound oh now now now hush yourself tyl loesp said as though talking to an infant and pursed his lips and put one finger to his lips dont delay dear prince dont let us detain you depart feel free sake sir your father died easier than this hurry up you sir neguste said can he talk no sir he says nothing he tries i think earl droffo he asks for earl droffo im not sure droffo dead sir your men killed him he was trying to oh yes well ask away all you like prince droffo cannot come to you though you will soon go to him oh please dont hurt him sir please shut up or ill hurt you captain two guards you you will now what sir sir another new voice young and urgent what the thing sir the object sarcophagus it its doing its i cant its it is not what you believe oramen had time to think then things went flowing away from him again and he felt himself slip back beneath the waters sir what tyl loesp said not stopping they were in the newly broadened tunnel a minute from the entrance to the great semispherical chamber containing the sarcophagus sir this man insists he is a knight in your employ tyl loesp an anguished voice rang out over the pack of advisers guards and soldiers around tyl loesp its me vollird sir vollird tyl loesp said halting and turning let me see him the guards parted and two of them brought a man forward each holding one of his arms vollird it was indeed though he was dressed in what looked like rags his hair was wild and the expression on his face wilder still his eyes staring it is sir its me your good and faithful servant sir vollird cried we did all we could sir we nearly got him i swear there were just too many tyl loesp stared at the fellow he shook his head i have no time for you just save me from the ghosts tyl loesp please vollird said his knees buckling underneath him and the guards on either side having to take his weight vollirds eyes were wide and staring foam flecking his lips ghosts tyl loesp said ghosts man vollird shrieked ive seen them ghosts of all of them come to haunt me tyl loesp shook his head he looked at the guard commander the mans lost his wits take him he began gillews the worst vollird said voice breaking i could feel him i could still feel him his arm his wrist under he got no further tyl loesp had drawn his sword and plunged it straight into the mans throat leaving vollird gurgling and gesticulating eyes wider still gaze focused on the flat blade extending from his throat where the air whistled and the blood pulsed and bubbled and dripped his jaw worked awkwardly as though he was trying to swallow something too big tyl loesp rammed the sword forward meaning to cut the fellows spine but the tip bumped off the bone and sent the edge slicing through the flesh on the side of his neck producing another gush of blood as an artery was severed the guard on that side moved out to avoid the blood vollirds eyes crossed and a final breath left him like a bubbled sigh the two guards looked at tyl loesp who withdrew his sword let him go he told them released vollird fell forward and lay still in the dark pool of his own still spreading blood tyl loesp cleaned his sword on the fellows tunic with two quick strokes leave him he told the guards he turned and walked towards the chamber the sarcophagus had insisted the scaffolding be removed from around it it sat on its plinth the three black cubes around it on the floor of the chamber one immediately in front the other two near its rear corners the oct were still arranged beyond in their concentric rings of devotion tyl loesp and those around him got there just in time to see the transformation the sides of the black cubes were making sizzling crackling sounds a change in their surface texture made them look suddenly dull then they began to appear grey as a fine network of fissures spread all over them poatas came limping up to where tyl loesp stood unprecedented he said waving his stick in the air a couple of tyl loesps personal guard stepped forward thinking that the wild manic old man might be offering violence to their master but poatas didnt seem to notice to be here to be here now and see this this he cried and turned waving his stick at the centre of the chamber the faces of the black cubes showed great cracks all over their surfaces now a dark vapour issued from them rising slowly then the sides trembled and fell open in a slow cloud of what looked like heavy soot as the cubes casings seemed to turn to dust all at once revealing dark glistening ovoids inside each about three metres long and a metre and a half in girth they floated up and out from the gradually settling debris of their rebirth poatas turned briefly back to tyl loesp do you see do you see one can hardly avoid seeing tyl loesp said acidly his heart was still thumping from the incident a few moments earlier but his voice was firm controlled the ovoids drifted up and in towards the grey cube which was starting to make the same snapping zizzing sounds the black cubes had made moments earlier the noise was much louder filling the chamber echoing back off the walls the oct ringed round the chambers focus were stirring shifting as if they were all now looking up at the grey cube as it shuddered and changed its surfaces growing dark with a million tiny crazings this is your prize poatas tyl loesp shouted over the cacophony and their ancestor poatas yelled back waving his stick at the circles of oct is all well here poatas tyl loesp demanded should it make this sound who knows poatas screamed shaking his head why would you flee sir he asked without turning round the sound from the sarcophagus died away without warning only echoes resounding tyl loesp opened his mouth to say something but the sides of the sarcophagus were falling away too now slipping as though invisible walls penning in dark grey dust had suddenly ceased to be and letting its powdery weight come sliding out falling in a great dry wash all around the plinth lapping to the inner fringes of the surrounding oct there was almost no noise accompanying this just the faintest sound that might have been mistaken for a sigh the last echoes of the earlier tumult finally died away the grey ovoid revealed by the fallen dust was perhaps five metres across and eight long it floated trembling in midair the three smaller black shapes drew in towards it approaching as though hesitant they tipped slowly up on their midaxes ends pointing straight up and down then they slid ponderously in to meet the larger grey shape at the centre of their pattern silently joining with it seeming to slide partway into it the resulting shape hung steady in the air echoes slowly died to leave utter silence within the great chamber then the shape roared something in a language the humans present could not understand sounds crashing off the walls like surf tyl loesp cursed at the sheer piercing volume of it and clapped his hands to his ears like everybody else some of the other men fell to their knees with the force of the sound only pride prevented tyl loesp from doing the same while the echoes were still dying away the oct seemed to startle and move almost as one dry whispering noises like small twigs just starting to catch fire began to fill the chamber the sound was drowned out as the greydark shape hanging in the centre rumbled out again this time in sarl thank you for your help it thundered now i have much to do there is no forgiveness a filmy spherical bubble seemed to form around the shape just great enough in extent to enclose it completely the bubble went dark black then quicksilver as tyl loesp and the others watched a second bubble flickered into existence enclosing the first forming two metres or so further out from the inner silvery one a blink of light brief but close to blindingly bright came from the space between the two spheres before the outer one went black a humming noise built quickly a vast thrumming sound which issued from the black sphere and rapidly grew to fill the entire chamber cramming it with a toothloosening eyeballvibrating boneshaking bassy howl the oct fell back rolling to the floor seemingly flattened by the storm of noise every human present put their hands to their ears again almost all turned away stumbling bumping into their fellows trying to run to escape the pulverising fleshbattering noise the few humans unable to look away poatas was one on his knees stick fallen from his hand remained transfixed watching the colossally humming black sphere they were the only ones to witness very briefly a scatter of tiny pinprick holes speckling its surface loosing thin blinding rays then the outer sphere blinked out of existence a tsunami of widespectrum radiation filled the chamber in an instant as the thermonuclear fireball behind it surged outwards the blast of light and heat incinerated oct and humans indiscriminately vaporising them along with the inner lining of the chamber blowing its single great spherical wall out in every direction like a vast grenade and bringing what was left of the building above and the surrounding plaza crashing down upon the glowing wreckage the first waves of radiation gamma rays neutrons and a titanic electromagnetic pulse were already long gone their damage done the silvery sphere lifted slowly calmly out of the smoking debris perfectly unharmed it drifted through the kilometrewide hole in the citys plaza level and moved slowly away dropping its film of shields and altering its shape slightly to that of a large ovoid it turned to the direction humans called facing and accelerated out of the gorge the core they stood on the edge of the kilometrewide crater left in the plaza level the suit visors made the scene bright as day ferbin clicked the artificial part of the view off for a few moments just to see the true state of it dim cold greys blacks blues and dark browns the colours of death and decay a rollstar was due to dawn about now but there would be no sign of it this deep in the gorge for many days yet and no melting warmth to restore the falls until some long time after that there was still a faint infrared glow visible through the suits visor deep inside the crater steam lifted slowly from the dark depths the vapour rose and was shredded to nothing by the cold keening wind anaplian and hippinse were checking readouts and sensor details something like a small nuke djan seriy said they were communicating without touching now reckoning the need for silence was over even so the suits chose the most secure method available glittering unseen coherent light from one to the other pinpointing small blast but serious emp and neutrons the ships avatoid said and gamma they must have been fried djan seriy said quietly kneeling down by the breach in the plazas surface she touched the polished stone feeling its grainy slickness transmitted through the material of the suit little wonder theres nobody about hippinse said they had seen a few bodies on their flight over the city coming in from the outskirts and a surprising number of dead lyge and caude but nothing and nobody moving all life seemed as frozen and stilled as the hard waters of the sulpitine but why isnt there anybody else here hippinse sent to anaplian lace to lace no aid no medics these people know nothing about radiation sickness she replied anybody escaping would have got to safety thinking they were over the worst of it and getting better and then died badly in front of the people they reached wouldnt encourage you to come see what happened theyve probably sent a few flying scouts but all theyll report is dead and dying mostly dead while the oct and aultridia are too busy fighting each other hippinse sent and something seriously capable is profoundly fucking with the level systems top to bottom the drone turminder xuss had floated off some way when theyd set down it floated back now theres some sort of tech embedded in the vertical ice behind one of the falls it announced probably oct quite a lot of it shall i take a look anaplian nodded please do the little machine darted away and disappeared into another hole in the plaza anaplian stood looked at hippinse ferbin and holse lets try the settlement they had stopped only once on their way in to look at one of the many bodies lying on the snowscudded surface of a frozen river channel djan seriy had walked over to the body unstuck it from the grainy white surface looked at it radiation shed said ferbin and holse had looked at each other holse had shrugged then thought to ask the suit it had started to whisper quickly to him about the sources and effects of electromagnetic particle and gravitational radiation rapidly concentrating on the physical consequences of ionising radiations and acute radiation syndrome as applicable to humanoid species especially those similar to the sarl then djan seriy had removed one of the strakes on the right leg of her suit a dark tube as long as her thigh and a little thinner than her wrist she had laid it down on the surface of the frozen river and looked at it briefly it had started to sink into the ice raising steam as it melted its way through it had moved like a snake wriggling at first then slipped quickly down the hole it had made for itself in the solid surface of the river the water had started to ice over again almost immediately what was that miss holse had asked anaplian had detached another piece of the suit a tiny thing no larger than a button shed tossed it into the air like a coin it had gone straight up and had not come back down shed shrugged insurance in the settlement barely one person in a hundred was still alive and they were dying in pain no birds sang no workshops rang or engines huffed in the still air only the quiet moans of the dying broke the silence anaplian and hippinse instructed all four suits to manufacture tiny mechanisms which they could inject into anybody they found still living by just pressing on their neck the suits grew little barbs on the tips of their longest fingers to do the injecting can these people be cured sister ferbin asked staring at a man moving weakly covered in vomit and blood and surrounded by a thin pool of dried excrement trying to talk to them but only gurgling his hair came out in clumps as his head jerked across the frozen mud of one of the settlements unpaved roads thin bright blood came from his mouth nose ears and eyes the nanorgs will decide djan seriy said crisply stooping to inject the fellow those the injectiles cannot save theyll let die without pain too late for most of them holse said looking round this was that radiation wasnt it yes hippinse said apart from the ones with bullet wounds obviously djan seriy said rising from the now limp sighing man and looking around at dead soldiers clutching guns and the crumpled bodies of a couple of lyge lying nearby armed riders crushed beneath there was a battle here first the few twists of smoke they had seen were fires burning themselves out rather than smoke from the chimneys of works and forges and steam engines at the main railhead for the settlement all the engines and most of the carriages were gone hundreds of bodies lay scattered about they split up in twos djan seriy and holse checked the archipontines carriages and the rest of the headquarters compound but found only more dead bodies and none they recognised then hippinse called from the hospital train im sorry the fellow i shot tell him im sorry wont you somebody please im most terribly sorry son it was me you shot and look im fine i just fell over in surprise thats all calm now holse lifted the young mans head and tried to get him sitting upright against the wall his hair was falling out too holse had to wedge him in a corner eventually to stop him falling over i shot you sir you did lad holse told him lucky for me im wearing armour better than stridethick iron whats your name son neguste puibive sir at your service im so sorry i shot you choubris holse no damage done nor offence taken they wanted whatever drugs we had sir thinking they would save them or at least ease their pain i gave away all i could but then when they were all gone theyd not believe me sir they wouldnt leave us alone i was trying to protect the young sir sir what young sir would that be then young neguste holse asked frowning at the little barb just flexed from the longest finger on his right hand oramen sir the prince regent hippinse had just entered the compartment he stared down at holse i heard he said ill tell them holse pressed the barb into the young mans mottled bruisedlooking flesh he cleared his throat is the prince here lad through there sir neguste puibive said attempting to nod at the door through to the next compartment he started to cry thin bloody tears ferbin cried too sweeping back the mask section of the suit so that he could let the tears fall oramen had been cleaned up carefully however his face looked to have been badly beaten ferbin touched his gloved hand to his brothers reddened staring eyes trying to get the eyelids to close failing djan seriy was at the other side of the narrow bed her hand cupped under the base of their brothers head cradling his upper neck she gave out a long breath she too swept her mask back and away she bowed her head then let oramens head very gently back down allowing it to rest on the pillow again she slid her hand out she looked at ferbin shook her head no she said we are too late brother she sniffed smoothed some of oramens hair across his head trying not to pull any of it out as she did so days too late the glove of her suit flowed back from her flesh like black liquid leaving the tips then the whole of her fingers then her hand to the wrist naked she gently touched oramens bruised broken cheek then his mottled forehead she tried to close his eyes too one of his eyelids detached and slid over his bloodflecked eye like a piece of boiled fruit skin fuck fuck fuck djan seriy said softly anaplian hippinse shouted urgently from the compartment where he and holse were trying to comfort neguste puibive he asked for earl droffo but theyd killed him sirs tyl loesps men when they came on the airbeasts theyd already killed him him with only one good arm trying to reload but what afterwards hippinse insisted shaking the injured man what was it he said what did you say repeat that repeat it djan seriy and holse both reached out to touch hippinse steady djan seriy told the avatoid whats wrong holse didnt understand what was making hippinse so upset it wasnt his brother lying dead through there the man wasnt even a real human these werent his people he had no people repeat it hippinse wailed shaking puibive again djan seriy took hold of hippinses nearest hand to stop him jolting the dying youth all the rest left sirs those that could on the trains when we all started to fall ill the second time neguste puibive said his eyes rolling around in their sockets eyelids flickering sorry to we all took a terrible gastric fever after the big explosion but then we were all right but then in the name of your worldgod hippinse pleaded what did oramen say it was his last understandable word i think sirs puibive told them woozily though theyre not real are they just monsters from long ago oh shit no anaplian thought what are lad holse asked pushing hippinses other hand away that word sir that was the word he kept saying eventually when he could speak again for a short while when they brought him back from the chamber where the sarcophagus was once he knew earl droffo was dead iln he kept saying i couldnt work it out at first but he said it a lot even if it got softer and fainter each time he said it iln he said iln iln iln hippinse stared at nothing the iln holses suit whispered to him aerospiniform gasgiant midlevel ancients originally from the zunzil ligature assumed contemporary sophisticated equivtech level involved between point eightthree and point seveneight billion years ago multidecieon nonextant believed extinct nonsublimed no claimed descendancy now principally remembered for the destruction of approximately two thousand three hundred shellworlds to djan seriy anaplian it was as though the world beneath her feet dropped away and the stars and the vacuum fell in around her anaplian stood leave him she said snapping her mask back into place and striding out of the compartment hippinse rose and followed its the secondhand word of one dying man transmitted by another the avatoid sent to the sc agent could be false anaplian shook her head something spent geological ages in a buried city wasted several hundred thousand people as it left just for the hell of it and then disappeared she replied lets assume the worst of the fucker whatever it was it may not have been the source of the cant i stay holse began yes you can but ill need your suit anaplian told him from down the corridor it can function as an extra drone her voice changed as holses suit decided her voice was growing too faint and switched to comms same applies to my brother she told him can we not mourn even a moment ferbins voice cut in no anaplian said outside in the cold desert air turminder xuss swept down to join anaplian and hippinse as they stepped from the carriage oct it told them a few still left in the rearmost ship a klick back under the ice upstream all dying ship systems blown by emp recordings corrupted but they had live feed and saw a black ovoid emerge from a grey cube housed centrally in a prominent chamber beneath the citys central building it was joined by three smaller ovoids which emerged from objects the sarl and oct cooperated in bringing to the central one last thing they saw sounds like a concentric containment enaction strong vibrations and photontunnelling immediately before containment drop and fireball release confirmatory thank you anaplian told the machine she glanced at hippinse convinced hippinse nodded eyes wide face pale convinced ferbin holse anaplian said calling the two men still inside the carriage we have to go now there is an iln or some weapon left by the iln loose it will be at or on its way to the core of sursamen the first thing it will do is kill the worldgod then it will attempt to destroy the world itself do you understand your suits must come with us whether you are inside them or not there would be no dishonour in we are on our way ferbin said his voice sounded hollow coming maam holse confirmed there lad you just rest easy there thats it they heard him mutter the four suits and the tiny shape of the accompanying machine lifted from the wispily smoking remains of the hyengzhar settlement and curved up and out heading for the nearest open tower seven thousand kilometres distant turminder xuss powered ahead and up vanishing from sight almost immediately ferbin assumed they were flying in the same diamond formation as before though the suits were camouflaged again so it was impossible to tell at least this time they were allowed to communicate without having to touch but this thing must be ancient maam mustnt it holse protested its been under there for an eternity everybody knows the iln vanished millions of years ago whatever this thing is it cant be that dangerous not to more modern powers like the optimae the culture and so on can it it doesnt work that way anaplian said would that it did she fell silent as they tore upwards into the air spreading out hippinse cleared his throat and said the type of progress you guys are used to doesnt scale into this sort of civilisational level societies progress until they sublime godlike retirement if you will and then others start again finding their own way up the techface but it is a techface not a techladder there are a variety of routes to the top and any two civs whove achieved the summit might well have discovered quite different abilities en route ways of keeping technology viable over indefinite periods of time are known to have existed aeons ago and just because somethings ancient doesnt mean its inferior with workable tech from this things time the stats show its about sixtyforty it will be less capable than what we have now but thats a big minority im sorry to have to involve you in this anaplian told the two sarl men we are going to have to descend to the machine level and possibly the core of sursamen to confront something we have very little knowledge of it may well have highly sophisticated offensive capabilities our chances of survival are probably not good i do not care ferbin said sounding like he meant it i would gladly die to do whatever i can to kill the thing that killed our brother and threatens the worldgod they were leaving the atmosphere the sky turning black what about the ship maam holse asked hippinse anaplian asked im broadcasting for help the avatoid replied oct systems nariscene morth anything to patch us through nothings coming back from the chaos in the local dataverse system disruption is still spreading jamming everything take heading to another level to find a working system and even then itd be somebody elses whim ill signal it anaplian said i guess we have no choice hippinse said this should get us some attention arming anaplian said coding for machine space rendezvous no holds barred total panic now mode hippinse said as though he was talking to himself how can you signal the ship maam holse asked i thought signals couldnt get out of shellworlds oh some signals can djan seriy said look back at the gorge down from the falls where we landed earlier they had risen so fast and travelled so far laterally already this was not easy holse still hadnt located the gorge below the hyengzhar and hadnt thought to ask the suit to do so for him when a sudden flash attracted his eye it was followed by four more in groups of two the whole display lasted less than two seconds hemispherical grey clouds burst blossoming around the already dead lightpoints then quickly disappeared leaving rapidly rising greyblack towers behind what was that holse asked five small antimatter explosions anaplian told him the debris stacks were already falling over the horizon as they raced away just above the outer reaches of the atmosphere the liveware problem and its remotes are monitoring the surface at prime level listening for unusual vibrations those five explosions together wont rattle sursamen as much as a single starfall but theyll make the planet ring like a bell for a few minutes all the way out to the surface which is all we need surface compression waves thats how you get a signal out of a shellworld so the ship holse began will right now be making its way towards the core anaplian said and not taking no for an answer getting something hippinse said oh looks like brilliant blinding light splashed off to ferbins left diagonally ahead his gaze darted that way even as the images danced inside his eyes and the suits visor blacked out the entire view then cast an obviously false representation up showing the horizon nearby towers and not much else the image he was left with was that of a human figure lit as though it was made of sun stuff anaplian hippinse yelled yes her calm voice came back laser strong physical hit optical sighting no ranging pulse my suit has slight ablation and i slight bruising all mirrored up now suits have split us up already expect mo something hammered into ferbins back it was like a cutting sword blow landing on thick chain mail the breath tried to whistle out of him but the suit was suddenly very stiff and it felt like there was nowhere for the breath to go under crew attack dorsal above the suit informed him no immediate threat at present power and frequencies thats one hit each two on me anaplian said more have missed i am reading a ceiling source nariscene tech probably tss three on me source probably comped ditto hippinse said we can probably soak outrange in twenty yes but maybe more ahead i am sending xuss to deal with practice if nothing else my pleasure turminder xuss said can i use am too anything anaplian said leave to me xuss purred ill get back ahead and anticipate similar feel free anaplian said kinetics would be a bigger worry prioritise and warn of course regardless shoot first you spoil me ah holse shouted a moment later faith even my old man never hit me that hard should be this ones last xuss said there straight up their collimator oh pretty firing not admiring anaplian told it oh really xuss said somewhere between amused and annoyed already on my way they flew over the landscape far below for another few minutes without attracting any more hostile attention the world seeming to turn like a great tensed drum beneath them shining and darkening as fixstars and rollstars came and went and complexes of vanes and ceiling structure cast them into shadow ferbin cried a little more thinking of his brother lying dead disfigured assaulted in that cold abandoned carriage unmourned now they had been forced to leave unattended save for a dying servant who was himself hardly more than a child it had not been a death or a lyinginstate fit for a prince of any age a cold and terrible fury grew in his guts how fucking dare anything do that to so young a man to his brother to so many others he had seen them he had seen how theyd died prompted by holse hed had his suit tell him the effects of high radiation doses one hundred per cent certainty of death within four to eight days and those days full of appalling agony it looked like his brother had been injured before the lethal blast though that made no difference he might still have lived but even that chance however good or slim had been snatched away from him by this filthy pitiless murderous thing ferbin sniffed back the tears and the suit itself seemed to absorb whatever he could not swallow no doubt to be recycled reused and purified and brought back to him as water from the tiny spigot he could summon to his mouth whenever he wanted he was a little world in here a tiny perfect farm where nothing went to waste and every little thing that fell or died was turned to fresh use to grow new produce or feed beasts he had to do the same he realised he could not afford not to employ oramens cruel ignoble death they might well have to surrender their lives in whatever doomed enterprise they were now embarked upon but he would honour his young brother in the only way that could mean anything from this point on and turn oramens death to a determining reinforcement of his purpose he had meant what he said to djan seriy earlier he did not want to die but he willingly would if it helped destroy the thing that had killed his brother and meant to do the same to the worldgod the worldgod might he see it look upon it dear god converse with it just be addressed by it never had he thought to witness it in any way no one did you knew it was there knew it was in some sense another being another inhabitant of the vast and bounteous galaxy but that did not reduce its manifest divinity its mystery its worth of reverence something flickered high above in the darkness three tiny trails of light seemed to converge on an implied point one trail winked out another curved the third flared suddenly into a dot of light the suits visor briefly blocked out there you go xuss said kinetic battery definitely compromised there was a nariscene combat engineering team crawling all over it trying to get the unit back under their control what happened to them blown to smithereens the drone said matteroffactly no choice thing was powering up already swinging towards you great anaplian muttered so now were at war with the fucking nariscene excuse me maam sir holse said do all levels have such fearsome weaponry looking down upon them basically yes hippinse said by the way im down by five and a half out of eight micromissiles the drone said that was learning overkill and i think i can deal with anything similar with two easy one highprobability but just to let you know five and a half anaplian said turned one away when i saw the third was getting through saved it rehoused it half an engine charge left most conservationary of you anaplian said hippinse anything yes im into a nariscene hardened military news channel the avatoid said shit the oct and aultridia really are at war the oct ships above the open towers were spotted and the nariscene closed them off the oct blame the aultridia for the hyengzhar explosion the aultridia suspect a plot to increase oct control after the blast at the falls some oct craft tried to force their way into the open towers but got ripped apart between them the nariscene oct and aultridia have closed off every tower are we still doing the right thing heading where were heading looks like it twofifty seconds to go four minutes later they plunged back into the atmosphere this time the suits stayed sleek and silvery and barely slowed at all as they hit the gases they left a trail of glowing ionised air behind them bright enough to cast shadows from kilometres up they slowed so fast it hurt and arrived feeling even more bruised at the grassy fluted base of a tower when they landed the ground cover sizzled and burned beneath their feet and steam came spluttering up around them the suits stayed mirrored a section of the green slope nearby was already rearing out of the ground spilling turf and earth as a cylinder ten metres across slid up and out a circle appeared on its curved surface as it slowed then fell forward to form a ramp when the cylinder stopped rising anaplian stepped forward leading the others turminder xuss came banging out of the sky as the ramp door started to rise again seconds later the cylinder began to descend identify a voice rang out within the cylinders still damp interior i am culture special circumstances agent djan seriy anaplian originally of the royal palace pourl in sarl i am accompanied by my brother the rightful king of sarl ferbin and an avatoid of the culture ship liveware problem be advised that there is an iln shellworlddestroying machine loose i repeat an iln shellworlddestroying machine is here within sursamen it is heading for or is already in the core with the very likely intention of destroying the world broadcast this disseminate as widely as possible informing the nariscene and the morthanveld as a matter of extreme and absolute priority release control of cylinder no do as i say there is an iln shellworlddestroying machine present within sursamen it has already killed everybody at the hyengzhar and is now heading for or is already in the core it intends to destroy the world tell everybody everybody insist release cylinder control instantly no stop release control of corridor environment replace fluids immediately warning aultridian proxies deeming apprehension awaits the cylinder was slowing drawing to a stop in a few seconds no anaplian said walking like some strange silvery dream to stand before the circular door i have no time to waste with you get in our way and i will kill you broadcast all ive said as widely as possible at maximum urgency i insist anaplian detached a handgun from the left hip of her suit the weapon was silver too turminder xuss rose to hover at the very top of the door also shining like mercury release control of door the voice wailed as the door started to open lidding down like a drawbridge apprehension awaits anaplian rose quickly to float level with the top of the doorway levelling the gun the tiny mirrorbodied shape of turminder xuss glinted and was gone a few flashes reflected off the vaulted ceiling of the corridor outside then the door was thudding down anaplian was already descending and moving forward she put the gun back to her hip as her feet hit the floor just beyond the door she stepped out over the twitching bodies of a dozen wellarmed oct all of them sliced into halves or smaller fractions their weapons had been cut up too a couple of the gunparts lay on the floor still sputtering and sparking raising fumes from puddles xuss monofil warps clicked back into its body as it flicked about and powered down the tunnel ahead a large circular door was already rolling back into the wall fluids a metre deep surged out and were soon washing about anaplians legs alarms keened and somebody was shouting something in oct keep up anaplian said over her gleaming shoulder hippinse ferbin and holse stepped smartly from the cylinder tried to avoid stepping on oct body parts as the flood of fluids washed them towards them they followed anaplian down the tunnel a minute later a few more oct deaths later they stood watching another circular door roll away more kneedeep fluids rushed out past them they stepped into the resulting chamber the door closed behind them and they listened to the air whistling out well be in vacuum again from this point on anaplian told them unhitching her crew from the back of her suit and quickly checking it hippinse mirrored her actions ferbin and holse looked at each other then did the same djan seriy restowed the laser weapon where it had been it moulded into the dorsal section of her suit while she reached over her shoulder and pulled on another of the long strakes on her back producing yet another glossily black weapon she let it unfold itself and checked that too ferbin caught his sisters gaze and she nodded i shall lead with this particle buster you use the kinetic rifle ferbin holse you and hippinse lead with the crews dont want us all using the same stuff her mask unmirrored long enough for her to smile briefly at them and wink just shoot at what we do then the suit was fully mirrored again we are all mirrors ferbin thought reflecting each other we are here and these strange suits of armour turn back all light but somehow despite that we are nearly invisible the gaze is redirected from each contact with our surfaces sliding away until we see something of whatever surrounds us as though only that is real turminder xuss lowered to hover in front of anaplian level with her sternum a couple of slim shapes like spikedaggers drifted up from anaplians calves and also floated just ahead of her also we have a long way to drop this an open tower maam holse asked no anaplian said we are one tower away from an open tower the one that the ship will be using if this things left anything behind to ambush anybody coming after it the opens are where theyll likely wait the ship has no choice but to use an open we do but we can keep close enough to where the ship will appear to offer support even then we wont be leaving by the main tower shaft she glanced at the two sarl men we are the infantry here in case you hadnt guessed gentlemen expendable sacrificeable the ship is the knight the heavy artillery however you wish to express it she looked at hippinse as the door ahead of them twitched anything not yet hippinse said two small mirrored things like tiny daggers floated up to station themselves level with his shoulders another pair of mercurially glinting shapes slid away from ferbin and holses suits too and floated up to cluster round turminder xuss if you dont mind gents the drone said casually be my guest ferbin told it didnt even know they were there holse said the door rolled silently to one side revealing utter darkness the drone turned soot black and darted ahead disappearing along with the four other smaller missiles the humans floated across a tube hippinse said was only thirty metres wide a scendship shaft beyond a circular hatch had just completed irising open they floated through to the main tower interior as they started to drop they moved away from each other until they were nearly half a kilometre apart i really never thought to be doing this holse thought he was frankly terrified but elated too to be dropping towards the worldgod with mad aliens to meet up with a talking eccentric spaceship that could stride between stars like a man strode between stepping stones to go in search of an even more insane iln that wanted to blow up or crumple down the whole world that was the kind of thing hed not even started to dream of when hed been back on the farm mucking out stables and following his dad around the frostrimed gelding pen carrying the gently steaming ball bucket ear still smarting from the latest slap he had the worrying feeling that he and ferbin were along as little more than decoys but in a way he didnt care he was starting to change his mind about the old warrior code stuff knights and princes invoked usually when they were drunk and in need of spilling their words or trying to justify their poor behaviour in some other field behave honourably and wish for a good death hed always dismissed it as selfserving bullshit frankly most of the people hed been told were his betters were quite venally dishonourable and the more they got the more the greedy bastards wanted while those that werent like that were better behaved at least partly because they could afford to be was it more honourable to starve than to steal many people would say yes though rarely those whod actually experienced an empty belly or a child whimpering with its own hunger was it more honourable to starve than to steal when others had the means to feed you but chose not to unless you paid with money you did not have he thought not by choosing to starve you became your own oppressor keeping yourself in line harming yourself for having the temerity to be poor when by rights that ought to be a constables job show any initiative or imagination and you were called lazy shifty crafty incorrigible so hed dismissed talk of honour it was just a way of making the rich and powerful feel better about themselves and the powerless and povertystricken feel worse but once you werent living handtomouth and had some ease you had the leisure to contemplate what life was really all about and who you really were and given that you had to die it made sense to seek a good death even these culture people bafflingly mostly chose to die when they didnt have to with freedom from fear and wondering where your next meal was coming from or how many mouths youd have to feed next year and whether youd get sacked by your employer or thrown into jail for some minor indiscretion with freedom from all that came choice and you could choose a nice quiet calm peaceful ordinary life and die with your nightshirt on and impatient relatives making lots of noise around you or you could end up doing something like this and however scared your body might feel your brain rather appreciated the experience he thought of his wife and children and felt a twinge of guilt that they had been so absent from his thoughts for so long recently hed had a lot to think about and so many new and utterly bizarre things to learn but the truth was they seemed like beings from another world now and while he wished them only well and could imagine if by some miracle they survived all this going back to them and taking up his old duties again somehow that felt like it was never going to happen and hed long since seen them for the final time a good death well he thought given that you had to die why want a bad one they hovered above a gigantic door composed of great dark curved sections like scimitar blades all pressed together to make a pattern like the petals of a flower the drop had taken nearly half an hour and in that time they had passed another five levels where according to the suit things called variolous tendrils vesiculars gas giant swimmers tubers and hydrals lived the final level above the machine space was empty of life full of oceanic water under kilometres of ice now they were directly above the machine space level where according to both legend and convention the workings of the world as it had originally been conceived still sat lifeless but mighty this is secondary isnt it anaplian asked staring down at the vast shutter yes hippinse said openable hippinse floated over the very centre of the threekilometrediameter door his outline in the visors of the others fuzzy barely hinted at even by the astoundingly sensitive sensors of the suits he detached something from his suit and left it lying right in the doors centre where the great blades met they followed anaplian back up a kilometre to a huge oval hole in the side of the vast shaft entered the hundredmetrediameter tunnel which it led to and floated straight down behind above them something flashed the suits registered tiny but ponderous longwavelength vibrations in the fabric of the tube around them anaplian beckoned them together and when they touched said the main door should have opened the one at the bottom of this too so we can fall straight out xuss and the four suit missiles are going first look ferbin said staring down light a flickering bluegrey circle widened quickly as they fell towards it beyond beneath dimly glimpsed far below vast shapes loomed all curved and swooping sharp and bulbous pocked and ribbed and serrated it was like falling into a vast assemblage of blades the size of storm systems all lit by lightning clear turminder xuss announced suggest staying apart though signalling less a risk than a tight target copy anaplian said tersely they dropped beneath the ceiling of the machine level and hung hundreds of metres apart over a drop of about fifty kilometres to the vast blade systems lying still in the gloom below a few tens of kilometres off a colossal vaned shape like an enormous toroidal gear wheel filled the view its topmost edges ridging up to the level ceiling it seemed to sit on top of and mesh with other titanic spheres and discs all linked to still further massive shapes and far in the distance hundreds of kilometres away their lower reaches obscured by the relatively near horizon of spiralled bladed complexes like immense open flowers enormous wheels and globes the size of small moons bulked in the darkness each seeming to touch the undersurface of the shell above hells gearbox djan seriy thought when she saw it but did not choose to share the image with the others the flickering bluegrey light sporadic sharp intense came from two almost perfectly opposed bearings partially obscured by intervening machinery in both directions thats battle light hippinse said agree anaplian said any ship signals there was a pause yes got it but confused broken up must be the other side getting reflections hippinse said sounding first relieved then worried our direction anaplian asked follow me hippinse said heading off xuss ahead please anaplian said already there the drone said the suits tipped them so that they raced across the ghostly landscape far below with their feet leading though the view could be switched easily enough to make it look as though one was flying headfirst holse asked about this not streamlining the suit replied we are in vacuum so not required this orientation presents smaller target profile in direction of travel and prioritises human head for damage limitation ahha oh yes also what holds the world up holse asked theres no towers the large machines present within this space retain the structural integrity of the ceiling above i see holse said rightyho steer clear of the open tower base anaplian told them leading them away from a great disc of darkness above petals of material nearly a kilometre long hung down from the edges of the gap looking so symmetrical that at first they didnt realise they were the result of something breaking through from above the ship anaplian asked looks like it hippinse said he sounded puzzled and worried again supposed to leave a drone or something here they flew on for another minute until turminder xuss said trouble up ahead what is it anaplian asked somebodys fighting highfrequency crews particle beams and what looks like am by the backsplash from the signatures were outgunned pull to here the drone told them and their visors indicated a line across the long summit of one of the kilometreshigh vanes at the top edge of one of the gigantic spheres light flashed immediately beyond bright enough to trip the visors sightsaving function they drifted to a stop metres beneath the ridge line of the vane each a kilometre or so apart from the other seeing this the drone asked and imposed a view on their visors of a great dark gulf of space beyond between more of the levelfilling spheres and sidetipped concave torus shapes lit by glaring bursts of light the view became shallowly triangulated offered from three different points of view then four and five as the four smaller drones all added their perspective to that of xuss three different sources of pinpoint light and sudden harsh detonations lay between sixtyfive and ninety klicks distant much closer only ten kilometres from them and four down a single object was trading fire with the three faraway sources the coordinated views suggested something only a few metres across was darting in and out behind the cover of great serrated blades on a vast cogwheel beneath firing and being fired at by its three distant adversaries those three read as ours hippinse said urgently theyre having to fall back can we surprise that thing just underneath anaplian asked looks like it ping one of the distants make sure we have this right anaplian said xuss done the drone replied theyre the lps three remaining of four combat drones it left behind under the forced open tower theyre damaged retreating the fourth dead hippinse said slag in the trench between us and the hostile tell them to keep doing exactly what theyre doing xuss those five and a half am missiles prep all but two armed tell two of the extra knives to widen out now and drop not power on my mark secondwave suicideready prepped moving the drone said everybody else spread further out over the next eight seconds then pop over the top and empty everything start moving now ferbin holse remember work with the suit and let it move you if it needs to of course will do maam eight seconds now now now anaplian called the suits bounced them up over the long curved summit of the great ridge of blade light flared above them suddenly looking down into the chasm beneath the exhausts of the drones ampowered missiles were sootdark spots on their visors as the suits blanked out their extreme flaring the visors blinked red circles round their target and all four of their weapons fired ferbins kinetic rifle leapt and hammered in his hand throwing him up and back with every pulse the rounds tiny bright trails left in the eye he started to twist as the recoil tried to turn him round and make him somersault all at once the suit doing its best to compensate and keep the gun pointed at their target light everywhere something thudded into his lower right leg there was a burst of pain as if hed twisted his knee but it faded almost instantly the target washed out in multiple visortripping bursts of light which threw shadows like barbs and thorns all over the ceiling kilometres above cease fire anaplian yelled calling off the dropknives theyre stopped xuss said heres their view something glowing white was falling and tumbling away amongst the curved blades unleashing yellow sparks and leaving orange debris falling slower behind all firing had stopped the fiery falling object was providing the only light there was that it anaplian asked pretty sure xuss said move on keep checking and scan that hostile debris lets go hippinse took a kinetic frag the avatoid wheezed close to getting mushed okay repairing moving okay djan seriy said as they all moved out across the dark trench far below the molten debris was still falling ferbin anaplian said gently im sorry about your leg what he looked down his right leg was missing from the knee down he stared general yilim he thought he felt his mouth go dry and heard something roar in his ears youll be all right his sisters voice said quietly soothingly in his ears suits sealed it and pumped you with painkill and antishock and it was cauterised by the hit you will be fine brother my word on it once were back out well grow a new one easiest thing in the world okay ferbin felt remarkably all right now almost happy mouth okay no roaring any more certainly there was no pain from the wound in fact no sensation down there at all yes he told his sister you sure sir holse said yes he said im all right i feel very good he had to keep looking at it to be sure it had really happened and then felt down just to confirm sure enough no leg below the knee and he felt fine extraordinary that thing was morthtech compromised hippinse told them when he got information back from the microdrone sent to investigate what was left of the machine theyd been fighting one of twelve if its internal records are right what the hells morth stuff doing down here anaplian asked i dont remember any mention of that me neither hippinse said kept that quiet probably well intentioned anaplian made a noise like a spit they were flying a kilometre apart across the edged unfolding darkness of the machine level weaving past the great spherical and ringshaped components surfaces ridged and incised with swirling patterns like cut and chiselled gears the liveware problems three damaged drones were keeping pace ahead hurriedly trying to repair what they could of themselves turminder xuss led the way twenty klicks to the fore any more comped anaplian asked all twelve were two left now we got one and the ship wasted the rest on entry okay anaplian said ship took some damage from them though it did it was hurt on the way down hippinse said from nariscene tech anaplian asked incredulous it had a long way to drop totally contained offering perfectly predictable aiming and no egrid powering hippinse said tried to negotiate but they werent having it they were able to throw a lot at it for a long time it suffered how badly badly enough wounded would have gone limping off before now if this wasnt a desperation mission oh shit anaplian breathed it gets worse hippinse said theres a guard ship a guard ship liveware problems encountered got off a spec readout before it had to concentrate on combat what ship whose also morth nobody aboard ai from the spec seriously capable power linked to the core this wasnt mentioned anaplian insisted must be a recent thing point is its been taken over too how djan seriy said her voice angry must have been running same systems as the guard machines hippinse said comp one and you get the lot if you play it clever fuck djan seriy shouted there was a pause then fuck again this ah comped sir holse said tentatively compromised hippinse told him taken over by the other side persuaded by a sort of thoughtinfection does that happen a lot sir it happens hippinse sighed not to culture ships as a rule they write their own individual os as they grow up so its like every human in a population being slightly different almost their own individual species despite appearances bugs cant spread the morthanveld like a degree more central control and predictability in their smart machines that has its advantages too but its still a potential weakness this iln machine seems to have exploited it hippinse made a whistling noise must have learned a lot fast from somewhere an enabler anaplian said bitterly bet you the oct ran an enabler system at the thing that would fit hippinse agreed what from the ship anaplian asked ferbin and holses suits registered information coming in from one of the three drones but they wouldnt have known how to interpret it seeing this anaplian said her voice sounded flat and lifeless holse felt suddenly terrified even ferbins euphoria was punctured yes hippinse said he sounded grim seeing it light flickered and flared ahead bearing a few similarities to the display produced by the firefight theyd chanced upon earlier between the ship drones and the compromised morthanveld machine but much further away the light was being produced from some way over the horizon and reflecting off the undersurface above strobing and flaring across the ceiling structures with a distant slowness that seemed to imply a conflict of a weight and scale orders of magnitude above that of the earlier skirmish thats them right anaplian asked thats them hippinse replied voice low ferbin heard his sister sigh this she said quietly is not going to be fun they got there in time to see the ships destroying each other the last action was that of the culture superlifter liveware problem it fell into the unnamed morthanveld guard ship a stubby fist ramming a bloated head and partially annihilated both of them in a blast of total spectrum radiation so extreme that even from eighty kilometres away it was sufficient to trip alarms in the suits im gone hippinse said sounding like a lost child down to us now anaplian said crisply hippinse you all right yes the avatoid said they were all watching the distant shrapnel of the wreck huge pieces of ship flailing and tumbling and racing away from the explosion their glinting somersaulting surfaces lit by the fading radiations of the carnage as they flew away smashing into vanes and blades and machinery and ricocheting away again trailed by sparks and liquidic splashes of secondary and tertiary debris still got the drones anaplian asked ive lost them yes yes got them hippinse said quietly theyre answering both ships gone turminder xuss announced i am up close and dodging megatonne shit here and i can see the offending article it has the xinthian ferbins blood seemed to run cold at the mention of the last word xinthian the other name for the worldgod ah what would that mean sir holse asked the xinthian is enclosed within what looks like a fiery cage turminder xuss told them the offender is very small but looks extremely capable energy profile the like of which i have not seen before whod have thought something so ancient would be so potent it showed them beyond where the ships had disputed beyond where their wreckage had slowly fallen splashing wildly across the great flowers of spiralled vanes beneath like sunglinted rain on a forest bloom half a horizon away but coming quickly closer another tableau presented itself the view wobbled overmagnified then grew quickly more stable and detailed as the drone and its accompanying missiles rushed closer the worldgod was an ellipsoid a kilometre across and two in length jerking and writhing within a lightsplintered surround of fierce white fire extending a few hundred metres out from its mottled dark brown surface the iln machine was a dot to one side joined to this tortuous mayhem by a single strand of bright blue energy beneath the xinthian directly over a hole in the centre of one of the immense blade flowers a tiny bright globe was growing throwing off intense recurrent flashes of light beneath it anaplian said sounding like she was gulping its generating antimatter hippinse said where are djan seriy began then they were all hit by intense bursts of laser fire sparkling from a source above and behind them the suits flicked about spun raced away ablating layers ferbin found himself pummelled too warm breathless and his weapon nearly torn from his arms as it twirled aimed and fired in one absurdly fast movement that happened so quickly it left his flesh and bones aching comped morth drone somebody said mine somebody else said youre motherfucker ferbin heard somebody else hiss actually it sounded like him all ferbin knew was that he was being tumbled about and yet the gun was always pointing in the same direction whenever it possibly could and it was kicking and kicking and kicking at him throwing him wildly back bouncing across these dark and livid skies until it all stopped hippinse no answer hippinse reply it was djan seriys voice hippinse her again hippinse ferbin had blacked out momentarily due to the extreme manoeuvring the suit apologised it informed him that they were now sheltered with the surviving members of their group agent anaplian mr holse and himself behind a vane on the flank of the nearest machine sphere the visor helpfully circled his sister and holse each a few hundred metres or so away ten metres down from the scimitared summit of their protecting vane light glittered above strobing over the ceiling structures ferbin began to wonder how he had got here to safety he hadnt actually articulated the words this thought was leading to when the suit told him that it had taken control under agent anaplians instructions ferbin you back with us his sisters voice sounded loud in his ears ah yes he said he tried to check himself tried to carry out a mental inventory of his faculties and bodily parts for a moment everything seemed fine but then he remembered his missing lower leg well no worse he said in fact he felt good still strangely almost absurdly exuberant and sharp suddenly fully recovered from his blackout and seemingly ready for anything some still woozy part of his mind wondered vaguely how profoundly and subtly the suit could affect his emotions and what control over that process his sister had holse djan seriy asked im fine maam but mr hippinse we lost him when he attacked the second of the two comped morth machines also xuss isnt answering and the ship drones dont appear to have survived that last tussle either we are somewhat reduced gentlemen werent there two of those morthanveld machines holse asked both gone now i got the other one anaplian said every word she uttered sounded clipped bitten off holse wondered if she had been wounded too but did not want to ask what now maam that is a good question holse anaplian said i strongly suspect if we stick our heads over this vane above us well get them blown off also due to the angles there isnt really anywhere else to go conversely i have a shortrange linegun that can knock the living fuck out of anything that pokes its head or other relevant part over our side of the vane that is our inventory however the iln machine knows i have this weapon and will certainly not come close enough to let me use it sadly holse heard the woman take a breath we have lost my particle gun to enemy action the kinetics are expended or blasted the crews wont have any effect and the subsidiary missiles have either also expended themselves in the course of action or been vaped vaporised i should say sorry brother sorry mr holse my apologies for having involved you in all this i appear to have led us into a sorry situation it was ferbin thought it was a sorry situation sometimes life itself seemed like a sorry situation what was to become of them and what lay ahead for him he might die here within minutes but even if he didnt he knew he didnt want to be king he never had when hed seen his father killed his first instinct had been to run away even before hed rationalised this gut decision hed always known in his heart he wouldnt be a good king and realised now that in the unlikely event they escaped this desperate fix his whole reign his entire life would be a slow and likely ignominious winding down from this peak of meaning and possible glory there was a new age coming and he could not really see himself being part of it elime oramen him he heard holse say whats to be done then maam well we could just rush the bastard and die very quickly to no effect anaplian said sounding tired or we can wait here until the iln machine finishes making all the antimatter it wants and destroys the whole world us first after itself and the xinthian she added if thats any consolation holse gulped is that really it maam well anaplian began then paused ah it wants to talk might as well hear what it has to say humans a deep sonorous voice said to all of them the shellworld machines were built to create a field enclosing the galaxy not to protect but to imprison control annihilate i am a liberator as were all those who came before me however vilified we have set you free by destroying these abominations join me do not oppose what ferbin said is it saying holse began ignore it anaplian told them its just being a properly devious enemy always unsettle the opposition if possible im telling your suits to ignore any further comms from the machine yes ferbin thought she controls these suits the machine was trying to control us we are controlled its all about control so are we stuck as we are then maam holse asked it and us no anaplian said come to think of it the iln machine doesnt need to settle for a standoff last estimate we took the required am mass will take hours to accrete long before that one of the ilns subpods will appear over that vanesphere way back there good sixty klicks off and pick us off from a distance holse looked at the distant ridge line then around at their immediate surroundings he didnt see how they could be got round hows it going to do that maam it can retreat over the horizon and circle round behind us that way djan seriy said heavily the cores only fourteen hundred klicks in diameter horizons very close could even go right round the core in vacuum wouldnt take long for a sufficiently capable machine id guess we have a couple of minutes oh holse said again yes indeed oh holse thought nothing else we can do maam oh anaplian said sounding very tired there are always things worth trying such as maam going to need one of you two to sacrifice yourself sorry pardon maam then i get to do the same thing anaplian said sounding like she was trying to remain calm so one of us survives for a little while longer at least survivors suit can get them anywhere within sursamen or back to near space more to the point we might just stop the world getting blown up always a reasonable goal what do we have to do ferbin asked somebody has to surrender anaplian said give yourself to the lln machine it will kill you quickly hopefully but it might just be intrigued enough to inspect you first that first one though itll be suspicious of whoever goes first dies to satisfy its caution the second that will be me might just get close enough im already preparing all this in my head im assuming the enabler program the oct hit the lln machine with was one of ours they have subtle misconstructions regarding contact and sc that might aid our cause here though i do have to emphasise that this is the most ridiculously long shot and even then were relying on the worldgod not being fatally injured and it being capable of unmaking all that antimatter an explosion based on whats already accumulated would kill it and do a significant amount of damage to the core so still hope of a desperate kind but you wouldnt bet on any of this trust me so one of us has to holse began i cant ask either of you anaplian started to say at the same time then gulped and shouted ferbin the suited figure was already rising above the shield of the vane upper body exposed to the flickering radiations beyond throwing away the weapon hed been carrying she must have been hit hard when she awoke it was to find herself in the grip of something adamantinely hard and utterly unforgiving dear fuck it had eviscerated her the suit was shredded torn apart and her body inside with it all that was left of her was her head half flayed skin burned off and a short tattered tail of spinal cord this bloody scrap was what the iln thing cradled eyelids burned away she couldnt blink not even her tongue or jaws were responding to orders djan seriy anaplian felt more helpless than a newborn the iln machine above her was dark not big vaguely triangular her eyes were damaged the view hazy so much trouble from something so small she thought and would have laughed if she could its slickly bulbous shape was lit from the side by the cage of light surrounding the xinthian and from below by the scintillations sparking from the containment holding the growing sphere of antimatter strange little beasts you the great heavy voice said inside her head what fleeting titillations life continues to throw up manyfold like virtual particles bioscale so long after oh she had seen all she needed to see heard all she needed to hear go now she was close enough and this was all she had and the worst of it was backups or not shed never know if it was going to be enough fuck yourself djan seriy anaplian

apartment in the company of a smoothly handsome ringlethaired blond gent and holding the hand of a strangelooking little boy she watched openmouthed as he nodded to her mrs holse he said he walked to the centre of their cramped living room put his hands on his hips the oddlooking child still kept a determined hold of his hand and gazed around he was dressed rather well even for a princes servant and looked better than ever he had wellfed and sleek the twins had taken one look and yelped they were hiding behind her skirts holding on fit to drag her to her knees and peeking round one on each side you look well my dear he said he caught sight of the youngest hiding behind the door into the bedroom he waved there was a thin cry and the door banged shut he laughed and looked back at her young choubris at school senble told him good he nodded oh he said with a smile his teeth looked wrong far too pale and even wheres my manners eh he nodded at the glossylooking man standing smiling at his side senble dearest meet mr klatsli quike the fellow nodded slowly an honour maam he was carrying a small pile of boxes bound with ribbons mr quike will be staying with us holse announced breezily and this here he said waving the hand holding that of the oddlooking very seriousseeming little boy is toark toark holse as he shall be known henceforth well be adopting him mr quike is a man of considerable abilities who finds himself at something of a loose end and with a sentimental attachment to our dear homeworld while little toark here is an orphan of war and so much in need of love and a settled family life the poor little soul senble had had enough she threw the wet washing back into the tub wiped her hands once on her skirts pulled herself up to her best height detaching the twins who ran for the bedroom and disappeared squealing and said not a word not a word for an entire year then you march in here bold as you like not a word of apology telling me theres gents going to be staying with us and bringing me another mouth to feed when weve no room in here as it is even without you being back let me add and no money to spend anyway even if we did have the room which we dont now dear holse said picking up the young lad and sitting him on his knee as he settled himself in his old chair by the window the little boy buried his face in holses shoulder we shall have a much bigger and far better set of rooms by this evening mr quike informs me isnt that right mr quike it is sir quike said flashing dazzling teeth he put the pile of ribbonwrapped boxes on the kitchen table and produced an officiallooking letter from his jacket your new lease maam he said showing it to her for one year paid for in advance holse said nodding using what senble asked loudly you wont even get your servants pension now not under this new lot citizen im owing you owe half a years rent on this place i thought you must be the bailiffs when you marched in here i did money is not going to be a problem for us from this point on dearest i think youll find holse nodded at the washtub and you shall have servants to do that sort of thing to protect your delicate hands he was looking round for something you seen my pipe love its where you left it senble told him she didnt know whether to hug the rogue or slap him about the face with the wet washing whats all that anyway she asked nodding at the pile of boxes on the table presents for the children holse explained for the birthdays ive missed and this he said reaching into his jacket and producing a slim box also bound with ribbons is for you my dear he handed it to her she looked at it suspiciously what is it she asked its a present dearest a bracelet she made a humphing noise and thrust the box into her apron pocket without opening it holse looked hurt and wheres all this money coming from senble asked she glared at this quike fellow who smiled gracefully back dont tell me youve finally won something at the betting in a sense dear holse told her the money will be coming from a fund set aside for special circumstances by some new friends ive made he waved one hand airily mr quike will be handling the financial side of things and what do you propose to do senble demanded if this is a betting win you know damn well youll just gamble it all away again next week and well be back to hiding from the constables men and pawning the brass which is already pawned i might add oh im going into a career in politics me dear holse said matteroffactly he was still holding the shy young boy and patting his back reassuring him senble threw back her head and laughed politics you politics me indeed holse said smiling broadly at her she was still distracted by those teeth i shall be a man of the people yet one who has been places and seen things and made friends such as you would entirely not believe my dear im better connected upwards and downwards worldgod be praised than you could possibly imagine also as well as my earthy charm native cunning and other natural abilities i shall have an inexhaustible supply of money quike smiled as though to confirm this outrageous statement which i understand is a not unuseful attribute in the political sphere of life and i shall additionally have a rather better knowledge of my fellow politicians tastes and foibles than they will ever have of mine i shall probably make a very good parliamentarian and an even better first minister what senble said incredulously meanwhile mr quike here will be keeping me honest and making sure i dont become a what was that word mr quike

it at him there she shouted you madman holse flinched the pipe hit him on the shoulder and fell to the floorboards but did not break he lifted it with his free hand thank you my dear most kind he stuck the pipe in his mouth and settled back in the seat with a contented sigh legs extended little toark no longer had his head buried in his shoulder he was looking out at the city now on this sunny fresh and beautiful day holse smiled at the still thunderstrucklooking senble and then glanced up at quike ah family life eh
