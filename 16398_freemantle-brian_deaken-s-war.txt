brian freemantle deakens war prologue home leave had been the reward for the original concept and then for all the training and preparation but he had been away so long that they were practically strangers and it had not been the success they hoped she had wondered if he would mention it to bring it out into the open but he had not she stood just inside the bedroom door watching him pack and wished she could feel greater regret at their parting he was a good man and she wanted to love him but his ambition frightened her it seemed to consume him how long will it take she askeda recurring question ive allowed for two months he said but it could be much shorter maybe just weeks it depends on their reaction being what i predict i hope its short she said frightened of course she said shouldnt i be this could establish me completely mean a lot to us it is going to mean a lot to us she said heavily he hadnt always been a callous man sergeis place at the academy will be automatic he said anxious to stress the advantages he is clever enough to have got in anyway she said he looked around the small apartment and itll be nice to get somewhere bigger she came farther into the room wondering how long it would take her to get to know him again when he was back permanently all his documentation was on the bed beside his suitcase she picked up the south african passport smiling at the stiff official picture rupert underberg she said thats a good name hes got a boy just like us he said two years younger she frowned imagining something she didnt know youve met him he shook his head just borrowed his identity for the last year they walked to the door together the crammers school for the very rich was off the basel to zurich road sufficiently close to zurich for the lake to be visible from its expansive verandahs and stepped walkways here after the struggle of prep schools privileged children of ambitious parents were forcefed to make university entrance just as to the north at strasbourg geese had corn thrust down their throats to make pate de foie gras the product of strasbourg was frequently on the diningroom menu at the ecole gagner its students were frequently on the acceptance lists of oxford and cambridge and harvard and the sorbonne only by sustaining maximum results could it remain the best and charge maximum fees the main building had been created in the seventeenth century in the style of a walled turreted castle with crenellated battlements by a frenchman who had pretensions to a military life without the stamina to make it possible the high walls and the single drawbridged entrance to the dormitory area remained giving the ecole gagner added attraction they meant it was secure even so bodyguards were an accepted feature in the school precincts six were assigned to a kuwaiti prince the son of a rancher who owned ten square miles in paraguay had three so too did tewfik azziz the regimentation at the ecole gagner would have pleased its militaryminded architect everything had its order from mealtimes to recreation to examination times and vacation times the longest holiday was in the summer always starting on the wednesday of the second week in june and not ending until the last thursday in august the principal considered the extended relaxation necessary after the workload imposed through winter and spring most boarding schools have a travel officer reflecting the importance of its pupils the ecole gagner had a department staffed by four here as with everything else the precision was absolute timetables agreed and adjusted weeks in advance to fit parents requirements and usually the convenience of private aircraft azzizs departure was scheduled for noon his father had brought the scheherazade into harbour at monte carlo and the alouette helicopter which had its own pad and hangar at the stem could make the journey to zurich and back to the yacht in under four hours with the inconvenience of road travel only necessary from the school to the airport the schools closeness to the tightpacked foothills prevented its having a landing pad of its own azzizs car left the school grounds at eleven all three bodyguards were with him the american williams who had been a green beret officer and then a contract employee for two years with the cia rode in the back alongside the boy one bedouin drove the other sat beside him in the front from their clothes and demeanour it was difficult to tell that they were arabs or had ten years earlier been desert tribesmen obediently the driver kept to the speed limit crossing the ancient bridge only accelerating slightly along the winding driveway through the outer grounds beyond to the left were the playing fields skating rink and covered swimming pool the gateman was waiting at the boundary wall he looked in smiled and then operated the electrically controlled outer protections the car turned right onto the main road almost immediately picking up the river limmat from the hills it was possible to see the lake into which it fed looking forward to the vacation asked williams with the boy safely aboard the yacht he would have two clear months to himself his sister was expecting him in houston by the end of the week very much said azziz he hadnt found it easy achieving the examination grades but he had managed he knew his father would be pleased it was important always to please his father when do you sit for cambridge asked the american immediately i return they think ill get in without any difficulty the boy knew that the assessment had already been sent along with his endofterm report to his father it was going to be a pleasant holiday the road began to fall away for the final descent into zurich from the elevation it was possible to distinguish the newness of the bahnhofstrasse set against the tangled parts of the old quarter the driver was familiar with the route and turned away towards the airport missing the congestion of the town azziz detected the black spot of a helicopter and wondered if it were his it was too far away to see the markings were in good time said williams as the car turned onto the slip road to the airport he wasnt a good flyer and put a travel pill surreptitiously into his mouth he hoped azziz hadnt noticed there was a separate car park for the private section away from the main airport complex when the car halted all three men turned instinctively towards azziz this was a mistake so too was leaving the doors unlocked all four opened simultaneously the ambush perfectly coordinated move and hes dead said a voice the magnum was against the front of azzizs head so all three men could see it fired from that close it would have decapitated him the three remained motionless it took only moments to disarm them williams had a colt automatic in a shoulder holster and a shortbarrelled smith and wesson against his leg in an ankle strap the arabs each had a smith and wesson both longbarrelled take me too said williams his head was tilted awkwardly because a pistol was hard beneath his left ear dont be stupid said the man who had first spoken he was short and slightly built oliveskinned and crinklehaired one of the bedouin said pig in arabic in the same language the spokesman said tell his father that tell his father were the worst pigs he can imagine he came back to williams you listening yes said the american tell his father to wait until hes contacted and then cooperate if he tries anything with the authorities or any people like you well kill the boy you got that yes said williams again a fifth man appeared in the doorway with a gunlike object in his hand none of the three men recognized it as an immunization compressor which injects without the necessity of a needle there was a hiss as the man fired against the necks of the american and the driver and into the hand of the second arab unconsciousness was almost immediate theyre not hurt said the curlyhaired man to the boy azziz looked fearlessly across the car at him get this gun away from my head he said it hurts the man nodded and the pressure was relaxed you wont be harmed said the man not if you do what youre told youre going to get out of this car and be taken to another if you try to attract any attention well shoot your legs away you wont die but youll be crippled for life do you understand yes said azziz all right said the man now get out the boy got out of the car fully aware for the first time of the number of men who had crowded around the vehicle shielding what was happening from anyone else who might have entered the car park youre idiots said azziz do you have any idea what sort of man my father is we know exactly what he is said the man thats why weve got you the liberianregistered and appropriately named bellicose a freighter of tons sailed from genoa in ballast making easy passage with the coast of italy and france always in sight until it reached marseilles captain sven erlander let his first officer go ashore to arrange the loading while he completed the official record from the rough log he was still working on it when raoul edmunson entered the cabin going well said the first officer plenty of stevedores too anything awkward asked the captain edmunson hesitated i always think arms shipments are awkward he said i dont like them neither do i agreed erlander that wasnt what i meant its all crated said the first officer and the general cargo is already loaded good said erlander as he completed the log the last entry recorded was the visible passing of monte carlo where the scheherazade was expectantly at anchor the helicopter pad was still empty like cigarette odour or the smell of garlic on the breath the overnight argument was still there a barrier neither was prepared to cross richard deaken moved politely but unspeaking about the kitchen and karen manoeuvred with equal good manners and matching silence in the opposite direction in a dance that neither enjoyed nor properly knew the steps she set the table as she always did and he put the brioches in the basket and then laid the bread alongside it was always his job to go to the baker just off the boulevard jacques dalcrose for morning bread just as it was to brew the coffee he concentrated more than was necessary upon the filter he heard her sigh deaken removed the filter and the coffee residue with elaborate caution almost as if it might explode and then carried the pot to the table he put it between them without offering to pour for her she reached forward impatiently splashing some into her cup so that it spilled into the saucer deaken realized it was childish not to have done it for her karen used a tissue to clean the saucer and then turned it between her fingers into a tiny brown ball deaken carefully ensured he finished pouring well before the rim of his own cup so there was no spill he should have bought a newspaper on the way back from the baker to create a physical division between them this is fucking ridiculous yes he said she wasnt referring specifically to this morning but to many before and nights and days and weekends things had been going badly for a long time i meanwhy dont know its ridiculous like you said do you still love me you know i do then why she pleaded again ridiculous he repeated they were still dancing more intricately now it neednt be deaken regarded their arguments like some juvenile game of scrabble a limited number of words arranged before them to create into a pattern of familiar sentences or phrases we cant afford a baby he saidthe most familiar phrase of all karen crumbled a brioche between her fingers until it became a scattered pile of crumbs and dough we cant even afford this fucking bun she said you know im right shall i tell you something she raised her hand way above her head so that bread debris rained down between them im fed up to here im utterly and absolutely pissed off with this bloody affectation you dont have to swear ill swear as much as i fucking well like she seized her coffee cup with both hands making a barrier between them he thought she was beautiful even though she had only scraped a comb through the blonde hair and coloured her lips anger flushed her face she looked young and innocent and flustered he wanted to reach out and touch her he didnt its not an affectation he insisted he didnt want to argue any more with her then tell me what it is weve been through it all before richard deaken on the run again im not running away he said i work here in geneva because i want to because i think it might have a future for me and because to have stayed in south africa was impossible you know that you dont work here she persisted you go into that dingy bloody office and make chains out of paperclips all day why the hell maintain all this crap about being a lawyer for the underdog were the only underdogs in the entire country the swiss are too bloody expert at making money maybe i should try to join a firm he conceded deaken wondered how long it would take other trained lawyers to recognize his problem if he did join a group of partners to realize that his trial nerve had gone so that he couldnt remember the construction of a brief or the points of defence or prosecution or seize as he had once been able to seize the mistakes and errors of the other side and turn them to his advantage youd better before its too late she said theres no point in having an international law degree and the reputation you have unless you use it deaken started eating a brioche not because he wanted it but because he needed something to do it was difficult to swallow he should have sought psychiatric help before now before it had become so bad that he didnt think he could ever again appear in open court and had tried to bury himself in the anonymity of civil ligitation would you need money to buy into a firm almost certainly we havent got any sometimes theyll let you pay it off from salaries and fees once youve joined she reached across the table for his hand an impulsive gesture i dont mean to bitch she said i know i do love you i know how good and successful you could be it just seems letting everything drift like this is such a waste she never accused him of failing her even during their fiercest arguments but he believed she felt that he had maybe ill look around he said karen put her head doubtfully to one side promise she said not today said deaken ive actually got a client today ill start tomorrow karen stood and swept the crumbs she had created into her napkin and then cleared the rest of the breakfast things from the table ive been thinking she said from the sink about what getting a job she turned as she said it conscious of the effect it would have she lifted a rubbergloved hand against any outburst washing bubbles dripping onto the floor in front of her im not trying to start another fight she said quickly im bored with nothing to do honestly and it would help youve got to admit it would help financially i mean i said id look around said deaken tightly switzerland was packed with doctors and psychiatrists maybe it wouldnt take long he wouldnt tell karen she had once thought of him as strong and forceful thats got nothing to do with it she said why on earth shouldnt i work because i dont want a wife of mine having to he said recognizing as he spoke the same pride that kept him from telling her of his fear of a breakdown thats rubbish she said i might have to soon she dried and creamed the hands of which she was so proud and began shaping her nails with an emery board wait please he said what for lets see what i can find havent we waited long enough she stared up from her manicure and for a moment deaken thought his wife was going to continue arguing instead she made a half shrug with her shoulders and went back to her filing he got up from the table took a cloth and began wiping the crockery she had stacked into the draining tray he was alongside her but she didnt look at him why dont we meet for lunch he said we cant she began and then stopped what time are you meeting this client she said instead eleven what about i dont know i cant imagine that itll go on until lunchtime nothing had lasted that long from the time he had arrived in switzerland why dont i ring you around twelve thirty just in case fine agreed deaken they had returned to the elaborate politeness of an hour before because he was meeting a new client the first for a month deaken wore the better of his two suits the one with least shine at the seat and elbows he returned to the kitchen from the bedroom for a cloth to give his shoes a final buff when he straightened karen came forward and adjusted the knot of his tie he reached out for her feeling the stir of excitement at the touch of her body beneath the thin housecoat maybe today will be the big one she said thanks he said what for being kind she stretched up to kiss him twelve thirty she said ill be waiting outside the apartment deaken hesitated at once aware that it had grown hotter since he had been out for the breakfast bread he set out towards the water turning left almost immediately up the rue de rhone and then right along a crossstreet to take him to the avenue pictet de rochemont it was too expensive an office even huddled as it was like some afterthought atop the grander suites of bankers and accountants but deaken had wanted an impressive address a mistake he thoughtlike so much else he went in through the main entrance with its smoked glass and potted plants and uniformed doormen feeling like an interloper and took the lift as far as it would go he emerged on the eighth floor where the offices were already diminishing in size and walked up the stairway to the top floor which had been added at some time like icing to a cake here the flooring was linoleum not marble or cork or tile and the windows fronting the corridor had the smeared look of glass cleaned once a week by a charwoman with little enthusiasm deakens office was the fourth along to the right but he stopped at the second because it was the one that elian fochet occupied when he entered she was bent over a newspaper crossword anything he said an offer for an outofhours answering service without which no successful business is supposed to be able to operate and a handout from american express on the benefit of taking cards against the firm for employees use recited the woman she hesitated and added everyone got the same thanks said deaken youve an appointment at eleven she said elian fochet was mousyhaired absolutely flatchested and wore butterfly spectacles that had gone out of fashion years before deaken thought she looked exactly what she was the shared secretaryreceptionist for a group of people hanging on by their fingertips to some pretension of business he wondered if she was a virgin i know he said do you want me to serve coffee no thank you said deaken her coffee was appalling it wont be any trouble no really she offered him the circulars but he shook his head she threw them in the waste basket he continued on to his own office unlocked the door and stood at the entrance the cheap carpet still looked presentable so did the couch along one wall and the matching chair in front of the desk he could have got away with the imitation black leather chair highbacked and paddedarmed behind it but the desk was ply and looked it despite the attempt to disguise it with varnish the inset too was clearly plastic and not leather nothing he could do about it now though from a bottom drawer of the desk deaken took a duster and wiped the desk top then the sparsely filled filing cabinet and after that the windowsill he slanted the venetian blinds lessening the light coming into the room and then looked over his shoulder better he decided not much better he dusted the telephone which rarely rang returned the cloth to its drawer and from the one above took out his clean notepad there were six pencils in a cup to the right all needle sharp thats how hed occupied the last hour of the previous day it was ridiculous to continue like this he had to do something and do it soon the erosion of selfconfidence had been insidious a run of bad trial resultsnot surprising considering the sort of trials they wereand he had suddenly decided to take a rest expand my experience in civil litigation hed told everyone except that he hadnt been offered any civil litigation and doubts about his own ability had intensified until now he wasnt sure if he could handle a case even if it were offered help he thought thats what he needed professional medical help there would be no reason for karen to know he was having treatment easy enough to arrange appointments and sessions during the day what about the real cause of the rows and their increasingly strained relationship he was frightened of parenthood deaken admitted to himself of seeing karen balloon into awkward ugliness nine months of worrying whether the child would be bom properly formed and not with some mental or physical disability was he unusual thinking like that unnatural even he knew karen was determined to become pregnant just as he was determined against it get the job settled first he thought the baby could come later richard deaken on the run again because of the glass fronting he was aware of the shadowed approach even before the peremptory knock on the door deaken just managed to stand before the man got into the room he was tall and broadshouldered with clipped fair hair and a suntanned open face the sort of man to play rugby or tennis deaken thought one look encompassed the room and deaken knew the shading from the venetian blinds hadnt worked shit he thought the man offered his hand rupert underberg he said the contact was dry businesslike for the first time deaken put the name in possible context the accent was bland but there could have been the slightest trace of south africa when underberg sat in the chair indicated deaken realized his face was almost completely shadowed in the effort to put the office in better light deaken glanced at his wristwatch underberg was ten minutes early the man looked again around the office more critically this time deaken had no doubt he could manage lunch with karen he would probably have time to plait several yards of paperclips except that he didnt have sufficient for several yards he normally collected these from incoming mail it was thoughtless not to have accepted the brochures from the answering service and american express this morning you didnt make it clear in your telephone call what exactly it was that i could do for you mr underberg said deaken i didnt know then said the man now i do what is it negotiate for me said underberg negotiate something very difficult and special deaken felt a spurt of interest he took one of the painstakingly sharpened pencils from the coffee cup wrote underberg on the pad underlined it twice and then looked up why dont we talk about it and ill see if can help he said oh i think youll be able to help deaken inscribed a third line beneath the mans name how he said mildly irritated by the mans attitude do you know adnan azziz deaken frowned briefly then he remembered the saudi arabian arms dealer continued underberg the biggest yes said deaken i know of him he kills people said underberg not directly he never does anything directly deaken leaned forward over his desk hand against his forehead to shield his face as much as possible from the other man the words had an ominously familiar ring he had appeared in civilrights trials either as the leading defence advocate or as the supporting advisory counsel to lawyers of the country in germany and america and chile and nicaragua and turkey and ireland and south africa and so often his involvement had begun with a meeting like this and with words like these not me he thought i cant do it anymore ive lost the enthusiasm ive lost the anger i just want to be left alone i dont think this is for me he said oh yes it is said underberg deakens apprehension tightened i know all about you richard deaken said underberg i know that in south africa your father is a leading member of the nationalist government a predicted cabinet minister which he would have been much sooner if it wasnt for the embarrassment of having a famous son up to a year ago there wasnt a betterknown civilrights lawyer than you anywhere in the world not many people simultaneously get the cover story in time and newsweek you know whats happened in the last year lost your taste for fighting who are you demanded deaken the man smiled baring his teeth again and stretched back in the chair the man youre going to work for get out said deaken youre going to negotiate for me with adnan azziz said underberg his voice measured and confident deaken stood up please get out of my office underberg settled farther in his chair we have information that adnan azziz has completed an arms deal worth something like with terrorists in angola and namibia it goes beyond rpg rocket launchers up to wirecontrolled tank and antipersonnel carrier missiles which we presume the soviet advisers intend to operate because the swapo guerrillas certainly havent got the ability thousands of ak rifles and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition and not just communist weapons we know there are crates of american armalite rifles again with tons of ammunition i dont want to know said deaken he was still standing and felt vaguely ridiculous its important that you know said underberg like a patient schoolmaster ive already told you i wont take instructions said deaken with growing exasperation for gods sake get out of my office its for a massive assault in namibia continued underberg as if the lawyer hadnt interrupted we think its timed for midjuly weve no definite date but we know thats the month well find out soon enough for what deakens question was automatic without proper thought underbergs teeth showed in his piranha smile to stop it happening of course he said its scheduled to be their big show the one that will finally sway public opinion against south africa in favour of the united nations initiative theyre even going to invite the worlds press to report it only it wont quite be the story they expect deaken sat down underberg obviously had no intention of leaving and there was no way he could make him weve infiltrated swapo up to here said underberg putting his hand beneath his chin were going to mount a counteroffensive they couldnt imagine possible and annihilate the whole movement in one decisive battle he shifted trying both for effect and a more comfortable position in the cramped chair because were going to have helicopters and tanks and guns and rifles and missiles and theyre going to be grabbing for bows and arrows and spears you said theyd purchased worth of weaponry said deaken which theyre never going to see said underberg you will get azziz to deflect the shipment dont be ridiculous everythings been thought out very carefully mr deaken itll work exactly as we intend it to deaken shook his head this wasnt the sort of job he had hoped to impress karen with at lunch azziz has a son of eighteen said underberg a very attractive if indulged child this morning he was kidnapped on his way to join his father for his summer vacation jesus christ erupted deaken you know i cant listen to any of this youre mad no said underberg just determined i could have you arrested the moment you leave here for the first time the mans amusement seemed genuine itll take the police or any other force hours to get here even if they believed you by which time i could be halfway across europe i understand your attitude really do i actually feel sorry for you i told you once to get out said deaken burned by an awareness of utter impotence now im telling you again get out of this office i dont believe a word youve said but i still intend informing the police he snatched at the telephone immediately aware that he didnt know what number to ring the instrument growled demandingly in his ear put it down said underberg no one can get through to you if the receiver is off the rest deaken remained with the receiver held before him underberg reached over the desk and depressed the telephone rest the growling stopped put it down said the man again please slowly deaken did what he was told thank you said underberg he looked at his watch no harm will come to the boy he said his voice even and conversational youre to assure azziz of that if he does what we want his son will be released unharmed and quite safe the telephone jarred into the room deaken jumped it was too early for karen far too early shouldnt you answer it said underberg deaken obeyed richard said a voice he recognized at once as karens im with two men they came to the apartment just after you left and said you wanted to see me so i went theyve told me to telephone you deaken tried to swallow against the sensation in his throat ive come a long way in a car im frightened said his wifes voice whats happening richard they drove fast anxious to cross the border the speedometer needle registering the permitted maximum on every road although they were cautious never to exceed it and risk interception by the police the bodyguards had been under observation for two months but their body weight was still only an estimate the reduced oblivon inoculation had been carefully measured against that body weight but there was always the possibility they would recover earlier than the scheduled hour and that they would ignore the instructions and raise an official alarm sealing off the country they chose basel as the citroen joined the queue of vehicles edging into france the curlyhaired man arranged an anorak across his lap covering the magnum he wedged against azzizs knee well be watching you not just from both sides but from the front as well warned the man the slightest mistake when we come to the check and ill blow your leg off it was the height of the holiday season and the busiest time of the day when the customs officials were under the greatest pressure to keep the tourist flow moving in both directions the passport checks were cursory very good said the man as the car picked up speed and began to descend into france im glad your people did what they were told take the gun away said azziz it was an order not a request the man did where are we going asked the boy not much farther my father will pay you know whatever you ask for hell pay i hope youre right the tension lifted from the men in the vehicle now that the border had been crossed the driver still kept within the speed limit they went through st louis and then almost at once huningue mulhouse was already being signposted but they turned off the main road to rixheim three of the men keeping azziz between them got out at the farmhouse the driver kept the engine running using the gate entrance to make his turn and go back towards the main road it was a square threestorey yellowbrick building with white shutters freshly painted and strapped back alongside each set of windows it was no longer a farm the surrounding fields were rented to a neighbouring farmer and the main house given over to holiday rentals a boule set was neatly arranged at one end of the gravel drive and the immaculately clipped lawns through which they walked were set with a garden table and chairs and a canopied swing seat everything was new and whitepainted the canopy and seats were striped bright green the thick oak door led immediately into the main communal room it occupied almost half the ground floor and was dominated by a huge open fireplace at one end racks and spits of a curing system were still in place there were vases of flowers on the central table and on the large open dresser and sideboard as they entered a man emerged from what was clearly the adjoining kitchen he nodded towards them but said nothing azziz stood by the central table looking around him curiously he was a blackhaired deeply browneyed boy tall and athletically slim already his fathers london staff were inquiring about stabling facilities for his polo ponies in the cambridge area he held himself disdainfully erect what now he said we wait said the only man who ever spoke you talked in arabic at the airport yes but youre not an arab no momentarily azzizs demeanour faltered israeli zionist seeing the boys alarm the man added you wont be harmed providing your father does as we ask how are you called shimeon said the man shimeon levy a good enough pseudonym said the boy its my given name said levy im not afraid of people knowing it they will soon enough captain erlander returned from the port office by eleven edmunson was aft on the gangway deck supervising the loading and the captain turned away from the bridge approach going towards the stern how is it he said another six tons said the first officer an hour then give me two just in case theres a holdup threeoclock castoff decided erlander the forecast is good so we can clear the strait by midnight erlander saw the other man frown and smiled at the doubt dawn then he said i want to get rid of this cargo as soon as i can there was a workers cafe in the docks and from one of its windows a man had patiently watched the loading he was dressed in overalls like other customers but appeared uncomfortable with his dress and his surroundings he was an african his name was edward makimber richard deaken sat hunched forward over the desk staring fixedly at the other man he was sick with anger and impotence the feeling of nausea churning through him sour in his mouth he was aware too of something else he was frightened where is she not in geneva bastard dont be stupid said underberg i give you my word she wont be harmed or bothered in any way what good is your word its all youve got why pleaded deaken desperately why me if youve got the boy why not deal with azziz direct underberg shook his head it wouldnt work half as well its been carefully planned deaken looked away from the patronizing selfsatisfied man think he had to think like the trained lawyer he had once been still was christ he was frightened it wont work deaken said he took up one of his sharpened pencils tracing squares on the paper in front of him as he arranged his argument lets say i get through to azziz and lets say he believes me and diverts the shipment so what hell have met the demands he gets his son back and then all hes got to do is assemble another shipment you said yourself hes the biggest there is hes got the resources underberg laughed but thats precisely why youre involved why weve got your wife deaken thought how he would like to smash his fist into that face not just once but over and over again a second shipment doesnt matter underberg said ive already told you the swapo buildup is underway for an assault in july once its stopped there wont be time for azziz to arrange another but hell try something hes the sort of man who has to which is why youre so essential we need someone in the middle someone who can report every move we dont want to negotiate in the dark the emotion surged through deaken making him shake his legs were tightly together feet braced against the floor his hands pressed against the desk top it would be natural for you to try and hit me anticipated underberg in his even unmoved voice id feel the same way myself if i were you but dont try itid knock the shit out of you deakens eyes flooded at his own helplessness dont hurt her he begged please dont hurt her ive already promised you that deaken pushed his hand across his face where was the cohesion to his thoughts the logic that had made him best of his year at rand university how do we keep in touch where do i go underberg reached into his inside pocket theres an air ticket to nice the evening flight he said azziz is in monte carlo from an opposite pocket the man extracted an envelope money he said we know you havent got any and youll need it the third item was a single sheet of paper telephone numbers listed underberg the first is a public kiosk on the quayside at monte carlo the quai des etatsunis the second is of the bristol hotel if you havent been to monte carlo before its on the boulevard albert theres got to be more than that protested deaken underberg shook his head contact will always come from us never from you be by that quayside kiosk at noon every day if its engaged for any protracted length of time or broken for some reason then go to the bristol at four the same afternoon and well call you therenothing will ever go wrong with the telephone system of a hotel like the bristol it made them absolutely secure deaken realized i want to know something he said what does my father know anything about this nothing insisted underberg and there must be no contact between youwed know if there were youll be watched all the time you wont know but well always be around when will i get karen back when were satisfied you control me as long as shes safe said deaken if anything happens to her your pressure goes he stopped unsure of the threat then he said if anything does happen to her ill hunt you down wherever and however ill hunt you down and kill you of course you will said underberg calmly karen deaken walked apprehensively into the farmhouse staring about her warily her hair was straggled and she had been crying she looked crumpled and small beside the hugebellied bearded man who had brought her from switzerland through the same unhindered crossing at basel at once levy crossed the room towards her you mustnt be frightened he said soothingly everything is going to work out all right i promise fear never hurt anybody said the bearded man whose name was solomon leiberwitz stop it levy said to him to karen he said dont worry she looked at him he smiled she responded nervously then realized what she was doing and straightened her face what do you want levy gestured towards the bench alongside the fireplace where tewfik azziz sat for the moment he said just for you to sit next to him over there what for we want to take your photograph said the israeli together adnan mohammed azziz was a man conscious of his importance and content with the security and respect it accorded him he was one of a number of menanother was his countrys oil ministerborn outside the dynastic hierarchy of brothers and cousins of the saudi monarchy but accepted within it and even accorded the honorary title of sheik because he was a successful traveller in both directions across the bridge between the isolated religiously dominated court of riyadh and the commercial elbowjostle of the west his unique and peculiar empire had been founded by his father who by camel pack had supplied the weapons that enabled ibn saud to surge in from his nomads camp storm a desert fort and establish his as the predominant family in a kingdom where oil was yet to be discovered the father had taught the son and adnan azziz had been a diligent pupil not just in a goatskin tent but later after the oil came at oxford and then the business school at harvard a dynasty created by arms never forgets their necessity even when the tradition changes from muzzle loaders and lee enfields to radar systems missiles and supersonic jet fighters azziz served his country well and himself better with seemingly inexhaustible funds at his disposal he arranged payment by percentage of what he purchased and began his very first negotiation fully aware of the commission that would be available from the grateful manufacturer he was neither greedy nor careless remembering his fathers teaching that a man fortunate to enjoy curds every day misses them all the more when they are denied him he traded hard but always fairly never leaving dissatisfied the seller with whom he dealt or the purchaser for whom he acted another of his fathers teachings was that the gold merchants of the souk frequently began as copper beaters azziz applied for and was granted court permission to act for others expanding his expertise and influence to the benefit of his country and his fortune to the benefit of himself it took him twenty years to become the largest and most successful independent arms dealer in the world in so doing adnan azziz became a truly international man as comfortable in a galabeeyeh in his palace overlooking the red sea near jedda as he was hosting a cocktail party at which he only ever drank orange juice in his penthouse on the corner of new yorks fifth avenue and st street or in his regency town house in south audley street running parallel with londons park lane but he was most comfortable of all aboard the scheherazade it was a large white elaborate and sophisticated yacht tons in weight dieselpowered and with a crew complement of fifty they were as specialized as the vessel in which they served six men were employed to operate communication equipment equal to that of american naval cruisers and necessary to maintain constant and uninterrupted liaison with azzizs worldspanning business links part consisted of two computers and a locationandfix device programmed for orbital navigational satellites the fifty did not include the tenman team necessary to service maintain and fly the sternhoused alouette nor the immediate legal staff at least two of whom were normally in constant attendance wherever azziz was domiciled at any time they were led by an american named harry grearson who was with azziz when the panicked telephone call came from zurich airport the open emotion came entirely from switzerland the nature of his business had taught azziz complete control even when being told of the abduction of his only son his voice kept to a monotone when he recounted the conversation to grearson in the stateroom of the yacht who are they like his employer the lawyer remained quietvoiced there was no indication apart from the fact that they spoke arabic as well as english said azziz he was an imposing man tall and fullbodied the stature increased by the fact that the weight was not indulgence but muscle he wore white ducks a blue shortsleeved shirt and was completely naked of any jewellery even a wristwatch youve informed the police no said azziz at once we were warned not to thats a mistake said grearson better this way insisted the arab ill meet the demand whatever it is tewfiks mother had died in childbirth and despite taking three more wives as azziz was allowed by moslem law his four other children were all daughters what have you told your people to do fly back here so i can question them more fully there was nothing left in the car no note or letter apparently not it shouldnt have happened not with three of them i know said azziz so do they would any arab faction have cause to attack you azziz shrugged i dont know of a particular reason supplied the shah so the iranian fundamentalists could regard me as an enemy they dont have the organization judged grearson azziz lifted the internal telephone dialled the communications room and asked to be told the moment the alouette radioed landing instructions it could be purely criminal without any political implications said grearson he was a lean greyhaired man who wore rimless glasses which he was constantly adjusting arranging them back and forth along the bridge of his long aquiline nose he never wore anything but a business suit today it was dark blue and waistcoated and seemed incongruous in the surroundings of the yacht do we get him back ourselves well need someone azziz agreed who professionals decided azziz soldiers but not yet lets see what they want it might not be necessary the internal telephone purred softly azziz listened without talking and then said to the lawyer theyre here led by williams the three men who had failed to prevent tewfik azzizs kidnap came single file into the stateroom the american was clearly nervous the bedouins terrified once more demanded azziz what happened the voice was still quiet williams started hurriedly but azziz stopped him at once ordering him to begin again and this time neither azziz nor grearson interrupted when williams had finished azziz told the bedouins to recount their version in arabic it took longer because of the two mens fear and because they interrupted each other in the telling when they finished azziz interrogated williams and the bedouins to ensure the stories matched and that nothing had been missed eight men then he said that i counted confirmed williams there could have been more in charge of transport remembering williamss green beret service grearson said any indication that they were military williams thought about the question obviously it had been carefully planned but i didnt get a marked impression of drilling the medical gun is intriguing said grearson to williams he said the three of you recovered almost simultaneously williams nodded agreement within a moment or two of each other about an hour for grearsons benefit azziz said ive asked about any accent in the arabic that was spoken they say it could have been palestinian or jordanian maybe even iraqi grearson grimaced too wide he said no liberation group would have cause to do it said azziz ive supported them with both money and weanons im sorry said williams very sorry azziz looked steadily at the man for several moments then he said simply yes i think we should inform the police said grearson again well wait said azziz for how long asked the lawyer as long as it takes said azziz with arab fatalism it was another five hours the package had been delivered by hand to the harbour office at monte carlo and was brought back in the yachts tender doing the evening mail run grearson saw that azzizs hands were quite steady as he slit it open it was a coloured polaroid picture of tewfik azziz and a woman neither of them recognized sitting stiffly upright on a bench alongside what appeared to be a wide fireplace a flash had been used in what must have been quite strong sunlight so the picture was overexposed just a photograph queried grearson azziz turned it over a name he said richard deaken with what appear to be some letters of qualifications grearson took the photograph its a lawyers degree he identified immediately several in fact while grearson was examining the picture the arab opened the second letter to arrive that night scanning it briefly its the school report he said softly theyre confident of his getting into cambridge as he spoke richard deaken was disembarking at nice airport from the evening flight from geneva six hours had elapsed since the confrontation with underberg and he still felt confused they had been identified to each other when the photograph was taken and separated immediately afterwards both locked in separate bedrooms at either end of the house in each a securing bar closed the outer shutters across the outside of the windows which had been screwed down so that it was impossible to open them even slightly into the frames steel bars had bean newly fitted a portable toilet was set in the comer of each room and each had a washstand with a flowerdecorated bowl and matching pitcher the wardrobes were empty except for hangers when they were fetched for the evening meal karen was sitting on the very edge of the bed staring towards the door azziz was asleep so he was the last to enter the downstairs room only levy sat down with them at the table azziz stretched up to look into the tureen and said is this meat kosher no said levy i want to be sure dont eat it if you dont want to said the israeli theres plenty of cheese and fruit he offered the dish to karen she had combed her hair and applied some fresh lipstick but her eyes were still red she hesitated and then ladled a small amount onto her plate it was lamb flavoured with just the right amount of garlic levy helped himself and then pushed the tureen towards azziz the boy stared at a piece of meat he had manoeuvred onto his ladle and then served himself the wine was local in an unmarked bottle levy gestured towards karens glass she hesitated again and then nodded indicating a jug levy said to azziz i assumed youd want water why is mrs deaken involved in this demanded azziz her husband is necessary said levy he broke some bread from a stick whats happening to richard she blurted nothing levy said gently hes working doing a job thats all hes quite safe azziz put more of the stew onto his plate then looked across the table at the man is it new jewish strategy to fight with women levy pushed aside his plate cut a portion of goats cheese and then took an apple to eat with it he looked down concentrating upon peeling the fruit our argument isnt with you he said nor with arabs even not directly azziz frowned and said i dont understand its not necessary for you to said levy how long are you going to keep me here said karen she wished her voice had been stronger no longer than we have to said levy a few days i hope thats all and me asked azziz the same after the meal there was coffee freshly ground and as good as everything else they remained at the table to drink it tomorrow there will be some books promised levy and games im getting a backgammon set he looked at karen do you play no she said pity levy turned to the arab youll be allowed out into the garden to exercise watched of course and not together one acting as hostage for the other seized the boy yes said levy simply we dont want to hurt you either of you unless absolutely necessary goaded azziz wont argue with you said levy theres no purpose in it he summoned leiberwitz to escort azziz back to his room he took karen himself at the bedroom door he said i know you came away from geneva with nothing i dont want you to be embarrassedif theres anything you need anything personal make a list and ill get it for you thank you even underwear he said ill get it myself she thought he was more discomfited than she was dont be afraid about the men i mean he said you wont be troubled thank you she said again i wanted you to know this isnt what i expected she said nor me admitted the man the scheherazade was arranged like a gaudy ornament on the skyline lit brilliantly overall there was even some form of underwater illumination so that the hull was visible along its entire length because of the lighting deaken had seen the tender cream away from the side of the vessel while he was still linked by radio telephone from the harbour masters office to adnan azziz away from the yacht it merged into the blackness of the intervening sea deaken became conscious of the telephone bank and hurried to it the number he had been given earlier that day in geneva was the second box from the left he looked hard at it then lifted the receiver nothing appeared wrong with it he turned back towards the most obvious quay steps almost at once the tender emerged from the darkness there appeared to be a crew of three and a man in civilian clothes as deaken looked the man stood up and moved to the side of the vessel that was being brought against the harbour edge greyhaired thin almost to the point of gauntness officiallooking thought deaken he waved unthinkingly selfconsciously stopping the gesture half completed there was no response from the tender two crewmen fended off making no attempt to secure the helmsman kept the boat expertly in place by reverse and forward thrusts of the engine deaken said the man in the suit yes grearson mr azzizs attorney deaken stepped awkwardly into the boat at once it moved away putting him further off balance deaken held a side rail and offered his hand grearson looked as if it were holding something offensive in silence they travelled towards the scheherazade they were so close it seemed to dominate the skyline now deaken thought it looked more like a liner than a yacht there was a stepped walkway wider than stairs in normal houses let down from the side with a flat landing stage at the bottom three feet above the lifting sea the tender coasted perfectly alongside deaken followed the other lawyer out as awkwardly as he had boarded as he climbed he saw the davit hawsers dangling ahead ready to lift the tender the winch had whined into operation by the time he gained the deck deaken looked around expectantly but apart from the crew waiting to ease the tender into its cradle it was deserted this way said grearson deaken followed obediently aware of a clumsiness in the other mans walk it was not a limp more the cautious stiffness of someone nervous of pain as soon as deaken went inside the yacht he was aware of the smell cigars clearly and perhaps perfume or incense combined it was an odour of richness luxurious richness the inner companionways were deeply carpeted and the panelling a dark heavy mahogany where there was metalwork it gleamed from constant polishing the companionway led to a landing that crossed the width of the ship and from it in a doublesided descent of steps ran a stairway that reminded deaken of the circle approach in a cinema or theatre it was indeed an approach culminating not in walkways along a lower deck but in a large set of doublefronted doors highly polished and dark wood again grearson who was still in front knocked and entered immediately leaving the door open for deaken to follow the young lawyer stopped just inside the door only the roundness of the portholes showed they were aboard a ship deaken guessed a hundred people could have gathered in the stateroom here for a reception without the slightest impression of overcrowding padded seating in white leather around the bulkheads was broken intermittently by tables from which flowers spilled in profusion there were larger easy chairs and couches again in masculine leather arranged around the room and two small writing bureaux with a third lower table upon which were grouped four telephones there was no colour differentiation they were all white to deakens immediate left there was a bar area with a steward in attendance a glitter of glass and chrome and four highlegged chairs the carpeting throughout the entire area was white and longtufted the man who stood waiting in the middle of the room dominated it not because of his height and barrel body but from the way he held himself when he was young deaken had attended government and diplomatic functions with his father and seen the same demeanour it was always from politicians or leaders who were long established who considered themselves unchallengeable the man was as severely dressed as the american lawyer in a dark grey singlebreasted suit in some material that shone slightly but not from overwear it was probably silk like everything it went with the perfume of wealth i am adnan azziz he said the english was entirely without accent richard deaken yes the voice was expressionless neither hostile nor friendly theres a mistake said deaken desperately a misunderstanding weve obeyed your instructions cut in azziz tell me what you want they are not my instructions exclaimed deaken i want my son back unharmed said azziz deaken was overwhelmed by a feeling of inadequacy he was aware of his concertinaed bagged suit and a collar that his tie didnt fit properly the tie that karen had tried to adjust for him that morning the last time she had touched him and of his flyaway hair and of the stickiness of his skin where he had sweated in fear of underberg and then because he had travelled too far too fast on overheated aircraft and was confronting people he didnt want to meet god he thought oh dear god theyve taken my wife he said simply neither man facing him made any response didnt you hear what said demanded deaken theyve kidnapped my wife this morning to make me do this come here azziz looked sideways to grearson i said we knew about you repeated the american lawyer he reached to one of the small tables and picked up what appeared to be a telex printout you were considered a radical at rand university he said after qualifying in international law you were actively involved with subversive movements he looked up became famous through it he said deaken closed his eyes against the catalogue it was like a criminal record a list of previous convictions to be presented at every opportunity no more he said wearily im married now trying to establish a private practice in geneva picked up grearson still consulting the paper and wanting to show azziz how efficiently he had assembled the information from just the qualification initials after deakens name on the photograph operating there for a year listen said deaken please just listen haltingly at first anxious for some reaction from the blank closed faces in front of him deaken recounted what had happened in geneva setting it out chronologically as he would have done in court a shipment to africa queried azziz thats what he said the arab looked to his lawyer again grearson shook his head surely you know about it insisted deaken its for for gods sake which is a comparatively small amount said azziz it could be a subsidiary sale said grearson talking to the arab there would never have been an enduser certificate if it is going to africa deaken frowned between the two men check it tonight if you can ordered azziz as grearson moved to the telephone bank azziz said to deaken whats your wife like what describe her inexplicably deaken felt embarrassed blonde he said she wears it short brown eyes doesnt use a lot of makeupdoesnt have to quite short about five foot five slim too from the table from which the lawyer had taken the telex sheet the arab handed deaken a photograph deakens eyes flooded when he saw her and he blinked she was holding herself stiffly upright legs tightly together shoulders squared there was a school photograph of karen like that back in the apartment except that there she was smiling you knew said deaken looking up to azziz putting her in the picture doesnt mean shes a victim it could have been done to support your story does she look like an accomplice said deaken look at it does she azziz took the photograph back no he admitted after a pause i want her back safely said deaken just like you want your son back azziz smiled for the first time if all it means is stopping a small arms shipment itll be easy at am the bellicose cleared the strait of gibraltar edmunson was the officer of the watch he ordered the freighters course twenty degrees to port and entered the reading in the rough log he was conscious of the ship heaving in the more exposed north atlantic but knew from the forecast that the swell was moderate if the weather held it was going to be an easy uneventful voyage a thousand miles away from the yacht in monte carlo harbour grearson put down the telephone from his fifth call france he announced to the waiting men they had only bothered with sandwiches and coffee served and then immediately removed by hovering stewards in the beginning azziz and grearson had talked across him but now they included him in the conversation and listened to his opinions marseilles is convenient said the arab paris thinks the ship has left already we shant know until the port office opens in the morning said grearson thought you said you couldnt ship direct said deaken grearson hesitated the enduser certificate was arranged through portugal he said the what enduser certificate repeated the other lawyer its the official documentation stipulating the destination of any shipment for the benefit of the authorities how does it work for this consignment theyve been sold to a portuguese arms company with the azores given as the port of unloading during the voyage they will be resold to one of our other companies and the ship advised at sea of a different destination and not more than one or two portuguese officials know of the transaction anticipated deaken its a system that works said azziz he looked attentively at deaken as if expecting criticism the south african said nothing im still not happy about excluding the authorities from the kidnap said grearson picking up the polaroid photograph which lay between them and staring down at it i didnt consider there was a choice said deaken nor i said azziz but i think we could do more said deaken pleased as first one then a jumble of ideas occurred to him he reached forward for the picture cornflowers and daisies he said indicating the vases of flowers visible on the table and sideboard so what said azziz underbergs appointment with me was for eleven he was early by fifteen minutes the call came from karen at about eleven thirty what time was the boy snatched about eleven thirty said azziz deaken nodded just after you left he recited thats what karen said when she called by the time they grabbed your son theyd already had karen for over an hour grearson shook his head i dont understand the distance said deaken they had to put the boy and karen together and geneva is he paused making a quick calculation over a hundred and fifty miles from zurich he turned to azziz i want a map and compasses he said the look of annoyance from azziz a man who normally gave orders and never took them was momentary he gave the instruction to a steward deaken smiled happy with the way his mind was working at lastit had been a long time to grearson he said whats the first thing the authorities would do told of a kidnap like this the american lawyer didnt reply immediately then he said seal the borders right said deaken the steward returned with maps and compasses from the navigation room and handed them to azziz the arab passed them immediately to deaken they wouldnt have taken any chances with the speed limit guessed deaken thats thirtyseven miles in the cities sixtytwo outside deaken found the map and squinted over it basel he said looking up why demanded grearson a good road to the nearest crossing said deaken not more than five or six towns where they would have to slow lets say they averaged fifty miles per hour zurich is fiftythree miles from basel to azziz he said how long were the bodyguards unconscious they estimate an hour which fits just time for them to get across the border there seems to be a lot of supposition protested grearson not too much insisted deaken poring over his maps if tewfik was the important one then karen would have been taken north theres a motorway from geneva to lausanne and then again from bern to zurich it would have been an extended route but worth it for the speed what time was the photograph delivered at the port office six said grearson at once i checked it was personally delivered not part of the normal postal run seeing the expectancy on deakens face grearson said no they couldnt remember what the messenger looked like theres always a lot of activity in the office at that time of the evening and there are frequently personal deliveries for mr azziz deaken went back to his maps of northern france now i was specifically told what flight to catch from geneva the reservation had already been made when underberg gave me the ticket he said you had to be expecting me so you had to have the photograph already too long by road too uncertain so it must have been flown down he shook his head i dont think theyd have risked crossing back into switzerland if the alarm had been raised the photograph would have been disastrous for them he stabbed the compass point into the map strasbourg he said no borders to cross and a good airport why dont we see if there was a flight from strasbourg to nice say around five oclock azziz nodded at once and grearson went back to the telephone it took only nine minutes klm he said from strasbourg at landed nice at on schedule time even to get to monte carlo by public transport and avoid the risk of being remembered by a taxi driver still supposition insisted grearson i agree theyd have got out of switzerland as quickly as possible but not that they would have gone north thats pure guesswork look said deaken gesturing around the room what do you see grearson frowned about him irritated at not being able to answer the question what he said flowers said deaken every sort of flower a lot of them subtropical he picked up the photograph of karen and tewfik azziz cornflowers he said cornflowers and daisies nothing from the south tenuous said grearson can you do better said deaken grearson looked away without replying the timing was tight deaken addressed himself directly to azziz a two pm departure from strasbourg would have meant lastminute boarding by one fortyfive and they would have tried to avoid that because of the risk of anyone remembering if it took an hour to get to basel and maybe another fifteen minutes to cross the border that takes us to twelve thirty deaken stopped sure of his argument thats all they did just crossed the border and stopped almost immediately for the photograph to be taken he scribbled a calculation on the map edge equating his estimated timing with distance then setting his compass he used zurich as the compass point sweeping a half circle westwards on the map it covered selestat to the north le locle in the south with epinal at the westward bulge of the half circle deaken reversed the map for the men opposite pushed it across the table towards them and said somewhere there azziz stared downwards for several moments and then said youve made it sound convincing its a holiday place said deaken a farm why said the arab look at the picture said deaken its a communal room like a lot of french farms and the fireplace is a working one with all the fittings for smoking but look at the surround its white not blackened by fire or smoke it hasnt been used for a long time maybe agreed azziz weve only their word that theyll let them go said deaken youve the resources why not inquire specifically around there we could identify it from a brochure azziz looked at grearson well do it he decided fix it through paris in the morning to deaken he said theyre making contact at noon that was the arrangement by then well have discovered whats happened in marseilles youll stay aboard tonight it wasnt a question thank you said deaken who hadnt considered what he was going to do but i havent got anything he said thats not a problem said azziz deaken was suddenly overwhelmed with fatigue he looked at his watch and saw it was am but he didnt think hed sleep it was an intelligent exposition said azziz he had stayed with coffee but grearson sat with a brandy balloon cupped before him in both hands unless hes involved in which case it would have been simple said the lawyer then hes directed us to his accomplices which doesnt make sense said the arab i believe him i think his wife has been taken just like tewfik i would have expected a cash demand said the lawyer sipping from his glass azziz nodded its definitely a complication a clever one said grearson fingering his spectacles if we default on the shipment the word will get around very quickly we exist by reputation and reliability i know said the arab his head was forward on his chest a familiar attitude of concentration it was a long time before he spoke we cant afford to lose that reputation he said there was another pause or tewfik his head came up i dont want an army he said positively i want a small compact group but theyve got to be the best i dont want a bunch of hasbeens fat on beer and boasting about the black women they raped in the congo green beret or british sas just the best williams was a green beret reminded grearson he was a mistake said the arab i dont want any more there wont be promised grearson whose life until now had been a comparatively easy one of creating contracts with people who were always the willing buyers and who enjoyed the comforts with which azziz surrounded himself he didnt want anything to change well use this man deaken said azziz and if necessary his wifetheyre our advantage theyre expendable one deck above where azziz sat but farther to the stern deaken stared around a suite only slightly smaller than the apartment he occupied in geneva reaching out to touch first the smooth wood of the bulkhead and then letting his hand drop to the silk covering of the bed he supposed the word was bunk but it wasnt appropriate this was a bed big enough for two the thought hit him like a blow oh my darling he said aloud poor darling ill get you back i promise ill get you back tewfik azziz waited a long time twice almost drifting off to sleep only to jerk awake irritated at himself for the weakness it showed he was extremely careful crouching for a long time near the door tensed for sounds waiting for the conversation and then the footsteps to cease for the house to sleep even then he waited for the stir of guards placed outside there was no movement to indicate the precaution he had rehearsed the walk like everything else so he crossed silently to the window the wom five franc piece hot where he had held it for so long in his hand he purposely kept the light off so it was difficult locating by touch alone the screws which bolted the bars in place the round edge of the coin fitted only in the centre and there was little leverage on the small disc azziz thrust hard down upon it to get the maximum purchase hands quivering with the effort of making the turn the coin twisted free twice sharp enough to have cut him if he hadnt had the forethought to protect his hands with a handkerchief his captors might have become curious about such finger cuts azziz bit back the groan at the effort feeling the blood pump through his head when the screw gave it was an abrupt jerking movement which threw the coin wide again he groped out feeling for the screw rubbing his thumb across the head to ensure he hadnt milled the crosscut sufficiently for them to detect it if they made a check while he wasnt in the room then he fitted the coin in yet again having to put a thumb and forefinger either side to keep the coin in place and slowly succeeded in unscrewing it completely azziz stopped panting his clothes glued to him with sweat for several moments he hunched in the darkness with the screw held tightly in the palm of his hand like the prize it was then carefully he reinserted it and tightened it so it would be undetectable by the time he became aware of the greyness of dawn edging in through the shutters azziz had succeeded in releasing six of the eight screws holding the inner bar into position across one of the windows when he lay down he realized his fingers were so numb he could hardly feel them karen slept badly several times waking abruptly knowing immediately where she was and tensed for the sound or presence that had startled her on each occasion there was nothing she got up finally before it was properly light taking a long time to wash and dress she had been careful to wind her watch wanting always to be aware of the time it was seven when she heard movement about the house it was far away downstairs in the kitchen or the big room she supposed she wished they would come for her karen moved impatiently but aimlessly around the bedroom consciously avoiding that part where the portable lavatory stood it embarrassed her so much so that she didnt look at it which was a stupid reaction but one she couldnt stop at the window she reached out pulling at the bars without any purpose it wasnt with any purpose she realized shocked until now this very moment the idea of escape hadnt occurred to her she had been too frightened too confused to think of it after being tricked from the apartment and really terrified during the ride into france when she realized what had happened and believed that the big man who kept pressing himself against her really would harm her if she didnt do everything she was told but then she had accepted it everything had taken on an air of unreality like some grownup game she had been tricked into joining and didnt want to admit she was afraid of playing she didnt want to play she wanted to get back to richard back to sanity back to worrying about money and why she wasnt pregnant at thirty she pulled at the bar harder this time it didnt move she would have to think of something make a plan not sink into apathetic acceptance and wait until someone else did something for her wasnt that the attitude that irritated her so much about richard the change from the fervent ever moving changetheworld man into an acquiescent halfoptimist she felt suddenly ashamed that had been a secret thought until now hidden always in a corner of her mind consciously unformed because to form it would make it into a criticism of the man she loved and she did love him as much as she ever had she knew how he felt because they had talked it through richard hadnt sacrificed any ideals he had just stopped being manipulated just as the movements themselves were so often manipulated by the very people or authorities they sought to correct or improve he was right then honest why did she argue so much with a man who had done the right and honest thing karen heard them coming and hurried from the window not wanting them to find her there it was levy who came into the room youre ready the man seemed surprised i didnt sleep much im sorry there was even an unrealitv to the conversation karen thought i made a list she said it had occupied an hour the previous night before she had attempted to sleep levy took it without reading it putting it immediately into his pocket shall we go down tewfik azziz was already in the large downstairs room when karen entered he stood politely and she smiled the arab waited until she was seated before sitting himself he passed her a wicker basket of croissants and bread richard got them yesterday she thought shed behaved like a stupid child reducing them to crumbs in her petulance she shook her head helping herself instead to coffee what happens now azziz demanded we should hear something today said levy and well be freed asked karen that depends said levy dont you know said azziz sarcastically well know soon enough said levy karen looked around the room two men who only spoke to levy in what she presumed to be hebrew lounged casually at the door leading out into the garden and she could see three more moving around in the kitchen they were making no effort to conceal their identities mrs deaken will exercise first announced levy the men who had brought her from switzerland emerged from the kitchen levy crossed to them and she got the impression that they were arguing she was aware of azziz close to her you must run if you get the opportunity the boy whispered softly forget what he said about one being a hostage for the other she had karen realized guiltily what about you they wont hurt me they might run repeated azziz urgently as levy turned may i walk with you he said do i have a choice of course i dont mind karen stopped directly outside the door putting her head back so that she could feel the sun fully on her face breathing deeply only outside the farmhouse was she fully aware of how stale her bedroom had been there was a man positioned on the far side of the garden at the gate through which they had entered they moved off to the left where the garden was most extensive it was lshaped with a low barbered hedge down the middle like a dividing line beyond the bordering fence she could see trees and patchwork fields on the skyline a group of men were gathering crops around a slowly moving machine everything looked peaceful what were you and azziz talking about said levy he told me not to be afraid levy looked at her but said nothing he was only slightly taller than she was karen realized he wore jeans and a shortsleeved shirt his arms were matted with hair you havent got a gun she said no what would you do if i ran catch you what if you didnt i told you yesterday that youre hostages for one another i dont think youd hurt him she challenged dont put it to the test she saw his hands were gripped tightly at his sides as if he was angry or tense will you speak to richard why i want him to know im all right that i love him no he said not me but hell be told youre all right would you hurt me if azziz got away he isnt going to that isnt an answer youd better hope it is they came to a high hedge as neatly clipped as the dividing line behind them the lane that led into the village would be on the other side karen decided she tried to remember how far away the village was from inside the car it had seemed quite close she strained listening for any sound that might be coming from it she heard cooing and looked back towards the farmhouse there was a dovecote on the roof of one of the outbuildings pure white birds were preening and parading along the walkway the books and games i promised will be here this afternoon said levy i dont feel like reading or playing games itll be a way of passing the time dont be so bloody patronizing the helpless anger burst from her who the fuck do you think you are what gives you the right to treat me like this to treat anyone like this to tell me when to sleep and when to wake and when to eat and when i can breathe fresh air instead of air stinking of my own shit levy winced at the tirade and at her crudity i dont have to justify myself to you you supercilious sod she lashed out surprising herself as well as him her palm slapped across the side of his face so hard that he stumbled sideways it hurt her hand the physical pain making her realize what she had done she stepped backwards slackarmed not trying to protect herself as he swung in retaliation levy pulled back at the last moment but his slap still made her ears ring you stupid bitch bastard they stood confronting each other like bantam cocks waiting to be released for the fight karen saw his hand move a sideways gesture and flinched then recognized he was waving away the man who had been posted at the gate and who had started moving towards them she tried to prevent it but the tears began to flow down her cheeks any of the others would have shot you does that make you any different of course it does shit she said youre all the same thugs we believe in what were doing fucking thugs what do you call azziz whats it to do with me nothing said levy were using you and the boy neither of you will suffer he hesitated putting his hand to his stillred face providing you behave sensibly he made a shooing motion for her to move ahead of him back to the house she didnt move at once wanting to give the impression of some independence however futile he seemed to understand her need holding back from any further movement until she was ready she turned eventually walking shoulders squared in front of him she wasnt apathetic or acquiescent she felt proud it was clear that the gate guard had relayed an account of what happened in advance of their return there were five men grouped inside the room regarding her blankfaced as she reentered the farmhouse when levy spoke it was in what she had earlier presumed to be hebrew the exchanges were sharp staccato almost the israeli looked beyond her to azziz youre a silly boy said levy im not a boy you blistered your fingers said the israeli it was obvious at breakfast this morning karen looked towards azzizs hands but he pulled them instinctively behind his back weve found the screws loosened continued levy weve put more inheavier gauge karen was conscious of azziz stiffening it was anger she decided teach this little bastard a lesson said leiberwitz levy walked to the arab holding his hand out give it to me he said i dont know what you mean i want whatever it was you used to undo them said levy i didnt touch them levy slapped azziz openhanded like hed struck the woman earlier but this time he didnt pull back karen gasped at the crack as the heel of the israelis hand caught azziz high on the right cheek azziz swayed head jerked back by the force but he didnt move he didnt make a sound either give it to me said levy azziz said nothing if i have them search you said levy nodding behind him theyll hurt you maybe badly let me said the bearded man moving forward give it to him said karen shut up said azziz levy hit him again palm first against the other side of his face azziz had been looking towards her so the blow caught him more in the mouth this time his lip split in a burst of blood the arab looked fully at levy letting it run unchecked down his chin very heroic said levy he hit the youth again this time azziz staggered quickly he recovered stop it she knew azziz wasnt being hit for whatever he had done not entirely levy was taking out upon the arab the irritation hed felt at her she went to them before anyone else could stop her stop it i say the israeli swept her aside causing her to fall over the slightly raised edge of a flagstone she fell backwards too quickly and too surprised to put out her hands to save herself she landed hard on her coccyx which was agony and then fuller on to her back driving the wind from her body because of the pain it emerged as a scream she rolled over grabbing her skirt down knees against her chest groaning the breath back into herself face against the coldness of the stone her cutoff view was of legs she was aware of people moving towards her stay away she wheezed stay away from me the legs stopped moving she hated them seeing her as defenceless as this i want it whatever it is if you dont give it to me ill have them strip you in front of the woman well turn out your clothes and find it and beat you she knew it wasnt levys voice it was the man whod tricked her from the geneva apartment breathing easier now karen raised her head so that she could see the room again azziz was still confronting levy defiantly but there wasnt the initial stiffness in the way he held himself whats the point she said her voice wavered uncertain azziz thrust into his pocket taking out the coin instead of giving it to the israeli he threw it on the ground it clattered against the stone and rolled away describing diminishing circles until finally it settled on its side for a moment levy looked steadily at azziz then he picked up the coin studying the edge for the score marks which would confirm it was what azziz had used he went back to the arab and said all right everything else in your pockets out onto the table sullenly azziz emptied his pockets now pull all the linings out said levy some of the watching men laughed as azziz obeyed tonight youll sleep with your ankle handcuffed to the bed said levy briefly he looked sideways at karen she was rightthere wasnt any point no point at all pig said azziz his lips were already swelling making it difficult for him to enunciate clearly we told you that at the beginning said levy you should have believed me because it was essential to the operation the man called rupert underberg insisted upon a seafront room at the bristol with a balcony overlooking the harbour it was here that he breakfasted off yoghurt and eggs and fruit he couldnt stand the continental crap he looked beyond the squared basin with its clutch of yachts to where the scheherazade rode at deepwater anchor as he watched the rotors of the helicopter suddenly began revolving and then the machine lifted banked and flew off parallel with the coastline westwards underberg noted he wondered how the occupants had entered without his being aware of it it must be wonderful to be rich enough to own yachts and helicopters he thought returning to his breakfast to eat like this everyday would his wife enjoy it he wished she was with him so he could have given her a chance he had wanted so much for it to be better during his leave she didnt think he understood but he did he would make it up to her very soon in a month or two she would realize that it had all been worthwhile deaken emerged from his cabin unable to remember the direction from which the steward had led him the previous night he went to his right at once aware of the wind chop of the helicopter takeoff he found a door out onto the deck in time to see it pick up the flight path along the coast towards france he decided staring directly towards the shore and establishing his directions monaco was displayed before him in pinks and yellows and ochres the sun was already strong silvering the water and he had to squint to pick out the palace with its flag showing the prince was in residence and then the casino between him and the shore yachts squatted at their moorings like nesting seabirds deaken strained trying to locate the telephone kiosk he had to use but it was too far merging into an obscure whitish blur he heard voices and moved towards them realizing when he got nearer that he was going to the stern of the vessel he stopped at the rail gazing down isolating first the helicopter pad with its whiteringed landing pattern the pool was higher on the next deck up three girls were in the water giggling and laughing a fourth was spread on her back on a lounging chair the three in the water were topless the one sunbathing was completely naked if youre joining us youd better change the girl was barefoot which was why he hadnt heard her approach behind him her black hair was short almost boyish her face was deeply tanned without makeup she had brown eyes like karen she was wearing a bikini bottom and a diaphanous white gauze top tied only at the neck her nipples were dark and full im carole she said there was an accent but he couldnt identify it deaken he said richard deaken he felt like a schoolboy caught peeping into the girls dormitory when did you come aboard last night she nodded we knew there was a meeting part of the staff thought deakenharem in fact she smiled conscious of his discomfort how long are you staying im not sure coming down to the pool he shook his head hurriedly i heard voices he said we spend most of the day there if you change your mind she said the smile was professional wed welcome the company she walked to the companionway leading down to the pool deck with a fluid hipswaying sensuality deaken hurried back into the interior of the ship through the door from which she had emerged annoyed with himself for having been discovered by the girl annoyed even with wasting his time ogling whores almost at once he recognized the alleyway along which grearson had led him when they had boarded and then the broad sweep down to the stateroom at the wide double doors he hesitated then knocked something was said on the other side which deaken didnt hear but he entered anyway azziz was standing as he had been the previous night he was wearing a sports shirt and slacks ive sent someone for you said the arab i lost my way said deaken wheres grearson marseilles said azziz i decided a personal visit would be better than a telephone call the helicopter remembered deaken the door opened behind him a bespectacled darkhaired man began im afraid and then stopped when he saw deaken my personal secretary mitri introduced azziz if you want anything while youre here ask him the man nodded but did not smile he carried a leather writing case with fittings on the outside to hold pens thank you said deaken the palestinian secretary looked inquiringly at azziz who shook his head mitri backed out closing the door behind him will you hear from grearson before ive got to go ashore asked deaken i hope so said azziz if we dont you can say weve located the shipment that well do what they want theyll want details so do i what does that mean i talked to grearson before he left we decided we were being too subservient we dont have any choice i want contact with my son insisted azziz i want to know hes all right cancel the shipment and you can have him back i cant do that in a day said azziz i dont even own the arms at the moment deaken stared at the other man feeling the stir of uncertainty you said the sale to portugal was just a book transaction a way round officialdom contracts had to be drawn up and money seen to be exchanged for it to remain legal said azziz its not a big problem but it cant be resolved in a day surely you see that how long two or three days shrugged the man two or three days shouted deaken my wifes with those bastards sos my son said azziz quietly then get them out get them both out im going to deaken accepted it was illogical to expect everything to be settled so quickly but he hadnt thought beyond today we darent take any chances he said i dont intend to thats why i want to speak to my son deaken looked at his watch it was almost a quarter past eleven ive ordered the tender in the water at eleven thirty said azziz deaken turned to the telephones he must be there by now over an hour ago agreed azziz why hasnt he called hes got to trace the shipment it wasnt handled directly through paris they were just the vendors i know theyll expect more said deaken again less than twentyfour hours has elapsed said azziz there cant be more deaken remained looking at the telephones willing one to sound here said azziz deaken turned to the arab azziz was holding out a small leatherettecovered box whats that i want the conversation taped said azziz i want to hear whats said underberg said id be watched all the time this couldnt be any danger to him it was a sensible thing to do thought deaken he reached out and accepted the recorder do you know how to use it the lawyer nodded turning it over in his hand and locating the suctioncapped receiver to stick onto the telephone you should be going said azziz its not half past yet said deaken why hadnt the bloody american rung you shouldnt be late deaken moved reluctantly towards the door dont forget the contact said azziz ill accept whatever conditions or arrangements they want so long as i can speak to him ill ask promised deaken to speak to karen as well he decided the hollow disbelieving sound of her voice when she had spoken to him in the geneva office echoed in his head confident of at least part of the yacht deaken found his way easily out onto the deck the tender was already drawn up at the bottom of the step way he went down carefully glancing back up towards the ship as he reached the platform two of the girls were looking over the rail from the pool deck the sun was behind them so he couldnt see if either was the girl to whom he had spoken one waved deaken got into the tender without responding from the balcony of the bristol underberg focused the binoculars and saw the motorboat pull away from the side of the scheherazade he smiled and stepped back into the shade of his room in the stateroom of the yacht the telephone sounded at the time azziz had arranged and he picked it up expectantly sailed nearly fortyeight hours ago reported grearson freighter is called the bellicose liberian registration owned by a greek company called levcos general cargo to madeira then on with our shipment the line was extremely clear it was paris not marseilles any stated destination sailing orders are to refuel at dakar then onwards for contact off benguela deaken gone ashore yes said azziz when does the bellicose get to madeira tonight the weathers good so it should be there on time whos the portuguese in the middle hernandez ortega said the american weve dealt with him before good man whos the purchaser an import company called okuru shippers with an address in the avenue liburation in lobito how was the purchase made they came here to the office in paris any names makimber said the lawyer edward makimber the lawyer hesitated do you want me to go to lisbon to see ortega no said azziz at once what about the men we want paris have got some names american or british american said grearson address for one is brussels i dont want any belgian congo rubbish repeated azziz i know check him as youre so close instructed azziz and tell paris to make a contact with this man makimber i want to see if there really is a deadline or whether theyd accept a delay deaken said theyd thought of that make the inquiry said azziz and tell them to arrange a matching shipment do we have sufficient stock more than sufficient said grearson fix it ordered azziz it would be an easy way out agreed grearson not for some said azziz more to himself than to the other man it was when deaken jumped ashore before waiting for the crew to tie up he ran up the steps looking anxiously towards the telephones the one in use was not the one which had been identified by underberg deaken hurried into the box thrusting the door closed behind him he put the recorder on the ledge and depressed the suction cap against the earpiece of the telephone tugging it gently to make sure it was attached eleven fiftyfive he saw he looked around the quayside was crowded with yachtsmen and sightseers and flower stalls and souvenir sellers near the harbour office an artist had erected an easel and was painting the yachts against the background of the palace a group had formed behind the man no one was obviously watching him decided deaken but then they wouldnt be obvious although he was ready for it tensed even deaken still jumped when the telephone shrilled he snatched up the receiver almost dropping it in his eagerness yes youre on time good said a voice he recognized as that of the man who had confronted him in geneva the previous day belatedly deaken remembered the tape and jabbed the lever down hows my wife hows karen perfectly well said underberg why the recorder deaken whirled around there was no one in any of the other boxes he turned in the opposite direction he was overlooked by dozens of windows and at least three hotels it was like being pinned out ready for dissection under some microscope we didnt want any mistakes he said im glad youre being careful said underberg what about the shipment deaken gripped his hands against the familiar patronizing voice azziz has agreed said the lawyer thats good thats very good said underberg where is it deaken hesitated being located he said now the pause was from the other end that doesnt sound very sensible mr deaken it was sold through france said the lawyer desperately shipment was arranged through marseilles azziz has sent someone there this morning remembering the arabs point deaken added weve only had a few hours again the man didnt speak immediately then he said dont forget why youre involved dont forget what happens to your wife depends upon your seeing that everything goes the way we want it to deaken tugged at his collar loosening his shirt sweat soaked him running down his face and from beneath his arms into the waistband of his trousers he tried opening the door but the sound of the quayside was too loud so he closed it again he could feel the sun burning through the glass im not forgetting anything he said you didnt give us enough time youll have enough time said underberg more than enough azziz wants to speak to his son and i want to speak to karen to make sure theyre all right blurted deaken we make the stipulations said underberg well accept any conditions whatever the arrangement lets just speak to them hear their voices thats not possible it must be possible i said it wasnt whats happened to them deakens fear was immediate his voice unsteady ive told you theyre all right both of them said underberg insistently theres no way you can talk to them it wont work azziz can make it work all hes got to make work is the rerouting of the arms shipment make sure he does that the response came at once to deaken but he paused considering it then he said youve made that impossible what do you mean demanded underberg how can i ensure anybody is doing anything when im tied to these telephone calls give me some way to contact you underberg laughed that wasnt very clever he said im not trying to be clever said deaken im trying to do what youve asked to protect karen you know how to do that let us speak to them repeated deaken no make some concession pleaded deaken were not in the business of making concessions said underberg were combatting terrorism which azziz feeds upon bastard said deaken dont forget it said underberg not for a moment will azziz sort everything out by tomorrow i dont know youre supposed to know the man paused then he said ill give you fortyeight hours i dont understand i wont call you tomorrow the day after the same box the same time no wait started deaken realizing the man meant to break the contact the line went dead from behind the closed windows of his room underberg saw deaken emerge disconsolately from the telephone kiosk the recorder clutched tightly beneath his arm it was fortunate that deaken had protested about the difficulty of daily calls if he hadnt reflected underberg then the idea of lengthening their contact time would have had to come from him and he hadnt wanted that only another thirty minutes before the call from mulhouse levy wouldnt be as argumentative as the lawyer levy imagined they were working for the same thing underberg sighed contentedly there would still be time before the plane left for him to have a leisurely lunch on the terrace he enjoyed living well on the quay below deaken boarded the tender it was clearly marked as that from the scheherazade and as it moved away from the moorings deaken looked up at the watching faces they all envied him he realized stupid sods karen stood stiffly as levy entered the room he stopped inside the door and held out the packages to her everything you asked for he said you didnt say anything about underwear but i bought some anyway he hesitated pants at least he added white thank you she said the parcels carried advertisements for shops in the rue de la bourse in mulhouse she didnt remember that as the name of the last place through which theyd driven before turning off to the farmhouse ive got a message through to your husband that youre all right he said karen said nothing you are arent you said levy you werent really hurt there was only a small mirror high on the washstand so she hadnt been able to see probably just bruised she said there was an ache at the bottom of her back he shouldnt have been stupid you said that already i didnt mean to hurt him you did though she said his fathers doing what we want everything is going to be all right you will let us free if he does everything wont you demanded karen in sudden fear youll let us go levy smiled the first time she had seen him do so his teeth were very white and even of course he said how many more times have i got to tell you i mean you no harm after what hed done to her and to the boy she should loathe this man karen knew hate him she wondered why she didnt la grande place in brussels and the cafu in the corner is an essential stop for tourists a place for posing singly and in groups for holiday pictures the cafe is made entirely of wood with wooden stalls and wooden benches and an uncovered wooden floor it rises through several balconied sections around the central flaring barbecue pit and is dominated by the complete figure of a stuffed horse alive it had been a large proud animal dead it gazes through opaque glass eyes onto the square with an expression of vague dismay at having become a sideshow almost an entire side of la grande place is occupied by the town hall the exterior is intricately decorated with crisscrossed beams and fancy brickwork like the original model for hansel and gretels gingerbread house it was not the location that harvey evans would have chosen for a meeting but the demand from paris had been for somewhere easy to find and he was sure that every taxi driver in belgium knew of the cafe with the horse the american sat in the prearranged stall both hands around the beer glass from which he only occasionally drank twice he had to shake his head against his table being shared with the explanation that he was awaiting a companion it was always a polite refusal because harvey evans was invariably polite he was a still quiet man with a trained soldiers neatness the fair almost white hair was closecropped at the sides far above his ears and his hard highcheekboned face was closely shaven so carefully it seemed to be polished the trousers were freshly pressed and the shoes glistened reflecting the light from the flickering cooking area because he was leaning forward the windbreaker was pulled back so that the rolex watch that had been the green beret amulet in vietnam protruded on the little finger of the left hand there was a heavy fraternity ring with a red stone in the centre evans revolved it idly thinking back to the telephone call from paris abrupt and curt and businesslike the voice confident american too so it could be something he thought something worthwhile he hoped to christ it was since libya there hadnt been anything sensible and libya had been an asshole evans sighed like everything else had been an asshole since nam they hadnt deserved the treatment when they got back none of them had he hadnt wanted to be regarded as a hero although he probably qualified with the purple hearts and the silver stars and all the other junk he and the others had collected too easily in the end like trinkets for having saved up cardboard tops from breakfastfood packets all he wanted was to be accepted as the soldier he had become someone who had shown sufficient aptitude and ability for promotion to one of the youngest majors in the berets but he hadnt got it none of them had they had gone halfway around the world and risked being maimed or crippled or killed and got back home to find themselves ostracized treated with contempt even as if they and not some asshole group of politicians sitting in the warmth and comfort of washington had started the whole bloody thing and made america look as stupid and as ineffectual as it had appeared in the end it hadnt occurred to him before but there was a direct analogy with the military legend the commanders fuck it up and the poor grunts in the boondocks cop the shit evans had been studying every entranthe had chosen the seat specifically for the purposeand looked at grearson more intently than he had at most others the man was alone had an attitude of authority which evans recognized from the army and the clothes were american like the voice had been on the telephone the man looked around orienting himself and walked directly up to the stall youre harvey evans he said it was not a question evans stood aware of the immediate examination yes he said grearson liked what he saw the man was in good shape unneglected and no beer belly he thought remembering azzizs injunction sorry im late apologized the lawyer delay at the airport the soldiers handshake was firm without any ridiculous pretence at making it so i didnt mind waiting said evans you spoke of a job maybe said grearson cautiously he ordered whisky how did you get my name paris thats a city said evans who in paris people who recommended you as being very good what sort of people the sort who deal in weaponry they had seemed the most obvious contacts when evans moved into europe from the middle east he supposed he must have contacted about six different armsdealing organizations which one thats not important not for the moment said grearson i want to be sure first of what your suitability what do you want to know everything about you the lawyers drink arrived he put it before him untouched and evans realized it wasnt to drink merely to entitle him to occupy the seat in the stall evans gave a clipped official recital of his career as if he were reading from the formal documentation which still existed somewhere in fort bragg why did you leave in grearson fingered his spectacles i didnt like the atmosphere said evans wherever i went said who i was i was made to feel as if i was guilty of something grearson nodded aware of the attitude that existed in america in the immediate aftermath of the mistaken war why not a civilian job dont have the training said evans im a soldier thats all ive ever been ever wanted to be what then heard there was opportunity in libya training their people guerrillas too from other countries spent almost two years in a camp near an oasis called kufra he shook his head at the memory christ what a place what was wrong with it prayers to mecca god knows how many times a day political indoctrination sessions and stupid bastards shooting off guns and throwing grenades and believing they were immortal so it didnt matter if they got hit evans stopped no booze or women either like being a goddamned monk grearson analysed what the other man said before speaking you got anything against arabs he said do you mean am i jewish are you no so what about arabs evans shrugged nothing wrong with arabs he said that wasnt what pissed me off about libya what did then theyre crazy they really do believe what their priests tell them that gaddafi is leading them into some sort of holy conflict they cant be killed booze important to you booze frowned the man you said there wasnt any booze or women evans smiled apologetically i dont drink or whore any more than anyone else he said but i was there for two years grearson smiled back what have you done since then nothing he had been lucky first time grearson decided he pushed a sealed manila envelope across the table theres retainer with another for expenses evans picked the envelope up felt it and put it into an inside pocket of his windbreaker what do you want you formed a deeppenetration unit in vietnam yes how many men it varied said evans usually it was six what sort of opposition could you handle evans smiled again proudly this time a platoon or company any time he said frequently happened in fact we were well trained could you assemble six people how long have i got two or three days and i dont want rubbish i want men like you only a year or two out of the services still trained still fit i could try grearson respected the man for avoiding the overcommitment id want to meet them when theyre assembled said the lawyer if one isnt right then the whole things off i cant recruit unless i know what weve got to do somebodys got something belonging to us said grearson we want it back so call the police said evans thats not possible not on this occasion what can i offer youll get a week as commander the people you recruit get all expenses of course if the need arises for you to be used if you have to go in to recover whats ours and you do it successfully therell be a bonus for you and for everyone else paid in whatever currency you want to wherever you want so we might not actually be used not necessarily said grearson but you still get the payment and expenses and a severance bonus for you for the others evans nodded the terms seem fair enough he said what happens about equipment dont bother about anything whatever you want will be provided to be effective weve got to train have some idea of what the operation will be i cant tell you that not yet said the lawyer and i do recognize the difficulty thats why the people you get together have got to be already well trained there wont be time for much preparation i dont like that said evans grearson was pleased at the professionalism it could be something like a surprise assault he said guardedly defended probably but you should have some element of surprise how big a building i dont know well have plans layouts i hope so but youre not certain a waiter returned to the table inquiringly both men shook their heads no said grearson theres no certainty how big is the object to be recovered said evans i mean will it be in a safe under some sort of protection that well have to blow grearson hesitated its not an object he said evans did not respond for several moments i see he said my client has a permanent need for protection said grearson particularly so after this if everything goes as it must then there could be permanent employment for you and for some of the people you recruit what about limitations said evans limitations when we recover he paused and then went on what it is we have to recover are there any limitations on the force thats got to be employed none said grearson immediately absolutely none and the authorities will not be involved no i dont know your name said evans or how to make contact my name doesnt matter at the moment said grearson lets leave it that i am an attorney he passed a folded sheet of paper across the table theres a name and telephone number he said theyll have immediate contact with me call them when youve assembled your people this time evans opened the paper noting the paris telephone number against the address of something called the eklon corporation the second place he had approached after libya he remembered a nondescript set of offices on the rue reamur the receptionist as haughty as only the french can be refusing to let him get past to someone in authority he had been sure she would have thrown his details away azziz he thought in complete recollection adnan azziz he felt a burn of satisfaction this could definitely be something worthwhile is mr azziz personally inconvenienced said evans this man was a good choice decided grearson someone very close to him i understand understand something more said grearson there must be absolute discretion i dont want any of those you recruit to know anything more than the barest minimum it would be a risk of course said evans youll have no need to worry i want professionals insisted grearson absolute professionals there must be no mistakes there wont be grearson offered his hand and received the firm handshake in return why on earth have that done to a horse said grearson looking at the rigid animal everyone gets stuffed said evans jesus said the lawyer they crowded into the room appearing to expect him to resist levy in front and three others behind gradually azziz was identifying them always careful that they would be unaware of his eavesdropping on their conversation and remarks the big bearded man who had wanted to involve himself in the beating was leiberwitz the tall saturnine man was kahanche thought the given name was sami the squat man bullshouldered and bullnecked whom azziz had seen smirking during the beating was greening do you want to undress said levy no said azziz his mouth hurt to talk i dont think hes respectful enough said leiberwitz what are you some sort of sadist levy said to him in hebrew in english to azziz levy said its your fault were having to do this azziz said nothing aware of the conflict between the two men confronting him lie on the bed said levy the arab did as he was told the israeli adjusted the arms of the handcuffs as wide as they would go and before securing them around azzizs ankle he slipped his finger between the boys flesh and the metal to ensure it would not chafe satisfied he clicked them shut he snapped the other armlet around the metal upright of the bed needlessly tugging to see it was engaged dont try anything else thats stupid warned levy if you fall awkwardly from the bed you could break your ankle as levy left the boys room he looked automatically towards karens bedroom door a thin ruler of light was marked out beneath it he hesitated and then continued on down the stairs leiberwitz was waiting for him in the large room i wont be treated like shit he said stop behaving like it said levy unimpressed at the protest theres no plan to hurt them hes a spoiled supercilious little bastard i think hes rather brave said levy the harbour at funchal is protected by a huge arm built out across almost half its width to form a protected inner anchorage normally cruise liners are brought inside to tie up along it and make their passengers run the gauntlet of its length through the basket salesmen and wickerworkmakers and lace vendors tonight there were no liners in port so the pilot took the bellicose into the favoured place manoeuvring her close to the cranes high above from the balcony of reids hotel underberg watched it was a warm still night the lights of the madeira capita spread out before him like an overturned jewel box he could hear the blur of the mooring instructions as far away as he was underberg turned walking back into the hotel sorry that he had arrived too late to sit out there in the late afternoon and go through the traditional ritual of madeira cake and tea it hadnt been an easy flight with a transfer at lisbon and underberg felt tired he wondered if it would be a wasted journey it was a short ride down the hill and underberg stopped the taxi at the seafront road to walk the rest of the way along the harbour spur past the cafe built into the rock face the jetty was washed in a butteryellow glow from the nightwork spotlights the cranes already dipping into the bellicoses holds by the time underberg arrived he held back perfectly concealed by the containers of some already unloaded wharf cargo the captain the rank designated by his cap edging was on the wing bridge overlooking the quay staring down at the work his name was erlander underberg knew fortyeight married two children and a home in strandvauagen stockholm the freighter was not his predominant interest so underberg moved farther away from the water seeking a more extensive view of the quay he didnt bother with the immediate bustle of stevedores beside the bellicose because underberg guessed the person for whom he was looking would not be that close instead he concentrated on previously unshipped stored cargo some covered in tarpaulin and net it was away from the working lights black and grey outlines jagged against the night sky it was a long time before he detected him and when he did underberg smiled the man was using the cover as expertly as he was underberg moved from container to container purposely not trying to disguise his approach wanting the man to identify him he was still some way away when he saw the flash of teeth surprise surprise said edward makimber the voice was educated carefully modulated not really said underberg at cambridge the african had anglicized his name to kimber underberg guessed he wouldnt admit to it now do you normally keep such a close eye on the competition said makimber quite often said underberg were very competitive do you normally worry so much about a purchase about a purchase as important as this said the african azziz has a good reputation hasnt he just general caution said makimber we could still help were grateful for everything youve done so far its important if were going to get independence for it to be exactly that independence archetypal intellectual revolutionary thought underberg makimber could probably quote verbatim whole chunks of marx and engels and lenin maybe if he wasnt trying to be fashionable even stalin its good to know we remain friends we always made it clear there was no question of endangering our relationship its still a good assurance said underberg it wont take long said makimber gesturing towards the unloading port office has it scheduled to sail at six are you going back to angola benguela by tomorrow night and if thats not possible then in through lobito the quayside encounter had unsettled makimber and he decided not to disclose his intention of checking the shipment through dakar just as he was ensuring its untroubled passage here in madeira it was a precaution just as it had been a precaution to take photographs and attempt to create a file on underberg when namibia was independent a proper intelligence system would be set up not oppressive or brutal like all the others seemed to be just protective to ensure there would be no danger to the properly and democratically elected government ive told you how important this is he said with what the ship is carrying were going to wake the world up to what those south african bastards are doing in our country underberg wondered idly if makimber already had his victory speech drafted it would be full of rhetoric and artistic inference he guessed they always were from this sort of man makimber would expect some reference to be made he supposed wed like to attend the celebrations he said youll be honoured guests said makimber we dont forget our friends now it was underberg who motioned towards the freighter you did there makimber wearily shook his head at the other mans tenacity that conversation goes round in circles he said no hard feelings of course not makimber paused uncertainly then he said will you and your people be there i dont know said underberg angola certainly it might be better if you werent it was late when the alouette brought grearson back to the yacht deaken and azziz had already played the tape recording through twice and the palestinian secretary mitri made a transcript while the three men ate they dined properly this time in the saloon with laced linen and crystal deaken wondered if the women he had seen earlier in the day would join them but the heavy mahogany table was only set for three places it was a superb meal salmon mousse and then duck what would karen be eating thought deaken he pushed his plate aside barely touched i hope ortega isnt going to be difficult said grearson setting out on the path he had rehearsed with azziz at a private meeting before they had joined deaken in the dining room ortega queried deaken hernandez ortega explained the lawyer the portuguese intermediary its a book transaction an arrangement deaken said to azziz immediately alarmed yes said the arab so wheres the problem a price had been already agreed for the repurchase said grearson but i havent been able to contact ortega all day i think he wants more how much more demanded deaken we wont know until we get hold of him so the shipment isnt yours thats why i was late back said grearson i spent the afternoon trying to trace ortega down in lisbon he wasnt available purposely avoiding you queried azziz i think soits a tedious negotiating ploy deaken looked sharply between the two men to the arab he said you dont seem very concerned of course im concerned you heard the tape pressed deaken theyre impatient whatever ortega wants ill pay you know that said azziz but when weve got fortyeight hours reminded azziz itll be resolved by then everything pressed deaken my son isnt going to die mr deaken said the arab neither is your wife mitri came softfooted into the dining saloon halting just inside the door he carried the recorder in one hand and in the other the transcript and several copies the stateroom decided azziz rising from the table the two lawyers stood with him and filed behind the arab into the adjoining room they took their copies from the secretary and each read in silence for several minutes grearson finished first he was nearest the recorder he pressed the play button listening to the two voices with his head bent over the typescript as if he were checking its accuracy bad judged grearson when the tape stopped he snapped off the machine and stared at deaken you handled it very badly how else could i have handled it said deaken immediately knowing a dip in his newfound confidence you were told not to be subservient i had nothing to argue with no pressure it should have been handled better insisted grearson what would you have done not pleaded not shown any desperation said the american at once i am desperate theyve had my wife for two days now you wont get her back by showing your weakness wheres the strength for christs sake arguing between ourselves is stupid said azziz to deaken he said i think you could have been more forceful i recognize the difficulty but there should have been more force what have you achieved fought back deaken were no closer now to meeting their demands than we were twentyfour hours ago you dont even own the bloody stuff they want stopped and what about trying to locate wherever it is theyre being held whats been done about that ive briefed paris said grearson so theyve had a whole day what have they found out we havent heard havent you called them said deaken outraged theres no point in arguing repeated azziz i agree i didnt get anywhere conceded deaken i wasnt in a position to but you tell me precisely what youve achieved youre doing the bare minimum and trying to look busy flying around in helicopters if you couldnt get ortega to a telephone why didnt you go personally to lisbon you had the facilities youre right said azziz coming back here was an error of judgement why dont i do what he should have done today said deaken let me go with your full authority i dont think thats necessary said grearson stiffly i want to know the stuff is back said deaken i want to get that whole bloody thing over azziz nodded why not he said if you want involvement then you can have it i said i dont think thats necessary protested grearson its decided said azziz as if on cue there was a sound at the door which immediately opened at first because she was dressed deaken didnt recognize the girl who had surprised him that morning on deck staring down at the swimming pool carole was wearing white again a plain white sheath with just a diamond pin on the right shoulder the other girls waited complacently behind her you said ten carole said to azziz quite right to deaken azziz said were going ashore to the casino why not join us dont be ridiculous said deaken suit yourself said azziz would you like me to stay carole asked him directly deaken felt himself colouring no he said she pouted an expression of professional disappointment sure positive at the top of the steps leading into the tender grearson said to azziz it went the way you wanted but im still not sure its a good idea letting him see ortega well call lisbon before he gets there theres a limit to what we can tell ortega we can tell him enough to make it sound convincing said azziz and itll get the damned man out of my way he irritates me from below one of the girls called something up to them but neither heard azziz waved you sure about this mercenary fellow he impressed me said the lawyer lets hope he impresses me said azziz grearson looked down into the waiting tender i like the dark one he said carole if thats her name then shes yours said the arab in brussels harvey evans replaced the telephone after almost eight hours of continuous use because of the time difference he had left america until last if they kept their promises and flew in the following day he had a unit not precisely the one he wanted but men he had worked with before and whose capabilities he knew evans stretched the cramp from his shoulders dropped two cubes of ice into the scotch and then stood at his apartment window looking out over the rue des alexiens evans believed in instinct and his instinct told him that this was going to be something good damned good he took a deep swallow of his drink it had taken long enough deaken felt satisfied physically to be doing something apart from the brief thirtyminute excursion to the quayside telephone he had been aboard the yacht for two days and until the helicopter lifted him off and whirled away just off land he hadnt realized how claustrophobic he had found it beneath him the coastline of the riviera unrolled as if on display for his benefit it was early just after six and the corniche was quiet just an occasional car and once near antibes what appeared to be an almost unmoving procession of three lorries the large trailerdrawing camions with chimneys just behind the cab spouting out black exhaust the helicopter was low enough for him to make out the inscription on the sides two road haulage from different companies and a chemical container they seemed intrusive like a blemish on a pretty face out to sea a tanker made its way eastward two yachts were moving in the same direction both under sail wakes zigzagged behind them as they tacked to catch the wind it seemed early for such effort through the headset deaken heard the pilot pick up instructions from marseilles flight control almost at once he took the machine farther out from the land and then swung it to starboard bringing them in directly from the sea deaken had expected to be put down in a separate section but realized as the helicopter made its final descent that he was only a hundred yards from an airliner a group of people stood waiting shielding themselves from the machines downdraft deaken got out ducking low the rotor blades still clopping above his head there was an airline representative a customs official and an immigration officer the deference was obvious the formalities were cursory and within minutes deaken was being led to the waiting aircraft he was conscious of other passengers already aboard staring through the windows at his arrival the first officer was waiting at the top of the steps leading him immediately into the firstclass section with the invitation once they had taken off to join them at any time on the flight deck as deaken fastened his safety belt the steward came alongside with the drinks trolley i dont drink at seven thirty in the morning refused deaken anything you want just call mr deaken said the man they even knew his name thought deaken so this was power he wanted to despise it but couldnt he was flattered by it he admitted to himself excited too he ate a solicitously served breakfast and then for politeness rather than because he wanted to went onto the flight deck for the transit landing in madrid it enabled him to inquire about timing they were on schedule the captain told him lisbon arrival was they were ten minutes early and he was ushered off first deaken had travelled only with a briefcase so there was no luggage reclaim delay and he went through customs unchecked the arrangement with azziz before deaken had left the scheherazade was to telephone ortegas office to learn the result of the arabs contact while he was en route if ortega was there an appointment would have been arranged if not his secretary would pass on an alternative location the response was quick when he dialled the number the language conveniently moving into english when he identified himself mr ortega was expecting him at eleven after the frustration of the previous fortyeight hours it was proving remarkably easy thought deaken almost too easy he hoped it was not a bad omen he actually enjoyed the drive from the airport locating the silver thread of the tagus river looping out to the atlantic as the taxi topped one of the enclosing hills of lisbon he had never been to the portuguese capital it had the slightly declining faded atmosphere of a once great and important place shunted aside by circumstance like a dowager of a lost fortune forced to wear the patched clothes of a previous age deaken liked it he thought it was a nicely packaged easily manageable city with a lot of churches and blackshawled women and statues of warriors on horseback looking into the distance for something to capture ortegas office was in an area of tightly packed streets on the rua da assunc ao after the opulence of the past two days deaken had expected it to be an impressive place perhaps occupying an entire building and to be at least as imposing as the smokedglass groundfloor suites which he hurried past every day on his way to the garret on the avenue pictet de rochemont in geneva it wasnt a secondfloor warren of rooms was reached by a not particularly clean set of stairs to a waiting area a secretarys annexe leading to ortegas sanctum at the end of a small corridor the carpeting began here dramatically improving in quality beyond ortegas door there was a large desk elaborately carved and brass inlaid leather furniture including a matching couch and a side table supporting the model of a propellerdriven aircraft which deaken couldnt identify one wall was occupied by a map of the world and another dominated by the photograph of a man in a grey lounge suit and a lapel full of medals ortega stood but didnt come forward to greet his visitor the portuguese was a small dapper man the white summer suit immaculate the pink silk pocket handkerchief complementing the pink silk tie he smiled when they shook hands and deaken saw both the mans eyeteeth were gold it was a peculiar affectationa rich vampire thought deaken youll be with grearsons department said ortega in a manner of speaking said deaken ortega gestured deaken to a chair in front of the desk and seated himself instead of increasing his stature which deaken guessed was the intention the size of the desk made ortega look more diminutive there were no difficulties with the shipment leaving france ortega raised an immaculate eyebrow so i understand said deaken the man was presenting his references or at madeira deaken concealed his lack of knowledge sailed satisfactorily five thirty this morning said ortega as i knew it would ive never had trouble there mr azziz is grateful he asked me to tell you that he hadnt but deaken had never found flattery a drawback ortega smiled his goldtipped smile its an important cargo he said still bargaining arent they all said deaken for the first time he was on something like an even footing although he hadnt known about madeira and wondered what else there was to learn africas a good market said ortega more money available there than in south america and theyre prepared to spend it for the right material my involvement usually begins after the deals have been struck lured deaken and as you said im new big enough for country agencies to get involved said ortega adopting the lecturers pose towards which deaken had hoped he would move great britain is in there france sos america russia is particularly active once theres a big sale then theres dependence for spares and ammunition and the purchaser becomes a client state with national agencies involved it must make it all the more difficult for independents said deaken thats where azziz has the advantage over the rest of us said ortega hes independent but hes understood to have saudi arabian backing real or otherwisehes got the best of both worlds and appears to enjoy it thought deaken he wondered if carole had slept with azziz the previous night and felt immediately irritated by himself why should it matter to him there should be no difficulty after madeira he continued still searching ortega looked down at the papers in front of him again dakar by saturday he said the smile flashed again but then thats nothing to do with me is it as i said mr azziz is extremely grateful which is why youre here a percentage was agreed i believe said deaken although there was no limit he didnt want to concede any more than he had to azziz had accused him of panic the previous day did azzizs opinion matter any more than his bedmate why the hell couldnt he dispel the inferiority complex two per cent for the risks involved said ortega you knew the risks before you entered the transaction theres always time for reflection reexamination said ortega i would have thought in your business our business deaken corrected that all the risks and examinations should be decided before commitment conditions change they didnt here everything went exactly as planned oh no contradicted ortega at once there were difficulties in marseilles people got greedy i thought at one time the whole thing might get blocked another two per cent offered deaken six hundred thousand was a hell of a profit whatever difficulties ortegas agent had encountered ortegas expression was smooth with apologetic refusal its an onwardgoing thing he said these people are in contact with each other from port to port by the time the bellicose got to madeira the customs people knew the rate had gone up how much five per cent two and a half million dollars for having his name on a piece of paper for four or five days bloody ridiculous agreed said deakenthe charade had gone on long enough from his briefcase he took a signed but blank bankers order made out against a holding account of a company named as eklon and lodged in the swiss banking corporation on zurichs paradeplatz he leaned forward against ortegas elaborate desk hesitating before he filled it in what currency he saw ortega was fitting documents into an envelope swiss francs said the portuguese arms dealer theyre always so sound he saw the lawyer pause and slid a calculator and computer printout of the rates timed one hour before their meeting began across the desk deaken made the calculations and offered it to ortega for agreement ortega nodded but he didnt smile this was business deaken filled in the amount it was an awful lot of gold teeth he thought when he looked up ortega was burning a taper beneath some wax watching the blobs fall on the flap of the envelope what are you doing sealing the documentation i havent seen it yet said deaken its all there i assure you deaken retrieved the bank draft from the desk there can be no payment until im satisfied everythings complete deaken had no intention of getting all the way back to the scheherazade to discover something was missing there had been too much delay already ive already spoken to mr azziz said ortega it sounded like a reprimand would you let a representative of yours pay over a million sight unseen no ortega picked up an ornate paper knife fashioned like a miniature twoedged sword and picked away the stillplastic wax he offered the envelope to deaken the lawyer opened the flap and took out four sheets of paper two were pinned together the manifest deaken realized it was in french having had sufficient unoccupied time to learn the languages of switzerland deaken read it easily feeling a lawyers satisfaction at having tangible evidence to consider there were russian as well as american rockets browning machine guns listed with the ak and armalite and entry after entry setting out the amount and calibre of the ammunition there were four gauges of mortar shells as well as weapons antipersonnel and antitank mines and five separate listings for shoulderoperated missiles which deaken assumed were to resist helicopter assaulthe remembered the south africans were fond of using helicopters in the bush good shipment isnt it said ortega deaken thought it was an obscene remark very good he said the second was the official bill of sale from ortega to azziz the purchase price precisely listed at swiss francs the purchaser inscribed as eklon corporation the third also in french was what deaken assumed to be the enduser certificate it seemed inadequate for all the trouble it had caused he saw that it had been endorsed from ortega to eklon theres no bill of lading said deaken what documentary proof that the shipment is aboard the bellicose there should be one from your agent in marseilles i assure you everything is aboard said the portuguese its not for me to believe you or otherwise deaken gestured with the papers in his hand these mean nothing without the bill of lading thank god hed insisted upon the envelope being opened i can have it delivered to you when i receive it from france or you could return to collect it personally more delay thought deaken maybe for days i can collect it he said im returning through marseilles youre very conscientious mr deaken said ortega i regard it as basic caution deaken leaned forward setting the draft out in front of him the alteration took seconds what are you doing redating the bank authorization said deaken its drawable against tomorrows date not todays ortegas face stiffened thats offensive he said no said deaken thats properly considering the risks he offered the payment for several moments ortega looked at it without moving then reached forward to pick it up the attitude which had been patronizing was now hostile deaken didnt give a damn ill need written authorization for your man in marseilles and his name and address said deaken ortegas personal notepaper was held in a small brass rack to his left he took a sheet and scribbled an impatient message scrawling a signature beneath it i had intended suggesting lunch he said in a tone indicating he was no longer going to i need to get back to marseilles as soon as possible said deaken the helicopter was scheduled to collect him from the incoming evening flight he saw from the second envelope which ortega gave him that the french agent was named marcel lerclerc and that the office was on the boulevard notre dame thank you again he said rising ortega remained seated im sure youll do well with azziz said the portuguese i hope to said deaken heavily he was back at the airport by he started his tour of the airlines at the tap desk but it was not until he reached iberia that he found a fast enough routing a direct flight to madrid in fortyfive minutes with an immediate transfer connection to an air france service en route from new york he reached marseilles at the evening rush hour was beginning so it was not until almost five that he reached lerlercs office the arms dealers agent was a saggy bulging man with a closed suspicious face his attitude changed as soon as deaken produced the written authorization has there been a difficulty there was the slightest accent from his colouring deaken guessed he was corsican rather than french difficulty when he telephoned from paris mr grearson said i was to send the bill of lading there paris thats where the order came from i know said deaken you say mr grearson called from paris yesterday morning confirmed the man quite early lerclerc got heavily from his chair bent with difficulty over a safe in the corner and took out the bill of lading its in order he said still defensive deaken carefully compared the manifest duplicate with the lading certificate it took a long time because he was careful he was conscious of lerclerc shifting behind the desk when he looked up lerclerc said all correct appears to be lerclerc visibly relaxed a little pastis he offered seeming to think a celebration justified deaken nodded and lerclerc heaved himself out of his chair as he poured he said we enjoy doing business even subsidiary business with your organization so mr ortega made clear deaken hesitated its a worthwhile intercession lerclerc looked up sharply as he returned with the drinks still alert for criticism theres never been a difficulty from this port ever he said weve always earned our five per cent i know where to go who to see deaken accepted the water decanter and watched the liquid turn milky im sure you do he said soothingly to continued business toasted lerclerc deaken drank so mr grearson wasnt personally here yesterday the other man seemed surprised at the repeated question no he said should he have been i understood he was lerclerc shook his head been with azziz long just started an impressive organization from somewhere just beyond the office deaken heard a clock strike and confirmed the time from his watch ive a pickup scheduled from the airport im going to be late he said can i use your telephone to get a message to the pilot lerclerc grimaced apologetically bloody telephone has been out of order since this morning he said ive had three promises of an engineers call deaken finished his drink in a heavy gulp then ill have to leave immediately he was fortyfive minutes late getting back to marseilles airport but the helicopter pilot was still waiting obediently the departure formalities were as easy as they had been earlier in the day and he was airborne within thirty minutes they left on the same flightpath directly out over the sea to deakens right the sun was setting in a defiant burst of red and scarlet half submerged in the distant sea there had already been notification from the communications room of the helicopters return and the two men stood at the expensive panoramic windows of the scheherazade stateroom gazing westwards in the half light seeking the identification markings what did you tell ortega asked grearson that he was new to your staff that i wanted to try him out the agreed profit was to remain but i wanted ortegas assessment of how deaken bargained up to it the american lawyer frowned didnt he find that unusual i undertook to move the next difficult shipment through him said azziz he spotted the red and green lights of the helicopter almost at once they heard the windslapping sound and saw the black outline of the machine pass to port they turned away from the window im still unsure about deaken being unsupervised said grearson dont be said the arab dismissively hes a fool what about the second shipment everything ready in two or three days transport chartered from levcos again anything from makimber not yet said grearson you know its often not easy establishing direct contact at once the door opened and deaken entered both men were struck by the new confidence a bounce in the way he moved neither remembered hearing a knock at the door deaken offered azziz an envelope enduser certificate manifest official bill of lading and purchase receipt in the sum of swiss francs from ortega back to you deaken realized that he sounded like a schoolboy presenting an endofterm report to his father you made a good bargain thank you said deaken so now there are no more problems you can turn the bellicose back the arab nodded deaken looked at him expectantly azziz frowned and deaken said well why dont you azziz appeared momentarily surprised at the suggestion of course he said moving to the telephones deaken waited until the arab was sufficiently far away from them and said to grearson i thought you would have brought the bill of lading back from marseilles grearson looked at him intently why should i have done that i thought you went there yesterday to see the shipping agent paris corrected the american i wanted to find out about the original order and what progress there was in trying to trace where theyre being held deaken allowed himself to be deflected any news he said clearly we cant let the people in paris have the photograph to make their own comparison said grearson the helicopter is going up at first light tomorrow to bring back all the brochures and information theyve managed to assemble on holiday farms azziz came back into the group were contacting levcos through athens he said the turnabout instructions will go from piraeus so maybe the stuff from paris will be superfluous said deaken i thought grearson went to marseilles not paris he added he was looking directly at azziz as he spoke azziz returned the look his face expressionless paris he said you must have misunderstood hinkier and bartlett who were the first evans contacted because he knew they were in rome and would be together as they always were arrived in brussels on the morning flight bringing sneider with them sneider was drunk at that lopsided unprotesting stage of drunkenness evans shook hands with hinkler and bartlett sneider sniggered been like it for a week said hinkler who was wideshouldered and blond and looked more germanic than sneider whose parents were immigrants to milwaukee when he hasnt been drinking hes been getting laid how long has he been out of libya asked evans fortnight said bartlett i guess hes allowed said evans what is it said bartlett well wait for the rest decided evans hinkler and bartlett both looked very fit despite the drunkenness sneider was lean and hard his face leathered brown from the three years he had spent in the libyan training camps sure accepted bartlett at once accepting the soldiers logic against unnecessary repetition why dont we get sneider bedded down still smiling sneider allowed himself to be taken to the secondary bedroom in the rue des alexiens apartment they only bothered to unlace and remove his boots with the money he had been given for expenses evans had restocked the bar he nodded towards it when they returned to the living room hinkler poured two brandies without asking bartlett what he wanted evans took scotch hows it been asked evans he knew bartlett and hinkler had quit libya a year before him rough said hinkler there was something going in iran training again but it was a worse disaster than gaddafi didnt get paid for three months and they actually expected us to take notice of their damned religious crap god keep me from religious revolutionaries we were thinking of san salvador when you called said bartlett good contracts being offered know anyone there bartlett shook his head supposed to be some of our guys there but we havent heard any names wheres the recruitment frankfurt said hinkler thats where i found marinetti said evans is he in with us asked bartlett evans nodded he said hed come good said hinkler marinetti was the explosives expert they had all expected to be captured by the vietcong when a deep penetration into the parrots beak in cambodia fouled up in but marinetti had covered their trail with booby traps and given them the hour they needed to be airlifted out anybody else said bartlett hank melvin said evans and nelson jones hinkler and bartlett nodded together most of the old team remembered hinkler all but rodgers and ericson completed bartlett rodgers was still in libya ericson was permanently in a vets hospital in phoenix both legs amputated at midthigh where hed trodden on an antipersonnel mine in da nang three months before nixons peace with honour and mentally unable even to use a wheelchair melvin was the next to arrive the texan telephoned from the airport and reached the rue des alexiens fifteen minutes ahead of marinetti the greetings with those already there were subdued without any theatrical boisterousness and evans was glad they were still a team he thought gratefully melvin had travelled from madrid where he was negotiating a contract in mozambique marinetti confirmed that until evanss call he was considering the san salvador offer its always goddam training said melvin never combat evans had always suspected that melvin got pleasure out of fighting but he had never let them down theyd expected us to take our payment within the country in san salvador protested marinetti can you imagine what a load of crap that would have been toytown paper only good for wiping your ass once youre out of the country because he had had to come from america nelson jones was the last to arrive the extremely tall black man came quietly but with smooth assurance into the apartment smiling and nodding in recognition of those already assembled without any pretension he and evans greeted each other with an openpalmed slapping handshake hi said jones generally there was a comfortable response a reaction to someone coming home jones was six foot six and completely bald why dont we get sneider up suggested evans hinkler and bartlett accepted their responsibility coming from the smaller bedroom within minutes with the third man sneider blinked tried to focus licked his dry lips then shook his head reunion he snorted motherfucking reunion he saw the drinks on the side table and moved towards them no evans spoke softly sneider hesitated then halted without looking around what he said no the man turned angling his head to focus upon evans i want a drink i said no there was a sense of anticipation in the room the feeling of spectators witnessing arm wrestling between two evenly matched men evans hadnt wanted to put the other man into this position and moved to get him out of it were working he said its a job and were all here its time for briefing it was an exaggeration but it allowed sneider his escape another victory with honour thought evans sometimes it was difficult for him to remember he didnt have the inherent authority of the american military to back every command sneider nodded moving away from the drinks good to be aboard he said evans realized the man was still not completely sober because they were what they wereand because it was all he really knew aboutevans set out the financial details of the contract intent upon their reaction even sneider looked impressed to do what asked jones get somebody back said evans kidnap queried hinkler seemed like it said evans it was left vague bartlett looked around the room at the assembled men isnt this a little heavy they dont seem to think so where is it what have we got to do said marinetti always the practical one i dont know yet confessed evans i had to gather a group together then report back and we get paid even if were not used queried jones reverting to the financial details in advance confirmed evans sure this is straight demanded hinkler positive how demanded bartlett at once i know who it is the seven men gazed at him waiting its on a needtoknow basis said evans one by one they nodded accepting the refusal evans felt a stir of satisfaction that they still trusted him as a commanding officer what about materials said marinetti all being provided until we know what it is we wont know what we want he pointed out objectively itll be available whatever we want anything how can you be sure said sneider the effort of concentration was obvious but he was achieving it im sure said evans opposition said jones unknown as yet its a lot of money for going around with our pants around our ankles judged hinkler no ones going in bareassed assured evans there was a preliminary meeting and i was asked to assemble a force which ive done now i get back and we go on from there you think its europe persisted marinetti i said im not sure said evans he would be offending their professionalism he knew europes dangerous said melvin entering the discussion theyre too well organized here you get your money for coming said evans and your expenses if you dont like it when its set out then you can back away seems fair enough to me said hinkler bartlett nodded in immediate agreement been a long flight said jones i might as well hang around to see what the score is any currency i want wherever i want it queried marinetti cautious to the last in advance assured evans then im in me too said melvin they all looked at sneider that leaves you said evans sneider smiled a straight expression for the first time since he had entered the apartment be a pity to break up a winning team he said deaken was impatient to leave the yacht the uncertainties and doubts of the previous evening had been washed away by his awareness that they had met underbergs demands and that he would soon be with karen again he was on deck before the tender was lowered from its davits tapping his hand irritably against his leg as the boat was manoeuvred into the water and then reversed against the stepway deaken was waiting on the platform when it came alongside there was a shout from the deck and he waved up to one of the girls the tender was halfway across the harbour when he heard the scheherazade helicopter returning he hadnt realized that it had left the yacht there was a tug of nervousness just before he landed increasing as he climbed the harbour steps it disappeared the moment he saw that the designated kiosk was empty the day was close and muggy and deaken left the door open to make the most of what little air there was he positioned the recorder and fixed the listening attachment staring around him when he finished it really was beautiful he thought properly noticing the harbour and monaco rising in weddingcake tiers behind for the first time spectacular in fact just the place to bring karen there would be cheapenough hotels away from the front that was all they would need a clean comfortable pension where he could comfort her and convince her that the nightmare was over and that she didnt have to worry anymore just sleep and food and to lie in the sun not even sex if she didnt want it everything at her pace as she dictated it deaken had turned back inside the box and closed the door against the noise of the harbour when the telephone sounded there was no nervousness when he lifted the receiver this time nor forgetfulness in starting the recording everythings resolved he announced as soon as he heard underbergs voice tell me how said underberg the voice as patronizing as always he had once longed to pulp that arrogant supercilious face remembered deaken it seemed a juvenile reaction now all that mattered was getting karen back succinctly deaken identified the freighter and gave under underbergs detailed questioning the itemized contents of its cargo he set out its routing and the brief madeira docking and insisted in reply to the repeated question its already been turned back when last night what time eight said deaken he should have known more positively about eight good said underberg very good what about karen and the boy ill need better proof than this said underberg and turning the boat around is only half of what i want deakens euphoria burst like an overinflated balloon only half you surely didnt think we intended letting those arms go to waste did you theres another destination for them where all in good time said underberg what do you want me to do asked deaken dully itll take at least three days maybe four for the freighter to get back said underberg well make it another fortyeight hours no wait said deaken urgently how is she hows karen as an afterthought he added and the boy perfectly well said underberg were keeping our side of the bargain and were keeping ours said deaken hurriedly then everything is going to work out fine isnt it underberg replaced the receiver he was at the window binoculars in hand when deaken emerged from the kiosk underberg decided he believed the lawyer which meant azziz and grearson were deceiving the man as he had expected them to do he moved away from the window overlooking the harbour impatient for the call from levy the package had been delivered to the stateroom before the shorebound tender drew alongside the harbour edge it contained a list of twenty possible holiday farms only eight with illustrations the one at rixheim was the fifth they came to the large communal room was considered a feature and was prominently displayed with two separate colour photographs in the brochure azziz and grearson sat side by side comparing them to the polaroid picture showing deakens wife and the boy the sideboard was identical even to the matching plates and kitchenware and the manner in which it was arranged the fireplace with its intricate apparatus of cogs and chains was better shown in the brochure the bench upon which the couple were sitting had been dragged from one side they could see for once he wasnt foolish said grearson it was a good idea said the arab he added im glad we took the precautions we did immediately grearson picked up a telephone and was connected at once to paris it was a brief conversation the major evans has made contact he said hes got a unit ready good said azziz karen was aware of his concern as soon as levy came into her bedroom what is it she said the boy whats wrong i dont know she waited wanting a small victory after a moment he said can you help because of the permanently closed shutters in her room she had grown accustomed to the darkness as she followed the israeli along the corridor she realized it was still only half light the carefully made resolution about winding her watch had been forgotten and it had stopped at one oclock she didnt know whether that had been day or night two men were already in azzizs room greening was uncomfortable not knowing what to do leiberwitz turned at their entry and said hes shamming theres nothing wrong karen pushed past him the boy stared up at her dulleyed but aware of what was going on around him the bruising had developed so that his cheeks and lips were black fading at the edge into a yellow colour as if they had been treated with iodine he was greased in perspiration hair lank and sticking to his forehead his bedding was damp from his body and the room was pungent with his smell periodically almost at timed intervals he shuddered convulsively as if he were cold karen reached out hesitantly touching his wet forehead hes not shamming she said to leiberwitz who asked you demanded the bearded man belligerently he did she said indicating levy what would she have done if it had been her child a simple answer get a doctor we cant leave him like this she said to levy its probably only flu you dont know that no doctor he insisted you do something i dont know what to do she protested illness repelled her made her feel nervous and unclean her father had been killed outright in a traffic accident when she was ten the injuries too severe for anyone to view the body and by the time her mother became ill she had already left pretoria and was in her second year at the london school of economics none of the family had realized how quick it would be by the time she got back to south africa her mother was dead it had been her younger sister who had coped with the blanket baths and the bedpans secretlya secret she kept even from richard because she was ashamed of itshe was glad she had got back too late its only a fever levy was adamant cold water then she said doubtfully greening went to get it get his clothes off and fresh bedding she stood back while levy and leiberwitz took off azzizs stinking clothing the boy put up a feeble resistance and they left him with his underpants they rolled him back and forth to clear the bedcovering and replaced it with some linen from the bottom of the wardrobe the man who brought the water came with a towel and karen attempted to dry azzizs perspiration trying to prevent her fingers actually coming into contact with the boys skin but at the same time making sure no one else noticed her squeamishness she discarded one towel and demanded another using it to wipe azziz after she had sponged him with cold water when she was wiping his face their eyes held briefly and the boy managed a halfsmile the perspiration broke out afresh the moment she cleaned him i think he should be covered she said uncertainly sweat it out greening returned almost at once with more blankets as soon as they were put on him azziz attempted to thrust them away and water karen said he should have a lot of liquid she was grateful it was greening who lifted azzizs head and held the cup to the boys mouth karen pulled back from the bed wanting to get away as soon as possible thank you said levy i still think he should see a doctor no what happens if he dies he wont die its a chill nothing else a little while ago you thought it was flu she looked around the room i want a bath she said levy led her to the bathroom and entered ahead of her taking the key from inside the lock there was still a pushbolt which secured it from the inside i shall be right outside the door he said if i hear the bolt go across ill break it down she noticed that the small window was unbarred even lifted to let in about three inches of early morning light the drop to the ground would be about twelve feet she guessed maybe a little more she said nothing staring at levy and waiting for him to go back into the corridor right outside he said as if fearing she hadnt understood karen needed to use the toilet but didnt want levy to hear she started to run the bath turning the taps full so that the water splashed loudly into it the heating worked by an ancient mechanism that operated the gas jets automatically when the hotwater tap was turned it exploded into life frightening her everything was loud and echoing and she was sure levy wouldnt hear a thing afterwards she crouched at the window not opening it farther in case he heard the sash creak it was like looking through a letter box the window overlooked the front of the house and the lane beyond their exercise area was to the left dew still whitened the grass and hung in droplets from the summer spiders webs which skeined the bisecting hedge by straining she could pick out the fields and the sloping hill beyond where she had seen the labourers working already it was touched by the first warm fingers of sun and pockets of mist were forming like uncertain smoke fairy fires she thought thats how she would describe it to her babies when they grew old enough to want stories she often thought of phrases and simple little plots when the time came she wanted them to be her stories not somebody elses beyond the bordering hedge the lane ran straight and black still shadowed by the clustered hills she strained again in the other direction this time trying to see some neighbouring houses or farms there were a lot of thickhaired trees and as she watched a clock bell struck unexpectedly counting off a quarterhour she couldnt see the tower but it hadnt sounded far away you all right levys voice made her jump fine she said she undressed and got into the bath consciously making plenty of noise she stood to soap herself completely welcoming the feel of the water after so many days it was not until she sat down that she looked sideways and saw the empty keyhole practically level with the edge of the bath he wouldnt she thought at once and immediately questioned her certainty why not what justification did she have for investing him with any sort of decent feeling but she still didnt think he would have looked she was careful to dry herself standing to the side where she would not be visible through the tiny opening regretting that she had no perfume or cologne until that moment she hadnt realized something else that had been taken from her the right to be feminine she released the water and cleaned the bath and at the door paused for a moment reluctant to leave briefly for a few minutes at least she had been able to do whatever she liked it was something approaching a moment of freedom levy was waiting immediately outside your face is all shiny and pink he said the remark disconcerted her confused her i enjoyed the bath she said thank you the boys sleeping the fevers still the same but hes sleeping good neither appeared to know what to do we might as well have breakfast he said all right initially they ate without speaking levy attentive to her needs and passing the coffee pot and the basket of croissants towards her without being asked once as he offered her some butter their hands touched and he smiled apologetically this seems to be going on forever she said yes he said im sorry youre not terrorists are you said karen in sudden challenge we know what were doing said levy defensively karen shook her head i was reading politics in london at the school of economics when my mother died i went to south africa for the funeral and never bothered to go back and complete the course because id met richard he was a friend of the family and already involved in politicsradical politics for south africa he appeared in court for a lot of people not just there but elsewhere so i met plenty she stopped knowing that she had made her point clumsily youre not like them at allnone of you were not trying to be like anyone so what are you jews doing what jews have always done fighting to survive karen knew a sudden surge of pity she had encountered terrorists too many because although she thought she shared many of their views she had rarely liked or trusted the people who expressed them she was also familiar with the men who confronted them riot police armoured units and elite trained squads with dogs and gas and plastic and rubber bullets and water cannon this gentleeyed crinklehaired man who worried about breakfast civilities wouldnt stand a chance he had slapped her certainly knocked her down although that had been more of an accidental trip and beaten the boy but that hadnt been the ruthless unthinking cruelty she had known other people capable of that had been sudden flaring anger and nerves she corrected the thought more nerves than anger far more poor bugger she thought what time is it said karen eight she set and wound her watch forgot she said she wouldnt let it happen againit was important to keep track of the time though exactly why she wasnt quite sure we could walk in the garden if you like all right he stood back to allow her to go through the door ahead of him she hadnt been expecting the courtesy and half collided with him they both smiled embarrassed youre not going to run away are you he said no she said why give him that assurance so readily the faraway field was being worked again bowed men following a machine that appeared to be ploughing a slow unwavering line she thought the field was pretty neatly patterned as if they were knitting the design into the earth crows were sounding approval from the high elms and she heard again the clockchime she had counted in the bathroom she turned but couldnt see the tower there were more trees and more crows their nests picked out on the upper branches like musical notes for a tune the occupants couldnt get right it was still wet underfoot karen saw her shoes were being stained black more musical notes how long have you been married levy did not look at her nine years she said what about you three children it was a blurted question two he said both boys he smiled in private recollection shimeon is two named after me yatzik is a baby just four months the correction came immediately five months ive been away for a while i havent got any children why not it was a thoughtless question from a man still enclosed in his own thoughts they reached the perimeter edge near the hedge and beyond it the trees with their tuneless birds he took her elbow an automatic gesture to guide her around she was aware of the contact but didnt try to pull away richard doesnt want to why not he repeated she shrugged he says he wants to get settled first become established she was aware of him stiffening at the words his hand actually tightening against her arm my shoes are getting soaked she said why not take them off she was seized at once by the careless uncomplicated delight of doing something without thought of censure or explanation or excuse for now the coldness of the grass came as a shock she shivered and he tightened his grip on her arm around them birds screeched and guffawed as if aware of the awkwardness the sun finally shouldered itself up over the barrier of the trees karens feet were frozen and she felt ridiculous standing before him with her shoes in her hand they werent even her newest pair and the insoles were stained with wear she hadnt thought she was going anywhere that wasnt a good idea she said no she looked helplessly down at her feet then at the shoes in her hand itll be worse if i put them on again wed better go back she gave another involuntary shiver wed better get you dry i dont want anyone else falling sick they walked selfconsciously apart back to the farmhouse karen made man friday tracks over the flagstones they were even colder than the grass ill use the towel in my room she said wondering as she spoke why an explanation was necessary ill see how the boy is it was a wide staircase and they went up side by side careful still not to touch ill get dry then she said at the top yes it wasnt until she got back to the room that karen realized that she had left so hurriedly at levys summons that she hadnt made the bed she took the towel from its rail near the washstand and sat down on the thrownback covering crooking her leg in front of her her feet had dried already but walking barefoot had made them dirty she put water from the jug into its matching bowl placed it beside the bed and immersed both her feet she looked up to see levy in the doorway how is he she asked asleep said levy still sweating no different really she dried her feet taking care to ensure that her skirt didnt ride up over her thighs your shoes are still wet id better wait until they dry theyre the only ones ive got she tucked her legs beneath her she wished the bed were made ill put them outside when the sun gets hotter thank you thats all right he remained in the doorway as if there were a demarcation line he could not cross would you like to try backgammon again he had tried to teach her the previous afternoon under azzizs contemptuous stare and she hadnt wanted to learn no thanks cards i dont know any card games i want to make love to you yes she said i know why wasnt she outraged offended at least frightened he came into the room and closed the door karen knew that if she wanted to she could stop him but she said nothing levy bent down and picked up the bowl the water was dirty creating a line around the edge and she wished it hadnt he put it on the washstand and came back to kneel before her not touching her but leaning forward to bring his face against hers and not really kissing more biting and nipping trying to get her lips between his teeth karen felt a flood between her legs a flood she hadnt known before and which embarrassed her they collided in their urgency his hands moving over her not groping and pawing but seeking reassurance she felt his touch beneath her skirt and opened her legs wanting to help him all she could he couldnt wait to undress himself just thrusting aside his trousers and stabbing at her karen came to him the whimper rising into a moaning scream as they burst together and she felt his hardness going on and on as if forever at first after the initial coupling they were wrong mistiming each other but then he slid his hands beneath her buttocks and held her slowing her to his movement until they rode together each in perfect time with the other despite their frenzy and the flow that had already soaked her it took a long time they grew comfortable with each other enjoying the fit it was karen who started the race nails deep into the thickness of his legs hauling him into her with each thrust come on she gasped come on come on come on bucking each time she made the demand levy tried desperately to keep up like a man running for a disappearing train he just missed she was already exploding in a backarching groan when he made it hurrying the more to finish at the same time they ended the journey together limp and exhausted against each other conscious of the discomfort of clothes between them kiss me she said they undressed afterwards giggling at the reverse order reaching out to touch and to feel as if afraid that as quickly as it had happened it would end and they would lose each other your back is bruised he said im sorry it doesnt hurt naked they tunnelled into the bed building their own burrow very quickly it became hot i believe this is called the stockholm syndrome women developing sexual fantasies about men who kidnap them it didnt seem like a fantasy to me it didnt to me either sorry no she said are you no its she stopped unable to find the expression she wanted strange though isnt it she finished badly yes said levy he was moving his hand over her body as if he still needed the reassurance of her presence whats your wifes name rebecca whats she like levy thought for a while as if he needed to remember precise details dark he said black hair and deep brown eyes shes tall slim she graduated two years before me graduated shes a teacherwe both are karen pulled away to scrutinize his face it suits you better better than being a man with a gun i mean she felt a satisfaction at having been right about him and at the same timeinexplicablya disappointment was that what had originally attracted her to him the fervent radicalism richard had once had but now lost she pushed the thought away unwilling to make the comparison were teachers he corrected not anymore why not cant be he said not allowed levy had moved away from her now his body still close enough to touch but his mind far distant we were in beersheba in the south it was a good school we had a good house the children hadnt come of course not shimeon or yatzik then the war happened in its strange im a sabra born in israel but until then id never been into sinai the negev but never the sinai he reflected for a moment karen remained silent beside him not wanting to intrude it was beautiful so beautiful even through the eyeslit of a tank i couldnt get over the stillness and the size and the peace he laughed at the word peace even when we were fighting a war there was another pause the egyptians made it across the canal but we pushed them back right back right out of the desert the sinai was ours karen was conscious that his voice was charged with an intense excitement it became government policy to resettle the areas make new homesteads i persuaded rebecca to give up our safe home and trust me and to come with me into a wilderness i felt liberated like a pioneer the sort of settlers my parents had been from poland lots of places were developed yammit haruvit thats where we made a town near haruvit he laughed but there was no mirth not a big town a large village i suppose but it existed we built houses and a school where rebecca and i taught and we planted and we made the desert grow shimeon was born there yatzik too the only home theyve ever known levy caressed her and she settled into the crook of his arm and then came the peace talks he said camp david with carter and sadat and begin playing world statesmen resettlement land suddenly became occupied territory not the golan of course begin needed to seem strong so he seized the golan but the sinai was different it didnt matter about all the people who had put their faith in the government for the greater good the occupied territories had to be returned for recognition surely what recognition he said israel is there on all the maps and always will be israel will never gain anything by weakness what about the saudi arabian plan to get official arab acceptance of the country they couldnt even start the bloody conference in morocco because libya syria algeria and iraq treated it as a joke the sinai has been cleared reminded karen temporarily insisted levy karen wondered if levy would accept the analogy that what had happened to the sinai settlers was almost exactly what had happened to the dispossessed palestinians perhaps a discussion for later she decided not now what are you going to do she asked softly fight like weve always had to karen felt a great sadness envelop her we fought the arabs and won now if we have to well fight the jews he said you intend to fight your own people theres a monument in israel which will always be identified with resistance its called masada i know karen said the jews put themselves to the sword rather than be captured by the romans they didnt fight other jews this will be our masada he said stubbornly oh my darling she said my poor darling youre patronizing me no im not she said anxiously feeling up and putting her finger against his lips really im not im just frightened for you you neednt be he said with schoolboy bravura were going to have weapons enough to fight a war she felt him turn to her thats what were going to get from azziz a whole boatload how many are there of you enough but you know how good your people are your army and your security forces she said it wont matter what sort of weaponry youve got theyll destroy you maybe if it was just us only our settlement conceded levy but it wont be once the other settlers see whats happened the resistance will spread throughout the sinai and onto the west bank even jerusalem they wont be able to ignore that they will thought karen oh my darling they will just as all strong determined regimes always crushed any irritating resistance whatever the morality of their argument she had studied it been involved in it for what seemed a lifetime she knew the arguments catchphrases the cliches and the message was always the same the smaller sacrifice for the larger good the justification for every general in every war david and goliath was a fairy story nothing more in real life the roof only ever fell in upon the weak and the innocent i should see how the boy is said levy checking his watch and ive got to go to make a telephone call not yet said karen this time their lovemaking was slower without any desperation and they came together ecstatically when he kissed her levy found her tears and said me too darling it was beautiful for me im glad said karen she would let him think she cried from pleasure she decided deaken was comparing the photograph and the brochure like a man unable to accept he had the winning ticket in a fabulous lottery no doubt he said no doubt at all his excitement swept away the depression of his conversation with underberg so we can get them out said azziz quietly we queried deaken we have some men said grearson theyre already flying to strasbourg i made contact with them an hour ago while you were ashore whats wrong with the police how long do you think that would take azziz spoke dismissively days of dreary explanations then time to assemble their antiterrorist squads i want my son back now like i thought you wanted your wife back of course i want her back said deaken angrily but what if anything goes wrong it wont said grearson now that the opportunity had come to take the sort of action he had wanted ever since karens kidnap deaken felt a curious reluctance to act he was still frightened he realized what about the negotiations with underberg grearson laughed contemptuously you heard what he said all in good time were not going to get them back through any negotiation any payment you surely didnt think we intended letting those arms go to waste did you he quoted again they havent made all their demands yet it could be weeks before we even get into the position of negotiating deaken couldnt dispute the logic what have you arranged he said the nearest town of any size to rixheim is mulhouse said grearson theres a hotel there called the parc thats the assembly point for whom im flying up i want to come too said deaken i expected you to said grearson with weary resignation karen wanted another bath but she was reluctant to ask permission of anyone except levy instead she got up naked from the bed filled the basin with cold water and washed herself down gasping at the waters chill but inside she felt a burning warmth a completeness she hadnt known for a long time if ever she frowned at the qualification once more refusing the comparison refusing to consider what she had done and what was happening to her only three days ago or was it four she had accused richard of running now it was her turn karen was fastening her buttons when the bedroom door burst open levy stood there flushed whats the matter she said they had already registered by the time deaken and grearson reached mulhouse arriving at the hotel on the rue sinne singly and in pairs with the cover story to the management that they were engineers assembling from all over france for an international conference which was due to begin within twentyfour hours across the border in geneva it provided a satisfactory reason for their abrupt arrival and what they expected to be an equally abrupt departure they even paid in advance and with cash not credit cards because it was the biggestand his by right as commanding officerthe meeting took place in evanss room not technically a suite but with definite aspirations a larger than normal bedroom with a hollowedout annexe to the side with chairs and a table deaken watched scrutinizing every face as grearson explained for the first time what was expected of them there was no expression from any of them no shock at the idea of kidnap no fear or apprehension at confronting unknown opposition or unfamiliar terrain they didnt even look human they could almost have been created from some firm fleshcoloured material that would be hard and metallic to the touch not something that could be bruised or broken grearson showed the polaroid photograph and the holiday brochure to evans the man made no effort to take it grearson shifted impatiently we agreed on terms said evans setting out the priorities from one of the two briefcases he carried with him grearson took sealed envelopes only evans was addressed he distributed them among the relaxed composed soldiers who accepted the money as their right without thanks each man opened his envelope and carefully counted the notes evans offered grearson a sheet of paper and said expenses so far the american scanned the list dug into his briefcase then called each man by name handing over the money there was a visible relaxation when the transaction was concluded evans took the photograph and brochure spreading them out upon the bed for comparison the others crowded round better than nothing said marinetti but all it gives us is the internal layout well need a reconnaissance agreed evans i saw a sports shop two blocks up said bartlett camping stuff like that fine said evans you go deaken sat silently in his chair feeling superfluous to the discussion karens life depended on these few men and he could only watch any weapons you want will have to come from paris warned grearson id like to know what they are now it was marinetti who spoke again doors front and back he said pointing to the markings on the brochure ill want to blow them simultaneously outside lock and the hinges as well in case there are inside bolts he looked up to grearson plastique he said i dont care what sort detonators obviously and lead wires a lot of wire because ill want to link back and front charges to go at the same time grearson made neat careful notations with a gold propelling pencil deaken had to concede that the american was handling himself with admirable professionalism and was as cool in this bizarre encounter as the mercenaries dont like that curve in the stairway said jones sizing up the houseplan be a bastard if they have time to get into position stun grenades said evans he looked at grearson well want the percussion type developed particularly by israel its better to cause everyone a little discomfort even the boy and the woman than for anyone to get really hurt but well need earplugs the uzi is neat said melvin to evans the organizer nodded uzi automatic weapons he instructed grearson theyre israeli too the best well need something different for the standback said hinkler he was looking at the door anxious for bartlett to return from the sports shop one snipers rifle evans stipulated make doesnt matter although a mannlicher or an ingrams would be good it must have an image intensifier because well be going in during darkness and need a nightsight glasses too said jones infrared evans looked to see that grearson was writing it down dark coveralls he said black if possible certainly no leopard suits woollen berets and nightblack for our faces deaken wondered if there would be any humorous reference to joness natural advantage there wasnt and a closed van continued evans to go and come back in grearson looked up that all ordinary grenades suggested melvin we want to bring people out alive said evans what about a stretcher if the boy or the woman gets hurt said hinkler deaken winced and immediately composed himself embarrassed at revealing any emotion in front of such an impassive group evans shook his head no time he said if theres injury well fieldcarry them away he looked to grearson you making arrangements for any medical needs that wont be a problem there was a staccato knock at the door hinkler moved hurriedly to admit bartlett the mercenary arranged his purchases upon the bed an orange rucksack with a back frame a yellow anorak hiking boots thick socks and a red hat with a nodding bobble on the end great said evans bartlett stuffed a pillow into the rucksack to give it some convincing bulk and quickly changed into the hikers gear bright isnt it said grearson of course it is said evans people never suspect things that are too obvious to bartlett he said why not go take a hike bartlett moved steadily along the lane adjusting his trained march to the heavyheeled plod of a tired walker he had both hands tucked into the support straps of the rucksack and with head bent appeared uninterested in his surroundings the details were in fact being recorded in his memory with the accuracy of a movie camera there was plenty of available concealmenthigh banks higher than a man in places even jonestopped by hedges which in the main were thick and concealing confident that he was completely hidden bartlett stopped at a gap and gazed in at the house fifty yards of garden exposed for most of the way unless they could use the cover of that bisecting hedge door locked thick and heavy which he would have to warn marinetti about covered windows blind against the coming night from one of the three clustered chimneys a thin curl of white smoke formed like a question mark bartlett was alert to everything about him and heard the trundling farm cart long before its occupants were aware of him there were four of them spreadeagled along the edges of an opensided carrier with beets piled in the middle it was being pulled by a tractor the driver of which wore a collar and tie as if he were proud of the days harvest and wanted to dress properly for it bartlett stood aside and as the cart passed one of the men smiled and said ca va bartlett waved back it was instinctive caution to shield his face although he was sure that all they would remember would be the colour of his outfit which would be discarded in an hour he plodded on looking in at the gate with only the sort of curiosity that a casual passerby might show there could have been a light at one of the upper rooms but perhaps it was a trick of the sun penetrating some unseen window at the rear the lane rose almost immediately beyond the farmhouse boundary and bartlett bent into the incline assessing the distance with each step wanting to distance himself from any possible observation from the house without looking round he suddenly cut sideways to his left scrambling up the bank and plunging into the coppice he sped on until he was deep in the small wood before turning left again to bring himself out overlooking the house before it was visible he took off the brightly coloured clothing and stacked it against the bole of a tree squirming forward on his elbows and knees he reached the coppice edge the vantage point gave him a view of both the side and the rear of the farmhouse the rear door was thick like the one in frontanother reminder for marinetti there were no vehicles visible but there were plenty of outbuildings and barns in which it would have been an elementary precaution to conceal them as he watched a man emerged from the back door strode to the middle of the yard and looked around as if checking for anyone watching bartlett didnt move knowing he was completely concealed appearing satisfied the man went into one of the barns to emerge almost immediately he stopped in almost the same place in the yard for another then reentered the house bartlett wriggled himself backwards until he had penetrated the treeline and then rose to his feet brushing away the leaf mould he returned to the discarded clothing dressed and regained the lane in minutes he descended back towards the village with the same tired stiffkneed walk he had adopted when he passed the house the first time on this occasion he didnt bother to look in at the gate seemingly uninterested in something he had already looked at it was past seven by the time he got back to mulhouse whats it look like demanded evans at once well chosen vision on every side reported bartlett if we dont surprise them we could be cut to pieces shit said jones it was am when the closed van arrived from paris it was obviously impractical to bring the contents into the hotel so evans went out to inspect them in the vehicle he only bothered to take marinetti with him to check the explosives the two men returned within half an hour good said evans to grearson everything we wanted the uzis are brand new still with the original grease to the assembled soldiers he said looking at his watch ive got two ten there was a simultaneous reaction as they synchronized their watches thirty minutes to rixheim continued the man black up and dress on the way well hit the farmhouse at three in unison they moved towards the door involuntarily deaken said be careful they all looked at him disbelievingly melvin said dont be fucking stupid edward makimber emerged from the teranga hotel onto the place de union staring around him at the familiar activity of an african township at night dakar didnt really resemble an african town he corrected himself the french influence was too strong with its mathematically careful highways and large buildings he set out towards the waterfront wanting to orient himself even though it was late and the office of the men he wanted to see would be closed perhaps coming here would turn out to be overly cautious as it had been in madeira but he was determined not to take any risk which was why the others were flying in the following day from angola makimber didnt like dealing with such people but sometimes they were necessary just like revolution was necessary if you wanted freedom for a long time carole lay awake and then finally got up and went out on deck despite the lateness the harbour and the town beyond was still bright with light cars fireflying along the corniche and the lower roads she leaned against the deck rail and thought about a distracted and seemingly lost man called richard deaken he was obviously vulnerable and she felt sorry for him which she recognized wasnt professional at all she would have to be careful while they had been waiting for the paris delivery bartlett had sketched a series of reconnaissance maps of the lane approach the side elevation and the front and back assault positions so now the group moved confidently towards the farmhouse expertly taking advantage of the high banking and the hedge for cover the talking like the map reading had been done in the mulhouse hotel room now the only communication was by hand signals melvin was detached to act as rearguard to warn of anyone approaching from the village an essential posting after the possible arousing noise of the doors being blown the inseparable hinkler and bartlett were dispatched farther up the lane to enter by the track that led to the back of the house evans marinetti jones and sneider hunched by the farm entrance around marinettis right shoulder like a bandolier was looped the connection wire the plastic explosives and the detonatorsquite harmless when they were unconnectedwere in the satchel slung for balance across the other shoulder both he evans and sneider carried uzi rifles jones had the nightsighted ingrams snipers weapon the four men crouched relaxed and unmoving evans checking his watch to time the progress of bartlett and hinkler to the rear ten minutes had been allowed at the count he signalled to jones the black man rose and vaulted the gate in one fluid movement the other three rose too covering the front of the house this was the most dangerous moment if a guard had been posted jones was in full view of the house even when protected by the shadows of the hedge there was no challenge marinetti was the next to go over weighted by the equipment he carried evans followed as lithely as jones had done sneider went last the three men sprinted bent double towards the house behind them jones was splayed out on the ground in firing position the snipers rifle to his shoulder every part of the house clearly visible through the imageintensifier sight evans stopped with his back hard against the farmhouse wall uzi at the ready across his body sneider halted at the corner covering the side of the house marinetti remained at the door kneading plugs of the explosive into place around the locks and bolts fitting the detonator caps and threading the wires to connect the three he backed away like a fisherman running out a net evans watched until the explosives expert disappeared around the corner of the house towards the second door at the rear evans looked up frowning at the sky there were clouds but they were tattered and threadbare jostled and torn by a bustling wind that swept them in front of a too fullmoon it wasnt as bad as it seemed because he knew where to look but in several moments of brightness he could see jones clearly outlined in the garden evans detected the movement as soon as marinetti reappeared around the corner the man stopped there bending to twist the final connection for his wires making them live he looked up giving the signal to evans and sneider and in turn evans jerked the uzi a backandforth motion across his chest knowing jones would have him focused in the nightsight there was a smooth shadowy movement and the jones arrived alongside there was another sign from marinetti and evans and jones retreated from the door hunching down beneath the window with a minute to go each man screwed in his earplugs against the percussion grenades at two minutes to three marinetti fired the charges marinetti had balanced it perfectly using just enough charge to shatter the locks and hinges but no more the noise came as a crack the sort of sound that would have carried like the sound of a poachers shot as far away as the village evans and jones were on the move as the door burst in unrestrained by any inner bolts they ran over it darting immediately sideways and out of the framing rectangle of light they reached the large room simultaneously with hinkler and bartlett entering from the rear perfectly coordinated evans got to the stairs first halting at the bend with jones directly behind him the stun grenades went one after the other tossed lightly just to clear the upstairs bannister there was more noise this time the crump of explosion and then the invisible sonic shiver which they all felt despite their protection there was hardly any pause as they raced on no confusion even here evans going for the farthest door with jones then bartlett then hinkler taking the bedrooms which had been assigned to them from the brochure details each door burst in with one experienced kick directed against the lock the house was deserted they all reassembled at the central corridor evans snapped on the light jerking the plugs from his ears theyve gone he said unnecessarily fuck it said jones we get paid hinkler grinned three minutes to search every room take anything that looks like proof said evans there was instant unargued unqueried obedience each bedroom and the downstairs area searched hurriedly but well marinetti and sneider remained at the shattered front door alert for any signal from melvin they darted away singly evans first to establish guard at the gate marinetti staying in position until last at the doorway reformed they filed back down the lane moving this time with less caution because they knew there would be no observation melvin rose from the ditch when they reached him looking inquiringly back along the line too late said evans they reached the van unchallenged driving back towards mulhouse with the rear interior light on so they could rub the nightblack from their faces and remove their dark overalls that was like jerking off in a whore house said melvin the man who liked to fight whoever owns that place is going to be mad as hell said marinetti we sure made a mess there would have been a lot more if theyd been there said evans it was not as big as the first farmhouse more a cottage this time but it was much farther away from any neighbouring houses or villages karen hadnt really been trying to measure but she guessed there had been a gap of about ten minutes from the time they had passed through the last sleeping township until they pulled off the road to the new location twice during the hurried departure azziz had been sick ashamed despite his fever at showing weakness in front of a woman the boy had been her first concern when they had arrived she had cleaned him again still careful to avoid any direct physical contact and had told one of the men to stay with him mopping him with cold towels it seemed to be working back at rixheim they didnt bother to manacle him to the bed anymore despite levys attempt to prevent it there was an inflamed ring of soreness around the boys ankle the house was stocked in readiness she and levy ate together off cold meat and wine and fruit afterwards without discussing it they both went to the same bedroom they undressed each other with the undiminished excitement of discovery and made love twice in quick succession as if aware that their relationship had a time limit not wanting to waste one second allocated to them this place was prepared just in case said karen the windows were newly barred like the farmhouse of course said levy everythings been anticipated by schoolmasters and settlers she nuzzled against him arm tight around his waist as if afraid he might try to escape underbergs no schoolmaster just a zionist who thinks like we do underberg she felt him tense slightly at disclosing the name almost at once he relaxed he brought us together said levy until then thered been no organization just a lot of people making a lot of noise but getting nowhere why did we have to leave in such a hurry underberg thought it best you mean theyd found out where we were it was several moments before levy replied then he said hes not sure but it was a possibility now it was karen who remained silent reminded of what was actually happening to her that it would have to end that there was a time limit love me again she said huskily quickly love me again they were trying to conceal the nervousness they had all felt at the abrupt departure but two empty wine bottles were evidence of the general unease our leader finds a different way to relax said leiberwitz maybe hes gone to bed said kahane loyally he has said leiberwitz with the whore hes stupid to get involved said the smallest man of the group mordechai sela was thin and bespectacled a schoolmaster like levy hes treating us like shit complained greening teteatete meals which were expected to serve like bloody underlings its not causing any problem is it said kahane not if hes just screwing her said the fifth man levi katz what does that mean said greening what happens if he becomes fond of her rebeccas my cousin said leiberwitz im expected to sit by while a man married to my cousin is rutting upstairs with some gentile whore what can we do about it said morris habel the last member of the group plenty said leiberwitz deaken had been so sure that he was going to get karen back he had rehearsed what he was going to say how he was going to care for her now he felt numbed and emptied it was absolutely clean said evans pouring himself a scotch there was no shake to his hand no indication that he laid his life on the line an hour earlier maybe began deaken and then stopped looking at the tie that evans had taken from his pocket and was offering to grearson yes said the older lawyer at once thats the ecole gagner colours the boys names inside said evans he turned to deaken what about this nervously like a man fearing contact with something contaminated deaken took the watch he felt his heart thump wildly and his throat constrict so that he found it difficult to speak immediately then he said yes thats karens watch so they left in a hurry said grearson evans shook his head everything had been tidied beds made the whole house the tie was carefully laid across one bed the watch in the middle of another you were meant to find it said grearson evans sipped his whisky thats the way it looked to me bastards said deaken certainly seem sure of themselves said evans how the hell could they have known said grearson maybe they figured youd work it out exactly as you did they know the resources youve got after all the american poured himself another drink the job was over and he was relaxing he offered the bottle to the two lawyers both shook their heads where are the others said grearson away said evans returning to his seat by midday tomorrow the inquiries into what happened at the farmhouse will have reached here we dont want them to find a vanload of weaponry where are they said grearson clermont ferrand why there id been there before said evans knew there was a hotel called foch we needed a contact point the man paused we did what we were engaged to do i know said grearson the terms stand dollars said evans everyone wants to be paid in cash american could you come back with us to monte carlo of course anger flickered through deaken they could have been discussing a property deal or buying a car anything but the botched attempt to recover a womanhis wifewho was enduring god knows what sort of horror but the anger seeped away as quickly as it had come what good would it have done to shout and to rage as if aware of deakens thoughts evans turned to him and said im sorry it didnt work out thank you for what you tried to do said deaken now he was behaving as rationally as them yes said grearson rather as an afterthought thank you mr azziz will be grateful do you want me to disband said evans there was a moments hesitation no said grearson not yet hang on awhile deaken frowned surely you dont think therell be another opportunity at this moment said grearson i dont know what to think it took underberg longer than expected to reach the cottage hidden away in the hills behind sisteron he misjudged the holiday traffic and the difficulty of overtaking on the narrow twisting roads as he climbed up from the coast underberg decided the farmhouse assault had been useful because it confirmed his prediction that the arab would fight and he doubted that azziz would capitulate after one failure azziz was a proud man used to unchallenged success he would be furious at what was happening and at his helplessness to do anything about it levy hurried from the house to meet him as soon as underberg turned off the rutted track into the villa the israeli was gravefaced have you heard the newscasts he demanded the moment underberg opened the door of course said underberg and seen the television pictures a trained assault force they said soldiers a trained force of soldiers its hardly surprising is it said underberg considering what azziz does for a living we never considered having to fight trained soldiers you didnt have to reminded underberg i got you out in good time levy grimaced and dont you intend confronting trained soldiers as soon as youve got the necessary weapons said underberg thats different said levy then well be ready you make it sound like some biblical confrontation lining up on either side of a valley in a way thats how we regard it christ they were stupid thought underberg his carefully prepared role allowed him to give a warning dont said underberg you should know better than to expect our people to fight by the rules the israelis fight to wintheyve got to well be ready when the time comes repeated levy but without conviction it was just that we didnt expect the other business i dont know how they discovered the place said underberg but theyll never find us here even i got lost levy smiled grimly where are they said underberg i did what you said locked them in their bedrooms both are on the other side of the house i know azziz is trying to cheat on us said underberg how i know insisted underberg im going to give him one more warning to make sure he does what we want if he doesnt well have to convince him what do you mean send him some evidence thats a little more tangible than a photograph no said levy at once the rejection surprised underberg what do you mean no were not butchers the plan was always that they wouldnt be hurt if we could help it are you prepared to give up your settlement you know the answer to that you cant fight without guns i wont consider cutting off an ear or a finger its repellent were not animals underberg looked beyond levy to the cottage there are others who are less squeamish no said levy although he knew underberg was right theyll fight like ill fight but they wont torture like you i hope it wont come to that as they walked towards the house underberg said hows the boys chill today he doesnt seem any worse he paused or better for that matter id still like to get some sort of medical attention you know thats quite impossible said underberg let the woman look after him shes doing what she can but shes not a doctor underberg stopped at the door do you want to risk another commando assault he said levy swallowed i suppose not then the boy stays as he is underberg went into the house the israelis were grouped in the main room like children awaiting the arrival of a headmaster whose fierceness they had been warned about in advance underberg reflected it was fortunate they would never get the chance to mount their ridiculous protest in israel they would be annihilated in a matter of hours everything is going to be fine he said just fine there was an observation room immediately above the larger stateroom where azziz had listened impassively to every detail of the abortive rescue attempt immediately after the meeting broke up deaken wandered up there padded seats ran in a halfcircle below the windows there was one low glasstopped table and the inevitable bar the bar was closed but deaken didnt want a drink he stood to starboard looking out towards monte carlo trying to isolate the blank glimmer of windows in the buildings over half a mile away wondering if behind one of them was the bastard who kept taunting him in that condescending mocking voice far below he heard the growl of the tender and then saw the craft emerge from the shadow of the yacht grearson and evans were standing side by side each holding on to the cabin roof apparently two relaxed guests going ashore from a millionaires yacht he supposed that within two hours evans would be driving northwards to clermont ferrand with an attache case packed with dollar bills the overwhelming sense of helplessness gripped him once more nearly another twentyfour hours before the next tenuous contact jesus he had to do something more he turned at the sound of the door opening carole was wearing scuff shoes very short shorts and a white cotton shirt tied at the waist hi she said hello can i come in why not her smile faltered momentarily she came and stood next to him at the window staring out towards the diminishing launch the girls were hoping the guy you came with was going to stay he looked evil i think he is said deaken mildly she was close enough for him to he aware of her light almost imperceptible perfume he was also conscious of her gaze but she didnt ask the question he expected instead she said everyones down by the pool they usually are why are you always so shitty i didnt know i was there was another sad smile wearily she said dont sit in judgement on me we all use what weve got the best we can ive got a body which know how to use and im good to look at yes he said she made a sowhat gesture and because know you can hardly stop yourself asking ill tell you i got myself into the best house in paris one where i choose i havent been doing it for long and i dont intend going on for much longer im not going to become a raddled old whore doing tenfranc tricks in back alleys im sorry he said forgive me she was wearing a light grey eye makeup that he didnt remember from their last meeting and a more definite lipstick why not relax she said im not here to relax we could just talk im not sure that it would stop there thats up to you this was absurd thought deaken what the hell was he doing talking like this to a whore no carole walked to the door if you change your mind you know where ill be three hundred miles to the northwest in the bedroom of a large cottage set among the encircling green hills of sisteron karen hurriedly stood up as the key moved in the lock what was that all about downstairs she asked a visitor levy said i thought it might have been she hesitated im glad she said insane isnt it deaken recognized that the contact had become routine almost like leaving home at a regular time to catch the regular train to the regular ninetofive job he didnt even glance at the approaching shoreline a commuter and therefore bored with the landscape but back over the stern of the tender seeing the wake cream behind it and then the figure at the rail of the retreating yacht it was carole he knew he had seen her as he descended the steps but pretended not to and she hadnt called out either to attract his attention her apparent interest in him had to be strictly professional like the solicitous secretary and the solicitous stewards and why did it matter anyway for her attitude to be important to him under the present circumstances would be grotesque unthinkable so why was he looking back to catch a glimpse of her in no time they were among the outer yachts able because of their draught to get in close all about him there was the creak and tinkle of mooring ropes and stanchions and fantails occupied by people relaxing and laughing and drinking or eating safe people secure and untroubled lucky people the alarm flared the moment deaken set foot on the jetty and saw the designated telephone box was occupied by a woman too old for the shorts and the sagging halter top eyes cavernous from too much mascara cheeks ablaze with rouge lips wounded by scarlet lipstick he checked his watch five minutestime enough enormous sunglasses like screens on stilts were collapsed alongside her purse which gaped open at the coin pouch for her to stuff more money into the box she laughed turning as she did so her teeth were white and even and precise a graded monument to mathematical dentistry her brow wrinkled at his hovering presence and she looked pointedly at the unoccupied booths then she turned hunching her shoulders against him her back was deeply tanned wrinkled by overexposure to too much sun two minutes left hag deaken thought ugly bloody hag he looked worriedly about him knowing that he was being observed and hoping that underberg could see what was happening and allow him some leeway jesus why didnt she hurry from a yacht against the harbour wall there was a burst of laughter followed by shrieks of alarm as a drunken man teetered theatrically grabbing a stern stanchion to prevent himself falling into the water christ how he hated them with their comfort and complacency and their wealth at once his rational mind cut through the panic that was a ridiculous thought infantile they had every right to their money and their privilege to laugh and drink and flirt and do what they wanted his anger wasnt at them the woman had put down the receiver deaken thrust forward before she had time to get out there were other kiosks she began but deaken pushed past her bastard she muttered her australian accent made the oath sound more effective deaken pulled the door shut bastard came the muffled repetition through the glass he kept his back to her five past twelve please dear god dont make me wait another four hours he thought the booth reeked of the woman of her body of suntan oil and a heavy cloying perfume under the glare of the midday sun the trapped air felt sticky and unpleasant he put the recorder on the tiny support and realized he had begun to read the english translation of the dialling instructions for overseas calls he stopped annoyed with himself and not knowing why ten past he looked out of the kiosk the woman was stumping away along the walkway on top of one of the embracing arms of the harbour her fat buttocks wobbling with every gallumphing footstep bloody hag he thought again the telephone rang deaken looked disbelievingly at it and then grabbed the instrument to his ear im glad you waited said the voice im glad you did thought deaken he remembered the recorder squeezing the suction cap into place didnt have much choice he said i told you what would happen to your wife if you werent careful about what azziz did said underberg you let him raise an army i didnt know lied deaken you were supposed to know just as you were supposed to know everything he plans to do deaken felt sick deep in his stomach what else two days ago you told me about the bellicose lied to me about it i didnt lie do you know what lloyds of london is mr deaken without waiting for the lawyer to reply underberg said its the most efficient maritime brokerage and insurance firm throughout the world part of that efficiency involves knowing the position of ships insured by them you told me the bellicose had been turned aroun gave me timings id already checked with lloyds when you told me the freighter was heading northwards it was still going south down the coast of africa it still is as a matter of fact lloyds dont make mistakes in their plotting they cant afford toany more than you can the ship has never been turned azziz was a bastard thought deaken a stupid lying bastard he said started deaken but underberg cut him off impatient with the excuses i told you not to believe what he said i told you to make sure that everything was done exactly as i wanted it otherwise your wife would suffer where is she now underberg laughed miles away from where your action men did their number he said i had them out within two hours of realizing you were lying about the ship changing course guessed youd found out where they were and were playing for time so that was how it happened thought deaken he said is she all right did you get her watch and azzizs tie i asked you if she was all right for the moment said underberg but only for the moment i want you to understand and more importantly i want azziz to understand that im becoming more and more irritated by whats happening if that ship isnt turned back and directed exactly how i want it to be then next time you and he will get a more unpleasant reminder of what we can do to them would you want your wife to lose a finger mr deaken or an ear wait said deaken desperately dont do that theres no need to do anything like that i promise you from now on everything will be done exactly as you want it dont deakens mind blocked at the thought then this time get it right said underberg what do you want me to do make sure this tedious lying stops said underberg on saturday the bellicose docks at dakar i want you to be there in person i want you to board and i want you to be responsible for messages back to the levcos offices in greece giving the precise longitudinal and latitudinal fix and if i dont think its right and lloyds dont think its right or if the slightest thing happens to make me suspicious to make me think you intend using your private army again then your wife loses a finger and the boy a finger then an ear thats the price mr deaken a piece of their bodies for every mistake you make do you understand that yes said deaken dully i understand is that recorder working properly yes said deaken good because i want azziz to get the proper message i want him to hear everything ive said and to believe it where do you want the freighter to go with the position give levcos the speed so i can estimate your arrival back in the mediterranean make a refuelling stop in algiers youll be told what to do then in a cable addressed to you on the ship whatever he tried to do he remained a puppet controlled by the twists and jerks of this mans fingers thought deaken all right he said no more attempts to be clever there wont be your wifes too attractive deaken felt the sickness rise and swallowed against it dont hurt her he pleaded again whether she or the boy gets hurt depends upon you and azziz dont forget that for a moment wont position and speed insisted the man yes said the lawyer and warn azziz against trying to trace the contact calls to the levcos officetheyll be from a public box so hell be wasting his time what about this contact said deaken azziz has got a man grearson he could maintain it there was a hesitation from the other end of the telephone the same time agreed underberg every other day deaken felt relief that the link wasnt being severed every other day he repeated as if underberg would need the confirmation no more stupidity said underberg dont make your wife suffer deaken maintained his control with difficulty while they listened to the recording but as grearson leaned forward to stop the tape he could restrain himself no longer you idiotic bastard he shouted at azziz the attack seemed to take both the other men by surprise azziz recovered first no one speaks to me i do interrupted deaken its my wife youre putting at risk and your son what the hell sort of man are you willing to risk his child like that are you mad dont you see what youve done azzizs face was composed like a mask but on either cheek tiny patches of white pinched his features having located the farmhouse we had to take our chance he said his voice was flat expressionless we didnt know about the farmhouse when i went ashore to tell him about the boat said deaken furiously when you promised me it had been turned back it was a lie and you knew it deaken walked over to azziz we cant take any more chances he said his voice calmer i dont want to be here on this fucking yacht i dont want your hospitality i dont want to have anything to do with you i want to be home in geneva with my wife safely deaken stopped breathlessly i think youre a stupid bastard i think youre forgetting yourself said grearson coming to his employers defence im not forgetting anything said deaken im not forgetting the lies or what it might cost karen he indicated the silent taperecorder and im particularly not forgetting that if you hadnt behaved like such bloody fools and kept that ship going they wouldnt have become suspicious and cleared the farmhouse wed have them both back by now most of all i cant forget that it was a mistake said azziz in rare confession its the last one were allowed said deaken the boy lay limp with exhaustion against the pillows but the constant sheen of perspiration had gone so karen assumed the fever was over tewfik forced himself to reach out for the flannel and then the towel reluctant to be washed by her gratefully karen surrendered them how are you feeling she said not very strong he said slumping against the support and handing back the washing things whats been wrong with me i dont know i ache said azziz i ache all over youve not eaten anything for a long time said karen ill bring you something thank you said azziz for what youve done i mean i know how youve looked after me i appreciate it he hadnt been aware of her reluctance any more than the others had realized karen thankfully thats all right she said why did we have to move your father discovered the first place she wondered if richard had been involved it hadnt occurred to her until now very little about richard had occurred to her in the last few days and she didnt feel any remorse tewfik smiled wanly i knew he would said the boy proudly theyll be sorry for what theyve done yes she said uncomfortably theyre bastards arent they demanded the boy this time her hesitation was longer bastards she agreed at last knowing she had to the response from africa to their request for a delivery delay arrived thirty minutes after deaken had left the stateroom the call was routed through paris and for better reception grearson went up to the communications room it was a short conversation makimber says no reported the american lawyer as he reentered the stateroom it seems underberg is right makimber insists theyre necessary for a specific date its got to be the contracted time thats a pity said azziz his anger at the confrontation with deaken had goneanger was wasteful and azziz never wasted anything grearson appeared surprised at the calm reaction so we give deaken all the authority he wants to turn the ship back azziz didnt reply at once then he said how about the second shipment ready for loading the arab smiled what does underberg want the bellicose turned back a ship apparently turned back azziz said what if a vessel looking like the bellicose and loaded like the bellicose made the algeria rendezvous it wont work said grearson the instructions are that deaken sails with the bellicose and reports its position with independent checks from lloyds and where do you suppose hell get the position readings from the navigating officers and the captain exactly said azziz at first light tomorrow we get rid of the damned deaken for good i want you to go to athens see the levcos people and make whatever deal is necessary i want the bellicose to sail from dakar out of sight of land but to continue southwards but i want calculations given to deaken showing that its travelling in the opposite direction and those are the ones i want the ship and levcos to transmit to lloyds but surely even he can work out where the sun comes up said grearson hell know hes going the wrong way so what said azziz theres nothing he can do hell have to go along with it youre doing the negotiations now without any involvement from that fool well agree to an exchange well agree on times and places and whatever else they want when we get tewfik they can have the ship and its contents just like that said grearson doubtfully no said azziz smiling again at his lawyers surprise not quite your excellent soldiers will be on board if i submit once to terrorism then it will never stopthats a worthwhile lesson to be learned from the israelis what about the woman asked grearson as an afterthought i couldnt care less what happens to her said azziz any more than i care what happens to deaken the sun disappeared finally and reluctantly underberg moved in from the balcony of the monaco hotel he was sure they would move quickly after the threat to hurt the boy and the woman he would have to warn makimber to give him time to get to dakar and prevent deaken getting aboard the bellicose he would have to remember an appropriate time to remind the african of a favour owed everything was arranged with the customary efficiency of azzizs organization the helicopter connection to the airport courteous airline officials on standby to escort deaken to the waiting aircraft stewards in readiness to show him to his seat it was a direct flight with no transfer connections and deaken arrived in the senegalese capital just after midday the heat took his breath away the first reminder of a return to africa at once there were others the forgotten sweetsour odour flies which thrive in it lethargic people accustomed to the sunslowed pace colours seemingly bleached yellows and ochres the white of the airport building harsh in comparison the airport taxi was a dilapidated renault with missing handles and sagging door linings the dashboard and mirror surrounds a bazaar of dangling amulets and rosaries as if its very survival depended upon the will of god the legacy of the citys importance during the french occupation of africa continued as they entered dakar the wide straight streets were still policed by mottletrunked plane trees attendants to the setback villas two and sometimes threestorey shuttered and square and imposing monuments to vanished imperial power only occasionally were the sculpted patterned gardens still tended elsewhere was the tangle of neglect deaken chose a hotel near the harbour still with almost twentyfour hours before the bellicose was due to dock but wanting to be as near as possible it was terraced between groundfloor shops and offices above with wooden fronting verandahs on the first and second floors and wooden steps leading up to the entrance the streetlevel verandah had highbacked wicker chairs glasstopped tables and yellow ashtrays recommending pernod geckos glued to the walls like ornaments would suddenly dart at the speed of a blink in pursuit of insects deaken took a room at the front in order to keep the harbour in sight it was frenchbuilt like everything else with docks and stifffingered jetties and long sheds bracketing the wharves beyond the huge fan of water was flat and polished cupped in the protective grasp of cape verde and goree island cargo ships and freighters rusting and middleaged like cargo ships and freighters always are were tethered to their berths beneath highnecked peering cranes anchored off were two oil tankers heavy in the water like logs with straying branches a working place thought deaken no sparkling burnished yachts with tinkling rigging and back decks full of topless sunbathers and laughing holidaymakers after the last few days it was like retreating through the looking glass into the real world deaken was impatient to establish contact with the agent to whom he had letters of introduction and authority but he knew there would be no work going on at this the hottest part of the day to pass the time he descended to the ground floor and located to the right of the reception area a zinctopped bar with stools and beyond it sets of tables with curvebacked chairs there were five three of which were occupied there were more yellow ashtrays which prompted deaken to order pastis remembering he was in africa he mixed it with mineral water refusing the grubby carafe that was offered to him the pernod here was weak and already watered at the far end of the bar where it abutted the wall was a gaggle of black whores they stirred at his arrival and one detached herself from the group smiling as she sidled towards him deaken raised his hand and shook his head he thought the girl seemed almost grateful to go back to her lunchtime gathering he wondered what carole was doing he tried to hurry the question from his mind the idea of carole was intrusive and distracting she had no place in his thoughts he supposed when everything was over that he would see azziz again briefly but he would not be trapped on board the yacht not like before so he wouldnt be seeing her again ever good he thought very good that was as it should be he was still ashamed at how he had felt nervous too there was only room for one thought with no distraction karen was all that mattered karen and how they were going to start again dejeuner inquired the barman hopefully even he made the effort to maintain a french ambience the muchstained shirt originally white the black trousers threadbare and a money pouch at the belt the pouch was flat and empty non merci said deaken it was going to be a long wait not just until the bellicose arrived but afterwards days he guessed going back up around the fat chest of africa and into the mediterranean and not over even then there would be underbergs instructions to comply with more delay he took a second pernod conscious of the barmens flat pouch and leaving a larger tip than before the girl encouraged by her friends made a second desultory attempt he didnt see her approach so she had her arm through his and was inquiring in lisping french if he was lonely before he could make the second refusal he sent her back with a brandy unsure why he had made the gesture she would probably despise him for it there was laughter from along the bar she raised the glass and he raised his in return behind the bar the waiter remained blankfaced and unimpressed deaken telephoned for directions and to ensure that the agent was back at work and then emerged out onto the harbourfronting boulevard the place had that stickyeyed just awake feeling a stretching taxi driver took him along the curve of the sea and then briefly away from the waterfront into one of the roads that radiated from it like spokes there was a fleeting impression of dejavu and then deaken remembered ortegas office in lisbon only four days earlier he thought or was it five it seemed a lifetime the levcos agent was a man named henri carre a mulatto who had clung to his french parentage he was a thin finefeatured man with a high forehead of which he appeared constantly aware running his hand persistently across it and up into his crinkled hair one wall of the mans office was occupied by an erasable plasticized chart inscribed with the names of the ships for which he was responsible sectioned so that it showed the departure port stops en route and estimated time of arrival at dakar deaken saw that the bellicose was scheduled to arrive at dawn on saturday and that the panel allowed for possible delay was blank carre studied deakens letter of authority and then revealing the bureaucratic caution bred into people who had been colonized asked to see deakens passport dutifully the lawyer produced it carre placed it beside the letter apparently to compare the name and then looked up nodding with satisfaction it is an honour for me to meet you he said in stiffly formalized french i am sorry for the intrusion deaken was equally polite im asked to give you every help said carre pointing to the letter of authority the arrival is still scheduled for saturday the senegalese nodded what berth the man made a vague gesture towards the harbour from the window it was just possible to see a wedge of water undecided yet he said as if imagining he were being checked out by a carrier he added quickly it will be a good berth one of the best im sure said deaken whats the period in port just revictualling fuelling if necessary said carre deaken said im taking passage aboard carre frowned its a freighter he said therell be some sort of accommodation said deaken it hadnt occurred to him until now it didnt matter do you want me to radio the ship asked carre eager to show his efficiency deaken shook his head all thats being done from athens he said theyll be expecting me when they dock theres no problem i hope carre was unable to withhold the question any longer none its never happened before deaken was concerned at the mans curiosity carre had his local position to protect people in authority to appease his inquisitiveness could get the bloody cargo impounded quickly he said its an important shipment it was thought best for me to be personally aboard for the last stage of the voyage youve the ongoing orders then said carre damn thought deaken he said theyre being sent separately from athens there is a change in routing damn deaken thought again no he said it remains according to the original contract ive been the agent for levcos shipping for a number of years said carre pompously and they are most complimentary about your efficiency and ability improvised deaken in this particular instance theyve decided to invest us with the responsibility its no reflection upon you no reflection at all carre relaxed slightly ill need to know victualling and fuelling requirements he said maximum said deaken this man did not know what the cargo was nor its original destination so the indication of a long uninterrupted return passage didnt matter ill put it in hand said carre i dont imagine youll want to be in port longer than necessary no agreed deaken as quick a turnaround as possible what information should i give the customs authorities said the agent hes pushing hard thought deaken itll be a bonded shipment travelling in transit carre looked down to a duplicate of the manifest already fixed to a clipboard machine parts he read he looked up machine parts were important enough for you to be sent to accompany them yes carree waited appearing to expect deaken to elaborate when he didnt the agent said ill need to know where youre staying in case theres any change in the arrival times the royale there are far better hotels carre frowned i could have recommended some i chose it by chance said deaken i didnt want to trouble you more than necessary its quite adequate is there anything else i can do to help he offered his card no really said deaken accepting the square of pasteboard im most grateful to you he rose extending his hand carre stood and shook it anything assured the agent just call had deaken inquired from the airport carre would have suggested he stay at the teranga hotel although after their meeting he would have considered it inconvenient the agent allowed the lawyer ten minutes after leaving his office standing at the window to watch him walk down the spur road back towards the waterfront then he dialled the number makimber was in his room and agreed immediately to a meeting the african was waiting in the reception area when carre arrived pulling him at once towards the far corner of the lounge away from the entrance makimber sat forward arms against his knees head down looking at the floor as carre recounted his meeting with the lawyer only occasionally halting him with a question did you get the impression that the destination had been changed none said carre the relayed message that morning from angola about deakens arrival had really made his cultivation of this man unnecessary reflected makimber but he still didnt consider it wasted it provided confirmation and the knowledge of where the man was staying it had been a sensible precaution to come to dakar and to bring people with him even if they were thugs the authority was definitely from the eklon corporation carre nodded as full and complete charterers of the ship i suppose theyve the right perhaps it had been a mistake to attempt independence at this stage thought makimber at least the angolan message indicated that the friendship was still intact azziz was a bastard attempting to delay the shipment makimber supposed there had been a higher offer for what the bellicose carried he hoped the arab would rot in hell for what he had tried to do it was gratifying to be able to defeat him it is a problem asked carre gauging the other mans concern it could be im glad we became friends if ive helped to resolve it said the senegalese makimber smiled i shall be properly grateful believe me he said what time does the bellicose arrive five in the morning maximum provisioning and fuelling thats what he said he was alone carre shrugged i dont know he appeared to be if the bellicose arrives as scheduled and the handling starts right away what time could the ship sail carre turned down the corners of his mouth making the calculation around noon i suppose it was a long time too long but he would have to do it makimber took a sealed envelope from his pocket and handed it across the table to the other man carre accepted it feeling its thickness between his fingers knowing that the senegalese could increase its value by a third again on blackmarket currency dealing makimber said i told you i would be properly grateful theres a thousand dollars in american currency there was a moment of shocked surprise before carre grinned in open excitement thank you he said thank you very much theres more said makimber he felt like a fisherman landing a catch what must i do tell me everything that happens no matter how small or insignificant it seems carre nodded eagerly and do what i say tomorrow while the ships in port i dont want the captain becoming suspicious thinking anything is unusual in fact until he sails what about deaken hes going to miss the ship said makimber andreas levcos was a man who had spent his life transporting the unquestioned for the questionable and grown rich from his discretion a portly shiny man with oiled hair which gleamed and a silk suit which shone too from the light shafting in from the window he showed neither surprise nor curiosity as grearson outlined what they wanted done levcos wore sunglasses even though they were indoors not against the glare but simply because he always wore them you want the man given a northerly course but for the ship to continue southwards it was important to extract some logic from the frequent illogicality the false positions must always come from the master what about sunrise and sunset said levcos surely hell realize whats really happening once hes at sea hell be trapped it doesnt matter said grearson doesnt he work for you no said grearson positively levcoss office was in athenss port of piraeus it overlooked the ferry terminals and from the window it was possible to see the hydrofoils scurrying to the greek islands skittering away like water insects not breaking the surface tension of a pond whats the true destination from his briefcase grearson took a copy of makimbers last cable benguela he said the bellicose is to anchor ten miles off and wait for contact on the thirteenth all information about the delay request and makimbers refusal had been erased so grearson offered the paper across to the greek shipowner heres the positional fix and the recognition signal victory frowned levcos reading the call sign our clients are frequently given to theatricals do you want me to inform our people in dakar are they staff levcos shook his head agents then i dont think so said grearson lets restrict it to the captain it would be best agreed levcos and the other ship to remain in marseilles until its necessary to cross to algiers to coordinate with the supposed arrival there of the bellicose the lawyer hesitated coming to the most difficult part of the meeting and we would like to sail from marseilles with some of our people aboard grearson wondered what reaction showed in the mans eyes hidden behind the glasses the face remained blank what for demanded the greek to protect the cargo there could be trouble its possible the american knew levcos was too professional to accept anything more than the basic minimum of lying i could not afford difficulties within the mediterranean said levcos it is not illegal insisted grearson everything being carried has a valid enduser certificate issued to a registered dealer in portugal their purpose aboard will be only to protect the cargo as an afterthought he added and the ship of course this is extremely unusual said levcos grearson looked momentarily towards the busy harbour accepting that negotiations had begun we understand that he said it was like one of the bicycle races so popular on french television where the contestants hovered and manoeuvred reluctant to be the forerunner a ship is a valuable property said levcos of course said grearson at the moment neither wheel was in front of the other levcos made the pretence of looking through the papers before him as if information on the second freighter was available grearson was sure it wasnt the greek was an accomplished rider purchase price was said levcos grearson estimated an exaggeration of at least he didnt have time to check and argue hed been wrong to criticize deaken for his difficulty in confronting the telephone demands now he was in exactly the same position wobbling behind for which im sure youre insured he said there are exclusions said levcos it would be a difficult claim to pursue if my assumptions are right about the problems you might encounter as charterers were insured our indemnity would extend to include any damage to the carrying vehicle grearson sought assistance from legality levcos shook his head a gesture of sadness perfectly rehearsed i dont think weve met that this conversation ever took place he said so levcos was absolved from any foreknowledge of what might happen recognized grearson there was an intellectual stimulation in dealing with the other man what is it you seek mr levcos a bonded commitment said the greek backdated cover personally liable against eklon corporation from the date of the second charter in what sum levcos smiled again that practised expression of regret for the full purchase price of course no charterer would agree to such a commitment of course not agreed levcos no normal charterer that is he had just got a puncture decided grearson it was becoming a bumpy ride suppose i could provide such an undertaking contractually pressed levcos yes insurance is against misfortune the greek could smell an advantage like a shark detecting blood in water agreed grearson said which we hope will never befall us yes id like there to be a fuller understanding between us said the shipowner about what the american knew it wasnt even a race anymore future association ive already made it clear how grateful we are for your understanding said grearson youll naturally be a shipper of whom well think for a seaborne consignment again there was the sad smile and grearson decided that of all the artificiality that annoyed him most of all theres often a wide gap between thoughts and application said levcos what sort of contract would you seek said grearson in full retreat three consignments said levcos two said grearson minimum of twomonth charter on each grearson sighed agreed he said this time the smile was of complete satisfaction i can guarantee that your man aboard the bellicose wont have the slightest idea whats happeningand that the rendezvous will be kept on the thirteenth thank you said grearson there was little for which he had to be grateful what about this man deaken said levcos hell realize then that hes been duped we dont give a damn said grearson karen hadnt purposely approached quietly but levy hadnt heard her she stood in the doorway surprised at the slowness with which he wrote a purposeful careful formation of letters with frequent stops to consider the words twice he scrubbed out a halfcompleted idea and started again she felt consumed with love for him azziz is going to get up later she said not wanting to spy on him the israeli jumped instinctively he moved to cover what he was doing then relaxed back in his chair im writing to rebecca he said yes she had guessed that was what he was doing she worries by herself with the children yes she said again she had no right to be jealous do you miss her i miss the children i didnt ask about the children i asked about rebecca he looked steadily at her yes he said miss her im glad you didnt lie youd have known if id tried thank you just the same i love you he said i think i love you too she said levy folded the letter with the care with which he had been writing it and sealed it in an envelope ive told her i hope to see her soon do you yes he said then immediately no he shrugged i dont know whats going to happen to us she said god knows deaken was resigned to another long wait but tonight there wasnt the frustration of the previous days he was in a position at last to influence things and by this time tomorrow he would be doing exactly that aboard the bellicose already at sea and already heading northwards how long to get to algiers it would depend upon the weather he supposed carre would have had a forecast for the next two or three days at least damn deaken looked at the antiquated clock behind the bar seven thirty it probably wasnt accurate but even so carre wouldnt be in his office now it would have to wait until tomorrow the bellicose information would be more up to date anyway he watched two geckos on the wall near the clock converging upon an unsuspecting insect with highelbowed sticklike legs they pounced simultaneously colliding with each other with annoyed scratching sounds and the insect escaped deaken was glad the barman brought him a second pastis the last he decided something to eat and then bed he wanted to be up before dawn to be waiting on the quayside when the freighter came alongside the hopeful whores were still encamped at the far end of the bar the one for whom he had bought brandy smiled an acknowledgement rather than a proposition and deaken smiled back she was missing two teeth in the front he saw three of the girls were negotiating with a couple of seamen and a third bespectacled man in a cheap crumpled suit dockyard clerk deaken guessed he looked back to the girls couldnt be much of a living certainly not enough to spend on dentistry the unfulfilled smile came again inquiringly this time and deaken looked away not wanting her to misunderstand from where he sat deaken could see into the eating area a beadcurtained annexe of harbour and dock people all chewing stolidly none of the bar girls had bothered with an expedition so deaken guessed they were all unresponsive regulars he didnt want to eat there he decided but where there should be good fish in a place like this something else carre could have recommended deaken settled the bill and walked out through the reception area pausing at the top of the steps with the lower balcony to his left a few of the tables were occupied the occupants curiously ill defined in the dull illumination from the overhead skein of bulbs which trailed around the outer edge like decorations on a christmas tree long after the celebrations were over deaken paused at the top of the steps staring out towards the waterfront far away at the very tip of the harbour curve there was the yellow glow of nightwork and nearer the rusting freighters he had seen earlier the heavy blackness of their superstructure picked out with an occasional haphazard light deaken gazed around for a taxi the perimeter road was quiet and dark sleeping in the parked car on the opposite side of the road makimber smiled and said no problem to the two men with him there might have been if deaken had remained in the hotel the african hadnt really worked out how to resolve it apart from the luring the man away with some phoney message apparently from carre he was glad he hadnt had to bother he didnt want to involve the senegalese any more than he had to although hed decided the man should be sacrificed if necessary as deaken walked down the steps the two men makimber had positioned at separate tables deep in the gloom of the balcony waved for their bills paid immediately and got up to follow deaken had forgotten the heat of africa the wraparound blanket warmth even at night he felt the perspiration prick out on his skin and looked around forlornly again for a taxi he went to his right trying to orient himself sea to his left city to his right only the continuation of the dock area immediately ahead the cathedral and the pasteur institute he thought thats where the cafes and restaurants would be nearer the centre of town there was a stepladder of lanes and alleys climbing from the docks to the top of the city deaken turned right again sure of his direction now this was the daytime part of the city a place of warehouses and offices with only the occasional surprise of a bar to break the deserted nighttime loneliness the street lighting was careless twice people were practically upon him before he detected their presence makimbers car nosed into the alley two hundred yards behind it was only using sidelights so they couldnt see the two men who had followed deaken from the balcony of the royale makimber knew they would be in place i dont want him killed unless theres no other way said makimber it was a frequently repeated warning since his meeting with carre he supposed he should go the whole way with them to ensure they obeyed but it was more important for him to remain in dakar and ensure the freighter was safely on its way we know said the man in the back seat make sure you remember makimber said there was a snow line of white teeth in a smile but the man said nothing makimber hoped too many people hadnt acquired a taste for killing it had been an isolated problem after zimbabwes independence he remembered at the end of the road a long way off deaken could make out the brightness of the city the light at the end of the tunnel he thought recalling the familiar phrase the vietnam promise of victory parroted by the commanders in saigon and the politicians in washington vietnam had been the period of his most active radicalism the breaking point with his family he had told karen it didnt matter being disowned by them but it wasnt true it made him feel rootless belonging nowhere he felt the anger build up at the memory of south africa the convoluted logic was typical of the fascist bastards employing terrorism to combat what they regarded as even worse terrorism but he believed underberg that his father wasnt involved his father might be a nationalist and support apartheid as well as embracing every concept and policy which was anathema to deaken but he wouldnt have resorted to this deaken had known operations like this beforeand represented people caught up in themcovert schemes dreamed up by the bureau of state security renamed the department of national security after boss had earned the reputation of being as repressive as the security organizations of russia and the south american banana republics he wouldnt let them get away with it he would go along with everything they said now he had no choice but when he got karen back he would expose the whole business he was strong enough now to face the publicity to put himself back in the limelight from which he had temporarily fled now the running was over before this ended people would be fleeing from him deaken was never fully to know what happened his memory was simply of a flurry of sounds not really distinguishable as running feet a confused imagery of peoplehe didnt know how manyand then a blinding aching pain as he was struck repeatedly first along the side of the head when he instinctively drew back and then somewhere at the base of his skull causing a hurt that made him feel sick before almost immediate black unconsciousness it was too deep for him to feel the last needless blow across his shoulders makimbers car was alongside when it happened he saw the man pull up to bring the baton down for another crushing blow and shouted for him to stop there was a hesitation and for a moment makimber didnt think the man was going to obey i said stop the club was lowered reluctantly get him into the car said the african the man who had travelled with him in the rear got out to help the other two hump deakens flopping body inside near the door sill they dropped him hard against the road and two of them giggled get him in hissed makimber one went round the other side of the vehicle to lean across to pull deaken from the other two they were careless of bumping him against the car stretching his body lengthwise across the floor in the back over the transmission tunnel they scrambled in after him sitting with their feet resting on his back and legs it had seemed a long time but the car accelerated away down the gloomy road within two minutes of deaken being clubbed down having reached the brighter part of town the driver turned right then right again to disappear into the darkness of the waterfront makimber remained screwed around in his seat alert for any pursuit if he were to be detained and implicated in the assault then everything would be ruined there were vehicles behind but none taking any particular interest in them makimber exhaled slowly not wanting the others in the car to be aware of his concern he was the bwana mkubwa the big man he was not supposed to be frightened they had been in the senegalese capital for a week with the opportunity to learn its basic layout and the driver steered the car carefully into the delivery bay alongside one of the waterfront warehouses it was a dark secluded place bordered on three sides by blank empty buildings makimber still raised his hand to caution against any movement staring around the car to ensure they werent observed then he gestured for them to turn deaken over the lawyer groaned an involuntary sound as the air was forced out of his body by the manhandling makimber leaned over the seat he found the south african passport in the lefthand inside pocket operating the interior light to examine it briefly snorting contemptuously he replaced it going to the other inside pocket it was there he found the envelope addressed to captain erlander he broke it open and turned in the seat with the paper held close beneath the light wanting to read every word in his anger makimber slapped the face of the unconscious man deakens head twisted away under the force of the blow and makimber regretted it at once he wasnt a savage makimber had found what he wanted obtained his confirmation but he went carefully through deakens pockets for anything further about the bellicose and its cargo but that was it he snapped the inside light off not wanting to attract attention to the vehicle tell me what youve got to do he demanded from the men in the car anxious there should be no mistakes haltingly one prompting the other they went through the disposal procedure that makimber had patiently rehearsed with them throughout the afternoon far beyond kaolack insisted makimber far beyond kaolack recited the driver first closely followed by one of the men in the rear makimber felt the tug of unease at their getting it completely right is he a bad man very bad said makimber swine he thought again take me back he said to the driver it was only a short journey to the place de union and the hotel teranga makimber stopped the car before they reached it and got out there was a possibility of a road check nearly all the way to tambacounda he leaned in through the window from inside the car came movements and grunts of understanding makimber stood in the road and watched the taillights out of sight on his way to the hotel he tightened his arm against his chest feeling inside his jacket for the bulk of the envelope he intended shortly to destroy there were times as a moslem that he regretted the teachings of the koran makimber had spent most of his adult life in the west and would liked to have celebrated the odd special occasion with alcohol tonight was certainly a special occasionhe had averted a catastrophe the bellicose had picked up a following current and the headwind had dropped so they reached the shelter of goree island four hours before they were scheduled to dock knowing that no port facilities would be available until their arranged arrival captain erlander anchored off using the shore lee for protection in case the calm weather changed during the remainder of the night he let edmunson complete the final anchoring because the cable from athens was a long one and he didnt want to misunderstand it he had been reading steadily for fifteen minutes when the first officer came into his room they had sailed together for four years but edmunson never took advantage he waited until erlander suggested a drink then poured for both of them as the first officer brought the vodka to him erlander proffered the athens cable and said what do you think of that erlander had almost completed his drink before the first officer finished reading what sort of bloody stupidity is that demanded edmunson erlander shrugged ive queried it hours ago there was a repeat identical to the first were to take on a man and make him believe were taking a northerly course and all the while go south to benguela and anchor ten miles off on the thirteenth which means this trip could end nastily this time it was eriander who filled the glasses thats what i think he looked through the porthole towards the yellow and orange smoulder of dakar on the shoreline wonder who the poor bugger is ashore the car carrying deaken had already made its northerly diversion and passed through thies and was on its way towards diourbel one of the men tried to kick at deaken the space was too restricted in the back of the vehicle so he jabbed down viciously with his heel feeling the body jerk with the impact what shall we do with him asked the driver intent upon the unlighted road ahead kill him came the reply the pain pierced deakens unconsciousness then agonizingly engulfed his whole body he didnt movecouldnt movebecause of the hurt there was something hardraisedbeneath his stomach bending him dust a lot of dust more than dust road dirt gritting into his face and nose a stale dried odour the smell grew of people and oil and petrol like the earlier pain the realization came in a rush a car he was on the floor of a car face down nose and mouth ground into the carpet people had their feet on him several people one place worse than the rest a foot jabbing at him in some sort of relentless pattern again and again in the same spot the control came he didnt know how through the whirl of impressions the first thought was against movement to alert them made easy because his body was afire against the slightest jar he tried to remember but couldnt just the darkness of the alley something about vietnam and then sounds sounds and then the awfulness of something clubbing into his head terrible pain not as terrible as now though not an ordinary backstreet mugging otherwise he wouldnt be face down in a car being taken to god knows where hed have woken up in the same alley everything gone even his clothes what then the pain coiled around him band after band preventing coherent thought from above seeming sometimes far away and sometimes close came the blur of conversation and deaken forced himself to concentrate straining for the words he had breached the segregation even as a child when his mind had been most receptive to languages and he had managed a smattering of a lot of african tongues none perfect or even extensive but sufficient for daytoday communication they werent speaking bantu or zulu either or shona swahili the recognition settled without any satisfaction because it was not one of the swahili dialects he understood he was picking up isolated words even those flattened against positive identification the speed with which they were talking made it more difficult because they were arguing deaken recognized mtu mkorofi bad man repeated several times nearly always it seemed answered by reference to bwana mkubwa their leader the bwana mkubwa had told them something given an order taratibu but they couldnt agree over it every time mtu mkorofi came there was the repeated relentless kick and deaken was in no doubt he was the one they were referring to several times there was the word kaolack and then deaken remembered the airline map he had studied during the flight from nice recalling the senegal placename his memory was of it being somewhere far inland dust and fumes crowded into his nose and throat and he wanted to cough against them he managed to suppress the need guessing there would be a renewed attack if they suspected he was recovering why was he mtu mkorofi why had he been attacked at all it didnt make sense if only the pain would go away lessen at least so that he could think straight mtu mkorofi came again like a taunt then another kick abruptly so suddenly that he was rolled forward against the rear of the front seats the vehicle stopped he felt it skid as the brakes locked and then because he was against it he felt the driver twist in his seat to continue the dispute without the distraction of navigating gradually deaken picked up one particular word uncertainly at first and then positively it came from the man who kept kicking him he was sure just as he was sure what the word was despite the variation of dialect in swahili kuua meant to kill the pain was pushed aside by a new feeling the numbness of terror deaken tasted the vomit acid in his throat he thought he had shuddered a physical movement they might have felt but couldnt be certain he waited for the sounds above to lessen with their awareness of his recovery they shouted on almost as if they were unaware he was in the car with them as immediate as the terror the calmness came a bizarre sensation of serenity which he knew wasnt serenity at all but the approach of some sort of hysteria deaken still tried to hold the feeling wanting the detachment whatever its cause there was nothing he could do not thrust face down underfoot and boxed within a car it was a logical calculating thought not one of despair he had one small advantage they didnt know he was conscious listening to everything the shouting frenzy above subsided into a repetitive exchange of words there was only a solitary voice saying bwana mkubwa now met by a chorus of mtu mkorofi and a new expression one he missed at first and belatedly snatched for recognizing the phonetic similarity and then fitting it into the context of what they were saying the mtu mkorofi which was him was guilty of kupunja which meant to cheat he had cheated the big man the bwana mkubwa and no one should be allowed to do that what in the name of god or hell or whatever holy did it mean the fury all round him was subsiding now the lone protesting voice overwhelmed by the weight of the others surprisingly he felt no fear there was a sudden silence in the car each waiting for the other to move it was very hot in the enclosed space thick with body smell abruptly decisively the rear door near which his head was wedged thrust open a foot scraped against his cheek as the man got out they were getting ready to kill him still no fear instead he began to become aware of minuscule inconsequential things fresher air cicadas chattering from the underbush absolute darkness the movement of one man released the others he heard the front door open and then there was a shudder as it slammed shut suddenly he felt his feet and ankles seized as they began hauling him from the vehicle turning him over for better access to his clothes before any attack they were going to go through his pockets his shoulders and then his head bumped off the transmission arch jarring fresh pain through him as they hauled him out he kept his eyes closed head turned against the seats to cover any expression he couldnt control the interior light didnt seem to extend to the rear fetid foodfouled breath sprayed over him deaken let his body flop without resistance one chance thought deaken thats all hed have two men pulled him by his legs from the car and when he was almost clear the third grabbed his arms the eager onesthose who want to kill him with the reluctant one a spectator and if he were reluctant it was unlikely he would have any weapon in his hands a guess deaken knew but a reasonable guess everything was going to be a guess one chance he thought again the scream as he moved was involuntary a mixture of tension and instinct but it startled them at the same time deaken made a coordinated bodyarching eruption lashing out against them with his hands and feet twisting from them as he did so they dropped him awkwardly one leg then the other deaken had yanked at the man holding his arms and felt him begin to topple as deaken struggled to keep his balance he was suddenly conscious of the ground dipping beneath his left foot he guessed they were by a storm ditch with desperate ferocity he lashed out again one of the men toppled with a groan into the darkness deaken was free and his one thought was to run the pitchblack night helped him the driver had only left the sidelights on which did little more than mark out the shape of the car an advantage like his breaking the pattern confusing them and he was better oriented knowing the way the car was pointing and from it the line of the road which gave him the positioning of the storm ditch parallel to it the pain surged back immediately he tried to run he concentrated against it trying to force it aside just as a swimmer on a freezing day tries to ignore the icy coldness of the water the darkness his help a moment before became an immediate liability there was no marker to guide him a soft crack broke the still night deaken realized that somebody had fired a gun he had no impression of a bullet passing anywhere near him he felt out delicately with his foot waiting for the dip of the ditch as he found it he was aware of groping scuffling sounds as they came for him deaken stepped back counting trying to measure his runup never more than one opportunity he thought if he missed they would get him the beating had slowed him so that it was more of a stagger than a run he had miscounted the backward steps so the ground was already falling beneath his feet making his jump across the ditch a clumsy awkward plunge he didnt clear the ditch instead he crashed into the opposite bank gushing the breath from his body he clung there as if he were impaled chest and arms over the rim the lower part of his body dangling into the emptiness below from above and behind there was a shout as they realized what he had done he heard the sound of collapsing earth and stones as one of them scurried after him into the ditch he strained to get some air into his lungs they were close enough now for him to feel the vibration of their running feet through the earth against which he was pressed there were more shots two this time perhaps three fired in close succession deakens right foot found purchase and he pushed upwards hauling his body over the edge a rock was dislodged under his weight it clattered invisibly into the ditch and there were more shouts he could hear the panting of the man in the storm ditch deaken dragged himself out of the gully seconds before the man reached him deaken held his breath straining not to give away his position he felt the man plunge beneath close enough for him to have reached down and touched him deaken was shuddering with the physical effort puffs of dust rose directly beneath his nose and mouth which were jammed against the earth the footsteps had gone past away from him he ached to stay where he was to rest but knew he couldnt afford the luxury deaken tensed concentrating his strength then using the ditch as another marker he scurried away at right angles to it bent low stumbling and tripping over the dragging undergrowth hands stretched out in front to protect himself if he fell there were fresh yells from behind seeming far away now he heard another shot so faint it might not have been a shot at all but the cracking of a stick underfoot where the hell were the trees he had been sure they were close instead he found himself on one of those vast african plains low stunted scrub with the occasional isolated bush sticking up like some sort of lookout dont let it be endless please god dont let it be endless he thought he was staggering his sense of direction gone snatched and grabbed at by the twigs and grasses and undergrowth snakes deaken thought in sudden horror there were bound to be snakes mambas certainly puff adders too he stopped hearing himself whimper he thought puff adders were slowmoving more likely to strike than to get out of his way but he couldnt be sure he started off again no longer a headlong plunge instead scuffing slowly forward feeling his way with his feet hands stretched out like a blind man in unfamiliar surroundings they were still shouting but he had lost them there was a scurrying movement to his right and he jerked to a stop not a snake he decided too much noise maybe a bird startled out of his path there was no warning of the treeline one moment deaken was walking through scrub the next a branch whipped across his face slapping him backwards he felt a fleeting sense of relief that he had found somewhere to hide but snakes could also be in trees were they black or green mambas green he remembered able to strike from overhanging branches thats why unladen african women often balanced a rock or brick on their heads as they walked to provide an alternative target involuntarily deaken ducked he couldnt hear them shouting anymore just night sounds screeches and cries occasionally a nervejumping crash of pursued and pursuer through the bush sweat began to dry on him and he shivered wondering why it seemed colder here than it had in the city deaken tried to crouch against the bole of a thick tree as the panic began to subside the pain returned isolated at first and then taking hold of him in a solid dull ache his head was throbbing gently he began to explore with his fingers trying to detect any cuts he couldnt at first he didnt recognize the grinding cough of the engine but then he realized with a surge of hope that they had started the car he heard it pull away he had beaten them not bravely or cleverly but beaten them nevertheless and now he was stranded in the middle of nowhere and couldnt consider leaving until the morning because he didnt have any idea of the direction of the highway he had to find if he was to get back to dakar and by daylight he would only have seven hours to do that if he were to catch the bellicose and ensure that it altered course christ deaken moaned to himself say as little as possible remembered carre that was makimbers repeated instruction through the long night of rehearsals for this encounter with the bellicoses captain say as little as possible always take the lead from erlander if he got it right there would be another in american currency i was told to expect someone aboard said erlander the man came to my office yesterday told me about it said carre unhelpfully through the porthole of the captains cabin he could see the bowser lines being manoeuvred to connect to the freighters fuel tanks because only a comparatively small amount was involved they were loading stores with the ships derrick rather than a shore crane its still early said the captain hes staying at the royale said carre ill send a car for him who is he inquired the captain an employee of the consignee as i understand it said carre whats he like carre hesitated he seemed pleasant enough he said l hope youre right said erlander this ship isnt designed for passengers and wasnt going to be put to the test thought the senegalese grearson stood selfconsciously before the telephone kiosk aware from deakens experience that the conversations were conducted under observation and wondering where the man was activity swirled around him on the jetties and in the harbour people at play in the sunshine it increased the discomfort for one of the few times he could recall grearson felt overdressed in a business suit it wasnt the thought of being watched not entirely any more than it was wearing a suit while everyone else wore the bare minimum it was the thought of what was going to happen in a few minutes another negotiation and nothing to bargain with the lawyer knew azziz was unimpressed by the concessions he had had to make in greece azzizs judgementthe cost is too greathad sounded ominous to a man who had sacrificed a corporate career to work exclusively for one employer was fifty years old and knew it would be a bastard trying to earn a quarter of what he pulled in now if azziz fired him which he might grearson was frightened of losing it all the luxury of an always available helicopter and hotel and an airline staff on permanent personal standby and that wasnt counting the other privileges like the penthouse in new york and the yacht here in the mediterranean not just the yacht the women too carole was a very desirable new addition the best there had ever been grearson stirred excited by the thought of her he had never known anyone screw like her she was fabulous grearson entered the phone booth and fixed the recorder gazing around again in a fresh surge of discomfort the suit was definitely wrong in this heat the whole thing was wronga stupid melodramatic charade he attached the recorder ensured it was properly connected then stared blankly at the receiver waiting it sounded precisely on time grearson depressed the record button and lifted the telephone delicately between his extended thumb and finger so youre the other lawyer said the voice and youre underberg yes deakens gone to africa as you instructed hes going to make sure the ship comes back the instructions were clear enough the first time round it was a mistake if my people make a mistake your boy dies said underberg youd better hope were more careful than you are we have to talk to tewfik said grearson ive already been through this with deaken the yacht has every sort of communication device said the lawyer we can manage any sort of linkup that you want the answers no said underberg there wont be any trickery said grearson mr azziz just wants to hear his voice make sure hes okay ive told you hes okay we want to hear it from him get that ship back and you can hear it soon enough thats going to take days said grearson its been more than a week already it would have been over by now if youd done what you were told weve admitted the mistake said grearson lets start from a new base the american was sweating the receiver slippery beneath his fingers this wasnt going any better than greece there was only one base you screwed it up we want proof the boy is okay at least decided grearson he was controlling his voice better than deaken he was surprised at his need for comparison i told deaken in the last conversation the sort of proof youd get if you didnt follow our instructions grearson swallowed feeling a sudden chill despite the ovenlike heat of the kiosk if mr azziz receives any part of his sons body hell know hes dead he said hell know the negotiations are over it was a desperate gamble more desperate than he realized as he spoke the words from the other end of the line there was a silence which seemed to go on and on grearson clamped his lips between his teeth physically biting back the anxiety to know if he was still connected the first will come from the girl said underberg at last a concession grearson recognized it at once snatching at the advantage weve no interest whatsoever in the woman he said shes deakens pressure not ours you can do what you like with her youre bluffing said underberg he was at the window gazing down at the indistinct figure enclosed in the kiosk knowing he had been unexpectedly outmanoeuvred ive admitted an error on our part said grearson savouring his newfound strength and told you there wont be another were doing exactly what you asked and in return we want proof that the boy is all right i repeat as far as mr azziz is concerned tewfik will be dead the moment we receive part of his body do you want to put that to the test demanded underberg do you said grearson there was another long silence then underberg said no telephone linkup we wont be tricked proof insisted grearson when i get confirmation that the bellicose is returning grearson recognized the further concession levcos will have a position by tonight he said so will lloyds tomorrow at the latest well talk about it during the next contact said underberg grearson had listened several times to all the earlier recordings and detected the change in the mans voice between the previous conversations and this one underberg was anxious for the first time to conclude a conversation when will that be he said two days why not tomorrow two days repeated underberg i want the ship more than halfway back by then the boys not to be harmed said grearson make sure the ships on the proper course grearson decided it was degenerating into something like a schoolboy shouting match and he didnt want that he put the telephone down the lawyers hand was shaking and he was soaked with sweat he wasnt quite sure what he had achieved remembering the observation he unclipped the recorder moved purposefully from the kiosk and strode directly to the tender looking neither left nor right he retained this pose of indifference when he got aboard remaining conspicuously in view against the midships cabin and gazing out over the stern towards the scheherazade carole who had come ashore with him smiled from inside the tiny cabin and grearson smiled back christ he thought i hope ive got it right high above underberg stood rigidly at the hotel window hands white with anger gripped by his side he had been beaten outbluffed and outmanoeuvred during all the rehearsals and preparation this sort of opposition hadnt been allowed for a sudden nervousness shivered through him it was fortunate he had taken such elaborate precautions the boy insisted he felt well enough to exercise in the garden but he returned to the cottage within minutes coming unsteadily to the table at which karen was already sitting he eased himself gratefully into a seat and karen saw that he was shaking with the effort the squat guard greening who had escorted tewfik remained for a few moments at the door and then went outside again you all right she said just weak thats all for once there wasnt the usual embarrassment instead he looked around to ensure they werent being overheard and then said and i want them to think im worse than i am karen had looked with him towards the door impatient for levys return he had said he would only be away for an hour and it had already been almost twice as long as that were definitely farther south continued tewfik i can tell by the temperature and the things that are growing in the garden yes she said i suppose we are she wasnt interested where they were only that she could stay here and that it wouldnt end quickly have you heard anything something that might give us an idea where this is no said karen nothing itll still be france he said they wouldnt have risked a border crossing and beyond central france i guess theres quite a lot of pine and fir around have you noticed that no replied karen honestly i havent tewfik was too involved in his own thoughts to notice her lack of interest i tested them today he said they dont think theres any risk risk of my getting away they still think im ill he smiled at her encouragingly dont worry he said i wont go without you deaken hadnt rested at all he remained nervously apprehensive at the sudden hidden sounds around him towards first light he was attacked by swarms of mosquitoes which stung so badly that he had tried to cover his face with his jacket and sat cowering beneath its inadequate protection dawn came at in the morning an almost imperceptible darkening of the tree and shrub outlines against the increasing greyness and then abruptly dissolving into glowing reds and apricots deaken rose to his feet cramped and aching shook out his jacket and carefully ran his hands over his stubbled face his skin was lumpy and throbbing from the insect attack he moved slowly out to the edge of the coppice crouched against overhanging branches and staring down at the coarse grass and bracken underfoot each footstep precipitated an eruption of dust and fresh squads of flying things which buzzed angrily around him deaken fanned them away furiously the chill of the night had not been melted by the morning sun and deaken shivered realizing he was damp from the dew he stopped at the treeline and stared out over the barren plain there was no sign of the road his coppice was like a furred wart against the smooth unbroken face of the plain without the slightest elevation or undulation which might have provided a vantage point to pinpoint the broken metalled line of the highway he was lost even in daylight he tried desperately to orient himself he could pick out the tree against which he had spent the cramped night he thought he had come upon it directly at right angles which meant that if he walked away from it in a straight line he would hit the road but what if it hadnt been at right angles shit he said aloud shit shit shit he shouted but his voice was swallowed by the vast emptiness to his left maybe not more than four hundred yards away a dancing class of highstepping gazelles paused in their foraging gazing around with earpointed tenseness after a moment their heads dropped back to their feeding shit deaken shouted again this time they didnt even look up the sun appeared yellow over the rim of the horizon but it was not high enough yet to dispel the chill in deakens body christ he felt awful tired and dirty and itchy awful thirsty too but not hungry he didnt feel as if he wanted to eat again when had he last eaten not since the plane bringing him here only yesterdayless than twentyfour hours to be precise it seemed much longer why did everything seem so much longer than if actually was he checked his watch again six where was this bloody road like a novice swimmer venturing out of his depth deaken moved away from the trees halting after only a few yards to his right close enough to make him jump a disturbed squabble of birds winged suddenly into the brightening sky this time the gazelle herd scattered in their highfloating slowmotion run the sun was strong enough to affect the nighttime dampness now hollows he would not normally have recognized puddling with a white gauze of mist deaken frowned towards the rising sun trying to gauge its strength metalled roads overheated in the african glare send up a miragelike shimmer would he get the marker that way from a shiver of heated air no good thought deaken that would take hours high above so high and so far away that there was no sound a silver flicker of an aircraft trailed by with agonizing slowness washed and shaved and perfumed and pressed passengers and crew would be confident even careless of their timetable and destination all around the mist thatches were being dried out by the heat knowing at least the direction from which he had approached the outcrop of trees deaken turned a full degrees seeking the telltale quiver of air which might indicate the road nothing just the gazelle grazing again an occasional hovering bird poised over some unseen prey miles and miles of flat tobaccocoloured ground with the occasional upthrust thumb of an anthill very soon deaken was too hot and made for the shelter of the trees consumed by a bitter sense of continued impotence he was certain kaolack had been mentioned during the stifling car ride a major town he remembered from the aircraft map if he was right about kaolack then the road had to be one of the main routes through the scorched and arid country an artery in constant dawntodusk use so where were the cars and lorries and buses another fifteen minutes deaken decided if there was no identifying movement by then he would take a chance and strike out directly from the coppice it would remain a marker anyway so if he got too far away without locating the highway he could always return and try another route why fifteen minutes why not right away without wasting any more time occasionally scurrying thingsonly rats or field mice he hopeddarted noisily through the underbrush in front of him as he edged hesitantly forward he jerked back at a sting worse than the others high over his eye at once a puffiness formed soft under his fingers the swelling quickly closing his left eye the bus was already firmly on the plain by the time he noticed it there was a surprised moment of total immobility impressions kaleidoscoping through deakens mindhe was going in the wrong direction parallel rather than towards the road he started to run waving his arms wildly and yelling to attract the drivers attention careless now of any danger underfoot or of the pain pumping through him there was a horrifying surrealism about it all the bus seemed to be travelling slowly as the aircraft had earlier and his progress through the snagging scrub seemed equally slow realizing that he would never reach the road in time to stop the bus deaken halted snatching off his jacket and waving it above his head the speed of the bus didnt alter and he began running again he ran with his head bent sideways able to see the shape of the occupants through the slatted side windows and their luggage bundled on the rimmed rack of the roof deaken stopped again cupping his hands to his mouth and shouting stop help stop the vehicle continued on speed unchanged deaken couldnt run any more his breath was wheezing and his body ached and throbbed he stood aware he was a long way from the road vainly waving and then stopped bothering even with this to watch the bus become smaller and smaller until it finally vanished from the plain it took a long time for his breathing to become normal and the pain to diminish deaken remained slumpshouldered feeling the sun burn into him then head bowed he began to trudge towards the road sweat rivered his face making the bites irritate even more he was still some way from the road when he saw the air quiver for which hed been looking while far back among the trees he was surprised how far from the road the coppice was it looked very small from where he stood he must have been very frightened to have travelled that far the previous night deaken moved on coming finally to the storm ditch it was wide and deep filled at the bottom with the junk of passing travellers wrappers and boxes and rotting fruit and the inevitable cocacola can the bank upon which deaken stood was sheer but the opposing one was sloped up towards the road it was wide but he thought he could jump it he moved back several paces and then attempted a stumbling runup at the last moment he missed his footing and launched himself into the air with hardly any pace arms and legs flailing deaken thumped down on the other side but felt himself sliding backwards into the filthy ditch his fingers scrabbled to catch a grip and groaning with the effort he hauled himself upwards until he could feel the macadam hot and sticky under his fingers deaken levered himself upright the road ran black and rulerstraight from horizon to horizon the cooked air dancing crazily above it there was no shade in either direction the sun seemed to be burning into him at the very crown of his head he took his jacket off again to create a protective canopy and crouched down in the dust at the side of the road flicking his tongue against the dryness deaken felt his lips were already hard and scaling down there among the bottle and the cans there would be trapped water but it would be stagnant and stale diseased his throat felt swollen and gritty deaken dropped his jacket to look at his watch nine thirty still time if someone were to come along soon he screwed around looking back and forth along the road nothing it seemed to be getting more difficult to swallow as if his throat were closing he coughed and it hurt deaken stood to ease the cramp from his legs at first he imagined that it was a trick of the distorted light against the heat of the road he squinted squeezing his eyes tightly shut to clear his vision and when he opened them he saw that there was definite movement a black shape materializing down the highway deaken struggled back into his jacket and stepped out onto the road feeling the heat scorch at once through the soles of his feet he stood in the very centre arms raised in front of him it was a lorry openbacked with slatted sides to hold its cargo bulbous wings and a dustcovered cab the wipers had cleared two semicircular eyes in the windscreen which made it look like a vast metallic insect then he heard the horn sound strident and impatient it hadnt occurred to him that people wouldnt stop coming upon him stranded in this deserted savannah dear god no deaken moaned he waved his arms faster the engine note didnt change and the horn blast was more prolonged he wouldnt move deaken decided he would stay right where he was the man would have to halt or run him down deaken glanced desperately to left and right trying to estimate if there were room for the man to swerve around him at the last minute a hundred yards now maybe less the insect face was bearing down hom screeching and then suddenly the headlights flared on in a warning flash deaken moved sideways bringing himself more directly into the path of the vehicle there was a puff of burning smoke from the squealing rear wheels as they locked the back slid in the soft tar slewing the lorry towards the ditch the driver released the brakes correcting the skid then braked again there were fresh spurts of smoke cold with fear deaken remained where he was staring up at the lorry so close now that it towered above him he could see the drivers face black eyes pebbled with fear behind the ballooned wings were rusting running boards deaken noticed he had slowed the lorry sufficiently to leap aboard if he had to dodge at the last minute he wouldnt lose the lorry couldnt it slewed again slow and controllable deaken had to move but backwards not sideways so that he still blocked the road there was a moment of dustsettling silence deaken recovered first he went immediately to the passenger side hauling at the door not thinking until he was framed at the opening that the man might have a weapon he didnt from his startled expression it was obvious he expected deaken to have one the lawyer smiled splaying his hands i need help he said in english transport the driver looked blankly at him but there was a discernible relaxation in his attitude assistance he said attempting french aid there was still no comprehension what was help in swahili fervently deaken tried to recall the longunused words remembering at last saidia he said still nothing deaken pointed to the road dakar he said the mans face cleared he said something deaken could not understand nodding and smiling agreement deaken indicated that he wanted to sit in the adjoining seat repeatedly pointing ahead and repeating dakar smiling clearly relieved the man met the request with a further nod of agreement as an afterthought deaken indicated the way from which the lorry had been travelling and said dakar again once more there was a nod of agreement shit said deaken the driver nodded and smiled apparently now enjoying the encounter a relief from the boring lonely drive dakar said deaken again not offering an opinion this time he was given another smiling acquiescent nod which started deaken and then stopped realizing the hopelessness shit he repeated another nod he got in slamming the door it was movement whatever the direction at the first township or hamlet he would inquire again get it right maybe find a taxi ten fifteen he noted the driver ground the gears into mesh with a shudder of cogs snagging up through the gate in a ritual flourish which deaken realized he was supposed to appreciate when the speedometer needle registered seventyfive kilometres the man hunched forward over the wheel arms encompassing the rim surely this hadnt been the speed at which he had approached horn blaring fast enough to burn the tread off the tyres when he braked deaken stared at him and the senegalese answered the look smirking at what he believed to be admiration there was nothing he could do deaken accepted at least he was moving he tried again to reassure himself not stuck in some wasteland being gradually dried in the sun the oblong of the rustframed window gaped behind him dust drifted in fashioned in weaving snakes beyond he saw the load a haphazard pile of vegetables and fruit deaken groped for an orange it was green and unripened hard under his hands he gestured for permission to the driver who shrugged and nodded the fruit was as hard as its outer skin deaken bit into it face twisting at the sourness his mouth stung by it he gulped at the orange devouring the flesh almost without awareness snatching back through the hole for another orange as soon as the first went the rear window was not the only entry point for the dust it seeped in wedges through the floor and illfitting doors and deaken became aware of the vehicles age the cab he realized was more than the drivers workplace it was his home as well two jackets jostled from a peg immediately behind the man and level with the back of his head there was a shelf containing two shirts and a pair of shoes deaken looked down and saw that the driver was barefoot skeletal legs jutting from the frayed ends of greased trousers the plastic bench seat upon which he was sitting was covered with a plaid blanket which deaken assumed was the mans nighttime sleeping protection deaken eased forward uncomfortably deaken followed the drivers example and wound down the side window to get some air he tried resting his arm on the sill but hurriedly pulled back the underside of his elbow burned by the heat of the metal the plain stretched unbroken and unending proof that the world was flat they passed more gazelle and then a group of stunted piglike animals which gazed back without fear but with earcocked curiosity around a distant anthill black birds wheeled in maypolelike flight crows deaken thought and maybe vultures he wondered what the unseen carrion was it could easily have been him anxious to please the driver groped beneath his feet with one hand for a small battered portable radio one dial was missing and the plastic frame was supported by strips of tape and sticking plaster the man extended an aerial and looked carelessly from the road while he selected a station there was a blurred fuzz of interference from the unsuppressed engine beneath which it was just possible to detect the monotonous ululating of what deaken presumed was some local pop song the man said something in identification nodding to the radio and it was deakens turn to smile and nod with a complete lack of understanding the dashboard clock was smashed robbed of its hour hand and deaken travelled with his left arm twisted across his lap so he could count away the time it was exactly thirty minutes from the moment of his pickup to their arrival at the top of an incline above a small township huddled in a protective valley not more than a mile away deaken sat forward eagerly as they descended taking note of the outlying fields and the irrigation stream and the needle spires of more than one church the french influence remained with the placename visible despite the chipped paint secure on its rusting pole kaolack shouted deaken in despair the driver smiled and nodded carre had gone ashore from the bellicose ostensibly to pick up deaken from the royale but really to limit the time with the captain prolonging his absence as long as possible before returning when he made his way onto the ship from the quayside he saw the bowser cables being lifted away on their umbilical lines erlander was on the bridge wing where the hells our passenger he said i sent a car said carr he wasnt there were refuelled and revictualled said the captain should i check with athens carre welcomed the opportunity of getting away from the ship again erlander shook his head ive already done so by radio ive been told to make it an onthespot decision there was a shout from the deck signalling the final freeing of the fuel lines and erlander led the way into his day cabin he poured two glasses of gin topping both lightly with water carre picked up the jug adding another inch what are you going to do said carre he had never before earned as much on the side as he had from makimber he was unsure whether to hoard the dollars in the expectation of the conversion rate going up or change them at once it was a lot of money to move at one time and risk alerting the currency controllers and if that happened he would have to bribe his way out of trouble he would shift just a little at first he decided it was a warm feeling to be rich it justified the present unease erlander walked to the starboard side of his cabin looking out over the quay the early morning activity was slowing in the full heat of the day the shore cranes bowed with inactivity stevedores and harbour workers grouped in the warehouse shade or trailed to the liquor stalls did this fellow tell you what he had to do he asked just sail with you the captain turned back into the room what authorization did you see i told you erlander was a man who knew he sailed on the shaded side of every route never properly believing the manifest listing on any voyage it was a risk he took consciously for the money which levcos paid despite which he was a careful man running a clean efficient ship with a reliable professional crew never exposing himself to unnecessary danger the preposterous sailing instructions and the presence of a man who had constantly to be duped with false positions and speeds constituted precisely the sort of conditions which erlander had until now succeeded in avoiding which was why he was pleased the man had not turned up and why he had lied to the agent about making contact with athens there would be contact but not yet we sail at noon said erlander ill wait until then but no longer one hundred and twenty miles away deaken was agreeing to double the price if the taxi driver could get him from kaolack to dakar in time greening and leiberwitz stood watching levy and karen walking in the garden and leiberwitz said look at them mooning like youngsters greening looked sympathetically at the bearded man it must be difficult for you involved in the family he said thats not my first consideration what then i dont think levy is capable of leading us anymore hes not let his relationship with the woman interfere so far said greening i dont think he can be trusted anymore to make dispassionate decisions said leiberwitz what are you saying that its time someone else took over deaken chose a peugeot with the best bodywork and least tattered upholstery hoping that the engine would be in matching condition the taxi driver was a mulatto so there was a bridge with french fighting against the impatience and despair that swept through him when the man told him how far they were from dakar deaken still insisted the car be checked at a service station for oil and water and to fill the petrol tanks having escaped once from the wilderness he didnt want to be trapped there again the kaolack market was at its busiest the streets crowded with unhurried people and obstructing animals the driver forced his way through with his hand constantly on the horn it took ten minutes to clear the township but the car was moving easily with no sound of strain from the engine and deaken felt a prick of hope they actually accelerated on the gradient from the town and by the time they had reached the playedout ribbon of the dakar road the speedometer was flickering at kilometres deaken anxiously scanned the dashboard ensuring that all the temperatures and levels were reading properly between the drivers hands the steering column jarred from imbalanced wheels but it did not seem to worry him deaken eased back against the sticky upholstery recognizing the surrounding countryside and then what he believed to be the tree outcrop where he had hidden freed from the stomachtightening anxiety and with nothing to do except sit deaken examined the events of the previous night it certainly hadnt been a simple backstreet mugging there had been no attempt at robbery not until those last few moments when they hauled him from the car bwana mkubwa he remembered who was the big man they had kept talking about underberg possibly but underberg wouldnt have attempted to keep him off the bellicose it was underbergs idea that he sail to ensure the freighters return azziz then no there was no logic in that because azziz wanted him aboard as well and he had seen the thugs azziz employed evans and his trained mercenaries wouldnt have allowed such an amateur panicridden escape had azziz ordered him stopped he would have been stopped so it was another unanswered question to be filed away with all the rest the plain ended at last the landscape becoming stubbled with isolated trees and then thicker vegetation occasionally there were villages clusters of mudwalled huts with corrugated metal roofs set out along the highway staffed by scattering chickens and roundeyed potbellied children deaken noticed that the fuel was already half gone and that the watertemperature gauge was twitching up towards the ambercoloured danger area he gestured towards it and the driver nodded diourbel in fifteen kilometres he promised halfway guessed deaken maybe slightly less sixty miles then he checked his watch again could he hope to do sixty miles in an hour and ten minutes hows the road beyond diourbel he demanded good said the driver shrugging in what appeared to be immediate contradiction deaken realized the man didnt know noon he said i must be in dakar by noon no problem but there was deaken knew no road in africa certainly not this part of africa was good enough to allow the sort of speed necessary to cover sixty or more miles in just over an hour even if the overstrained overheated engine could maintain a good average the idea came abruptly to deaken his first reaction one of excitement quickly followed by that of annoyance because it was so obvious and hadnt occurred to him earlier in kaolack when the taxi pulled into the service station he leaped out before they came to a halt and ran into the office carres card in his hand shouting in french for the telephone a surprised attendant pointed to his right where the instrument was clamped to the wall deaken obtained the price of the call to the capital from the operator and then asked him to wait while he dashed to the cashier for change he pumped the money in repeated carres number and then stood shuffling his feet with growing frustration while the ringing tone purred out at him through the cracked window out on the forecourt he saw the driver make sure that the fuel cap was fully tightened and then look inquiringly into the office the tone purred on with no reply angrily deaken slammed down the receiver and ran from the building without bothering to reclaim his unused coins it was as difficult getting through diourbel as it had been to leave kaolack and deaken was unable to sit still impatiently tapping his hands against the front seat he should have tried to call from kaolack he thought in bitter selfrecrimination obvious downright bloody obvious and it hadnt occurred to him until it was too late under an hour to go he saw hurry he said please hurry there was more traffic as they approached the coast most of it moving at the customary sedate african pace and so much coming the opposite way that overtaking was almost impossible several times the driver pulled out to risk headon collision blaring his horn to be met by matching blasts as the oncoming vehicles had to swerve to avoid him it was when they reached thies and almost noon by the time they got through it the petrol tank was half empty again and the driver started to indicate pulling into a station but deaken urged him on willing to take the risk rather than sacrifice any more time they got to rufisque by the temperature needle already halfway through the amber colouring the heat from the engine combined with the scorching sun making the atmosphere in the car almost unbearable they entered the outskirts of dakar at deaken waved the man on in the signposted direction to the harbour stopping only for directions to carres office when they were among the dockyard warehouses as they moved parallel to the water deaken strained to make out the bellicose there seemed to be a lot of freighters and coasters in port but none with the name he sought deaken had the money ready as soon as they reached carres office throwing it onto the seat beside the driver and dashing from the vehicle and up the stairs to the second floor bursting into the agents office without knocking carre jumped at the intrusion half rising from his seat and then settling again where have you been he said it doesnt matter said deaken urgently wheres the bellicose sailed said carre deakens shoulders caved and he slumped into a chair trying to recover he said can i get a fast cutter to overtake it and board carre shook his head the pilot vessel has already come back its been gone more than an hour now itll have cleared our waters why didnt it wait i sent a car for you even went to the hotel myself no one knew where you were there were no messages did anyone know i was here inquire about me deaken asked carres face remained expressionless no he said should they have done the senegalese had been his only contact the only person who could have guided the attackers to him intent on the mans reaction deaken told him what had happened the previous night and of his desperate efforts to get back to dakar before the bellicose sailed carre managed a look of incredulity but deaken guessed it was forced we should tell the police said carre makimbers rehearsal had seemed to work perfectly well with the bellicose captain so he saw no reason why it shouldnt with this man who notifies athens of the sailing you or the bellicose said deaken both carre wasnt prepared for this question when will there be a position report probably in twentyfour hours carre didnt seem very sure everything would be all right if azziz had instructed athens he had twentyfour hours decided deaken maybe thirtysix if he included the remainder of this day thirtysix hours to do what he should have done before instead of slavishly attempting to follow the kidnap directions he accepted the decision that karen might die but that would happen anyway if he didnt act deaken was surprised at his detachment azziz snapped off the recording but didnt speak grearson waited opposite trying to conceal his apprehension i wanted contact reminded the arab you didnt get it i got concessions grearson fingered his spectacles like worry beads what if he doesnt believe you and maims my son azziz was a bastard thought grearson when there was conciliatory acquiescence he demanded forcefulness and when there was forcefulness he wanted subservience you heard the tape insisted grearson for the first time there was a balance something from our side but what did it achieve maybe proof that your son is still alive said grearson wishing he could disturb azzizs calmness its been more than a week now azziz nodded its something i suppose he said thank you grearsons concern subsided and he fitted the spectacles back into place dont you have something else to do grearson stood up were meeting in two hours make sure they know what to do he wasnt secure decided grearson not secure at all before he left to meet the mercenaries he would find carole and let her know he would be back late that evening christ she was exciting you did well said makimber counting out carres money extremely well thank you it wasnt easy lied carre wanting to give the impression that he had earned his bribe im positive it wasnt said makimber sure you dont know the reason for his asking you about notification of sailing it was the only thing they were still uncertain about carre shook his head theres no way he could intercept the ship now its sailed from here its fully victualled and fuelled said carre theres no need to make land for at least two weeks possibly three what about changed sailing instructions from the owners id be telexed a copy of that automatically from athens theres been nothing youd tell me at once of course makimber added another to the pile of notes youll find me grateful in the future he said carre smiled you say he seemed anxious to get away once he knew hed missed the ship repeated makimber extremely so he didnt stay more than about thirty minutes fortyfive at the outside i wonder what hell do said makimber more a question to himself than the other man evans arrived first from clermont ferrand having accepted grearsons suggestion to take a villa on the outskirts of marseilles on the aubagne road the rest travelled individually and booked into separate hotels in the town except for hinkler and bartlett who went everywhere together and registered at the same hotel the meeting with the american lawyer at the villa was the first time they had assembled as a group since mulhouse grearson concentrated first on money same terms as last time he said payable in any currency i presume that will be dollars there were nods all round marinetti said last time there was a bonus which will apply again said grearson twenty thousand each upon successful conclusion what do we have to do asked sneider it took grearson almost thirty minutes to outline what azziz wanted done throughout the briefing the men showed no surprise and no one interrupted when the lawyer finished evans said do we have the opportunity to examine the ship today said grearson the captain is expecting us i said about three no need for any particular explosives said marinetti jones stirred stretching his long legs itll be simple enough if theyre by themselves he said what happens if they bring the boy and the woman for exchange on the spot therell need to be a contingency plan said grearson so well have to wait until were sure said melvin unless its made clear in the exchange terms agreed grearson theyll imagine youre crew of course youll be sailing from marseilles what if theyre watching the port said hinkler they wont be said grearson as far as theyre concerned the bellicose is on its way back from dakar for the algiers rendezvous wonder what they want the arms for said bartlett its immaterial said grearson we dont intend they should have them no idea how many therell be queried evans none said grearson presumably theyll be armed said hinkler presumably said grearson weve still got some stun grenades said marinetti theyre not as effective outside a confined space but they might be useful remember that mr azziz wants an example made said grearson he doesnt want to be a victim of terrorism again not after were through promised evans getting to his feet theres no need for us all to go to the ship ill make the reconnaissance and come back to brief the rest of you here grearson followed the former major out to the car and got in the passenger seat beside him evans took the car out onto the main marseilles highway but kept in the slow lane letting even heavy lorries pass there was a differential in the bonus last time said evans intent upon the road you get against the others said grearson i didnt think youd want me to set it out in front of everybody thank you said evans in brussels you spoke of other employment permanent protection appeal to you evans allowed himself to shrug never done it he said its getting more and more difficult to get proper paid soldiering why dont we talk about it afterwards evans entered the city turning almost immediately towards the harbour isnt there a possibility theyll anticipate your doing something like this said evans as far as theyre concerned said grearson the ships been at sea since this whole thing began with no opportunity of our getting anyone aboard itll be a nice surprise for them they were driving parallel to the sea now there were several french warships in the naval section grey and pompous at anchor with a group of corvettes trailed one behind the other like a family of ducks nearer the civil docks were crowded with vessels from coastal fishing ships to ocean freighters at the dock gates grearson produced the levcos authority and was directed on to a peripheral road inside the walled area the hydra star was alongside a jetty already loaded so there was little stevedore activity around her grearson led the way aboard and was directed by the gangway crewman to an outer ladder to reach the bridge the metal felt oiled and greasy to the touch and grearson thought being a sailor in a ship like this would be a distinctly unpleasant way to earn a living there must have been some communication from the deck because by the time the two men reached the bridge the greek captain had emerged to greet them nicholas papas he said the captain was younger than grearson had expected oliveskinned and darkhaired because of the heat he wore the insignia of rank on his shirt so he could dispense with a uniform jacket grearson took the proffered hand introduced evans and then produced his letter from andreas levcos the captain read it and said theres been a lot of communication from athens about you he looked at evans how many men have you seven accommodation will be a problem said papas ive a full crew were used to difficult conditions said evans to grearson papas said everything is loaded when do we sail two days said the lawyer maybe three it depends upon the sailing conditions from dakar to algiers papas led them back into his cabin grearson saw there were several family photographs showing a pretty darkhaired woman and two children the captain offered drinks but grearson and evans declined papas poured himself ouzo i am responsible for the safety of my ship he said we understand that said grearson he put his hand on evanss shoulder and felt it tense these people are going simply to protect a cargo where will i be sailing after algiers i dont know said grearson to evans the greek said i control this ship at all times naturally said evans nothing is to happen without prior consultation with me of course papas studied the mercenary as if he doubted the quickness of the replies then he said do you want to look over the ship please said evans politely papas took them down an inner stairway to the deck the forward hold was still uncovered and grearson and evans stared down at the containers and crates could the ships derrick lift them out without the need for a heavier shore crane asked grearson although there was no intention of parting with the weaponry he had to be prepared for any question that might arise during their telephone contact if necessary said papas evans was examining the decking expertly assessing the cover available from the raised lip of the cargo hold and the other deck fittings just this hold queried grearson theres a small overflow in number two hold said papas only about six tons he led them back inside the freighter towards the crew accommodations the two cabins allocated for evanss men were small normally only occupied by two people thats all weve got said the greek that will be all right said evans how many crew do you carry said grearson twentyfive said papas twentyfive good men by a series of internal ladders and walkways they got into both holds through the bulkhead doors enabling evans to inspect the cargo crates and then returned to the bridge papas offered them drinks and again they refused it was almost four oclock when grearson and evans went back down the ladderway onto the quayside evans paused turning back to the hydra star papas was watching them from the bridge wing he wont be easy said grearson and the crew is larger than i imagined it would be numbers arent a problem said evans we can take care of ourselves he went over to the car theres plenty of cover particularly down in the hold no worries then evans stopped with the drivers door open and looked hard at the lawyer mr azziz will get his moneys worth he said the garden of the house curved in a gentle arc down to a high bank levy scrambled up and then leaned down to help karen he sat with his back against a fir and she leaned against him head on his chest here they were shielded from the house and their elevation gave them a panoramic view out over the distant durance river its beautiful said karen yes id like to stay here forever he kissed the top of her head his hand was around her waist and he shifted it slightly moving it gently against her breast she covered his hand with hers something should have happened and it hasnt she said what he said not understanding im late levy stopped moving his hand against her how late two or three days said karen which is unusual im very regular its probably because of all thats happened he said i think im pregnant levy moved her around so that he could see her face im sorry he said she stretched up to kiss him im not she said deaken who had rehearsed everything he had to do and was trying to rest in his window seat stirred at the landing announcement pushing aside the inadequate blanket to gaze out into the velvet african night homethe home he hadnt known for so long and which had not wanted to know him a different arrival from the last time he thought deep in reflection it had been a week after his tenth victory in as many hearings he remembered this time before the human rights court in strasbourg he had already been well knowntoo well known for the comfort of his familybut the strasbourg decision had been against britain over their treatment of detainees in ulster and made him an international media figure reporters had flown to south africa with him even an american television crew for a documentary they later called spokesman for the oppressed he had cooperated not through the vanity of which his father subsequently accused him but because he saw practical benefit from it he had changed his opinion about many things but not about publicity it was a useful weaponthe bestagainst governments or regimes or ruling parties or juntas that wanted something hidden and could be again there was the sound of the undercarriage groaning down a sparkle of the spreadout lights of johannesburg once more and then the snatch of the landing as the aircraft waited for direction towards the disembarkation finger stewards and stewardesses made their final tour offering immigration forms to holders of nonsouth african passports deaken refused wondering what his status was not prohibited if that had been the case his passport would have been withdrawn but certainly listed entered in the central indexes and computer banks and in the immigration records at ports and airports along with the subversives the doubtfuls and those who should be detained or questioned or just refused entry underberg had been right in his threat that the department of national security would know the moment he tried to contact his father which made his plan all the more desperate but the only one that had a chance of keeping karen alive deaken squeezed into the disembarkation queue and funnelled out into the airport building immediately alert for the signs the line for south african nationals was long but moving more quickly than the others through the immigration checks the officer at the desk was young and blond and freshfaced smiling and polite when he reached him deaken thrust his passport across the desk and said my name is richard deaken he indicated the large looseleafed book on his left and said youll find me listed in your check register my father is piet deaken i would like you to call a senior officer its very urgent the young face clouded and the immigration officer swallowed a pleasant shift of duty suddenly a problem the interest rippled from the attentive family immediately behind deaken and travelled all down the line the man at the desk looked from deaken to his picture back again and then shuffled through the book alongside him his finger stopped a third of the way down the page i told you it would be there said deaken despite his anxiety he was curious what the listing read the officer waved the rest of the queue towards an adjacent desk apologetically indicated the register and then deaken to his suddenly overburdened colleague as he lifted the desk phone its urgent repeated deaken i heard you said the young man officiously the conversation was brief in mumbled afrikaans and deaken wondered if the man speaking it believed he wouldnt understand but he quickly learned that his register listing was subversive to the right of the arrival hall was what appeared to be an insubstantial temporary wall made from plasterboard or some processed material it was from here through an unmarked door that the senior immigration official appeared he wore a darker uniform than the desk officer with shoulder crowns of superior rank and a peaked cap firmly in place he was a small fat man with pink cheeks and pudgy hands with obvious irritation he looked at deakens passport then checked the register what do you want he said at last to speak with you privately said deaken before the man could respond the lawyer added its a matter of security the pink face broke into a frown come with me he said deaken followed aware of the junior officer falling into step slightly behind him every face in the waiting queue was turned towards him the office appeared as temporary as its outer wall furnished with only the basic necessitiesdesk filing cabinet two phones and a picture of the prime minister the officer in charge kept his hat on when he sat down he didnt invite deaken to sit but he did so anyway i want to contact my father he said inform him that i am here on a matter of some urgency and that i want to see him immediately tonight and that i want a senior official of the department of national security to be present by the door the junior officer shuffled his feet is that all said his superior attempting sarcasm you know who i am said deaken who my father is please do as i ask you talked about security said the man he was going to be obstructive thought deaken he said it is of vital security far beyond the jurisdiction or control of this department that is for me to decide no said deaken firmly it is for me i want to see my father and an official from security if you obstruct me or refuse to help and expel me without the opportunity of seeing someone higher in authority then this country is going to be involved in an incident of international proportions as embarrassing as any that has happened in the past and i shall ensure that your identity is fully disclosed as the officer who took it upon himself to interfere deaken was aware how pompous he sounded but he marked the man as a bully who would respond most quickly to bullying the man glanced over at the junior officer and deaken knew he regretted now bringing him into the room dont think youre in a position to dictate what i shall and shall not do he said to deaken the opening was ideal thats for you to decide of course agreed the lawyer just make sure you dont get it wrong there was a burst of afrikaans to the young man at the door ordering deaken to be taken to a detention room thank you for doing what i ask said deaken also in afrikaans the younger immigration man was unsure how to treat him now he gestured for deaken to precede him but hurried to open the door for him they walked smartly down a narrow corridor to a smaller office with no furniture except for a desk and a chair the only light came from an overhead lamp recessed flat into the ceiling deaken tried to remember how many annexes and cells he had visited just like this to talk to beaten and bruised detainees he gave up there had been too many he sat down at the table feeling the undersize seat stop halfway along his thighs as they always seemed to do for maximum discomfort and disorientation nothing had changed he thought ive been away a long time he said to the young officer who remained with his eyes fixed over deakens head at some point upon the blank wall to the northeast in the south african capital of pretoria piet deaken emerged from the premiers private suite of offices in the government building stopping for a moment in the corridor he had suspected the reason for the summons after the latenight cabinet meeting hoped and prayed for it after all the rumours and discreet approaches but the confirmation still numbed him the excitement making his legs feel weak he put his hand out against the wall a tall angular man of muted greys his white hair tightly clipped high against his scalp he was going to be minister of the interior one of the most important portfolios in the entire government perhaps the most important in a country with the internal misalignments that south africa had which meant trust absolute trust not just from the other members of the cabinet and the party but from the backers the blurredimage businessmen and sponsors who had such power more even than trust full acceptance by them so the embarrassments of the past were forgotten finally and properly determined to be neither his fault nor capable of correction and there was a deeper meaning it meant that interior minister neednt be the only government office available to him he could still get the premiership that had once been denied him because of richard hannah would be pleased and proud his wife had waited a long time for this he heard the footsteps and pushed himself away from the wall smiling as he recognized his private secretary he wanted to break the news but knew he couldnt not before the official announcement the following day piet deaken had nothing to learn about discretion a telephone call said the man from the airport at johannesburg your wife told them they could reach you here when deaken picked up the telephone in his office he felt his brief elation draining away it was as if a hand had plunged deep into his stomach a cold cruel hand and was wrenching at his innards i do not have a son called richard deaken said the old man rigidvoiced at the other end the immigration man winced at the pedantic disclaimer i called the security headquarters in skinner street when i couldnt get you immediately theyve already got a deputy director on the way so he couldnt avoid it couldnt block it out thought the older man sir said the official at the airport uncertain at the silence im still here said the politician for how long he wondered around the pool there had been a lot of talk about grearson and carole knew from the girls who had been on the yacht before her arrival that he was always a flop a grunting mechanical man who had to be coaxed and praised and encouraged and with whom it was always over practically before it started but carole was superbly accomplished completely concealing any reaction but the one he wanted that was fantasticyoure amazing she said its always fantastic with you said grearson reassured that he had pleased her he was breathing heavily whats happened to that man who was here she said deaken he wasnt necessary anymore said grearson who liked to boast to her is he coming back no carole had detected deakens attraction to her even though he had done his best to conceal it she wondered if he would have succumbed if there had been more time she looked at the hump beside her in the darkness it would have been a bloody sight more exciting than this had just been i thought we were going to be cruising she complained weve been stuck here for days well get away soon promised grearson just as soon as mr azzizs son gets aboard whens that going to be only a day or two now just the boy or will there be a bigger party she asked hopefully just us said grearson he kissed her clumsily you dont want anybody else do you you know the answer to that she said christ how she wished it could soon be over deaken hoped his father would be the first to arrive so that immediate pressure could be imposed upon the security service but it didnt happen that way and he knew he was going to have to be very cautious to prevent any message getting through to underberg in monaco the security official was as short and squat as the senior immigration man but it was a muscled body not an overindulged one he came sternfaced into the room the immigration man behind him stopping at the doorway to look deaken over he was in plain clothes without any insignia of rank you wanted to see me the accent was thickly afrikaans i wanted to see somebody from security my name is swart you know my name and who am said deaken so what do you want so far i only know your name said deaken the man reached inside his jacket pocket and showed deaken his identification wallet there was a photograph and the shield of the security service that deaken remembered so well imprinted above the name the rank of colonel higher than he had expected the man could be a deputy even certainly with sufficient authority to have contacted underberg before coming here satisfied demanded swart deaken attacked at once youve got my wife if anything happens to her i guarantee it wont just be the publicity ill see that my father takes your whole fucking service apart what the hell are you talking about said swart amazed i asked to see my father said deaken he realized gratefully that his voice didnt show his anxiety hes coming said the fat man swart lowered himself into the one chair if it werent for who you are he said your record and your father youd have been seen by one of the airport staff as it is i have driven all the way from pretoria and im beginning to think ive wasted my time i want to know now right now what youre doing here and not in gibberish in words i can understand the arrival of deakens father saved him there was movement from the doorway and he looked up to see the tall upright old man five years he thought nearer six the final screaming row in the study of the parkstown mansion the accusations of disgracing the family of being disowned took on a victorian almost humorous unreality except that it had been painfully real deaken smiled wanting to reach out and touch his father make now the apologies he had never been able to make before but realized that would be as inappropriate as the smile piet deaken came hesitantly into the room looking not to his son but to the other men in the room for guidance swart stood up smartly the demeanour of respect obvious introducing himself and offering his hand the old man took it with indifference looking fully at his son for the first time his appearance in the doorway had been misleading deaken decided the initial impression had been that his father was upright and forceful as ever but it wasnt so there was a bend to his body an uncertainty like a once strong tree under pressure from a sudden wind why have you come back he said the voice like the stance was hesitant for help said deaken simply the ingenuous honesty of the reply surprised his father he blinked looking to swart again then back to his son i want to save karens life what to swart deaken said looking at the immigration officials im happy for them to stay if you are the colonels reaction was immediate a head jerk of dismissal deaken realized he had penetrated the barriers his father had erected but swart was still regarding him doubtfully politely he offered the chair to his father preferring to stand as he had stood a hundred times in a hundred courts to make his case except that this case was the most important of his life he started from the morning in the geneva apartment not referring to the argument with karen but mentioning the arrangement to meet during the day because he considered the timing important and then of the encounter with underberg karens frightened telephone call the photograph with azziz and his meeting aboard the scheherazade with the boys millionaire father deaken had always prided himself on his ability to read the expression on the juries or judges faces his father sat frowning uncertain swarts expression was one of bewilderment deepening when deaken concluded with the attack in dakar the old man responded first do you know anything about this he said to swart there have been rumours of some campaign underway in namibia but nothing definite mean about my daughterinlaw absolutely nothing insisted swart what about underberg then said deaken there was a wallmounted telephone near the door swart went to it standing with his back to them and speaking quietly so that neither could hear the conversation when he hung up swart said simply our service is in no way involved have your word ive spoken to the director said swart he looked at deaken he said the suggestion was as preposterous as the story what about the name demanded deaken there are two men named underberg in the service agreed swart marius underberg in central records jan underberg is in the transport section what does it mean asked piet deaken there was a pause and then swart said perhaps sir your son is unwell as he had when he planned his first escape tewfik azziz waited until the house quieted and he was sure that everyone was asleep carefully he got out of the bed and for thirty minutes practised every noiseless exercise that he could recall from the gymnastic and calisthenic instruction at the ecole gagner wanting to test his strength as fully as possible he ached at the end but knew that it was from the exertion not from any lingering effect of the illness so he was fit again fit enough to get away he got back into bed cupping his hands behind his head and staring up towards the ceiling it had been instinctive to promise the woman that he wouldnt go without her no not instinctive politeness automatic polite gratitude for what she had done for him when he had been ill by himself he stood a chance they would never make it together he felt a flicker of guilt but he had nothing to feel guilty about it was him they wanted not her she was just a pawn they wouldnt harm her if he got away he was sure they wouldnt there had been no argument from swart about letting the father stand guarantor for his son but during the drive from johannesburg to pretoria there wasnt the reconciliation that deaken had imagined in the detention room instead his father retreated behind the usual barriers deep in his own thoughts deaken was thoroughly confused if the south african security service was not involved then karen was in no immediate danger from his being in the country and the rerouting instructions for the bellicose had been sent independently so for the next four or five days underbergor whatever his name waswould receive information that was going to keep her safe but who was holding karen and azziz it was a maze deaken had turned the first corner and all he could see was another blank and impenetrable wall as they approached the parkstown suburb deaken looked out at the jacaranda trees which were black against the night sky in the morning they would be showing violet and purple deaken wondered if the arbour in the grounds of the house would be as spectacular as he remembered it when they telephoned from johannesburg airport deakens mother was in bed they arrived to find her fully dressed carefully made up and immaculately coiffed waiting for them in the larger of the garden drawing rooms the one which overlooked the tennis court and the stepped terraces hello mother said deaken she acknowledged him with a curt nod the sort of gesture she would have accorded a stranger he supposed he should go across to kiss her but didnt think she would want him to he decided to sit down on one of the deep green velvet settees what is this all about his mother was as rigid and formal as her carefully waved white hair it came as something of a surprise to deaken to realize that she was a stronger person than his father but it was he who elected to tell the story more concisely than deaken had done missing none of the details and showing the ability that had taken him from the advocates floor to the judges bench before exchanging a legal career for one in politics but he didnt stop at the account of missing the bellicose in dakar theres something else he said to his wife what ive got the interior ministry i was told tonight officially she looked at her son and then he had to arrive i need your help said deaken understanding now the reason for his fathers silence in the car what do the authorities say asked his mother they deny all knowledge or involvement said her husband they think im insane added deaken she looked at him are you of course not you dont look well karens been kidnapped ive been tricked cheated and left for dead in the middle of nowhere ive just flown four thousand miles how do you expect me to look weve a meeting with the director in the morning as always the old man tried to come between them theyre making more inquiries the woman didnt look at him eyes fixed on her son you almost ruined your fathers career once she said i wont have you do it again ive no intention of ruining anything said deaken wearily i just want karen back she didnt speak for several moments and when she did deaken realized she hadnt listened to him id have you committed rather than let it happen again she said deaken knew that she meant it the appointment with the director of the department of national security had been arranged for ten but just as deaken and his father were preparing to leave the parkstown house there was a telephone call from skinner street postponing it until midday why asked deaken i dont know they didnt say replied his father deaken was still at the breakfast table set out on the wide sweeping verandah overlooking the gardens the water sprinklers were already revolving over the grasses and shrubbery to beat the cooking heat of midday deaken noted that the arbour was still as colourful and as carefully kept as he remembered it he could see four africans working in the grounds but knew there would be more the maintenance staff had been twenty strong when he had lived there his mother had always insisted on neatness and efficiency he was glad he didnt look such a mess this morning whoever had cleaned pressed and mended his suit had made an excellent job of it his father who had remained standing after returning to report the telephone call sat down again and gestured for the waiting houseboy to clear the breakfast debris deaken saw that the serving staff still wore white gloves im sorry about last night said the older man unexpectedly deaken shrugged suppose shed reason enough it was still rude unnecessary she was very hurt by what happened last time im sorry your mother was always ambitious she thinks if id got the original appointment i could be premier now couldnt you still ive got to make a success of the interior ministry first deaken looked back at the garden and the working africans his father epitomized the boer member of the broederbond the closed secret society of ruling class always a participant in the voortrekker marches which commemorated the occupation of the country and their subsequent fight against the british there was everything he hated in the man he loved so much do you believe swart that this country wasnt involved my appointment has been rumoured for some time said the older man they wouldnt lie to me knowing that i can find out easily enough then i wont do anything to embarrass you promised deaken i intended to the threat of publicity was the only weapon i had to protect karen but not now the old man nodded do you believe me its difficult to im not mad i dont think you are what do you think then demanded deaken that its going to be difficult to convince anyone else deaken caught a movement from the french windows it was one of the house servants seeing his expectation his father said she wont be coming out oh said deaken he supposed half a reconciliation was better than none was this really a reconciliation with his father or the action of a man who had lost one opportunity and was trying to minimize the risk of losing another it really wasnt important deciding what to do next was important and he realized emptily that he didnt know wed better go said his father they said noon the limousine which had brought them from johannesburg was waiting with the uniformed driver at the wheel it had been washed and polished and gleamed in the sun they moved off along the broad residential roads between landscaped gardens jewelled by mansions and villas and beneath the purple and violet jacaranda trees deaken was surprised to feel a certain nostalgia the department of national security was a modern tall tintedglass building and the office of its director brigadier heinrich muller was on the top floor occupying a corner with a panoramic view over pretoria deaken followed his father into the room and closed the door behind them muller was a large heavybodied man fullfeatured and with thick heavy hands like swart who stood alongside and was the only other man in the room he wore plain clothes in fact swart didnt appear to have changed since the previous night deaken saw that the expressions werent as sceptical as he had expected just blank his father made the introductions and muller offered his hand deaken took it surprised im sorry for the delay said muller gesturing to chairs things took longer than we thought what things said deaken checking that a yacht owned by a man called adnan azziz who has a son in a swiss school was in harbour at monte carlo elaborated muller that there was an unexplained and so far unsolved assault upon a holiday villa near a small french town called rixheim and that a freighter named the bellicose owned by the levcos shipping company sailed from marseilles over a week ago and made a call within the last two days at dakar deaken experienced the sensation of being in a lift that suddenly descends faster than expected thank you he said softvoiced for believing me for bothering to make the inquiries it wasnt altruism said muller weve an interest in stopping major campaigns in namibia he hesitated which remains a problem what do you mean demanded deakens father muller looked at swart the stocky man cleared his throat and said according to what you told me last night azziz has ordered the bellicose to return for a rendezvous off algiers the falling sensation hit deaken again but this time it was a result of fearfear and blinding anger dont say the bastard has lloyds report a northerly course said swart the last report put the freighter forty miles off the mauritanian coast making twelve knots in a medium swell deaken frowned at the man so he is doing what he said weve longrange reconnaissance aircraft interrupted muller we ordered a check initially little more than a precaution at dawn this morning a freighter later identified from aerial photographs to be the bellicose was proceeding southwards towards angola there was a protracted silence in the room deakens father broke it that doesnt make sense he said only if there are two ships said the security chief and we know there arent thats why we delayed this meeting we overflew the mauritanian position two hours agoa supposed air force training flight to the azores weve swept the area there are ships certainly but none of them is the bellicose so underberg said deaken beginning to understand or whoever he is will think were keeping to the arrangement he said he is getting his information from lloyds it made sense of what had happened in dakar azziz was the bwana mkubwa the big man who had wanted to keep him off the bellicose so that he wouldnt discover that a change of course was never intended for the freighter i understand your reaction said muller of more concern to us is that whoever bought all the weaponry appears to be getting delivery as planned it has to be swapo surely said deaken thats the obvious conclusion said muller but there are still too many uncertainties about this business he looked at swart again the man took from mullers desk two photographs and showed them to deaken do you recognize either of these two men they were official pictures both men staring directly and selfconsciously at the camera no said deaken ive never seen either of them before im glad said muller who are they said deaken marius underberg and jan underberg said the director so whos the man i saw in geneva will you do something for us asked muller of course said deaken as he spoke he realized the final irony he was cooperating even seeking the assistance of an organization which he had criticized and fought all his life but there was no choice what do you want he said for you to work with our artists identikit and photofit specialists we need a picture of the man you met in geneva two men were waiting in the office next door one with paper pinned across an artists drawing board the other standing at a table before assorted boxes deaken worked first with the photofit expert picking his way through the containers holding every feature of the human face from basic outline to warts moles and strawberry birthmarks deaken worked with total concentration occasionally closing his eyes mentally to picture again the smug selfassured countenance that had confronted him over his cheap office desk in switzerland it took a long time and at the end he ached with the effort its as good as i can get it he said then let me improve it said the artist while the photograph was being taken off the composite image deaken went over the photofit features with which he was not completely satisfied he remained at the mans shoulder while he worked with finehaired brushes and then an air brush tinting and paring until at last deaken was staring down at the man who called himself underberg the retouched version was photographed again and then the three of them went back to the directors office comparisons asked muller begun from the original photofit said the man who had created it this version is put through a physiognomy computer deaken looked curiously between the intelligence director and his technicians so what happens now he said more checking said muller it took ten minutes a third whitecoated man came in with a folder and handed it to muller the director detached a snapshotsize photograph and handed it to deaken is this the man he said it was clearly a photograph that had been taken without the subjects knowledge it showed him striding down a wide highway bordered by modern buildings and from the number of blacks deaken guessed it was somewhere in africa who is he said deaken his name is vladimir suslev replied muller mitri brought the message from the radio room padding respectfully into the stateroom and handing it to azziz the arab read it his face clouding he studied it a second time to ensure that he had properly understood then he looked up to grearson and said its from levcos theyve had a signal from the bellicose that deaken didnt board in dakar what he apparently made contact with the agent there the day before the docking but that was the last they saw of him so where the hell is he god knows what about the messages theyre being sent as arranged they were never dependent upon deakens presence anyway if he tries something on his own he could ruin everything grearson brought his fist down hard on the chair arm your people in marseillesevans and the othersthey know deaken dont they asked azziz sure said grearson if they see him poking around the docks doing anything i want him killed it was a long frustrating discussion with frequent culdesacs from which none of them could find an exit it had long since grown dark and pretoria was still and quiet the directors office was littered with debris of long occupation discarded coffee cups and halfeaten sandwiches why should vladimir suslev whom we know to have acted as a military adviser to angola and again with swapo guerrillas in namibia represent himself as south african why should he kidnap a saudi arabian arms dealers sonand the wife of a south african of some notorietyand stipulate the ransom to be the rerouting of an arms shipment for an organization which the soviet union supports against us demanded muller it was the recurring question the maypole around which they had all danced until the strings had become tangled and what the hell is azziz doing said deaken that at least we may be able to find out said muller ill have people with me said deaken muller indicated swart hell be in charge there will be as many men as are needed well get your wife back it took a couple of hours to make all the arrangements and assemble an immediate advance group to join deaken and swart when the time came to leave his father asked if he could drive him to the airport at johannesburg if the guerrillas are planning an offensive in july the government have got a lot to thank you for will you tell mother what happened said deaken unsure why it was so important for him to impress her of course said the older man as far as im allowed to he smiled ruefully id like her to know the man stretched across the car putting his hand upon his sons arm come back he said i will promised deaken and bring karen yes said deaken after a pause ill bring karen eight men flew from south africa with deaken and swart in two separate aircraft two more went directly to paris to the south african embassy to collect the weapons that had been shipped over in the diplomatic bag to bypass customs interference there were contingency plans for more men to follow if swart decided it was necessary the first priority was to locate the russian and even before the conference in mullers office had ended everyone had recognized the problem facing them in monte carlo and the risk of deakens accidental recognition they chose nice taking a series of rooms in the hotel negresco swarts suite overlooked the promenade des anglais and it was here the group assembled early on the first morning deaken sat beside swart but took no part in the briefing admiring the military precision with which the security man deployed his men dispatching six to monte carlo but reserving two for marseilles the departure port of the bellicose despite the speed with which they had left south africa deaken saw swart had managed to bring a family photograph with him a woman as small and stocky as her husband and two children a boy and a girl both fairhaired smiling into the camera from what appeared to be a picnic scene it disclosed a personal side of a man whom deaken had regarded as a hardened professional as the men filed from the room swart said and now we wait and think added deaken about what the lloyds reports give the speed of whats supposed to be the bellicose sailing back yes so its a simple calculation to work out when it should arrive off algiers but we know it isnt going to said swart how can suslev contact a ship that isnt going to be there another dead end thought deaken id like to know what were working against said swart deaken looked up sharply for these unexpected new allies it was a matter of vital security to discover russias part in the arms shipment and if possible to prevent a major battle in a disputed area for him it was simply a matter of getting karen back the telephone sounded insistently swart lapsed into afrikaans as soon as the caller identified himself smiling at deaken as he replaced the receiver he said why is it that so often the most complex problem is really the most simple whats happened said deaken one of the people i sent to marseilles did the obvious thing as soon as he arrived there and checked the ships in port theres a levcosowned freighter named the hydra star loaded and waiting sailing instructions so thats how azziz is going to do it swart held up his hand it looks promising he said but it could also be a coincidencelevcos is a big company with lots of ships we shouldnt jump to conclusions you dont have to said deaken deaken made good time along the coast road and arrived in marseilles before midday he parked the car and approached the boulevard notre dame on foot deciding against telephoning ahead in case marcel lerclerc checked either with ortega or with grearson direct the confidence he had felt in the nice hotel room had evaporated slightly during the drive there was no certainty that azziz would have obtained his enduser certificate through portugal and ortega again and if he hadnt then the encounter with lerclerc was going to be ridiculous worse it would be suspicious practically guaranteeing that lerclerc would check back and that azziz would come to know about it it was still worth the risk though outside the office of the arms dealers shipping agent deaken hesitated rehearsing his strategy in his head and then pushed his way through the narrow door and along the cluttered dirty passage when he entered the office lerclerc looked up without recognition his face as closed and suspicious as on their first encounter ive come without an appointmentforgive me said deaken when the man didnt move deaken added the last shipment remember mr azziz the huge man heaved himself upwards extending his hand good to see you again good to see you he said overeffusive to compensate for his earlier reserve almost at once the smile faltered no problem this time is there deaken pretended to cough putting his hand to his face to cover any expression of satisfaction none at all he said i was passing on my way back to the yacht and it seemed like a good idea to call to see if everything was all right this end pastis thank you with his back to deaken lerclerc said told you last time things dont go wrong here the certificate has been accepted as i advised mr grearson and the export licence has been issued he turned back and gave deaken his glass they drank all were waiting for now is the sailing instructions from you said lerclerc it will be a day or two having taken one chance deaken decided upon another there might be some additions could they be added onto the export agreement lerclerc made a doubtful rocking gesture with his hand might be a chance of something small he said nothing big theres room though isnt there for a tank at least agreed lerclerc ive been away for almost a week said deaken have you sent on the bill of lading lerclerc nodded and then said do you want to check the duplicate it was going almost too well thought deaken exultantly to remind myself he accepted the other man took a folder from a filing cabinet and handed it to him beneath a copy of the latest manifest was a duplicate of the bellicose shipment they were identical everything okay said lerclerc deaken nodded i think ill advise against trying to add to the shipment it might be best the agent paused having got the clearance i dont like the stuff hanging around on the docks too long well move it very soon said deaken he decided he would be straining his luck if he hung around much longer as he stood to leave lerclerc beamed and said things seem to be very satisfactory all round very said deaken as he walked back along the boulevard notre dame he suddenly thought back to his initial visit after the bargaining with ortega in lisbon he had argued ortega into a commission of per cent which was the figure lerclerc had stipulated when he had arrived within hours a figure the agent couldnt have learned from lisbon because lerclercs telephone hadnt been working so the lisbon visit had been a setup a ruse to get him out of the way just as the attack in dakar had been arranged to get him out of the way permanently this time after another fools errand only this time he wasnt the fool grearson snapped off the recording of that mornings interchange from the quayside telephone and said he seems satisfied that the bellicose is on its way back azziz nodded and were going to get a picture showing that tewfik is all right grearson wanted to make sure his employer was in no doubt about his successful negotiation im grateful to you said azziz youve handled everything extremely well ashore the patient south african search team reached the bristol hotel which had been given to deaken as a backup contact point from the head porter whom they tipped francs suslev was identified as the guest in the harbourfront room on the sixth floor he was registered as r underberg they omitted to make a note of the supposed passport number which was a considerable mistake at one stage the intention had been for the conference to be chaired by the prime minister and to include responsible ministers from the cabinet but it was finally decided to restrict it to service chiefs and their respective intelligence heads for a fuller report to be compiled before positive and direct government involvement muller conducted it from a raised dais in the conference room of the skinner street building easels and blackboards were arranged behind him to accommodate the maps and photographs available the centrepiece was a detailed chart of the west coast of angola namibia and south africa marked with a model of a ship and a dotted line showing the progress of the bellicose against the line at timed and dated intervals were positions obtained from the aerial reconnaissance the last inscription was three hours earlier and the naval chiefofstaff an admiral named hertzog said whats the latest position muller looked instinctively at his watch as of half an hour ago forty miles off luanda he used a pointer indicating the distances between timings from these weve been able to make an estimate of the speed she seems to be making about eight knots still heading south queried the army chief brigadier general althorpe still heading south confirmed muller whats the information from namibia said althorpe he hesitated looking at his own intelligence officer weve isolated reports but no indication of any concerted mobilization i ordered the highest priority the moment the risk seemed genuine said muller theres certainly indication of assembly at tses gibeon and maltahohe a lot of movement farther north in the caprivi strip too were not limiting reconnaissance to the ocean said the air force chief a man named youngblood within twentyfour hours i hope to have some definite information after his meeting with lerclerc deaken had itemized everything he could remember from the cargo manifest of the bellicose muller had duplicated it and made a copy available to everyone in the room hertzog raised his sheet and said theres too much here for any seaborne unloading itll have to dock benguela is the most obvious place if she doesnt turn east towards luanda said muller theres mocamedes but thats far too close to our border i dont think theyd risk it althorpe gestured towards the enlarged map there are thousands of inlets and bays now muller lifted his copy of the cargo list even if the ships derrick was capable of offloading them the freighters draught would keep her offshore shed need to be alongside youngblood looked sideways towards the army contingent any indication of a soviet buildup althorpe nodded for his intelligence chief to reply he was a thin man named harper whose adams apple bobbed nervously up and down when he spoke its always difficult to estimate as you know moscow usually avoids direct involvement by working through cubans or east germans we dont estimate theyve more than a hundred soviet personnel on the ground youngblood turned to muller do you agree muller hesitated not wanting to contradict a colleague about a hundred military advisers he said but i think in angola and probably namibia too there are more straight intelligence operatives who arent bothering with any sort of advisory cover what about suslev the photograph located after deakens photofit recreation had been enlarged and occupied almost all of one blackboard muller said we dont know a lot the indications are that he isnt kgb but an officer in the military division of russian intelligence the gru certainly a longserving officer positively identified in angola in and then when this photograph was taken no sightings for over a year and then a brief appearance about four or five months ago after that nothing anything yet from europe demanded hertzog muller shook his head they havent had a lot of time swarts a good man one of the best in my service and hes got a good team im concerned about the involvement of deaken said youngblood not a good history im quite aware of it said muller hes not acting as a provocateur im sure sos his father whos been named today as minister for interior reminded althorpe its a delicate situation which im also aware of assured muller and so are the people ive got with him in france swart has got two briefs the first is to find out what the hell the russians are doing the second is to avoid any embarrassment that might affect a member of our government our involvement with deaken will be kept to the minimum seems to me that the apple splits almost perfectly in half said hertzog the freighter is one problem europe another i dont want that weaponry ashore said althorpe positively he patted the list on the table before him if there is mobilization and if this stuff is distributed then well have the biggest conflict yet on our hands maybe not just one battle probably several which means more international attention and more un criticism thered be a damned sight more international attention if i intercept it at sea said hertzog the bellicose is miles out of our territorial waters it would be piracy whos going to know about it demanded althorpe are the arms suppliers going to protest and be shown to have been starting a war or the shippers to have been carrying the weapons to it and any swapo publicity isnt going to worry us thats not going to be our decision pointed out muller thats a political conclusion which is why were having this meeting today weve all got to make recommendation prevention is always better than cure insisted althorpe mine is that it should be stopped mine too concurred youngblood with the advantage weve got wed be mad to let one round of ammunition ashore what about europe said hertzog i dont think we can be definite about anything until we know whats happening there true agreed muller but i think we should make contingency plans mine are already in operation said hertzog weve sailed vladimir suslev emerged onto monacos boulevard albert and on the comer bought a copy of that days nice matin glancing idly at the headlines as he walked to the car the russian drove slowly along the coast road going eastwards initially before branching up on the inland road that would give him his route to sisteron from the latest report from lloyds and from levcos in athens the bellicose was supposed to be making twelve knots which meant algiers in two days three at the outside if the weather worsened and that was unlikely he had taken the trouble to get the longrange weather forecast suslev smiled settling himself back into the seat three days and it would all be over he would be on his way back to moscow for the promotion and the honours he had been promised and which he had earned and for which his wife had suffered he knew that was how she regarded it from his leave in moscow it would take a long time for them to reestablish the relationship they once had had but he would do it he determined she was so beautiful so loyal maybe he had been wrong expecting her to make the sacrifice for his career he didnt think she would feel that way for long when she saw what it meant for them the route was crowded as he had found it the first time but today he drove without impatience actually admiring the scenery it was prettier than anything around moscow even the hills in springtime after the snow went he had heard that sochi on the black sea had a climate like this perhaps he would be permitted to go there as part of the reward she would enjoy that levy was expecting him coming from the house as soon as he saw the car well talk afterwards said suslev all right said the israeli why the newspaper it proves the date im glad its being done this way i decided it was better said the russian easily he remained in the car hunched down in his seat as karen and azziz were brought out into the garden at the side of the house and posed with the copy of nice matin held before them levy took two polaroid pictures plucking them one after the other from the camera and watching them develop the south africans had a more elaborate camera with a telescopic lens and they managed four exposures before the driver frightened of discovery said ok thats enough and drove on there was a communal table as there had been in the farmhouse at rixheim and the israelis gathered around it for the final briefing from the man they knew as underberg everything is going as planned he said its going to be a perfect operation there were smiles and nods of satisfaction leiberwitz said how soon two days three at the outside said the russian thats why i wanted this meeting weve got to move to the next stage now getting the stuff into israel said levy suslev nodded which normally would be impossible he said but ive found a way there were more smiles im calculating that the freighter will get back on the thirteenth the excuse for returning officially will be engine trouble he said all its documentation is in order so therell be no need for customs examination ive hired two lorries the ships crane is sufficient to offload what we want i want it put into the lorries to convey the impression that were going to try to move the stuff by road how is it going to be moved asked greening ive chartered a smaller freighter said suslev the marriv its docking on the twelfth we just use the lorries as carriers to transfer from one vessel to another and then sail up the mediterranean to haifa im calculating five days for the voyage but its not important because there will be contact ashore in the customs department at haifa theres a friend hanan cohenhis parents were among the first to be thrown out of hammit now theyve no business no home just some paltry compensation when he hears the marriv is approaching hell arrange to be on duty everything will get straight in do we all sail asked levy suslev nodded its the obvious way to get back he said when you disembark in haifa ill be waiting it sounds remarkably simple said kahane admiringly it is said suslev with a grin like i said its going to be a perfect operation how about the exchange the boy and the woman said levy immediately aware of the concentrated attention upon himself nothing can go wrong here either said suslev succinctly he explained how the return was to be made in a way to protect all of them conscious as he talked of the tension forming among the men that entrusts everything to levy complained leiberwitz the russian frowned levys in command that was the arrangement we made before we left israel i dont think he should be any longer said leiberwitz making an open challenge there was no place in any contingency plan for these people to argue among themselves and suslev felt a spurt of uncertainty why not he said i dont think hes impartial any more said leiberwitz nothing is going to endanger our mission said levy well get the weapons as we intendedand well stage the protest as we intended what about the woman demanded leiberwitz suslev saw levy flush and began to understand youve heard the arrangements said levy tightly shes returned like the boy why shouldnt she be said suslev to leiberwitz the huge man sneered towards levy and said im not sure hell be able to part with her suslev made a quick assessment and decided that the situation didnt present a danger to his plansas a distraction for them it could even work to his advantage well he looked questioningly at levy it neednt concern anyone in this room came the reply its not going to cause any problems was it wise suslev said feeling he should be seen to take some position i dont have to account to you or anybody else said levy tightlipped what about your wife said leiberwitz thats my business snapped levy the flush had gone now the man was pale with anger the russian looked round him trying to gauge the feeling of the other men to levy he said do i have your promise this wont end stupidly you dont have to ask me that i think i do levy hesitated then said yes my promise to the rest of them suslev said shimeon has been involved in this since the beginning its as much his action as it is mine im not interested morally in whats happenedonly that nothing interferes with the success of the operation im prepared to accept his assurance levy relaxed slightly only leiberwitz had spoken in open criticism realized suslev deciding to take the risk he said should there be a vote on it yes said leiberwitz at once in favour of shimeon remaining in command proposed suslev he raised his hand as he spoke kahane and sela responded immediately katz hesitated and then he came out in favour seeing the direction of the feeling habel finally raised his hand in support against said suslev leiberwitz and greening voted simultaneously shimeon remains in charge said suslev its a mistake insisted leiberwitz the matter is closed said suslev but the tension between them increased when suslev asked to be left alone with levy for the handover briefing the russian produced a map to ensure that levy knew the identity of the place then passed over the keys and a photograph of the villa where the boy was to be left its miles from anywhere said the russian no one will find him accidentally i dont like the idea of abandoning him like this protested the israeli theres a good reason i understand that said levy and its good i just dont like the idea of leaving him if azziz is sensible itll only be for an hour or two assured the russian he left the sisteron villa thirty minutes later the developed proof in his pocket the internecine squabbling was a definite advantage decided suslev not that he was taking any chances there was a freighter called the marriv due in port on the twelfth there wasnt anyone in haifa named hanan cohen though it didnt matter he was sure they wouldnt think of doublechecking there was no reason for them to do so they trusted him edward makimber determined against telling the rest of the swapo command of the difficulties involving the bellicose that had all been resolved so the only effect would be to make them uneasy and they were nervous enough as it was from what i saw in marseilles i estimate it will take two days to unload he said it didnt take that long to put the stuff aboard in france but the port facilities were better there think we should truck them directly inland to the dispersal points if we allow three days for that then we can commence on the fifteenth and launch the attack on the seventeenth exactly on schedule said arthur kapuuo the overall military commander its going to be a spectacular success said makimber confidently he wished he could understand why the russians had warned him about the interception in dakar he would have thought it more in their interest to let the consignment be turned back to prove the unreliability of outside suppliers it was the only uncertainty in an otherwise perfect operation and makimber didnt like uncertainties karen sat silently listening to levys account of the argument in the downstairs room when he finished she said im sorry for causing difficulties he smiled reaching out to touch her face it isnt your fault he said dont be silly is it a problem no said levy at once leiberwitz has always been jealous of my being in command he thinks he should have been chosen in israel why wasnt he hes too impulsive he doesnt think things through just like us said karen the package was brought aboard on the evening mail run from the harbour masters office the two photographs protected by hard cardboard and carefully sealed grearson unwrapped them and laid them before his employer the boy was holding the newspaper staring straight at the camera the woman was looking to one side obviously distracted by something or someone from the drawer of one of the large bureaux azziz took out the first ransom picture putting it next to the new ones for comparison he leaned forward as if caught by something groping into the drawer for a magnifying glass and adjusting it over the prints hes thinner said azziz and theyve beaten him he offered the lawyer the glass look he said theres bruising on his face its very faint said grearson it might be some fault in the printing beaten insisted azziz the pigs have kept him short of food and beaten him but at least we know hes alive said grearson he indicated the copy of nice matin and close not close enough said azziz he brought the photographs together like a man collecting playing cards the navigating officer had made the calculations he said according to the supposed speed of the bellicose it should be just north of casablanca thats about a day and a half from algiers time for the hydra star to sail said grearson azziz nodded are evans and his people ready absolutely evans knows to expect a message off algiers yes said grearson theres no radiotelephone communication so it will have to be by cable theres no way they will be able to know it isnt deaken replying azziz looked at the collection of tapes on your next contact we should get the handover instructions then right i want you to be the one who collects him said azziz personally grearson hesitated and then said of course youll need someone to act as a liaison said azziz suddenly there cant be any response from the men on the boat until weve got the boy back evans would be the obvious candidate said grearson azziz shook his head there needs to be a command on the boat take one of the others ill arrange it said grearson azziz looked down at the most recent pictures showing the fading traces of his sons beating then up at the lawyer i want them hurt he said quietly make sure evans understands that theyve hurt my son and now i want them hurt in return they were all assembled at the villa on the aubagne road when the lawyer arrived he took the photographs wanting them all to know what the boy looked like if the handover was made anywhere near the supposed weapons exchange evans studied them first then passed them round to the assembled group do you think theyre marks of a beating asked grearson could be said evans mr azziz wants retribution sure said evans youve already made that clear there was to be half payment in advance reminded marinetti forever practical grearson unclipped the briefcase and passed around the envelopes to marinetti he said therell be little need for any expert explosive use it wouldnt seem so said evans so ill have marinetti as the liaison decided the lawyer he can come back with me to the yacht and be with me when we exchange the boy marinetti smiled around at the others ill be thinking of you guys cramped up in that shitty old barge he said getting the boy back safely is the most important part of the operation said grearson the smile was wiped from marinettis face well get him back he said evans stood a signal for the rest as they started to file from the room grearson said good luck luck hasnt got anything to do with it said evans the photographs had to be developed so it was not until evening that they were brought to the hotel negresco by then there had already been protracted telephone conversations with muller in pretoria about the location of the kidnap house and of the second armscarrying freighter aware of deakens concern swart let him examine them first deaken stared down at karen blinking the mistiness from his eyes neither picture was perfectly in focus and each was obscured by the blurred foliage in the immediate foreground of the shubbery through which they were taken karen didnt look as deaken had expected her to he had anticipated that the strain of captivity would show that she would look as rigidfaced as the boy instead she appeared relaxed almost carefree he looked up at swart whitefaced and said the promise was to help me get her out not yet what do you mean not yet swart nodded towards the telephone my instructions are to find out a little more first we dont understand enough the difference of interest remembered deaken fuck understanding enough he said we know where she is where they both are lets get them out no i dont need you said deaken dont be ridiculous said swart you cant do anything by yourself youd be killed and get your wife and the boy killed as well help me then we will said swart but not yet we know shes all right that theyre both all right wait how the hell can you expect me to wait swart looked at the photographs of his own family no he said distantly how can i expect you to deaken was about to speak when the telephone rang it was a short conversation as he replaced the receiver swart said the ship has sailed from marseilles some men went aboard at the last moment and then it sailed half an hour ago they maintained the separation of rixheim levy taking his meals with karen and the boy while everyone else ate in the kitchen that night azziz said he felt too unwell to eat so it was just the two of them at dinner a subdued awkward meal with long silences between them what is it said karen at last she pushed her plate away revolving her wine glass between her hands hope he isnt going to become ill again said the israeli i dont think he is karen hadnt told him about her escape conversation with azziz if the boy got away it would upset whatever it was they were planning possibly extend the time she could be with the man she loved he looked at her curiously why do you say that i looked in she said theres no fever she paused then and said its not just the boy is it no he admitted what then there was some other discussion today apart from the row everything is almost ready he couldnt look at her when tomorrow weve got to be ready for tomorrow she felt sick and a weakness seemed to permeate her body numbing her legs whats going to happen the weapons were getting from azziz are on a boat itll be here very soon now when we get the shipment the boy is to be returned to his father what about me both of you said levy he reached out to grasp her hand what are we going to do he didnt answer she took her hand away tell me what were going to do i dont know he said emptyvoiced and still not looking at her do you want me you know the answer to that do you want me yes but you want rebecca as well he humped his shoulders a gesture of helplessness its more than that he said theres the protest about the settlements theres got to be the protest but its rebecca as well isnt it she persisted you love her dont you yes he said shortly shit whys it got to be like this i dont want to go back to richard she said its not his child its yours i wont go back to him karen knew she was being irrational ridiculous but everything that happened to her was irrational and ridiculous she refused to be shaken awake from the dream i dont want you to go back to richard so tell me the alternative theres no way we can stay together not immediately anyway she snatched at the straw not immediately you didnt think i was going to abandon you did you karen was near to tears something like that she said he raised his hand to caress her cheek fool he said softly she bit at his fingers enjoying his touch i love you so much she said i dont know how not yet he said or how long it will take but it wont end tomorrow or the next day ill make something work karen smiled whatever it was he decided however difficult she would go along with it she was consumed by him indifferent to anything or anyone else four hundred yards from where karen sat her husband drove slowly by the house straining through the darkness to make out its shape managing only to locate the tiny squares of light at various windows theres no purpose in everyone losing sleep decided swart the observation will be in shifts the rest of us can try to get some rest in sisteron all right said deaken he screwed around in the seat for a final look soon my darling he thought very soon now the maps and the blackboard were still in place but only deakens father was in the room with muller the intelligence chief tapped his pointer against the map and said the bellicose seems to have stopped off benguela the last reconnaissance report says shes turned back upon herself and is steaming in circles waiting for contact thats what it seems like theres to be a final meeting but the consensus in the cabinet is for a preemptive strikean interception at sea i know said muller nothing more from europe not since the other freighter sailed the timing is important isnt it said piet deaken if we have to intercept the bellicose in advance of any exchange in europe my daughterinlaw could be killed yes admitted muller the old man turned away from the dais looking out over the south african capital my vote is for interception he said the south african intelligence service had established their electronic eavesdropping headquarters at ondangua as near to the angolan border as possible with equipment sufficiently sophisticated and powerful to intercept all commercial wavelengths as well as dial searches for clandestine transmissions edward makimbers contact with the bellicose was on a normal commercial link giving them perfect reception victory muttered muller when the coded message was brought to him he looked up shaking his head at the theatricality there was going to be a victory but not the sort they imagined evans knocked politely at the door looking through the glass for papass nod of agreement before going out onto the bridge the captain of the hydra star stood in front of the helmsman close to the radar screen we should be approaching algiers soon after dawn he said and then we wait said evans i control this ship at all times said the captain firmly you made that clear from the start im making it clear again so therell be no misunderstandings there wont be i know what sort of men you are said papas know what you do im not having my ship endangered no matter what instructions i get from athens evans hoped papas wasnt going to become a nuisance the interception of the guerrilla communique to the bellicose reached the south african cabinet towards the end of its discussion when the decision had already been practically made but the confirmation of swapo involvement made the vote unanimous the order to the army navy and air force was accorded topsecurity classification and a second cabinet meeting was scheduled for the afternoon to consider the countrys reaction to the inevitable international protest by the time the order reached admiral hertzog he already had two freighters and a cruiser carrying a helicopter squadron of marine commandos off mocmedes but well outside any recognized limit of territorial jurisdiction he immediately signalled the speed to be increased from cruising to full and for the course to be altered northeast the air and army strength in namibia was already high because of the conflict but three additional detachments of commandos were airlifted into walvis bay in cs on standby readiness the air force had maintained a permanent highaltitude reconnaissance over the bellicose but now an additional and specially equipped c was sent into position it was in fact a flying laboratory utilizing technology developed by israeli scientists and capable of completely immobilizing the electrical capability of any given target the target was the bellicose captain erlander frowned at the radar screen which he had been watching for the approach of makimbers launch and said bloody things fogged edmunson who had been attempting visual sighting from the wing came back into the bridge housing but before he reached the screen the rear door opened from the radio shack and the operator said trouble sir radio is out what about the secondary set demanded the first officer that too a sunspot suggested erlander dont see what else it could be said the radio operator indications arent the same though edmunson looked briefly at the snowed image never seen a sunspot do that either he said both men stared in the direction of the unseen angolan coast the skyline was hazed with dawn mist the sea flat and unbroken think there will be repair facilities ashore said edmunson we dont know the port reminded erlander its got to be benguela surely then why all this nonsense of cruising off and awaiting the arrival of a launch said the captain why couldnt we have gone straight in what time did makimber give asked the first officer he estimated ninesaid he was leaving at dawn the african had kept to his timing and the departure had been monitored by the reconnaissance plane its signal to walvis bay was relayed at once to the approaching ships the reconnaissance aircraft kept up a steady flow of information enabling hertzogs navigating officers to chart both course and speed for makimbers launch so they could achieve the blocking position their commanderinchief wanted there he is said edmunson pointing to starboard the captain stood alongside the first officer and watched as a black smudge on the horizon formed into the recognizable shape of a launch it was large maybe forty tons and moving fast through the water both men went out onto the wing to look through glasses quite a deputation said erlander counting the other africans grouped around makimber ill be glad when weve offloaded and are underway again said edmunson with a sailors superstition this has been a funny trip from the very beginning from inside the bridge the radio operator said ive checked right back to the radio mast itself cant find anything wrong at all check again said erlander i dont want to be at sea with dead electrics he signalled dead slow and gave the course so that the bulk of his ship would provide some lee for the smaller launch it maintained its speed flamboyantly finishing with a wide arc to bring itself alongside the bellicose makimber led the way aboard followed by four other africans makimber was clearly pleased with himself his face lit by a constant smile youre on time he said it is good very good are there docking facilities asked erlander everything assured makimber benguela dombe grande said makimber theres a river anchorage ive got some heavy stuff said erlander i need to be alongside everything will be okay everything said makimber in a voice that lacked confidence what about repair facilities repair facilities we seem to have some radio trouble said erlander we might need some electricians not at dombe grande said makimber we could go into benguela afterwards suggested edmunson to erlander wed like to inspect the cargo said makimber erlander led the way to a lower stairway bringing them out on the open deck again several of them were suddenly aware of the noise but it was edmunson who spoke gesturing over the stem of the ship what the hell the helicopters were coming in low practically at wavetop level and out of the rising sun like a swarm of black insects the formation split at the last moment arcing out of the direct line of the freighter but pulling into a tight circle erlander realized the four africans with makimber had pistols in their hands and that two were supporting themselves against the deck rail taking aim dont be bloody ridiculous he shouted theyre gunships for christs sake the helicopters were circling sufficiently close for the cannon to be visible through the cutaway sides heavycalibre weapons with their bandoliers of tracers looped at the ready there was an operator and armourer at every opening one of the africans began shooting wildly hand bucking with the recoil from his pistol the answering fire was deafening timed bursts coming from each helicopter as it reached the bridge area shells from the first ricocheted harmlessly from the flat decking at the stem the others were aimed intentionally wide as well either in the air or plucking up a churn of spray from the head or sides of the vessel erlander and edmunson threw themselves below the rail line what can we do said edmunson frantically nothing said erlander he had always known it would happen one day he wondered how difficult it was going to be from now on makimber crawled up alongside there are rockets in the cargo he said get us down to the holds dont be stupid said erlander wearily there are eight of them up there where do you think they came from theres obvious backup we dont stand a chance look said edmunson in confirmation through the rail venting the warships could be seen approaching in lineabreast formation i want the rockets shouted makimber erlander screwed around so that he could sit with his back to the rail were in international waters he said we stand a chance if we argue if we try to fight theyll blow us out of the water were sending men aboard announced a metallic voice echoing across the water from a bullhorn if theres any resistance the next shot wont be fired wide erlander and edmunson stood up and at the captains gesture distanced themselves from the stillcrouching africans six of the helicopters maintained the encirclement but the remaining two dropped low again flattening the water with their downdraught erlander watched as the rubberized dinghies flopped into the water to selfinflate before the wetsuited men splashed alongside immediately hauling themselves aboard it was expert and quick outboard engines starting almost at once still unsure whether there would be any further firing from the bellicose the dinghies split wide and approached from different angles overhead the gunships stopped circling hovering instead in an uneven but solid line their cannon trained upon the bellicose jesus said edmunson his voice a mixture of horror and admiration the commando group was ten strong they came alongside the launch occupying that first four spread out along its deck covering the higher superstructure of the freighter with mm machine guns to enable the remaining six to climb up the rope ladder that makimber and his party had used earlier they had kept their rubber suits on even the hoods so there was no designation of rank my ship is in international waters said erlander right agreed the unidentified leader a muscular moustachioed man so you have no lawful authority for this attack youre committing an act of piracy right again said the man erlander felt a lurch of despair as he recognized the accent get off my ship he said bollocks said the man and so it comes to a happy conclusion i hope so said grearson instinctively he gazed from the kiosk towards the surrounding buildings wondering where the bastard was he hoped he would be present at the exchange and get his ass burned by evans im glad you were sensible in the end and did everything we wanted shouldnt we be finalizing things said grearson impatiently weve got to be careful set it out demanded grearson it may be that you have something in mind for the handover a little surprise for us so weve got to take precautions against that were going to split them up tewfik and the woman hes going to be taken to an address and left there hell be quite safe and unharmed just unable to move about only the girl will know the address the people who come to meet the freighter wont so therell be no point in seizing them if the exchange goes according to plan then youll be told where the girl is get to her and then you get to the boy no said grearson at once that doesnt give us any guarantee at all it gives you what you want the boy back but on our terms and theyve always been our terms havent they azziz wasnt going to like this tape the lawyer knew the pendulum had swung greatly to his disadvantage how soon after the exchange he said as soon as weve made sure that the weapons are there that theres no stupidity then youll get the address of the woman the same way as you got the two sets of photographs through the harbour masters delivery shes quite close maybe an hour away you should have the boy back two hours after we get what we want he didnt have a choice realized grearson all right he said no stupidity repeated the man the boy is going to be shackled in the cellar of an empty house its in its own grounds so he wouldnt be heard even if he were able to call outwhich he wont be because hell be gagged behave properly and hell be free in two hours do anything silly and hell starve to death do you understand yes said grearson i understand its been a pleasure doing business with you said the russian replacing the telephone he had other calls to make he still hadnt sent the instructions to the ship off algiers and when everything was arranged there were the french police to be alerted were sure the bellicose didnt get a message out before the seizure said muller thank you said piet deaken so your daughterinlaw should still be safe how long can you keep it under wraps asked the old man as long as we want said the security chief days if necessary i hope to god it doesnt go on for days said deaken that girl must be going through hell the noise of revving engines beyond the shuttered windows awoke karen she lay momentarily disoriented and then turned sideways realizing that she was alone in the bed she hadnt been aware of levy leaving she was dressed and waiting when leiberwitz came for her gloatingly hostile its over he said karen stared back saying nothing levy would keep his promise not to abandon hershe was sure of it she wished he had woken her up earlier youre to come now said leiberwitz azziz was already at the table when she got downstairs with kahane standing guard at the door it was open and through it she could see lorries lined in the driveway theyre taking me somewhere said azziz what another house said the boy why he shrugged i dont know levy entered hurriedly from the garden flushed and obviously excited his demeanour altered when he saw her and she got the impression that he was embarrassed he said something to kahane and leiberwitz which she didnt catch and then came farther into the room to the boy he said ready the arab stood uncertainly and kahane called from the doorway well take you to the car levy waited until azziz had left with the two men and then said to her ill be back when soon maybe an hour leiberwitz said it was over sneered at me i said id find a way hurry back sure he reached out awkwardly touching her hand and then appeared to change his mind turning abruptly from the house she stayed alone for several moments then followed to the doorway the lorries prevented her seeing which car he had gone to it was only when it reversed out onto the road that she saw he was alone with azziz and remembered the boys determination to escape stop she called but levy was too far away to hear the car turned left heading towards the coast road azziz sat uncomfortably his left wrist handcuffed to the securing clip of the car seat belt his right hand clenched into a fist of frustration there was a browning automatic pistol in the luggage shelf in front of levy instead of the earlier magnum by tonight it should all be over youll be with your father said levy hell get you said azziz he wont be beaten by you maybe hell try said levy but the arab wouldnt succeed it was an extremely clever idea to sail to haifa they had been fortunate establishing links with underberg so early in the protest movement beside him azziz was concentrating upon the road he saw the sign to pertuis and then almost at once the turning towards aixenprovence and felt a stab of satisfaction at having guessed where they were during his conversation with karen how much farther he said not far said levy he looked quickly to the boy then away again youre going to be left by yourself he said when weve got what we want your father will be told where you are you wont be in any danger i promise you hell be told levy skirted aix slowing at the signposts for the indication to allauch that underberg had identified at his briefing he found it at last turning to the left and driving with the directions underberg had given him held against the wheel the villa was to the right just off the road the high wall and metal gates exactly as the man had described the padlock on the gate was well oiled and opened easily to the key underberg had provided carefully levy took the car through and then locked the gate behind him the house was just visible at the end of the curving drive i could die left here protested the boy said your father would be told what happens if something goes wrong it wont the driveway curved smoothly up to the villa which was shuttered and closed levy was still reluctant to leave azziz by himself he tried to suppress the doubt realizing there was nothing he could do to alter arrangements now he took the browning from the front compartment and got out of the car leaving the drivers door open he tossed two keys separately onto the seat and said the first unlocks the handcuffsrelease yourself the second is to the front door azziz twisted across the car freeing himself he got out of the vehicle massaging his wrist the handcuff still dangling from it into the house said levy gesturing with the gun azziz looked at him contemptuously and then moved ahead towards the villa he fumbled at the door appearing to have difficulty inserting the key and then pushed into the house levy followed too quickly and it was then that the boy made his move as levy came in azziz slammed the door back abruptly so that the edge caught the israelis gun hand levy felt a moment of agony in his wrist then numbness the gun skittered away across the darkened hallway azziz was already on the attack the handcuff chain between his fingers swinging the free armlet as a weapon he caught levy high on the forehead a glancing insubstantial blow but sufficient to bring tears to his eyes blinding him he lashed out hitting azziz in the shoulder the arab staggered momentarily offbalanced but recovered almost at once he was fit from the sports regime at the ecole gagner he swept the handcuff towards levy again but it was a feint as levy tried to dodge azziz swung with his right hand all the anger and frustration of the past days put into the punch it caught levy high on the side of the head and he grunted from the stinging pain that reverberated through his skull he crashed back against the door causing it to slam shut the action shut off any immediate chance of escape for azziz but put the hallway in greater darkness through his blurred vision levy saw azziz staring wildly around trying to locate the gun as the boy moved levy lashed out with his foot it was a desperate but lucky kick thumping in just below the boys knee azziz screamed with pain stumbling but kept going towards the gun levy could see it now right against the stairway which arced up around the wall of the highdomed vestibule azziz reached it seconds ahead of levy his fingers actually grasping the butt before the israeli dived on him seizing his wrist azziz tried to use the dangling handcuff again as a weapon but they were too close now rolling and grappling over the tiled floor clawing and gouging at each other azziz tried to bring his knee up into levys groin but missed striking his thigh instead sensation was returning to levys numbed arm he thrust upwards getting the heel of his hand beneath the boys chin forcing his head upwards at the same time clutching the wrist of the gun hand he could feel azzizs teeth grating under the pressure the boy clubbed wildly with the handcuff pounding levy on the neck and shoulders and twisting desperately to free his upthrust chin when he did so he snapped down trying to bite levys fingers the israeli rolled away to avoid the teeth and his grip momentarily loosened on azzizs wrist levy found himself trapped against the bottom step his shoulder caught beneath its lip the boy had secured his hold upon the gun and was bringing the barrel around towards him levy slashed out with a chopping motion that knocked the gun against the step and with unthinking ferocity he used his foot again stamping down on the tightly clenched hand he heard the crunch as azzizs fingers splintered between his heel and the metal of the automatic the boy screamed the gun clattered back against the marble and levy grabbed it rolling farther away and then swivelling back to point it at the arab fool he gasped you stupid bloody little fool azziz was crouched doubled over trying not to cry his crushed hand pressed against his stomach youve broken it he groaned youve broken my hand let me see azziz stayed bent over i said let me see azziz reluctantly extended his right hand the wrist supported in the palm of his left the index finger was bent awkwardly broken and the one alongside was already swelling blackly discoloured you cant leave me like this said the boy ive got to said levy they were all nervous and excited laughing too easily and too loudly only leiberwitz showed any control remaining with her in the main living room after levy had gone karen knew he wanted her to make some request like being allowed into the garden so that he would have the pleasure of refusing her instead karen got up from the table and started to walk towards the stairs where are you going said the bearded israeli to my room you didnt ask please may i go to my room she said with weary disdain leiberwitz considered for a moment for effect then said ok karen sat slumpshouldered on the bed staring down at the floor it seemed inconceivable that soon in hours or maybe days she would be reunited with richard be kissed by him having to pretend she wanted him she wouldnt pretend she decided couldnt pretend shed tell him as soon as they met apologize for the hurt beg his forgiveness even but she wouldnt pretend maybe he wouldnt be too surprised not for long anyway there had been too many arguments over the last few months for him not to know she was fed up inevitable that they would separate peculiar though the circumstances might be what had happened was just bringing it all to a head she looked up at movement from the doorway i know his wife said leiberwitz i know rebecca i suppose you would im godfather to yatzik hes told me about rebecca and the children said karen hes sacrificed the right to expect to be in charge why are you telling me this i want you to know what youve cost him but he is still in charge isnt he here maybe said leiberwitz he might not be later four miles away in the grand hotel du cours in the town of sisteron deaken looked angrily at swart and said theyre moving for christs sake the freighters gone and now theyve got lorries at the villa how much longer are we going to wait soon now soothed the south african unhappy at the way they were using the man mitri came with his customary discreet quietness into the stateroom to give azziz the message that had been relayed from the hydra star the arab scanned it then looked up at grearson and marinetti theyve received instructions he said theyve got to go to toulon a berth has been scheduled for them there they wont do anything until theyre sure the boys ok said marinetti theyre the best trained group of guys ive come across grearson turned at the sound of the departing tender carole and the other girls talked about spending a couple of days ashore shopping said azziz i thought it best to get them out of the way grearson hoped carole wouldnt be gone too long after this was over he wanted to relax kahane was facing the door and saw him first starting up with concern then the others turned and greening said what happened on the way back to sisteron the cut over levys eye had begun to bleed again and he had completed the journey with a handkerchief over the wound he made a break said levy so you needed help there too said leibenwitz hes where he should be waiting to be freed said levy irritated by the constant challenging azziz had started to cry when he had realized that he was to be left alone without help the defiance going at last levy couldnt shake off the feeling of sickness at abandoning him his only concern was to hurry now so that the boy could be released everythings ready said kahane lorries gassed up everything wheres the woman shes safe and untouched said leiberwitz he paused and then said no one else wanted to levy moved forward instantly aware of leiberwitz tensing wanting a physical confrontation he stopped fighting for control leiberwitz smiled as aware as everyone else in the room of the retreat shes necessary for what is to happen said levy we know how necessary she is sneered leiberwitz it was a childlike exchange but he was losing ground levy realized and there was already sufficient disarray among them the freighter is coming into toulon he announced there was a stir among the group breaking the tension between levy and leiberwitz levy went on we only want the small arms rifles the rockets and the launchers according to underberg the marriv is at berth thirtyeight therell be people there waiting underbergs people the guns are coming into berth twenty the attention upon him now was absolute and levy decided they were back under controleveryone except leiberwitz will there be any resistance asked greening levy shook his head thats why the boys been moved and why only the girl is going to know where he is azziz has been warned that you dont know anything that it would be pointless putting up a fight because only his son will suffer you know said leiberwitz arent you coming to the docks not immediately said levy but im coming dont want anything to start until i get there so who decided you wouldnt break under pressure havent we other people to fight said levy there was so much more to do and already he felt very tired sure youll still be able to persisted leiberwitz yes snapped levy ill be able to already the boy had been chained in the house at allauch for three hours lets get going he said trying to indicate an energy he didnt feel obediently they all stood except leiberwitz arent you up to it said levy scoring the other man hurried to his feet well see soon enough he said remember warned levy stopping them at the door i dont want any approach to the freighter until i get there leiberwitz looked to levy towards the stairway and then back to levy again ill be there he said will you levy remained in the downstairs room while the lorries reversed out onto the road and then accelerated away at the foot of the stairway he halted hand against the balustrade thinking back to leiberwitzs question throughout all the planning and preparation he had never had any doubts but now he did he wasnt sure he wanted to fight levy sighed and began climbing the stairs this is it said swart as soon as he learned of the lorries departure the people with him were already briefed moving at once to their cars the man he had sent for deaken caught up with swart in the car park hes not in his room and i cant find him anywhere in the hotel damn said the director his wifes still at the house said the observer who had returned with the news about the lorries just one man with her as far as we could guess weve still got a car at the house said swart yes its the weapons shipment thats important thats what were here for what about deaken swart only hesitated for a moment then he said leave him nothing can happen to her if weve got the house covered deaken decided he had been stupid to believe their promises theyd never intended to help him they just wanted to use him like every other bastard had wanted to use him since the whole thing began no one gave a damn about karen not azziz or grearson or his father or muller or swart no one bastards all of them he didnt need them didnt need any fucking one of them despite the burning anger deaken still moved carefully along the road sure that once swart noticed his absence from the hotel he would try to intercept to prevent any interference with their plan of campaign bugger them there was only one thing that mattered that had ever mattered getting karen back he had much to apologize to her for he knew the ridiculous unnecessary delaysdays when he should have acted instead of letting other people take control he walked alert to the slightest danger twice jumping sideways and concealing himself behind the bordering hedge to avoid being spotted by any passing car on the third occasion a whole cavalcade roared by and when deaken risked a glance it was too late to confirm whether it was the south africans looking for him he wished he had a gun but he didnt imagine any of the people he had seen issued with them would have been careless enough to leave one lying around but then he didnt know how to use a gun he didnt know anything about safety catches and cocking mechanisms or automatic firing so how was he going to get her away deaken was forced to accept that he didnt know just that somehow he would the ground dipped and then rose again to provide a vantage point from which to observe the hollow where the house lay trees obscured it up to the roofline the road and the distant knoll from which he knew the south africans kept observation were completely hidden but deaken realized that by cutting away from the road he would be able to make his approach without being visible to anyone and the gathering darkness would help too he hurried stumbling through the grass anxious now that he was so close and slowing only when he got to the ditch and the hedge towering above it he had to move with the utmost care now not to make any noise he didnt risk jumping slithering instead down one side and then clawing up the other he was glad the ditch bottom was clean and summerdried wincing against the sudden snap of a twig beneath his feet he parted the foliage fear stabbed into him when he realized the driveway was empty of lorries then he saw the solitary car and the pendulum swung if they were moving her they would be more likely to use the car than the lorries the lorries had to be for the guns he was at the side of the house the drive and the road beyond to his left the house almost immediately in front the rear and the outbuildings to his right he moved sideways following the hedge conscious as he moved that the garden curved to provide even greater concealment from the house the bank rose again and had it not been so dark deaken guessed the view of the surrounding countryside would have been impressive the hedge was sparse here and he had no difficulty pushing through deaken bent against the slope of the hill not wanting to drop noisily downwards into any unseen dip lights in an upstairs room guided him through the gloom of the garden his toe stubbed against the edge of the patio at the rear of the house and he slowed further edging his feet forward tensed against any noisy collision at the house he pressed his ear against a darkened downstairs window listening for sounds everything seemed quiet deserted a double door was alongside deaken pressed against it to lessen any sound then cautiously turned the handle there was the faintest sound the creak of wooden frames parting from wooden surrounds and then the door gave the russian looked regretfully around the luxury room at the bristol hotel and then for the last time out over the harbour towards the glittering outline of the scheherazade he left abruptly carrying his own luggage down into the foyer he paid his bill and went through the ritual of assuring the receptionist that he had enjoyed his stay and would come again wishing it were true on the front he paused savouring the warm scented nighttime air and then got into the rented car for the journey along the corniche he had purposely left three hours before his flight wanting to enjoy the drive he was looking forward to going home it was the old part of the commercial docks scheduled for redevelopment and therefore being run down some wharves and their container sheds already abandoned cranes like decaying skeletons where they had been half disassembled for their scrapmetal value marinetti drove only using sidelights even though many of the road lights were out and hadnt been replaced foot depressed lightly on the throttle so there was only the faintest hum from the engine could fight a war with cover like this said marinetti we arent going to fight anything or anyone until we get the boy back reminded grearson twenty identified marinetti grearson strained just able to pick out the berth number painted on the slanted roof of the wharf shed it had to be one of the last operational moorings in this part of the docks he decided only three of the five arc lights set into the shed roof were working and in front of them three cranes stood sleeping no stevedores said marinetti its supposed to be engine trouble with engineers not needed until tomorrow reminded grearson remembering the instructions that had been relayed by evans from the hydra star marinetti reversed the vehicle into a shed a full berth away from that designated for the returning freighter manoeuvring it into the shadow of a high wall he killed the lights and then wound down the window put yours down too he ordered the lawyer what for said grearson noises said the soldier you can always hear before you can see grearson did what he was told far beyond the waiting berth there was the glow of the active section of the docks and he could just detect the distant whine of machinery and the water slapping gently against the sea wall unseen in the darkness there was a scuffling movement and grearson shifted uncomfortably knowing it was foraging rats marinetti saw the lorries first there he said softly pointing leiberwitz was in the lead lorry with kahane and greening beside him in the cab katz sela and habel were in the second vehicle immediately behind its not here yet said kahane unnecessarily its not scheduled for another two hours said leiberwitz he had got in the parting shot but the anger still burned through him over the confrontation with levy nice and quiet said greening itll be easy to unload kahane peered at his watch wonder how long itll be before shimeon gets here depends how difficult it is for him to get out of bed said leiberwitz havent we had enough of that said kahane wearily he doesnt seem to said leiberwitz all three reacted nervously to the noise then relaxed when they realized it was katz and sela who had drawn up behind in their lorry and were now standing on the dock leiberwitz wound down the window what happens if levy doesnt show up we go ahead said leiberwitz that isnt what was agreed said katz have you got a better idea there was no challenge from either katz or kahane katz moved away from the lorry going farther towards the waters edge from their vantage point marinetti said i count five but think one stayed in that second lorry tewfik said grearson no said marinetti the arrangement set out on the tape was a clever one dont think it was a bluff it would be too much of a risk for them to take bringing him with them i wonder if theres been any contact with the ship said the lawyer more people hissed marinetti ignoring the question where said grearson squinting into the darkness in the shadows by the shed see that broken crane said marinetti theyre very goodthey know how to use cover swart was in the lead car with four men the rest of the group in the one that followed they had had to move too quickly for any consultation with muller and swart was uneasy at having to make the decision on the spot and deakens disappearance was an additional complication the order had been to stop the lawyer doing anything that might embarrass his father he was glad that at least he had covered the house where the woman was being held he gazed across the intervening water towards the lorries and the men beside them this is where we intercept said swart what about the french authorities asked one of the men in the back theyve let out two shipments said swart im not risking a third where the israelis expected the ship to dock katz who was nearest the water realized that what he had imagined to be stationary navigation lights were moving he hurried back to the first lorry and said somethings coming wheres shimeon said the loyal kahane nervously where do you think said leiberwitz he never gave up he said to wait insisted kahane aboard the freighter harvey evans stepped from the bridge ladder onto the foredeck the assembled men turned at his approach and sneider said looks quiet enough ashore theres plenty of time yet said evans wonder where marinetti is said melvin peering towards the deserted dockside unless hes got the boy there wont be any action the moneys just as good said sneider why get our asses shot off if we dont have to theres an awful lot of crew around said evans according to my count said bartlett were each of us being covered by at least two he spoke looking towards the hatch area where twelve crewmen were attempting to look busy heaving tarpaulin off the metal hatch covers evans nodded and ive just had another lecture from the captain about the safety of his ship always had him pegged as a sneaky little bastard said sneider evans looked to hinkler and bartlett he said i want you two against the offshore rail just watch our backs if we have to move and theres any attempt to stop us give them a burst over their heads i dont want to kill anyonejust frighten them what happens if they dont stop said hinkler no one is to be killed repeated evans take them out at the legs there she goes said jones the mooring lines snaked out from the ship to be collected by the escort tender and ferried in to the shore bollards fore and aft the engine whined bringing the freighter gently in against the quay wall there was an imperceptible bump and they rocked slightly hinkler and bartlett picked up their gunny sacks and moved away to the far rail and evans watched as four of the hatchmen detached themselves and followed he decided the greek captain was a bloody fool ashore kahane could not quell a sense of deepening anxiety its early he insisted it wasnt due for another hour more than another hour what the hell does that matter said greening its here and shimeon isnt he said wait said kahane you want a vote said leiberwitz so lets vote i say we move with you in charge demanded kahane somebodys got to be said leiberwitz somebody who accepts responsibility i say move supported greening leiberwitz stared at katz and sela the men looked at each other clearly feeling uncomfortable and katz said i dont see why we should wait it seems pointless sela shrugged the quicker we get it over the quicker we can be away youre outnumbered said leiberwitz to kahane habel hasnt voted said kahane he knew it was pointless but it would mean a further delay no matter how slight to sela leiberwitz said go and tell him whats happened what were deciding ahead of them the freighters derrick stirred into action swinging the gangway over the side and then manoeuvring it into position through the split rail they dont want to wait said leiberwitz they dont have a choice said kahane neither do we sela came back to the first vehicle and said he thinks we should wait four against two said leiberwitz he looked contemptuously to kahane and said if you want to sit here wetting yourself youre welcome he climbed out of the lorry leaving the door ajar for greening to follow on the quayside the four of them stood for a moment uncertain what to do next looking to leiberwitz for a lead lets go he said three hundred yards away swart raised his hand and said not yet not yet let them get far enough away from the lorries the driver sat hunched forward fingers ready on the ignition key now said swart the two cars accelerated away tires howling headlights glaring anxious for maximum surprise before the men on the quay could recover the four israelis stood transfixed immobile with shock kahane responded first thrusting the uzi machine gun through the cab window and squeezing off a short burst that went hopelessly wide ricocheting off the concrete quayside what the hells happening screamed grearson they were told not to shoot its not coming from the ship said marinetti theyre firing from the dockside aboard the freighter evans shouted its a setup i dont know whats happened but its a setup well have to fight our way out the men snatched their weapons from gunny sacks and holdalls hinkler and bartlett immediately sprayed warning shots over the heads of the crew who had begun to move when they saw what was happening face them off evans told melvin on the quayside the israelis moved into action at last trying to shield their aim from the blaze of the approaching lights firing with their handguns kahanes second burst was better than his first shattering the windscreen of the second south african car the inrush of glass blinded the driver who was also shot through the shoulder he still had the instinct to haul the wheel to the left to swerve away from the hurtling approach to the quay edge and the oily sea below they smashed into the second israeli lorry the impact so violent that habel was hurled out of the vehicle and shattered his skull against the bordering wall the driver died instantly together with the man beside him and one in the rear the fourth broke his neck but retained consciousness screaming out in immediate agony and then continuing wail after agonized wail the mercenaries were positioned well protected by the metal of the freighter rail sneider sprayed the quay with automatic fire which was taken up by evans as soon as sneiders ammunition clip was exhausted by the time evans ran out for jones to begin firing sneider had reloaded ready to resume an uninterrupted hail of highcalibre bullets behind him evans heard more shooting close from melvin and then farther away from hinkler and bartlett and then screams as the crew were brought down the captain was a stupid bastard he thought agaih one of joness bursts caught the protruding israeli lorry shattering the windscreen and decapitating kahane then one of the rounds penetrated the fuel line and the vehicle erupted in a violent white and orange explosion swarts car had slewed around thirty yards from the israelis and everyone had got out using it for protection to shoot at the four men who were trying to crab sideways from their totally exposed position towards the comparative safety of the shed two had turned to answer the concentrated and calculated fire from the freighter and as he watched swart saw one then the other literally blasted off the ground from the avalanche of bullets and then the french ambush erupted the blackened quay was suddenly flooded with blinding white light as the supposedly broken shed lights and then at least ten more ancillary search beams were switched on car and lorry headlights in a solid practically unbroken line came on in unison to encircle the berth in the sudden break in the shooting the clatter of squads of soldiers running was momentarily the only sound from the sea as well as from inland a flurry of helicopters arrived with more lights focusing downwards upon the fighting and then the announcements demanding surrender amplified metallic voices in french then in english saying that they were completely surrounded by police antiterrorist squads crs and a french army detachment calling hinkler and bartlett to the shore rail to join with melvin and sneider evans scurried with jones bent double towards the bridge ladder a crewman saw them and moved to intervene the black man shot him almost carelessly the automatic rifle balanced in his right hand he waited until evans had climbed to the top then scrambled up after him side by side they dashed into the bridge housing papas was crouched rigid against the storm rail staring down at the quayside battlefield evans snatched at his shoulder cast off he yelled cut the line and get us out of here papas blinked like a man awakening from a deep sleep i said get us out of here repeated evans cut the mooring lines youre mad said the greek brokenvoiced utterly mad dont you imagine theyll have sealed the harbour entrance against us theyve got helicopters overhead soldiers on land i cant go anywhere evans swung around absorbing at once the stupidity of his demand below his men had started shooting again but at once were answered by equally professional coordinated fire blasting out simultaneously from at least five different spots and scything into the ships side even with the protection of their elevation evans saw hinkler clutch upwards and then fall backwards his face pulped red as he stood crying bartlett was hit theyve got a tripodmounted cannon down there said jones ninemillimetre at least a phosphorous flare then another exploded lazily from a helicopter hovering directly above and floated gently down completely illuminating the deck at once still from above automatic fire rained down on them sneider and melvin died instantly and the already wounded and dying crewmen twitched and jumped under the relentless downpour bastards screamed evans he ran out onto the bridge wing conscious of jones behind him squinting against the light still above them they both began firing using the recoil blast of the overhead guns as markers suddenly there was an explosion more violent than that of the israeli lorry as their bullets caught a helicopter fuel tank there was a red and black roar a searing skinscorching blast of heat and then the helicopter plunged downwards lodged for a moment at the very stem of the freighter and then toppled hissing into the sea far below the two remaining israelis ran forward arms high above their heads in surrender leiberwitz was caught in the stomach by a blast from one of the french machinegun emplacements practically cutting him in two before anyone realized what they were doing to the men around him beside the car swart shouted stop firing stay down but keep your hands visible on the bridge jones aimed at the quay but only managed a short burst before a second helicopter arrived flattening them against the deck with its downdraught it released a flare which blinded them so neither evans nor jones ever saw the momentary black flecks of the three dropped grenades set to fivesecond time fuses the explosion killed both of them as well as papas and split the bridge wing from its main housing grearson obeyed marinettis instruction keeping his hands visible and stretched out against the car dashboard when they were surrounded black hooded figures hauled open the doors to drag them out seconds before it happened the lawyer said distantvoiced what happened for gods sake what happened we lost said marinetti levys concern was entirely for the boy refusing to let karen even look at his bloody cuts or the bruising until she had repeated and then repeated again his instructions on how to guide the police to the villa where azziz was held sure youve got it right he said positive she said now let me clean you up levy shook her off his voice far away as if he couldnt believe what he had done i had to leave him handcuffed to some piping in the cellar of some empty bloody house he was crying asking me to help him and instead walked away levy snatched the browning automatic from the waistband of his trousers and slammed it onto a chest near the bedroom door i never want to see a bloody gun again he said hell be all right said karen ill see to it hes all right please let me help you i havent time said the israeli the ships due you cant drive like that she said it was a wonder you werent stopped by the police coming here he allowed her to lead him to a chair near the bed where she eased off his bloodstained jacket and examined the deepest cut it should be stitched she said its very deep just bind ittry to stop it bleeding karen poured water into a bowl from the pitcher and set it down at his feet aware as she cleaned away the caked blood how pale levys face was it made the bruising around his cheek and eye appear even more prominent poor darling she said my poor darling stop it he snapped after what i did to that kid stop it karen made a pad from a clean handkerchief and then tore the sheet on her bed for a strip to tie against the gash almost at once it began to stain from the unstaunched blood she smiled feebly close to tears you look odd she said like someone dressed up for a fancydress party it doesnt feel like a party to me he said she snatched out cupping his face between her hands dont go he snorted at the absurdity of her plea they might expect me to do that leiberwitz at least youll be killed she blurted eyes flooding if not here back in israel levy shook his head israel would never turn the army against its own people it couldnt do that and survive itll be compromise like politics always is he stood pulling her to her feet i have to handcuff you he said the police will cut you free once weve unloaded the ship and ive told them where you are levy took the wrist bands from his coat and stood staring down at them i cant he said it doesnt matter yes it does he insisted there mustnt be anything against you any suspicion he looked around the room and said the bed frame i suppose karen sat demurely offering her arm he clamped on the handcuffs running his finger round the inner rim to ensure it wasnt tight just wait until they cut it off he said azziz moved aroundthats why he got sore when he had connected the other band to the metal bedhead he said i have to leave you now karen bit her lip not wanting to break down but knowing she was going to she reached out for his hand not able to speak i meant it he said about finding a way yes itll take time he bent to kiss her and the tears broke flooding uncontrolled down her face i love you he said which was what deaken heard as he came through the door the fury surged through him so strong there was a brief moment of faintness and then he saw the discarded gun get away from her deaken moved as he screamed out the demand plunging into the room and snatching up the automatic get away he said again there was no hysteria in his anger he was icily controlledillogically almost detachedthe gun he didnt know how to use steady and unwavering in his hand they were very close only feet apart and the man seemed to fill deakens vision magnifying his impression of a strained scratched and bruised face the shirt splattered with blood she had obviously put up a fight no said karen her voice jagged its all right darling all right said deaken eyes fixed upon levy im here now its going to be all right no shouted karen leave him id like to kill you said deaken he aimed the gun with both hands at levy but i want to hurt you more than that im going to see you locked up forever im going to invoke every law and every statute under every international or national legal convention im going to see that you spend the rest of your life living through the sort of agony youve put her through put me through i love him karen didnt raise her voice it was a calm positive assertion he stared at her not understanding i love him and im going to have his child deaken blinked against another spasm of faintness bringing his other hand to steady the gun god how hed make this bastard suffer if her breakdown was permanent and i love her said levy what said deaken his voice was suddenly weak and unsure were going to have a baby said the woman were going to stay together somehow karen hesitated and then she said i dont want to be with you anymore richard deaken never remembered making a positive decision even any contraction of his fingers there was a sudden blasting roar and the gun kicked wildly in his hand so that he almost dropped it the shot caught levy fully in the chest kicking him backwards onto the bottom of the bed and then onto the floor karens cry was beyond hysteria animallike she threw herself sideways jerked short by her handcuffed wrist fingers of her free hand clawing out as she tried to touch levys crumpled body she threw herself again and again until the blood began to drip from her stripped arm and then she stopped whimpering in her frustration at not being able to reach him she stared up at her husband bastard she said you bastard epilogue suslev was waiting for her knock when it came he hurried to the apartment door opening it wide to admit her excitement churned through him at the first sight of his wife so beautiful he thought so radiant how are you he said fine sure positive he stood back for her to enter the apartment was just off kalinin prospekt but still with a view of the kremlin and far more spacious than suslev had ever expected he led her around it like a rich child with a toy no other child could afford showing her the kitchen quite separate from the dining area a fullsized room where they could entertain and the third bedroom which could be used on the rare occasions when they had guests the bathroom was equipped with a shower which he turned proudly on and off to prove that it worked sergeis at the academy he said theres going to be an acceptance ceremony in a weeks time suslev took a square of pasteboard from a dresser and said heres our invitation she smiled enjoying his excitement beside the invitation was his official citation confirming his promotion to full colonel very impressive she said picking it up she felt a great weariness and wished she could share his excitement theyre calling it one of the most successful disinformation operations ever said suslev theres even talk of it being included in the training manual thats wonderful she said she hoped the conceit wouldnt last it was going to be difficult enough to learn how to love him again without additional barriers its nice to be properly recognized he said i hope youre right she said he seemed to miss the point i got worried that it took deaken so long to go to south africa suslev admitted i think that was the greatest uncertainty the delay involving his father and the south african intelligence service i didnt expect to have to manoeuvre him there with all that bullshit about dakar and boarding the ship what about the second boat she yearned to deflate his pride that was a surprise he conceded i knew thered be something and guessed it would be mercenaries in the event two ships gave us a better propaganda result because of the seizure of the bellicose how could you be sure of being identified she said he shook his head i knew id be on the south african security files i spent most of my time in angola making myself obviousi even saw them photographing me it was logical that when deaken with his family connections got to pretoria with his story theyd check out the underbergs in security try descriptions and end up with me that was the lure the bait i knew theyd have to follow because of their neurosis about russian involvement in angola and namibia youd have been in trouble if theyd extended the search beyond their own security service but they didnt he said triumphantly south africa has even paraded the real rupert underberg at press conferences and insisted hes nothing more than a senior clerk in their foreign office he sniggered and got the rest right they actually identify his visit to the seychelles as the time when we got all the passport details to make our own copy and been laughed at and condemned for trying to avoid the truth the french have retrieved my hotel registration in monaco with the passport number underbergs passport number and directly accused pretoria of lying i used it for all the car and lorryrental registration forms too and for hiring the last villa to hide the boy in south africas illegal seizure of the bellicose as well as their involvement in the carnage at toulon makes the evidence against them overwhelming its years since theyve been hurt so badly internationally did israel work out as well absolutely he said enjoying the boasting up to now theres been an incredibly close business liaison between israel and south africa israels largest export is the polished diamonds it gets rough cut from south africa and thats only a small part of the business and commercial ties now its damaged probably forever itll certainly be years before either jerusalem or pretoria trust each other i used the same underberg passport going in and out of israel so again theres official registration on airline immigration forms and hotel documents as far as israel is concerned its incontrovertible proof of a south african government employee stirring up a dissident antigovernment group and using them in an operation to smuggle weapons through to an area where theyre involved in conflict and by exposing azziz a saudi arabian with direct links to the court as the supplier of those weapons and having him made look foolish by the israeli involvement whether by dissidents or not puts back for years any chance of the saudi peace plan for the middle east and any recognition of israel the saudis have lost face and israel has been shown to be a country treating its settlers so roughly theyll try armed resistance rather than look for the promised land suslev paused splaying his fingers weve made fools of south africa internationally and split them from one of their closest allies israel weve made israel and saudi arabia turn away from each other and run back into their comers and weve strengthened our position in angola by convincing swapo and every other nationalist group on the entire african continent that they shouldnt trust any other arms supplier but moscow the woman looked sadly away what about deaken she said hes a hero he killed the terrorist who kidnapped and murdered his wife thats the official version anyway that she was shot during the struggle she shrugged i thought he was a nice man gentle frightened and nice she paused wanting to make the point then she said he loved his wife very much didnt want her used sure youre all right he said reverting to his earlier question shouldnt i be she said people pay thousands for that sort of vacation none of it would have worked without you insisted suslev didnt it upset you she demanded he felt foolish at having been carried away by his own euphoria he came forward pulling her into his chest excited by the feel of her closeness you know it did he said softly we talked about it before it ever started and agreed it wouldnt matter that it wouldnt count she pushed away from him looking up into his face wanting to feel some emotion at his touch and failing completely they had lost too she decided to break the moment between them he took the false duplicate passport of rupert underberg from his pocket and tossed it onto the dresser alongside the citation certificate its gone on for so long he said that i think im going to miss not being rupert underberg im not said the woman i hated being carole being a whore i just want to be myself again she didnt think it was ever going to be possible
