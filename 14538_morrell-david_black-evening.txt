david morrell black evening tales of dark suspense copyright by david morrell to philip klass and william tenn once again for anything the most banal even to become an adventure you must and this is enough begin to recount it a man is always a teller of tales he lives surrounded by his stories and the stories of others he sees everything that happens to him through them and he tries to live his own life as if he were telling a story but he has to choose live or tell jeanpaul sartre la naus√©e foreword rereading the stories in this collection i wasnt prepared for the flood of powerful memories that they evoked i suddenly recalled the circumstances under which each was written where i was living what i was feeling why i was motivated to compose each tale those emotionfilled memories extend back more than thirty years and yet it seems only last week that i was a graduate student in american literature at the pennsylvania state university the year was i was about to complete my masters degree looking ahead to course work for my phd but unable to ignore a compulsion that had gripped me since high school to be a fiction writer penn state s english department had recently hired a noted science fiction writer philip klass whose pen name is william tenn to teach composition he was the first professional writer i had met and with the innocent brazenness of youth i asked him if he would give me personal instruction he answered politely that his schedule was already full to bursting and if i wanted to be his student why not sign on for a course i explained that i felt i would benefit more from oneonone discussions he responded that certainly every student would benefit from that approach but unfortunately there wasnt time sensing that i would persist he told me that if i gave him a story a week he might reconsider for how many weeks i asked for as long as necessary he replied obviously klass was trying to discourage me a story a week in addition to my considerable course load was burdensome the odds were he clearly thought that i would soon get tired and give up after all even if i did deliver a story a week and for heaven knew how long there still wasnt any guarantee that he would teach me he had only promised to reconsider my request but my mother hadnt raised a quitter and i kept at it finally after i had submitted a story a week for six weeks i was heartened to receive a note in which klass asked me to come to his office this is it i thought my big chance hell tell me he liked my stories and hell arrange to have them published to the contrary he told me that the stories werent satisfactory and would i please stop bothering him your subject matter isnt special enough klass said all successful writers have a distinctive compelling approach a particular world view that makes them unique look inside yourself find out who you are which usually means find out what youre most afraid of that will be your subject for your life or until your fear changes but i dont mean fear of heights or water or fire he continued those are the superficial symptoms of much deeper fears your true fear is like a ferret darting within the tunnels of your psyche desperate not to be discovered i did my best to nod wisely i think i understand good but i really didnt understand confused i went off and did exactly what klass had warned me not to do i wrote stories about fear of heights and water and fire to my credit this new batch of stories didnt fool me i knew that they lacked something that they didnt have whatever spark of inspiration separates ordinary stories from memorable ones nonetheless i persisted and persisted and suddenly felt something give way in me my willpower had finally snapped after all writing is an act of faith and if you lose faith in yourself if insecurity makes you realize just how unnatural it is to sit scribbling all alone to sacrifice time with your wife and daughter to give up your few moments of leisure to gamble against the unlikely odds that you will be one of the very few only about prose fiction writers in the united states who are able to support themselves by writing well you run out of hope i found myself wishing i was somewhere else years before there had been an iron mine outside state college where perm state is located known as the barrens it was a large open pit that had been abandoned after it turned into a lake when a dynamite blast released an underground stream on occasion i used to go there to hike and appreciate the woods around the former mine discouraged with my writing efforts i decided to go there yet again it was a blazing august afternoon the forest was dense and humid drooping in the summer heat closing in on me and as i walked along the narrow trail wary of snakes that might be in the underbrush i heard a sound behind me the snap of a branch a squirrel leaping from tree to tree i thought i kept going wiping the sweat from my brow when i heard another branch snap and the crunch of what sounded like a footstep on dead leaves someone else was in the forest i realized someone else was out for a hike looking for relaxation so i kept following the narrow trail and the next time i heard a branch snap and a footstep crunch on dead leaves i felt a cold spot between my shoulder blades the primal reaction seized me without warning it was inexplicable i had an abrupt premonition that whoever was in the forest meant to harm me this irrational apprehension grew in strength as i heard yet another snap another crunch coming closer no matter how hard i strained to peer behind me i saw no movement in the forest i walked faster along the trail to my relief the sounds behind me stopped i breathed easier only to stop breathing altogether as i heard the approaching snap and crunch begin again but this time in front of me i froze as if paralyzed adrenaline gave me motion i backed up and froze again as i heard someone behind me i turned in a circle on guard against every flank and blinked in surprise when i found a desk and a typewriter before me the intense vivid visceral experience had been a daydream or a better description would be a daynightmare i had so disappeared into my psyche that i had lost touch with my surroundings imagination had felt more real than reality nothing like this had ever happened to me before it made me remember what klass had said your true fear is like a ferret darting within the tunnels of your psyche desperate not to be discovered but sometimes it might be possible to get close to it i realized the daydream had certainly scared me what was it about what was going to happen next the urge to know the outcome made me realize how much my earlier stories had lacked forward motion suspense a fresh vision i didnt know any fictional situation like the one i had just imagined james dickeys deliverance would be published three years later that novel about terror on a backwoods canoe trip amazed readers with its new approach to fear but in before deliverance i felt on my own by surrendering to my problem of how to be a fiction writer i had in zen fashion allowed my problem to solve itself feeling vitalized i immediately set to work to write the story so that i could find out what happened next i called it the plinker referring to a man who goes off one morning to do some target shooting the slang term is plinking and discovers to his horror that someone else is in the woods and is interested in a different kind of target shooting the story was written long before serial killers and stalkers became the subject of fiction and when i gave it to philip klass he must have sensed my excitement because he read it much sooner than he had the others i had given him he phoned and invited me to join him at a coffee house at pm and thus began one of the most unique afternoons evenings and nights of my life first klass told me he was amazed that i had written a story so different from the others one that had strongly engaged his attention then he asked if id been reading geoffrey household i shook my head no geoffrey who the british suspense writer klass answered households two most famous novels were rogue male and watcher in the shadows the former about a british biggame hunter who stalks hitler on the eve of the second world war later when i read households work i did recognize a kinship households fiction was best when it dealt with threats from unknown forces the more frightened and vulnerable the heroes were the more i identified with them that ferret in my psyche again my ignorance about geoffrey household revealed another of my limitations i hadnt read any suspense fiction or popular literature of any kind as a teenager i had been motivated to become a writer because of my fascination with stirling silliphants scripts for the television show route in which two young men drove across the united states in a corvette searching for america and themselves silliphant combined action with ideas but my desire to emulate him had led me more toward ideas than action after years of studying literature in college i had become so saturated with hawthorne melville faulkner and other classic authors that my fiction felt stale and imitative literary in the worst sense of the word but not anymore i remembered the thrilling contemporary feel of route and why i had wanted to be a writer in the first place i resolved to read as many current novels popular novels as i could beginning with household because if i was going to write action stories with a difference then i had better find out what the best action writers had already done so that i wouldnt repeat what they had already accomplished at the coffee house klass and i discussed these issues and were surprised to discover that three hours had passed it was now pm i was due home for dinner but klass asked if id be willing to go to his apartment meet his wife and continue the discussion after months spent trying to get klasss attention i felt my heart leap at the invitation quickly i phoned my wife and explained the situation klass and i then went to his apartment where our discussion became deeper and more intense the best fiction klass maintained came from a writers compulsion to communicate traumatic personal events often the writer had so repressed those events that the writer wasnt aware of the source of the compulsion but whether consciously done or not this selfpsychoanalysis made a writers work unique because the psychological effects of trauma are unique to each person you could tell the bad writers from the good writers because the bad writers were motivated by money and ego whereas the good writers practiced their craft for the insistent reason that they had to be writers that they had no choice that something inside them the ferret was gnawing at their imaginations and the festering pressure had to be released often daydreams were a signal of those pressures klass felt spontaneous messages from the subconscious subliminal hints about stories that wanted to be told what were my own festering pressures my fiction would reveal them klass said and it has in retrospect im amazed by the disguised revelations in what ive written that my father died shortly after i was born that he was killed in the second world war that i grew up with a morbid fear of war that economic necessity forced my mother to put me in an orphanage for a time that i could never be sure whether the woman who reclaimed me was the same person who had given me up that i persistently felt the lack of a father figure that my fear of violence eventually prompted me to confront my fear by joining a street gang i could go on but it isnt wise to face traumas directly otherwise i might lose the compulsion to write about them these were the sorts of things that klass and i kept talking about in his apartment again time sped by and we were surprised to discover that it was now ten at night klasss engaging wife fruma had participated in the discussion now she invited me to stay for a late dinner until midnight the three of us ate pot roast and talked then we cleared the dishes and klass spread the pages of my story on the dining room table he analyzed every sentence for me explaining why this technique worked but that one didnt showing me new ways to accomplish a scene giving me pointers about dialogue about structure discussing pace teaching me how to make description feel like action at last he reached the final sentence on the final page summed up his remarks handed me the story and said thats all thats the limit of what im going to teach you through the window behind him the night was turning gray birds began to sing dawn was approaching spellbound by klasss wisdom i had lost track of time now that the session was over i felt exhausted but after thanking him after starting home no matter how tired i was i felt buoyed by an excitement that seemed to lift me off the sidewalk the memory is vivid to me the night i became convinced that i would be a writer what happened to that story the plinker it was never published the magazines to which i submitted it found it too strong although it wouldnt be today i tried for a year one magazine kept it so long that i had hopes but one day the story was returned to me wrinkled dogeared coffeestained with a note informing me that the magazine was going out of business and someone had found my manuscript stuffed in a drawer undaunted i eventually put the story away because my attention had become fixated on another story a novel actually about a special forces vietnam veteran who engages in a deadly duel with a smalltown police chief a marine corps veteran from korea the plot was about the generation gap the difference between the fifties and the sixties about the differences between korea and vietnam about hawks and doves about mental programming i called it first blood it was dedicated to philip klass and his pen name william tenn each in his own way because the generous teacher and the gifted fiction writer both the same person had helped me i sent the novel to geoffrey household he wrote a kind letter back to me telling me that the action was too strong the plinker doesnt appear in this collection as important as the story is to me i find it unsatisfying now the work of an apprentice some readers might even mistakenly conclude that it is derivative of deliverance rather than a predecessor of it protective of it i keep it to myself but the stories that are included here presented in order of composition seem to me to wear their age well tales of dark suspense their approach is different from that of my international thrillers you wont find spies and roundtheglobe intrigue here what you will find are the stark emotions behind that intrigue fear and trembling the ferret keeps scurrying in my psyche these are some of its traces the dripping was my first published story and as such despite its horrifying content has great sentimental value for me i had started first blood at penn state in but graduate courses student teaching and my phd dissertation on john barth slowed the novels progress it was slowed even more after i graduated and moved to iowa city where most of my time was filled with teaching course preparation student conferences faculty meetings and my other responsibilities as an assistant professor of american literature at the university of iowa finally i completed the novel in the summer of instead of feeling exhausted however i was bursting with energy and immediately began the story you are about to read it is one of the few that occurred to me complete in a dream when i wakened i rushed to a typewriter and wrote it in one sitting the dripping that autumn we lived in a house in the country my mothers house the house i was raised in i have been to the village struck even more by how nothing in it has changed yet everything has because i am older now seeing it differently i feel as though i am both here now and back then at once with the mind of a boy and a man it is so strange a doubling so intense so unsettling that i am moved to work again to try to paint it studying the hardware store the grain barrels in front the twin square pillars holding up the drooping balcony onto which seared waxfaced men and women from the old peoples hotel above come to sit and rock and watch they look the same aging people i saw as a boy the wood of the pillars and balcony as splintered forgetful of the hours while i work i do not begin the long walk home until late at dusk the day has been warm but now in my shirt i am cold and a half mile along i am caught in a sudden shower forced to leave the gravel road for the shelter of a tree its leaves already brown and yellow the rain becomes a storm streaking at me sideways drenching me i cinch the neck of my canvas bag to protect my painting and equipment and decide to run my socks are spongy in my shoes repulsive when at last i reach the lane down to the house and barn the house and barn they and my mother alone have changed as if as one warping weathering their joints twisted and strained their gray so unlike the brightness i recall as a boy the place is weakening her she is in tune with it she matches its decay that is why we have come here to live to revive once i thought i could convince her to move away but of her sixtyfive years she has spent forty here and she insists that she will spend the rest what is left to her the rain falls stronger as i hurry past the side of the house the light on in the kitchen suppertime and i am late the house is connected to the barn the way the small base of an l is connected to its stem the entrance i have always used is directly at the joining and when i enter out of breath my clothes cling to me cold and wet the door to the barn is to my left the door to the kitchen straight ahead i hear the dripping in the basement down the stairs to my right meg sorry im late i call to my wife setting down my waterbeaded canvas sack opening the kitchen door there is no one no settings on the table nothing on the stove only the yellow light from the sixtywatt bulb in the ceiling the kind my mother prefers to the brightness of a onehundred watt it reminds her of candlelight she says meg i call again and still no one answers theyre asleep i think with dusk coming on the dark clouds of the storm have lulled them and they have lain down for a nap expecting to wake before i return still the dripping although the house is very old the barn long disused the roofs crumbling i have not thought it all so illmaintained the storm so strong that water can be seeping past the cellar windows trickling pattering on the old stone floor i switch on the light to the basement descend the wooden stairs to the right worn and squeaking reach where the stairs turn to the left the rest of the way down to the floor and see not water dripping but milk milk everywhere on the rafters on the walls dripping on the film of milk on the stones gathering speckled with dirt in the channels between them from side to side and everywhere sarah my child has done this i think she has been fascinated by the big wooden dollhouse that my father made for me when i was young its blue paint chipped and peeling now she has pulled it from the far corner to the middle of the basement there are games and toy soldiers and blocks that have been taken from the wicker storage chest and played with on the floor all covered with milk the dollhouse the chest the scattered toys milk dripping on them from the rafters milk trickling on them why has she done this i think where can she have gotten so much milk what was in her mind to do this thing sarah i call meg angry now i mount the stairs to the quiet kitchen sarah i shout she will clean the mess and stay indoors the remainder of the week i cross the kitchen turn through the sitting room past the padded flowerpatterned chairs and sofa that have faded since i knew them as a boy past several of my paintings that my mother has hung on the wall brightly colored old ones of pastures and woods from when i was in grade school brownshaded new ones of the town tinted as if old photographs two stairs at a time up to the bedrooms my wet shoes on the soft worn carpet on the stairs my hand streaking on the smooth polished maple banister at the top i swing down the hall the door to sarahs room is open it is dark in there i switch on the light she is not on the bed nor has she been the satin spread is unrumpled the rain pelting in through the open window the wind fresh and cool i have a bad feeling then and go uneasily into our bedroom it is dark as well empty my stomach has become hollow where are they all in my mothers room no as i stand at the open door to my mothers room i see from the yellow light that i turned on in the hall that only she is in there her small torso stretched across the bed mother i say intending to add where are meg and sarah but i stop before i do one of my mothers shoes is off the other askew on her foot there is mud on her shoes there is blood on her cotton dress it is torn her brittle hair disrupted blood on her face her bruised lips are swollen for several moments i am silent with shock my god mother i finally manage to say and as if the words are a spring releasing me to action i touch her to wake her but i see that her eyes are open staring toward the ceiling unseeing although alive and each breath is a sudden full gasp then a slow exhalation mother what has happened who did this to you where are meg and sarah but she does not look at me only toward the ceiling for gods sake mother answer me look at me what has happened nothing her eyes are sightless between gasps she is like a statue what i think is hysterical disjointed contradictory i must find meg and sarah they must be somewhere beaten like my mother or worse find them where but i cannot leave my mother when she becomes alert again she too will be hysterical frightened in great pain how did she end up on the bed in her room there is no sign of the struggle she must have put up against her attacker it must have happened somewhere else she crawled from there to here then i see the blood on the floor the swath of blood down the hall from the stairs who did this where is he who would beat a gray wrinkled arthritic old woman why in gods name would he do it i imagine the pain of the arthritis as she struggled with him perhaps he is still in the house waiting for me to the hollow sickness in my stomach now comes fear hot pulsing and i am frantic before i realize what i am doing grabbing the spare cane that my mother always keeps by her bed flicking on the light in her room throwing open the closet door and striking in with the cane viciously sounds coming from my throat i flail the cane among faded dresses no one under the bed no one behind the door no one i search all the upstairs rooms that way terrified constantly checking behind me clutching the cane and whacking into closets under beds behind doors with a force that would certainly crack a skull no one meg sarah no answer not even an echo in this soundabsorbing house there is no attic just an overhead entry to a crawl space under the eaves and that has long been sealed no sign of tampering no one has gone up i rush down the stairs seeing the trail of blood my mother has left on the carpet imagining her pain as she crawled i search the rooms downstairs with the same desperate thoroughness in the front closet behind the sofa and chairs behind the drapes no one i lock the front door lest he be outside in the storm waiting to come in behind me i remember to draw every blind close every drape lest he be out there peering at me the rain pelts insistently against the windows i cry out again and again for meg and sarah the police my mother a doctor i grab for the old phone on the wall by the front stairs fearful to listen to it afraid he has cut the line outside but it is droning droning i ring for the police working the handle at the side around and around and around they are coming they say a doctor with them stay where i am they say but i cannot meg and sarah i must find them i know they are not in the basement where the milk is dripping all the basement is open to view except for my childhood things we have cleared out all the boxes and barrels and shelves of jars the saturday before but under the stairs i have forgotten about under the stairs and now i race down and stand dreading in the milk but there are only cobwebs there already reformed from saturday when we cleared them i look up at the side door i first came through and as if i am seeing through a telescope i focus on the handle it seems to fidget i have a panicked vision of the intruder bursting through and i charge up to lock it and the door to the barn and then i think if meg and sarah are not in the house they are likely in the barn but i cannot bring myself to unlock the barn door and go through he must be there as well not in the rain outside but in the shelter of the barn and there are no lights to turn on there and why the milk did he do it and where did he get it and why or did sarah do it before no the milk is too fresh it has been thrown there too recently by him but why and who is he a tramp an escapee from some prison or asylum no the nearest institution is far away at least a hundred miles from the town then or a nearby farm i know my questions are a delaying tactic to keep me from entering the barn but i must i take the flashlight from the kitchen drawer and unlock the door to the barn forcing myself to go in quickly cane ready flashing my light the stalls are still there listing and some of the equipment churners separators dull and rusted cobwebbed and dirty the must of decaying wood and crumbled hay the fresh wet smell of the rain gusting through cracks in the walls flicking my light toward the corners edging toward the stalls hearing boards creak i try to control my fright i remember when i was a boy how the cattle waited in the stalls for my father to milk them how the barn was once boardtight and solid warm to be in how there was no connecting door from the barn to the house because my father did not want my mother to smell the animals when she was cooking i scan my light along the walls sweep it in arcs through the darkness before me as i draw nearer to the stalls and in spite of myself i recall that other autumn when the snow came early fourfoot drifts by morning and still storming thickly how my father went out to the barn to do the milking and never returned for lunch or supper the phone lines were down no way to get help and my mother and i waited all night unable to make our way through the storm listening to the slowly dying wind the next morning was clear and bright and blinding as we waded out finding the cows in agony in their stalls from not having been milked and my father dead frozen rocksolid in the snow in the middle of the next field where he must have wandered when he lost his bearings in the storm there was a fox nosing at him under the snow and my fathers face was so mutilated that he had to be sealed in his coffin before he could lie in state days after the snow was melted gone the barnyard a sea of mud and it was autumn again and my mother had the connecting door put in my father should have tied a rope from the house to his waist to guide him back in case he lost his way certainly he knew enough but then he was like that always in a rush when i was ten thus i think as i aim my flashlight toward the shadowy stalls terrified of what i may find in any one of them meg and sarah or him thinking of how my mother and i searched for my father and how i now search for my wife and child trying to think of how it was once warm and pleasant in here chatting with my father helping him to milk the sweet smell of new hay and grain the different sweet smell of fresh droppings something i always liked although neither my father nor my mother could understand why i know that if i do not think of these good times i will surely go insane dreading what i might find i pray to god that they have not been killed what can he have done to them to rape a fiveyearold girl split her the hemorrhaging alone can have killed her then even in the barn i hear my mother cry out for me the relief i feel to leave and go to her unnerves me i do want to find meg and sarah to try to save them yet i am eager to leave the barn i think my mother will tell me what has happened tell me where to find them that is how i justify my leaving as i wave the light in circles around me guarding my back retreating through the door and locking it upstairs my mother sits stiffly on her bed i want to make her answer my questions to shake her to force her to help but i know that will only frighten her more push her mind down to where i can never reach it mother i say to her softly touching her gently what has happened my impatience can barely be contained who did this where are meg and sarah she smiles at me reassured by the safety of my presence still she cannot answer mother please i say i know how bad it must have been but you must try to help i must know where they are so i can find them she says dolls it chills me what dolls mother did a man come here with dolls what did he want you mean he looked like a doll wearing a mask like one too many questions all she can do is blink please mother you must try your best to tell me where are meg and sarah dolls she says as i first had the foreboding of disaster at the sight of sarahs unrumpled satin bedspread now i begin to understand rejecting it fighting it yes mother the dolls i say refusing to admit what i suspect please mother where are meg and sarah you are a grown boy now you must stop playing as a child your father without him you will have to be the man in the house you must be brave no mother my chest aches there will be a great deal of work now more than any child should know but we have no choice you must accept that god has chosen to take him from us that you are all the man i have to help me no mother now you are a man and you must put away the things of a child eyes streaming i am barely able to straighten leaning wearily against the doorjamb tears rippling from my face down to my shirt wetting it cold where it had just begun to dry i wipe my eyes and see my mother reaching for me smiling and i recoil along the hall then stumble down the stairs down through the sitting room the kitchen down down to the milk splashing through it to the dollhouse and in there crammed and doubled sarah and in the wicker chest meg the toys not on the floor for sarah to play with but taken out so meg could be put in and both of them their stomachs slashed open stuffed with sawdust their eyes rolled up like dolls eyes the police are knocking at the side door pounding calling out who they are but i am powerless to let them in they crash through the door their rubber raincoats dripping as they stare down at me the milk i say they do not understand i wait standing in the milk listening to the rain pelting on the windows while they come to see what is in the dollhouse and in the wicker chest while they go upstairs to my mother and then return so i can tell them again the milk but they still do not understand she killed them of course one man says but i dont see why the milk only when they speak to the neighbors down the road and learn how she came to them needing the cans of milk insisting that she carry them herself to the car the agony she was in as she carried them only when they find the empty cans and the knife in a stall in the barn can i say the milk the blood there was so much blood you know she needed to deny it so she washed it away with milk purified it started the dairy again you see there was so much blood that autumn we lived in a house in the country my mothers house the house i was raised in i have been to the village struck even more by how nothing in it has changed yet everything has because i am older now seeing it differently it is as though i am both here now and back then at once with the mind of a boy and a man for the next ten years i worked exclusively on booklength fiction after finishing first blood in i wrote several different types of novels including a pursuit novel testament a nonsupernatural horror novel the totem and a historical western last reveille simultaneously i continued to commit myself to teaching there wasnt time for short fiction or energy whenever i did sit down to attempt a short story i found the effort frustratingly difficult my block was finally broken in with the partnership my inspiration for the story was a graduating senior who was worried about his job prospects he did well as it turned out but i got to thinking about the lengths that some graduates might go to land a job the partnership sure it was coldblooded but there didnt seem another way mackenzie had spent months considering alternatives hed tried to buy his partner out but dolan had refused well not exactly dolans first response had been to laugh and say i wouldnt let you have the satisfaction when mackenzie kept insisting dolans next response was sure ill let you buy me out all it takes is a million dollars dolan might as well have wanted ten mackenzie couldnt raise a million even half a million or a quarter and he knew that dolan knew that it was typical mackenzie couldnt say good morning without dolans disagreeing if mackenzie bought a car dolan bought a bigger more expensive one and just to rub the salt in dolan bragged about the deal he got and if mackenzie took his wife and children on vacation to bermuda dolan told him that bermuda wasnt anything compared to mazatlan where dolan took his wife and kids the two men argued constantly they favored different football teams their taste in food was wildly different lamb chops versus corned beef when mackenzie took up golf his partner was suddenly playing tennis pointing out that golf was just a game while tennis in addition was good exercise but dolan even with his socalled exercise was overweight mackenzie on the other hand was trim but dolan always made remarks about the hairpiece mackenzie wore it was impossible a scotsman trying to do business with an irishman mackenzie should have known their relationship would never work but at the start theyd been rival builders each attempting to outbid the other for construction jobs and losing money in the process so theyd formed a partnership together they were more successful than theyd ever been independently still trying to outdo each other one would think of ways to turn a greater profit and the other would feel challenged to be twice as clever they cut costs by mixing too much gravel with the concrete by installing lowgrade pipes and subspec insulation they kept special books for the irs mackenziedolan enterprises oh the two of them were enterprising all right but they couldnt bear to talk to each another they tried to solve that problem by dividing work so mackenzie ran the office and dolan went out troubleshooting for a time that did the trick but after all they had to meet to make decisions although they saw each other less they saved their tension up and aggravated each other more to make things worse their wives became good friends the women were constantly organizing barbecues and swimming parties both men didnt dare argue at these gettogethers if they did they heard about it later from their wives i hate that guy he bugs me at the office and he makes me sick at parties you just listen to me mackenzies wife said vickie dolans my friend and i wont have your childish antics ruining that friendship ill be sleeping on the couch tonight so both men braced their shoulders staring toward the distance or peering inside their highball glasses scotch opposed to irish whiskey while their wives exchanged new recipes what finally caused all the trouble was that dolan started making threats i wonder what the government would do if someone let them know about your special way of keeping books mackenzie replied and what about the subspec plumbing and the extra gravel in the concrete youre the one responsible for that the judge would simply fine me dolan quickly answered now the irs thats a different kettle if the tax man knew you were keeping separate books hed lock you in a dungeon where id never have to see your ugly puss mackenzie stared at dolan and decided there wasnt another choice hed tried to do the right thing but his partner wouldnt sell his partner even planned to turn him in and take the business for himself there wasnt any way around it this was selfdefense the man was waiting at the monkey cage a tall thin friendlylooking fellow he was young and blond he wore a tailored lightblue jogging suit he was eating peanuts at the water fountain leaning down to drink mackenzie glanced around the zoo was crowded noon a sunny weekday people on their lunchbreaks sat on benches munching sandwiches others strolled among the cages there were children mothers old folks playing checkers mackenzie heard tinny music from an organ grinder muffled conversations strident chattering and chirping he was satisfied that no one paid attention to him so he wiped some water from his mouth and walked over to the monkey cage mr smith mackenzie said the young man didnt bother turning he just chewed another peanut and mackenzie feared that he was speaking to the wrong man after all the zoo was busy there were other men in jogging suits besides no matter what the newspapers said it wasnt easy finding someone who would do this kind of work mackenzie had spent several evenings haunting lowlife bars before he even got a lead once someone had thought he was a cop and threatened to break both his legs but hundreddollar bills were good persuaders and at last hed had a conversation on a pay phone hed have done this job himself but after all he needed an alibi and what was more he readily admitted he didnt have the courage now hed made a mistake and approached the wrong man apparently the man he was supposed to meet had decided that the meeting was a trap and he wasnt going to show up as mackenzie moved to leave the young blond fellow turned to him hey just a second bob mackenzie blinked mr smith just call me john the young mans smile was brilliant he held out the bag you want a peanut bob no i dont think go on and have a peanut the young man gestured amiably with the bag mackenzie took a peanut as he ate he didnt taste it sure thats right relax and live a little you dont mind if i call you bob as long as we can get this settled youre not what i expected the young man nodded in agreement you were counting on a guy in a tight suit with a scar on his face well no but and instead you got a young man who looks like he ought to be surfing i know exactly what you mean its disappointing he frowned sympathetically but nothings what it seems today would you believe i was a business major as hard as i tried i couldnt get a job in management so now im doing this you mean youre not experienced just

truck youre but the young man turned his smile disarming hi pat you want some corn chips dolans mouth hung open sweat trickled from his forehead what the way youre sweating you need salt pat have some

inside the truck he ate the corn chips he was offered but he couldnt taste the salt his sweaty shirt was sticking to the truck seat he kept squinting toward the bulging object underneath the jogging coat pat heres the thing the young man told him im supposed to kill you dolan straightened so hard that he bumped his head against the ceiling what your partner hired me youre worth ten thousand

my god what happened nearly broke a tooth these kernels arent all popped i ought to sue i meant with dolan keep your voice down bob i know you meant what happened with him no one cares if someone breaks a tooth they only care about themselves a shame do you believe in competition what do you support free enterprise the thing that made this country great mackenzie felt his knees go weak he clutched the bar i do he muttered weakly then youll sympathize with my position when i went to see your partner oh my god you told him bob i couldnt simply kill him and not let him have a chance to make a bid that wouldnt be american mackenzie started trembling bid what kind of bid dont get excited bob we figured he could pay me not to kill him but youd just send someone else so what we finally decided was that hed pay me to come back and kill you he offered double ten grand now and ten when you were shoveled under he cant do that but he did bob dont go simple on me now you should have seen

at the stretch the track announcer shouted its inflation pat its killing us the young man wiped mustard from his lips you think im stupid dolan asked the young man frowned that im a moron dolan asked

she came last if youd asked me id have told you number three youll never guess what pat did bob youll never guess what bob did pat dolan stopped beside mackenzie looked around and sighed then sat on the park bench so you figured youd have him kill me dolan said mackenzies face was gaunt you werent above the same temptation dolan spread his hands selfdefense but i should sit back while you sic the irs against me that was just a joke some joke its costing me a fortune hey its costing me as well weve got a problem they nodded feeding bread crumbs to the pigeons ive been thinking dolan said the only answer i can see is both of us will have to kill him only way hell bleed us dry if we pay someone else to kill him the new guy might try something cute as well well do it both together that way you cant point the blame at me vice versa whats the matter dont you trust me they glared at each other hi there bob hows tricks pat the young man smiled from behind mackenzies desk he munched a taco going through their records what the hell is this now but he claimed that you expected him the secretary said never mind well deal with this just shut the door they stared at him hey fellas ive been going through your records theyre really a mess this skimping on the concrete and that subspec insulation i dont know guys weve got lots of work ahead of us a drop of taco sauce fell on the records us well sure were partners now we are i took the money you gave me i invested it in what insurance you remember how i said i was a business major ive decided this sideline doesnt suit me so i went to a specialist the things a graduates forced to do to get a job these days a specialist a hit man if the two of you decide to have me killed youll be killed as well mackenzies chest felt stabbed dolans ulcer burned so were partners here i even had some cards made up he handed one across a greasy taco stain along one edge mackenziedolansmith and at the bottom contractors i dont often use humor in my fiction the story you just read is one of the exceptions youll come across a few other examples later in contrast this next story black evening has no trace of humor whatsoever dark and disturbing it is more in the tone of the dripping part of a series of stories about houses it first appeared in a anthology called horrors edited by charles l grant and marks the beginning of a long association with charlie a skillful fiction writer he also edited some of the most influential dark suspense anthologies of the seventies and eighties including the muchpraised shadows series part of the reason i didnt write any short fiction from to is that i couldnt find a market for the type of stories i wanted to write when i learned about charlies anthologies i discovered i had a soul mate many of the stories in this collection appeared in publications that charlie edited along with numerous other writers of dark suspense im indebted to him black evening so we all went out there i can see youre apprehensive as we all were and so ill tell you at the outset that youre right the house was in the poorest section it had been among the best homes in the twenties id been told but now its shutters had long ago fallen its porch was listing its paint was chipped and peeling gray at dusk although i could guess that it had once been brilliant white three stories gables chimneys dormer windows balconies nobody could afford to build so large a home these days and no doubt it had required someone rich to build it then a mansion in its dotage sad i imagined the pride of those who had first owned it and their disappointment should they see what had happened to it but they would all be dead now so it didnt matter all that mattered was the stench i say we all went out i mean my deputy the doctor and myself we stood beside the police car staring at the dark silent decrepit mansion we saw the neighbors on the porches of the other illkept oncegreat houses silhouetted by the dying sunset then we held our breath and started toward the picket gate which fell off in my hand we moved up toward the front steps the sidewalk was weedcracked the yard overgrown we felt the cool air almost misty as the sun dipped below the horizon and in the dark our flashlights glaring we climbed the cracked creaking steps that led to the porch we had to work around some broken boards on the porch we stared down at a pile of newspapers then we squinted through the stained glass window dusty and opaque the darkness in there absolute at last i twisted the grip that rang the bell the tone was flat without enthusiasm no echo or reverberation followed no light came on no weak footsteps shuffled near to let us in i twisted at the bell again we waited now what the deputy looked nervous give them time theyre old i answered or maybe theyre not at home just one the doctor told me what theres only one her name is agnes shes eighty at least maybe shes sleeping you dont think so otherwise we wouldnt be here i twisted the bell again i hadnt lived in town for long after too many years in the city id brought my family to what id hoped was a better place and as the new police chief i was hardly eager to antagonize the townsfolk by disturbing an old woman all the same the stench was horrible it made my stomach rise my nostrils widen with disgust the neighbors phone calls had been so persistent that i couldnt ignore them all right lets go in i tried the knob the door was locked i pushed and the door came open with a sound as if the jamb had been cardboard no sharp crack instead a rip a tear so soft so effortless the wood was rotten at my feet is anybody here i called no answer so we looked at one another and we stepped inside the hall was dusty the odor more intense we flashed our lights the living room or what i guess had once been called the parlor was beyond an oval entrance to our right the room was filled with stacks of newspapers from the floor to above my head there was a makeshift corridor that we could walk through but the newspapers towered on each side this could be it i told the doctor papers wet and musty if they moulded you dont think so we went through another oval doorway anybody home i saw the grand piano cobwebs glistening in my flashlights glare more newspapers towered around it hoarding some old folks the deputys voice quavered abruptly he coughed gagging from the stench i guess we do it room by room i told them so we went up to the attic starting downward trying for some order some sane balance newspapers and each room devoted to a decade and we found a bedroom on the second floor and it at least was normal if by that is meant no clutter and no useless objects but the bedroom was from the twenties or so i guessed i have no eye for furniture the canopy above the bed the stained glass fixtures and the heavy hopsack covers on the chairs these clearly were from another time the bed had not been slept in we had tried the lights they didnt work she didnt pay her bill i guess the deputy coughed again the dust the cobwebs that pervasive cloying stench we went with flashlights to the first floor and the cellar is the place that you suspect you ought to check first but you always wait until last we stood inside the pantry on the first floor in the back the stench even worse there i strained to muster control as i pulled the door the smell was like a veil that struck us wafting up we went down slowly board by creaking board you know im a trained observer ive been taught to stop emotion just to take in what i see but thats difficult especially when youre staring by the aid of flashlights and you see only one object at a time the horror mounting until you dont think you can bear it first the womans headless body on the floor the stench like old potatoes that have turned to liquid in their jackets something has seeped from her the urge to vomit is uncontrollable then for no reason you can understand you scan up with your flashlight and you see her head jammed in the noose the white hair dangling flesh now viscous on her cheeks her open eyes dissolving toward you but that isnt it yet not the final detail for once more without a reason you can understand as if you know that it will be there you aim your flashlight toward a corner toward a tiny table meant for dolls and set for tea where tied to a toy chair slumped is another body small and lonely a young girl you know this from the long hair and the bow and dress you wouldnt know it from the face which has been food for insects and that isnt it yet not the final detail for the clothes she wears are not from our time but rather from the old days straw hat button shoes and yellowed crinoline a motheaten satin party dress as if she wore a costume or had been compelled to act a part she didnt like the bow around her neck so tight her blackened tongue is bulging out my christ the deputy moans behind me and the bile that spews up in my mouth is bitter scalding all right help me understand this we are in my office downtown its lights glaring painfully although the night outside is cold filled with sudden autumn gusts i have opened all the windows turned the fan on anything to clear the stench she killed the child then hanged herself that much is obvious i say but why im new here i dont understand this what would make her do it i hear the rattle of the fan the doctor clears his throat agnes lived there since the house was new she and her husband built it but i thought that they had money then the doctor goes on without pause his voice is weak he was a banker they were prosperous the husband andrew was his name in the world was theirs they had a child a daughter who was three she died that fall diphtheria i know this from my father who was the doctor in charge of the case he couldnt save the daughter and he watched the parents ruined by their loss the husband left one day the wife became a recluse its so easy now in retrospect to understand you see from time to time there have been children missing usually in autumn just as now that girl we found for instance all the people whove been looking for her youll soon have to notify her parents i dont envy you my guess is that as agnes aged as she became more lonely and reclusive she went crazy she tried to find a substitute for what shed lost she kidnapped children but of course she couldnt let them live to tell what shed done she killed them but believed that they were still alive her own child the way children play make believe with dolls i ask if that analogy helps you this is sickness so bizarre it threatens sanity to think about it where did she put the corpses of those other children maybe when they started rotting she couldnt sustain her makebelieve maybe this final time she understood what shed become and hanged herself it works the deputy says nauseated his face still ashen it makes sense thats the trouble the doctor says a lunatics always logical but the logics horribly twisted there were many things to do id put off phoning for an ambulance id wanted to understand before the scene became disturbed a clue destroyed but i knew i had to act now make those calls tell the parents i reached for the phone but it rang in anticipation yes i asked and then i listened and i realized how wrong wed been i set down the phone and peered at them it wasnt her it wasnt agnes what the doctor and the deputy stared it was andrew i told them as i rushed toward the door he left in the doctor repeated no he never left they ran out with me toward the cruiser hes still in there but we searched the place the deputy insisted he was in there we were just too dumb to see him we scrambled into the cruiser i sped from the stations lot but i dont understand the doctor said i didnt have the will or time to argue i skidded around corners raced up side streets at that once great now dilapidated section of the town i ran out hurrying past the ruined gate up the weedchoked sidewalk past the porch holes through the stained glass door i know youre in here andrew come out now dont make me look for you the house was silent grotesque as i flashed my light and charged in toward the parlor dammit andrew if youve harmed her i swear ill punish you the way you punished all those children in a frenzy i yanked at the stacks of newspapers chief youd better get control the deputy said but i kept pulling yanking and the one side of the room was no good i swung toward the other help me i yelled to the deputy the doctor and we found him andrew in the music room or rather in a room within a room a room whose walls were stacks of newspapers he was in there almost eighty brittle and yet strangely spry he glared up at me smelling old like ancient newspapers squirming to hide his secret but i grabbed his shirt and yanked him to one side and there she was another young girl dressed in clothing from the twenties gagged and bound and staring wideeyed fearful for it had been andrew who grabbed the children he had never left hed only lost his mind agnes to protect and preserve him hid him but each time he killed a child her loyalty had weakened until at last faced with awful choices she had hanged herself unable to reveal him id guessed that he was there because that phone call had informed me of another missing child a child who from fright was now whitehaired always would be and if agnes hadnt done it who else but andrew yes that girl an adult now is whitehaired i can prove it for that small child was my daughter and she sometimes seems to know me when i visit her on weekends a final story about a house the hidden laughter was published the same year as black evening ever since i attended modernpoetry courses in college ive been haunted by ts eliots four quartets and in particular the first section burnt norton its eerie otherworldly tone the sense it creates of falling through and out of time when my family and i first arrived in iowa city we lived in a small pleasant ranch house which we eventually outgrew but even after we moved to a larger house in a different section of town we often drove back to the old neighborhood and paused to savor the memories associated with our six years in that house it represented our postcollege youth we associated it with the excitement and difficulty of getting started in the world i got to wondering if under the right circumstances a house could be loved enough that a person might develop a mystical bond with it to the exclusion of everything else the house which i continue to remember fondly is described in this story the hidden laughter theres a line somewhere in an eliot poem burnt norton i think about unheard music and leaves being full of children hidden in excitement laughing i have sensed that music almost seen those children not in leaves it turns out in a house though where i used to live except that all this was so long ago that now i think of i as he and how he turned to see her walking toward him she was looking very puzzled somethings funny at the house we sold she told him all the neighbors say there are children inside laughing what was odd of course was that hed locked it when theyd moved out and besides there were few children in that neighborhood all of them accounted for i think id better look she said she had a key you see until the new owners came to take possession just in case some trouble happened in the meantime and she loved that house the one that shed been married in so she was going back to take a final look he didnt think she ought to but he couldnt talk her out of it because he was working on some bookshelves he just told her that hed wait to hear about the laughter which he knew would be imaginary so she left and thats the last he ever saw of her this happened in the morning he postponed his lunch and waited for her finally he ate he figured she was visiting some friends in the old neighborhood and after all the kind of marriage that they had they both were free and easy so he didnt worry then the evening came and it was time for supper still she didnt come and now he did begin to worry after he made a meal and fed his children he began to phone but no one at the old neighborhood had seen her not since lunch at least shed checked the house he was told and as he had expected there was nothing then shed visited some friends again as hed expected after lunch shed gone back to the house just to see it one last time and people in the neighborhood had gone on with their business but yes wait a minute yes her car was still parked in the driveway down there and she must be with some other friends when he made more calls however he learned that no one else had seen her and he worried even more he thought that maybe shed had some trouble with the car and left it but she would have phoned him then that much was certain he got a sitter for the children and drove over the house was much the same as hed left it oh the grass was somewhat long the shrubs in need of a little trimming but except for that and dust on the outside windows it looked as if they still lived there as he stood at the curb and surveyed the place he felt a yearning for his youth for the days when he and she were just beginning dont mistake the place was not impressive oh acceptable but nothing more a singlestory ranch house with a lush maple tree on the right a stunted plum tree on the left and in the middle an overhang that formed a porch what they used to call lowincome housing when a house was something that ambitious saving people could afford a lot of things had changed since then more money and more complications that moment as he stood there watching brought back fond memories of early days and innocence he walked up toward the house and of course the door was locked that was exactly like her she had felt so close to what the house had meant to her that she would never have left it unsecured he had a key as well though and he turned it going in there was an echo off the bare walls and the floor the cabinets that theyd built the hardwood floors that theyd varnished these brought back a sequence of quick images the two of them starting their marriage he waited and he listened honey but he really didnt think thered be an answer he walked through the living room to the kitchen looking for some sign that she had been there but the kitchen was the way it should be and he continued to the stairs down to the basement maybe she had fallen when he took a breath and opened the door to look down though the concrete floor below was silent and he almost didnt go down but he knew he should be thorough so he checked the basement even looked behind the furnace and the washer and the dryer they had sold with the house he glanced inside the crawlspace then he went upstairs and checked the closets the two bedrooms the small bathroom but he didnt see a sign of her and now he didnt know what else to do he almost went back to the front door before he thought of the attic and for reasons he didnt understand he felt a chill at first he just dismissed it then he thought that she would have had no reason to go up there and he almost left the house but hed been determined to be thorough and he knew that failing to check the attic would soon nag him so he walked back to the hallway moving toward the trapdoor when he stretched he barely touched the ring but then he had it and he pulled and the foldout steps came down to reach the floor he waited just a moment longer there was something like the coocoocoo of pigeons up there one on top the other faint and soft and gentle and it sounded just enough like laughter that he guessed this maybe was what people had been hearing not exactly laughter more like giggling coocoocoo and then it stopped of course some birds had somehow gotten into the attic and theyd heard him going silent she had gone up there to look and maybe she was hurt he didnt think until later that the trapdoor would be open if she had he knew only that he needed to look and quickly so he scrambled up and there was nothing insulation cobwebs wiring but no sign of her no birds no laughter nothing there was must all through the close stale air and he checked in the corners sweating and he still found no sign of her he thought too late that he had climbed around up there without first looking for a disturbance in the dust now with the smudge marks where he had knelt among the rafters he could never tell if someone had preceded him he listened for the cooing looking for some explanation when the sweat became too much for him he eased back leaving outside he was puzzled he checked with the neighbors again thered been a man she talked to someone now remembered that but everyone was certain that shed been alone when shed returned to the house he walked back looking then he asked if he could use a neighbors phone he called other friends he called the hospital and on an impulse the police no help no sign of her and since there was no evidence of something wrong he learned that no policemen would be coming out just give her time shell be back he left the neighbors returning to the house but this time when he studied it the dusk now gray around it he was conscious of a sound no something less than that something on the other side of hearing more a presence than a sound coming from the house he took a step the thing subsided a moment later it rose again closer stronger he could almost touch it hear it he continued toward the house music unseen unheard faint and tinkling merry far away yet close when he reached the door he recognized the coocoocoo and yes he did hear laughter childrens laughter but he burst in and the house was dark and there was no one the laughter stopped although it hadnt really been there it was all in his imagination he has heard it many times since then however and he comes back often just to stand and wait and let it happen so much so that now he owns the place again he lives there with his children who dont remember her the years have led them forward flashes now and then but little recollection and he asks them but they do not hear the laughter and the answer the police at first suspected that he killed her but they found no body and he managed to convince them of his innocence he had seldom argued with her had always seemed to like her there was no other woman and no insurance as a motive still he often wonders with this tendency of his to be both i and he in past and present he could maybe have a double personality he could have killed her and as someone else he never would have known about it although he cant find a reason he would have all right she was kidnapped but there was never a ransom note and his mind cant sustain the thought of what a kidnapper who left no note would do to her imagining his wife alone and trembling he continues to hope that one day shell come back to him he even hopes although this would normally be painful that she left him that the changes theyd been going through werent half so good as when they first had started that the man whom someone might have seen had been a secret friend who led her to a better life he wishes and he grieves and in his constant emptiness imagines that she actually is with him all around him that she never went away but only back to where he asks himself and answers to her youth her innocence his theory is fantastic although consoling that in every persons life there is a place that one can fall through even by choice slip through that she lives now with the laughter in a better time and space and sometimes he can hear a woman in among the childrens laughter playing games perhaps or just enjoying bringing home to him those words from eliot again what might have been what has been my words echo with the laughter four stories in ten years im not prolific do authors who are prolific have a secret weapon something that increases their output a special typewriter for example the following story a mix of darkness and humor portrays the bleak side of author envy its longer than my previous stories and with a few exceptions establishes a trend from this point on youll be reading mostly novellas many of the cultural references in this piece truman capote and johnny carson for example are now out of date but when i attempted to substitute current equivalents the story didnt work at first puzzled i finally realized why truman and johnny had to stay this story belongs in the year it was published after all if it were current it would have to be about a word processor the typewriter eric tingled as if hed touched a faulty lightswitch or had stepped on a snake his skin felt cold he shuddered hed been looking for a kitchen chair his old one and the adjective was accurate in fact his only kitchen chair had been destroyed the previous night crushed to splinters by a drunken hefty poetess whod lost her balance and collapsed in candor poetess was far too kind a word for her disgustingly commercial shed insulted erics greenwich village party guests with verses about cats and rain and harbor lights i hear your sights i see your sounds a female rod mckuen dreadful eric had concluded cringing with embarrassment his literary parties set a standard after all he had his reputation to protect the subway press had just released his latest book of stories after birth the titles punning resonance had seemed pure genius to him then too he wrote his monthly column for the village mind reviewing metafiction and postmodern surreal prose so when this excuse for a poetess had arrived without an invitation to his party eric had almost told her to leave the editor from village mind had brought her though and eric sacrificed his standards for the sake of tact and the continuation of his column in the strained dry coughing that resulted from her reading eric had majestically arisen from his tattered cushion on the floor and salvaged the occasion by reciting his story cat scat but when he later gaped at the wreckage of his only kitchen chair he realized how wrong hed been to go against his principles the junk shop was a block away near nyu junk described it perfectly students bought their beds and tables from the wizened man who owned the place but sometimes lost among the junk there were bargains and more crucial eric didnt have much choice in truth his stories earned him next to nothing he survived by selling tshirts outside movie theaters and by taking handouts from his mother leaving the hot humid afternoon eric entered the junk shop something for you the wrinkled owner asked sweating eric said aloofly maybe im just browsing suit yourself friend the old man sucked a halfinch of cigarette his yellow fingernails needed clipping he squinted at a racetrack form the room was long and narrow cluttered with the leftovers of failure here a shattered mirror on a bureau there a musty mattress while sunlight fought to reach the rooms back reaches eric groped to find his way he touched a grimy coffee table with its legs splayed it sat on a sofa split down the middle dirty foam bulged disintegrating pungent odors flared his nostrils kitchen tables even one stained kitchen sink but eric couldnt find a kitchen chair he braved the farthest corners of the maze tripping over a lamp cord he fell hard against a waterstained dresser as he rubbed his side and felt cobwebs tickling his brow he faced a dusty pile of liberty colliers and saturday evening post and saw a low squat bulky object almost hidden in the shadows that was when he shuddered as if hed touched a spiders nest or heard a skeletons rattle the thing was worse than ugly it revolted him all those knobs and ridges curlicues and levers what purpose could they serve they were a grotesque demonstration of bad taste as if its owner had decided that the basic model needed decoration and had welded all this extra metal onto it a crazed machinists imitation of kinetic art abysmal eric thought the thing must weigh a hundred pounds whod ever want to type on such a monster but his mind began associating baudelaire les fleurs du mai oscar wilde aubrey beardsley yes the yellow book he felt inspired an ugly typewriter he grinned despite the prickles on his skin he savored what his friends would say about it hed tell them hed decided to continue baudelaires tradition hed be decadent hed be outrageous evil stories from an evil typewriter he might even start a trend how much for this monstrosity eric casually asked eh what the junk man looked up from his racing form this clunker here this mutilated typewriter oh that the old mans skin was sallow his hair looked like the cobwebs eric stood among you mean that priceless irreplaceable antique no i mean this contorted piece of garbage the old man considered him then nodded grimly forty bucks forty but thats outrageous ten forty and its not outrageous pal its business that fool things been on my hands for over twenty years i never shouldve bought it but it came with lots of good stuff and the owners wouldnt split the package twenty years two bucks a year for taking space im being generous i ought to charge a hundred lord i hate that thing then you ought to pay me to get it out of here and i should go on welfare but i dont forty just today for you a steal tomorrow it goes up to fifty tall and good looking eric was also extremely thin an artist ought to look ascetic he told himself although the fact was he didnt have much choice his emaciation wasnt only for effect it was also his penance the result of starvation art paid little hed discovered if you told the truth you werent rewarded how could he expect the system to encourage deviant opinions his apartment was only a block away but it seemed a mile his thin body ached as he struggled to carry his purchase knobs jabbed his ribs levers poked his armpits his knees bent his wrists strained at their sockets god almighty eric thought why did i buy this thing it doesnt weigh a hundred pounds it weighs a ton and ugly oh good lord the thing was ugly in the harsh cruel glare of day it looked even worse if that junk man turned his lights on for a change his customers could see what they were buying what a fool ive been eric thought i ought to go back and make him refund my money but behind the old mans counter thered been a sign the old man had jabbed a finger at it all sales final eric sweated up the birddungcovered steps to his apartment building tenement was more accurate the cracked front door had a broken lock inside plaster dangled from the ceiling paint peeled from the walls the floor bulged the stairway sagged the banister listed a cabbage smell overwhelmed him onions and a more pervasive odor that reminded him of urine he trudged up the stairs the old boards creaked and bent he feared theyd snap from the weight he carried three flights four mount everest was probably easier a group of teenagers rapists car thieves muggers he suspected snickered at him as they left an apartment one of the old winos on the stairs widened his bloodshot eyes as if he thought that what eric carried was an alcoholic hallucination at last he lurched up to the seventh floor but nearly lost his balance nearly fell back as he struggled down the hall his legs wobbled he groaned not just from his burden but from what he saw a man was pounding angrily on erics door the landlord hardass simmons although the nickname wasnt apt because his rear looked like two massive globs of jello quivering when he walked he had a beer gut and a whiskerstubbled face his lips looked like two worms as eric stopped he nearly lost his grip on the ugly typewriter he cringed and turned to go back down the stairs but simmons pounded on the door again pivoting his beefy hips disgustedly he saw his quarry in the hall so there you are he aimed a finger gunlike mr simmons nice to see you crap believe me its not mutual i want to see your money eric mouthed the word as if he didnt know what money meant the rent the landlord said what you forget to pay me every month the dough the cash the bucks but i already gave it to you simmons glowered in the stone age i dont run a charity you owe me three months rent my mothers awfully sick i had to give her money for the doctors bills dont hand me that the only time you see your mother is when you go crawling to her for a loan if i was you id find a way to make a

come youre not rich and whats that ugly thing youre holding jesus i hate to look at it you mustve found it in the garbage no i bought it eric straightened proud indignant at once the thing seemed twice as heavy making him stoop i needed a new typewriter youre dumber than i thought you mean you bought that piece of junk instead of paying me the rent i ought to kick you out of here right now two weeks youd better have the cash or youll be typing in the gutter simmons waddled past he lumbered down the creaky stairs a writer what a joke and im the king of england arthur hailey hes a writer harold robbins hes a writer judith krantz and sidney sheldon you my friend youre just a bum as eric listened to the booming laughter gradually recede down the stairs he chose between a clever answer and the need to set his typewriter down his aching arms were more persuasive angry he unlocked the door embarrassed he stared at his purchase well i cant just leave it in the hall he thought he nearly sprained his back to lift the thing he staggered in and kicked the door shut he surveyed his living room the dingy furniture reminded him of the junk shop where hed bought the stuff what a mess im in he told himself he didnt know where he could get the rent he doubted his mother would lend him more money last time at her penthouse on fifth avenue shed been angry with him your impractical romantic image of the struggling starving artist eric how did i go wrong i spoiled you that must be it i gave you everything youre not a youngster now youre thirtyfive youve got to be responsible youve got to find a job and be exploited eric had replied aghast debased the capitalistic system is degenerate shed shaken her head and tsktsktsked in disappointment but that system is the source of what i lend you if your father came back from that boardroom in the sky and saw how youve turned out hed drop dead from another heart attack ive not been fair my analyst says im restricting your development the fledgling has to learn to fly he says ive got to force you from the nest youll get no further money eric sighed now as he lugged the typewriter across the living room and set it on the chipped discolored kitchen counter hed have set it on the table but he knew the table would collapse from the weight even so the counter groaned and eric held his breath only when the counter stopped protesting did he exhale he watched water dripping from the rusty kitchen tap he glanced at the noisy kitchen clock which although he frequently reset it was always a half hour fast subtracting from where the hands were on the clock he guessed that the time was half past two a little early for a drink but ive got a good excuse he told himself a lot of good excuses cheap scotch from the previous nights party he poured an ounce and swallowed it gasping from the warmth that reached his complaining empty stomach well theres nothing here to eat he told himself and poured another drink this albatross took all the money id saved for food he felt like kicking it but since it wasnt on the floor instead he slammed it with his hand and nearly broke his fingers dancing around the room clutching his hand he winced and cursed to calm himself he poured more scotch christ my columns due tomorrow and i havent even started if i dont meet my deadline ill lose the only steady job ive got exasperated eric went into the living room where his old faithful olympia waited on its altarlike desk opposite the door the first thing people saw when they came in this morning hed tried to start the column but distracted by his broken kitchen chair he hadnt been able to find the words indeed distraction from his work was common with him now again he faced the blank page staring up at him again his mind blocked and no words came he sweated more profusely straining to think another drink would help he went back to the kitchen for his glass he lit a cigarette no words thats always been my problem he gulped the scotch art was painful if he didnt suffer his work would have no value joyce had suffered kafka mann the agony of greatness in the kitchen eric felt the scotch start to work on him the light paled the room appeared to tilt his cheeks felt numb he rubbed his awkward fingers through his thick blond necklong hair he peered disgustedly at the thing on the kitchen counter you he said ill bet your keys dont even work he grabbed a sheet of paper there he turned the roller and surprisingly it fed the paper smoothly well at least youre not an absolute disaster he drank more scotch lit another cigarette his column didnt interest him no matter how he tried he couldnt think of any theories about modern fiction the only thing on his mind was what would happen in two weeks when simmons came to get the rent it isnt fair the systems against me that inspired him yes hed write a story hed tell the world exactly what he thought about it he already knew the title just four letters and he typed them scum the keys moved easier than hed expected smoothly slickly but as gratified as eric felt he was also puzzled for the keys typed longer than was necessary his lips felt thick his mind felt sluggish as he leaned down to see what kind of imprint the old ribbon had made he blinked and leaned much closer hed typed scum but what he read was fletchers cove astonishment made him frown had he drunk so much he couldnt control his typing were his alcoholawkward fingers hitting keys at random no for if he typed at random he ought to be reading gibberish and fletchers cove although the words werent what hed intended certainly wasnt gibberish my mind he told himself its playing tricks i think im typing one thing but unconsciously im typing something else the scotch is confusing me to test his theory eric concentrated to uncloud his mind and make his fingers more alert taking care that he typed what he wanted he hit several keys the letters clattered onto the paper taking the exact amount of time they should have something was wrong though as he frowned toward the page he saw that what hed meant to type a story had come out as something else a novel eric gaped he knew he hadnt written that besides hed always written stories hed never tried he didnt have the discipline to write a novel what the hell was going on in frustration he quickly typed the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog but this is what he read the town of fletcher s cove had managed to survive as it had always managed to survive the fierce atlantic winter that awful tingle again like ice this is crazy he thought ive never heard of fletchers cove and that redundant clause its horrible its decoration gingerbread appalled he struck the keys repeatedly at frenzied random hoping to read nonsense praying he hadnt lost his mind instead of nonsense this is what he saw the townsfolk were as rugged as the harsh new england coastline they had characters of granite able to withstand the punishments of nature as if they had learned the techniques of survival from the sturdy rocks along the shore impervious to tidal onslaughts eric flinched he knew he hadnt typed those words whats more he never could have forced himself to type them they were terrible redundancy was everywhere and lord those strained commercial images the sentences were hack work typical of gushy bestsellers anger seized him he typed frantically determined to discover what was happening his writers block had disappeared the notion of bestsellers had inspired him to write a column scorning the outrageous decadence of fiction that was cynically designed to pander to the basest common taste but what he read was deep december snows enshrouded fletchers cove the land lay dormant frozen january february the townsfolk huddled imprisoned near the stove and hearth inside their homes they scanned the toofamiliar faces of their forced companions while the savage wind howled past their bedroom windows wives and husbands soon grew bored with one another march came with its early thaw then april and the land became alive again but as the warm spring air rekindled nature so within the citizens of fletchers cove strong passions smoldered eric stumbled toward the scotch this time he ignored the glass and drank straight from the bottle he shook nauseous scared to death as the tasteless scotch dribbled from his lips his mind spun he clutched the kitchen counter for support in his delirium he thought of only three explanations one hed gone insane two he was so drunk that like the wino on the stairs he was hallucinating three the hardest to accept this wasnt an ordinary typewriter the way it looks should tell you that good god the telephones harsh ring jolted him he nearly slipped from the counter fighting for balance he teetered toward the living room the phone was one more thing hed soon lose he knew for two months hed failed to pay the bill the way his life was going he suspected that this call was from the telephone company telling him it was canceling his service he fumbled to pick up the phone hesitant he said hello but those two syllables slurred combining as one lo he said and repeated in confusion lo is that you eric a mans loud nasal voice told him you sound different are you sick youve got a cold the editor of village mind no i was working on my column eric attempted to control the drunken thickness in his voice the phone surprised me on your column listen eric i could break this to you gently but i know youre strong enough to take it on the chin forget about your column i wont need it what youre canceling my eric felt his heart skip hey not just your column everything the village mind is folding its kaput bankrupt hell why beat around the bush its broke his editors clich√©s had always bothered eric but now he felt too stunned to be offended broke terror flooded through him absolutely busted see the irs wont let me write the magazine off they insist its a tax dodge not a business fascists to be honest eric theyre right it is a tax dodge you should see the way i juggle my accounts now eric was completely certain hed gone insane he couldnt actually be hearing this the village mind a fraud a con game you cant be serious hey look dont take this hard huh nothing personal its business you can find another magazine got to run pal see you sometime eric heard the sudden drone of the dial tone its dull monotony amplified inside his head his stomach churned the system once again the system had attacked him was there nothing sacred even art he dropped the phone back on its cradle hopeless he rubbed his throbbing forehead if he didnt get his check tomorrow his phone would be disconnected hed be dragged from his apartment the police would find his starved emaciated body in the gutter either that or eric cringed hed have to find a steady here he swallowed with great difficulty job he panicked could he borrow money from his friends he heard their scornful laughter could he beg more money from his mother he imagined her disowning him it wasnt fair hed pledged his life to art and he was starving while those hacks churned out their trashy bestsellers and were millionaires there wasnt any justice a thought gleamed an idea clicked into place a trashy bestseller something those hacks churned out well in his kitchen waiting on the counter was a hideous contraption that a while ago had churned like crazy that horrific word again like crazy yes and he was crazy to believe that what had happened in his drunken fit was more than an illusion better see a shrink he told himself and how am i supposed to pay him totally discouraged eric tottered toward the scotch in the kitchen might as well get blotto nothing else will help he stared at the grotesque typewriter and the words on the paper although the letters were now blurred by alcohol they nonetheless were readable and more important they seemed actual he swigged more scotch tapping at keys in stupefaction randomly no longer startled when the gushy words made sense it was a sign of his insanity he told himself that he could stand here at this kitchen counter hitting any keys he wanted and not be surprised by the result no matter what the cause or explanation he apparently was automatically composing the outrageous saga of the passions and perversions of the folks in fletchers cove yes johnny eric told the television personality and smiled with humble candor fletchers cove burst out of me in one enormous flash of inspiration frankly the experience was scary id been waiting all my life to tell that story but i wasnt sure i had the talent then one day i took a chance i sat down at my faithful battered typewriter i bought it in a junk shop johnny thats how poor i was and fate or luck or something was on my side for a change my fingers seemed to dance across the keys the story leapt out from me toward the page a day doesnt go by that i dont thank the lord for how hes blessed me johnny tapped a pencil on his desk with practiced ease the studio lights blazed eric sweated underneath his thousanddollar sharkskin suit his twohundreddollar designer haircut felt stiff from hairspray in the glare he squinted but couldnt see the audience although he sensed their firm approval of his ragstoriches wonderful success america was validated one day thered be a shrine to honor its most cherished saint horatio alger eric youre too modest youre not just our countrys most admired novelist youre also a respected critic not to mention a short story of yours won a prestigious literary prize prestigious eric inwardly frowned hey be careful johnny with a word that big youll lose our audience ive got a book to sell yes eric said admiring his hosts sophisticated lightgray hair the heyday of the village mind the good old days in greenwich village thats a disadvantage of success i miss the gang down at washington square i miss the coffee houses and the nights when wed get together reading stories to each other testing new ideas talking till after dawn like hell i miss them eric thought that dump i lived in that fatassed simmons he can have his cockroach colony and those winos on the stairs the village mind a more descriptive title would have been the village idiot and literary prize the subway press awarded prizes every month sure with the prizes and a quarter you could buy a cup of coffee youll admit success has its advantages johnny said eric shrugged disarmingly a few more creature comforts youre a wealthy man you bet im wealthy eric thought two million bucks for the hardback four million for the paperback two million for the movie and another million from the book club then the british rights the other foreign rights in twenty countries fifteen million was the total ten percent went to his agent five percent to his publicity director after that the irs held out its hand but eric had been clever oil and cattle real estate he coveted tax shelters his trips to europe he wrote off as research hed incorporated his estate his jet his yacht he wrote off as expenses after all a man in his position needed privacy to write to earn more money for the government after taking advantage of every tax dodge he could find he pocketed nine million not bad for a fortybuck investment although to hedge against inflation eric wished hed found a way to keep a few more million well i cant complain but johnny money isnt everything oh sure if someone wants to give it to me i wont throw the money in the hudson river eric laughed and heard the audience respond in kind their laughter was goodnatured you can bet they wouldnt turn down money either no the thing is johnny the reward i most enjoy comes when i read the letters from my fans the pleasure theyve received from fletchers cove is more important than material success its what this business is about the reading public eric paused the interview had gone too smoothly smoothness didnt sell his book what people wanted was a controversy beneath the blazing lights his underarms sweated in profusion he feared hed stain his sharkskin suit and ruin it but then he realized he could always buy another one i know what truman capote says that fletchers cove is hardly writing its mere typing but hes used that comment several times before and if you want to know what i think hes done several other things too many times before the audience began to laugh but this time cruelly johnny im still waiting for that novel he keeps promising im glad i didnt hold my breath the audience laughed more derisively if truman had been present theyd have stoned him to be honest johnny i think trumans lost his touch with that great readership out there the middle of america ive tasted modern fiction and it makes me gag what people want are bulging stories filled with glamour romance action and suspense the kind of thing dickens wrote the audience applauded with approval eric johnny said you mentioned dickens but a different writer comes to mind a man whose work was popular back in the fifties winston davis if i hadnt known you wrote fletchers cove id have sworn it was something new by davis but of course that isnt possible the mans dead a tragic boating accident when he was only fortyeight just off long island i believe im flattered you thought of davis eric said in fact youre not the only reader whos noticed the comparison hes an example of the kind of author i admire his enormous love of character and plot those small towns in new england he immortalized the richness of his prose ive studied everything davis wrote im trying to continue his tradition people want true honest human stories eric hadnt even heard of winston davis until fans began comparing erics book with davis s puzzled eric had gone to the new york public library hed squirmed with discomfort as hed tried to struggle through a half dozen books by davis eric couldnt finish any of them tasteless dreck mindnumbing trash the prose was deadening but eric recognized it the comparison was valid fletchers cove was like a book by winston davis eric had frowned as hed left the public library hed felt that tingle again despite their frequent appearances throughout fletchers cove hed never liked coincidences one last question johnny said your fans are anxious for another novel can you tell us what the new ones about id like to but im superstitious johnny im afraid to talk about a work while its in progress i can tell you this though eric glanced around suspiciously as if he feared that spies from rival publishers were lurking in the studio he shrugged and laughed i guess i can say it after all whod steal a title after several million people heard me stake a claim to it the new book is called parsons grove he heard a sigh of rapture from the audience it takes place in a small town in vermont and well id better not go any farther when the book is published everyone can read it totally fantastic erics agent said his name was jeffrey amgott he was in his thirties but his hair was gray and thin from worry he frowned constantly his stomach gave him trouble and his motions were so hurried that he seemed to be on speed perfect what you said about capote guaranteed to sell another hundred thousand copies i figured eric said outside the studio he climbed in the limousine but you dont look happy the carson show was taped in the late afternoon but the smog was so thick it looked like twilight weve got problems jeffrey said i dont see what here have a drink to calm your nerves and wreck my stomach thanks but no thanks listen ive been talking to your business manager i hear it coming you both worry too damn much but youve been spending money like youre printing it that jet that yacht that big estate you cant afford them hey ive got nine million bucks let me live a little no you dont eric stared i beg your pardon you havent got nine million dollars all those trips to europe that beach house here in malibu the place in bimini ive got investments oil and cattle the wells went dry the cattle died from hoofandmouth disease youre kidding me my stomach isnt kidding youve got mortgages on those estates your ferrari isnt paid for the lear jet isnt paid for either youre flat broke ive been extravagant i grant you jeffrey gaped extravagant extravagant youve lost your mind is what youve done youre my agent make another deal for me i did already whats the matter with you have you lost your memory with your mind a week from now your publisher expects a brand new book from you hes offering three million dollars for the hardback rights i let him have the book he lets me have the money thats the way the contract was arranged have you forgotten whats the problem then three million bucks will pay my bills but where the hells the book you dont get any money if you dont deliver the manuscript im working on it jeffrey moaned dear god you mean it isnt finished yet i asked you no i pleaded with you please stop partying get busy write the book and then have all the parties you want what is it all those women did they sap your strength your brains or what youll have the book a week from now oh eric i wish i had your confidence you think writings like turning on a tap its work suppose you get a block suppose you get the flu or something how can anybody write a novel in a week youll have the book i promise jeffrey anyway if im a little late it doesnt matter im worth money to the publisher hell extend the deadline damn it you dont listen everything depends on timing the new hardbacks been announced it should have been delivered and edited months ago the release of the paperback of fletchers cove is tied to it the stores are expecting both books the printers waiting the publicitys set to start if you dont deliver the publisher will think youve made a fool of him youll lose your media spots the book club will get angry not to mention your foreign publishers whove announced the new book in their catalogues theyre depending on you eric you dont understand big business you dont disappoint big business not to worry eric smiled to reassure him everythings taken care of robert evans invited me to a party tonight but afterward ill get to work god help you eric hit those keys man hit those keys the lear jet soared from lax above the city eric peered down toward the grids of streetlights and gleaming freeways in the darkness might as well get started he decided with reluctance the cocaine hed snorted on the way to the airport gave him energy as the engines muffled roar came through the fuselage he reached inside a cabinet and lifted out the enormous typewriter he took it everywhere with him afraid that something might happen to it if it was unattended struggling he set it on a table hed given orders to the pilot not to come back to the passenger compartment a thick bulkhead separated eric from the cockpit here as at his mansion up the hudson eric did his typing in strict secrecy the work was boring really toward the end of fletchers cove he hadnt even faced the keyboard hed watched a week of television while he let his fingers tap whatever letters they happened to select after all it didnt make a difference what he typed the strange machine did the composing at the end of every television program hed read the last page the machine had typed hoping to see the end and one day finally those closing words appeared before him after the success of fletchers cove hed started typing again hed read the title parsons grove and worked patiently for twenty pages unenthusiastically what hed learned from his experience was that hed never liked writing that instead he liked to talk about it and be called a writer but the pain of work did not appeal to him and this way when his mind wasnt engaged the work was even less appealing to be absolutely honest eric thought i should have been a prince hed put off typing parsons grove as long as possible the money came so easily he didnt want to suffer even the one week hed calculated would be necessary to complete the manuscript but jeffrey had alarmed him theres no money then id better go back to the gold mine the goose that laid the golden egg or what was it a writers helper used to be called amanuensis sure thats what ill call you eric told his weird machine from now on youll be my amanuensis he couldnt believe he was actually a millionaire at least on paper flying in his own lear jet en route to new york and the today show this cant be really happening it was though and if eric wanted to continue his fine life hed better type like hell for one week to produce his second book the jet streaked through the night he shoved a sheet of paper into his amanuensis bored he sipped a glass of dom perignon he selected a cassette of halloween and put it in his vcr watching television where some kid stabbed his big sister eric started typing chapter three ramona felt a rapture she had never known such pleasure not her husband not her lover had produced such ecstasy within her yes the milkman eric yawned he watched a nut escape from an asylum he watched some crazy doctor try to find the nut a babysitter screamed a lot the nut got killed a half dozen times but still survived because apparently he was the boogey man without once looking at the keyboard eric typed the stack of pages grew beside him he finished drinking his fifth glass of dom perignon halloween ended he watched alien and an arousing woman in her underwear whod trapped herself inside a shuttle with a monster somewhere over indiana eric later calculated where and when it happened he glanced at a sheet of paper hed just typed and gasped when he discovered that the prose was total nonsense he fumbled through the stack of paper realizing that for half an hour hed been typing gibberish he paled he gaped he nearly vomited good god whats happened he typed madly little bo peep has lost her sheep those words were what he read he typed the quick brown fox and that was what he read he scrambled letters and the scramble faced him by the time he reached laguardia airport he had a stack of frantic gibberish beside him and to make things worse the typewriter jammed he heard a nauseating crunch inside it and the keys froze solidly he couldnt make them type even gibberish its got a block he thought and moaned dear god its broken busted wrecked we both are he tried slamming it to free the keys but all he managed to do was hurt his hands jesus id better be careful i might break more parts inside drunkenly he set a blanket over it and struggled from the jet to put it in the limousine that waited for him he wasnt due at the television interviews until the next day as the sun glared blindingly he rubbed his haggard whiskerstubbled face and in panic told the chauffeur manhattan find a shop that fixes typewriters the errand took two hours through stalled trucks accidents and detours finally the limousine doubleparked on thirtysecond street and eric stumbled with his burden toward a store with olivettis in the window i cant fix this the young serviceman informed him eric moaned youve got to see this brace inside its cracked i dont have any parts for something strange like this the serviceman looked horrified by the sheer ugliness of the machine id have to weld the brace but buddy look a piece of junk this old its like a wornout shirt you patch an elbow and the shirt tears at the patch you patch the new hole and the shirt tears at the new patch when youre through you havent got a shirt youve just got patches if i weld this brace the heatll weaken this old metal and the bracell crack in other places youll keep coming back till youve got more welds than metal anyway a weird design like this i wouldnt want to fool with it believe me buddy i dont understand this thing youd better find the guy who built it maybe he can fix it maybe hes got extra parts say dont i know you eric frowned i beg your pardon arent you famous werent you on the carson show no youre mistaken eric told him furtively he glanced at his gold rolex and saw that it was almost noon good god hed lost the morning ive got to hurry eric grabbed the broken typewriter and tottered from the building toward the limousine the traffics blare unnerved him greenwich village eric blurted to the bored chauffeur as fast as you can get there in this traffic sir its noon this is midtown erics stomach soured he trembled sweating when the driver reached the village eric gave directions in a frenzy he kept glancing at his watch at almost twenty after one he had a sudden fearful thought oh god suppose the place is closed suppose the old guys dead or out of business eric cringed but then he squinted through the windshield seeing the dusty windows of the junk shop down the street he scrambled from the limousine before it stopped he grabbed the massive typewriter and although adrenaline spurred him his knees wobbled as he fumbled at the creaky junk shop door and lurched inside the musty narrow shadowed room the old guy stood exactly where hed been the last time eric walked in hunched across a battered desk a halfinch of cigarette between his yellowed fingers scowling at a racetrack form he even wore the same frayed sweater with the buttons missing cobweb hair sallow face the old guy peered up from the racing form all sales are final cant you read the sign off balance from his burden eric cocked his head in disbelief you still remember me you bet i do i cant forget that piece of trash i told you i dont take returns but thats not why im here then whyd you bring that damn thing back good god its ugly i cant stand to look at it its broken yeah it figures i cant get it fixed the serviceman wont touch it hes afraid hell break it even more so throw it in the garbage sell it as scrap metal it weighs enough youll maybe get a couple dollars but i like it have you always had bad taste the serviceman suggested the guy who built it might know how to fix it and if cows had wings look tell me where you got it how much is the information worth to you a hundred bucks the old man looked suspicious i wont take a check in cash for gods sake hurry wheres the money the old man took several hours eric paced and smoked and sweated finally the old man came groaning up from his basement with some scribbles on a scrap of paper an estate out on long island some guy died he drowned i think lets see the old man struggled to decipher what hed scrawled on the scrap of paper yeah his name was winston davis eric clutched the battered desk his stomach fluttered his heart skipped several beats no that cant be you mean you know this guy this winston davis eric tasted dust ive heard of him he was a novelist his voice was hoarse i hope he didnt try to write his novels on that thing its like i told you when you bought it i tried every way i knew to make them keep it but the owners sold the dead guys stuff in one big lump they wouldnt split the package everything or nothing on long island the address is on this paper eric grabbed it frantically picked up the heavy typewriter and stumbled toward the door say dont i know your face the old man asked werent you on the carson show last night the sun had almost set as eric found his destination all the way across long island hed trembled fearfully he realized now why so many readers had compared his work with that of winston davis davis had once owned this same machine hed typed his novels on it the machine had done the actual composing thats why erics work and davis s were similar their novels had the same creator just as eric kept the secret so had davis evidently never telling even his close friends or his family when davis died the family had assumed that this old typewriter was nothing more than junk and theyd sold it with some other junk around the house if theyd known about the secret surely theyd have kept this golden goose this gold mine but it wasnt any gold mine now it was a hunk of junk a broken hulk of bolts and levers heres the mansion sir the totallyconfused chauffeur told eric frightened eric studied the big open gates the wide smooth lawn the huge black road that curved up to the massive house its like a castle eric thought apprehensively he told the driver go up to the front suppose theres no one home he thought suppose they dont remember what if someone else is living there he left his burden in the car at once both hesitant and frantic he walked up the marble front steps toward the large oak door his fingers shook he pressed a button heard the echo of a bell inside and was surprised when someone opened the door a grayhaired woman in her sixties kindly well dressed pleasant looking smiling with a feeble voice she asked how she could help him eric stammered but the womans gentle gaze encouraged him and soon he spoke to her with ease explaining that he knew her husbands work and admired it how good of you to remember she said i was in the neighborhood i hoped you wouldnt mind if i stopped by to tell you how i felt about his novels wouldnt mind no im delighted so few readers take the time to care wont you come in the mansion seemed to eric like a mausoleum cold and echoing would you like to see my husbands study where he worked the aging woman asked they went along a chilly marble hall the old woman opened an ornate door and gestured toward the sacristy the sanctum it was wonderful a high wide spacious room with priceless paintings on the walls and bookshelves thick soft carpeting big windows that faced the whitecapped ocean where three sunsettinted sailboats scudded in the evening breeze but the attraction of the room was in its middle a large gleaming teakwood desk and like a chalice on its center an old smithcorona from the fifties this is where my husband wrote his books the old woman told him proudly every morning eight until noon then wed have lunch and wed go shopping for our dinner or wed swim or use the sailboat in the winter we took long walks by the water winston loved the ocean in the winter he im babbling please forgive me no its quite all right i understand the way you feel he used this smithcorona every day i ask because i bought a clunky typewriter the other day it looked so strange it appealed to me the man who sold it told me your husband used to own it no i erics chest cramped his heart sank in despair wait i remember now the grayhaired woman said and eric held his breath that awful ugly one she said yes that describes it winston kept it in a closet i kept telling him to throw it out but winston said his friend would never forgive him friend the word stuck like a fishbone in erics throat yes stuart donovan they often sailed together one day winston brought that strange machine home its antique he said a present stuart gave it to me well it looked like junk to me but friends are friends and winston kept it when he died though the old womans voice changed pitch sank deeper seemed to crack well anyway i sold it with some other things i didnt need eric left the car the sun had set the dusk loomed thickly around him he smelled salty sea air in this quaint long island coastal village he stared at the sign above the shops door donovans typewriters new and used rebuilt restored his plan had been to find the shop and come back in the morning when it opened but amazingly a light glowed faintly through the drawn blind of the window although a card on the door said closed a shadow moved behind the shielded window eric knocked a figure shuffled close an ancient gentlemen pulled up the blind and squinted out toward eric closed the old man told him faintly through the window no i have to see you its important closed the man repeated winston davis although the shadow had begun to turn it stopped again pulling the blind the ancient gentleman peered out did you say winston davis please i have to talk to you about him eric heard the lock snick open the door swung slowly inward the old man frowned at him is your name stuart donovan the old man nodded winston we were friends for many years thats why i have to see you then come in the old man told him puzzled short and frail he leaned on a wooden cane he wore a doublebreasted suit a thin silk tie the collar of his shirt was too large for his shrunken neck he smelled of peppermint i have to show you something eric said hurrying back from the limousine he lugged his ugly typewriter toward the shop why thats the old mans eyes widened in surprise i know it was your gift to winston where i bought it in a junk shop wearied by his grief the old man groaned its broken eric said ive brought it here for you to fix then you know about its secret absolutely look i need it im in trouble if it isnt fixed you sound like winston the old mans eyes blurred with memories of long ago a few times when it broke he came to me in total panic contracts royalties im ruined if you cant repair it hed say to me i always fixed it though the old man chuckled nostalgically and will you do the same for me ill pay you anything oh no my rates the same for everyone i was about to leave my wife has supper waiting but this model was my masterpiece ill look at it for winston bring it over to the counter eric set it down and rubbed his aching arms what i dont understand is why you didnt keep this thing its worth a fortune i had others eric stiffened with surprise then too the old man said ive always had sufficient money rich folks have too many worries winston for example toward the end he was a nervous wreck afraid that this typewriter would break beyond repair it ruined him i wish i hadnt given it to him but he was good to me he always gave me ten percent of everything he earned ill do the same for you please fix it help me ill see what the problem is the old man tinkered hummed hawed and poked he took off bolts and tested levers eric bit his lips he chewed his fingernails i know whats wrong the old man said that brace is cracked oh thats a minor problem i have other braces i can easily replace it eric sighed with relief then if you wouldnt mind the keys are stuck because the brace is cracked the old man said before the keys stuck though this model wasnt typing what you wanted it wasnt composing eric feared hed throw up he nodded palely see the trouble is the old man said this typewriter ran out of words it used up every word it had inside it eric fought the urge to scream this cant be happening he told himself then put more words inside it dont i wish i could but once the words are gone i cant put new ones in i dont know why that happens but ive tried repeatedly and every time ive failed i have to build a brand new model do it then ill pay you anything im sorry but i cant ive lost the knack i made five successful models the sixth and seventh failed the eighth was a complete disaster i stopped trying try again i cant you dont know how it weakens me the effort afterward my brain feels empty i need every word ive got god dammit try the old man shook his head you have my sympathy beyond the old man past the counter in the workshop eric saw another model knobs and levers bolts ill pay a million dollars for that other one the old man slowly turned to look oh that one no im sorry thats my own i built it for my children now theyre married they have children of their own and when they visit my grandchildren like to play with it ill double what i offered eric thought about his mansion on the hudson his estates in bimini and malibu his yacht his jet his european trips and his ferrari hell ill triple what i offered six more days he thought ive got to finish that new book by then ill just have time to do it if i type every day and night youve got to let me have it i dont need the money im an old man what does money mean to me im sorry eric lost control he scrambled past the counter racing toward the workshop he grabbed the other model when the old man tried to take it from him eric pushed the old man fell clutching erics legs its mine the old man wailed i built it for my children you cant have it four four million dollars eric shouted not for all the money in the world the old man clung to erics legs dammit eric said he set the model on the counter grabbed the old mans cane and struck his head i need it dont you understand he struck again and again and again the old man shuddered blood dripped from the cane the shop was silent eric stared at what hed done stumbling back he dropped the cane and put his hands to his mouth and then he realized its mine he wiped his fingerprints from everything hed touched he exchanged the models so his broken one sat on the workshop table his chauffeur wouldnt know what had happened it was likely hed never learn the murder of an old man in a tiny village on long island there was little reason for publicity true mrs davis might recall her evening visitor but would she link this murder with her visitor and anyway she didnt know who eric was he took his chance he grabbed his prize and despite its weight he ran his ibm word processor sat on the desk in his study for pure show he never used it but he needed it to fool his guests to hide the way he actually composed he vaguely heard the limousine drive from the mansion toward the city he turned on the lights hurrying toward his desk he shoved the ibm away and set down his salvation six more days yes he could do the job a lot of champagne and television stiff joints in his aching fingers after all the automatic typing he could do it though he poured a brimming glass needing it he turned the late show on he lit a cigarette and as the body snatchers credits began he desperately started typing he felt shaky scared and shocked by what had happened but he had another model he could keep his yacht his jet his three estates the parties could continue now that eric thought about it hed even saved the four million dollars he would have paid the old man for this model curious on impulse eric glanced at what hed typed so far and began to scream because his random typing had become something different as hed expected but not the gushy prose of parsons grove something far more different see jack run see jill run see spot chase the ball i built it for my children now theyre married they have children of their own and when they visit my grandchildren like to play with it he screamed so loudly he couldnt hear the clatter as he typed see spot run up the hill see jill run after spot see jack run after jill the neighbors half a mile away were wakened by his shrieks they feared he was being murdered so they called and when the state police broke into the house they found eric typing screaming they werent sure which sight was worse the man or the machine but when they dragged him from the monstrous typewriter one of the state policeman glanced down at the page see jill climb the tree see jack climb the tree see spot bark at jack then farther down they soon discovered what it meant see eric murder mr donovan see eric club the old man with the cane see eric steal me now see eric go to jail perhaps it was a trick of light or maybe it was the consequence of the machines peculiar keyboard for whatever reason the state policeman later swore he told only his wife the damned typewriter seemed to grin dennis etchison is both a gifted fiction writer and a respected editor of short story anthologies in for the third volume of his masters of darkness series he asked me and a number of other contributors clive barker stephen king dean koontz joyce carol oates and more to choose a favorite from the stories we had written he also requested that we compose an afterword explaining our choice the following is what i submitted a trap for the unwary how does a writer choose a story among many that typifies what he or she has been trying to accomplish prior to selecting but at my back i always hear i reread several others and finally settled on this one not because its my most horrific although i did find my skin go cold but not to the frigid degree that was caused by for these and all my sins or the middle section of my novel testament and not because its style was experimental as was the hidden laughter but precisely because this story was so typical an example of a technique and various themes ive returned to again and again lets deal with the technique first like many novelists i find the discipline the compression of a story enormously difficult theres an irony here in the early seventies my initial effort at fiction was first blood but after i sent it to my agent i had a nightmare that so compelled me i wrote it verbatim a story called the dripping which was purchased by ellery queens mystery magazine and became my first sale two weeks before my agent phoned to tell me a publisher had accepted first blood other writers will understand the dripping to me will always be special a validation of my dreams but as i labored on my next book the dreaded second novel syndrome can i possibly do it again short story nightmares failed to visit me and as that second novel testament continued to give me problems to aggravate my insecurity i craved the satisfaction of writing another short microcosmic i can do it with luck in a couple of days validation of my ambition to be a hypnotist a magician a teller of tales i was then a professor of literature at the university of iowa by chance preparing for a class i picked up robert brownings my last duchess and felt a prickle of revelation you see the dripping had been a first person narrative but ive always been suspicious of first person narratives because of my admiration for henry james the master commenting on his consummate horror novel the turn of the screw had called his tale a trap for the unwary because its first person technique made it impossible to decide if the narrator was telling the truth about the ghosts she encountered or if she was hopelessly insane james in fact disdained the firstperson technique calling the device a trick in which the only interest for the reader was to decide if the i of the story was selfdeluded a liar or crazy so how could i devoted to the master feel justified in following my instincts to repeat to build on what id done in the dripping if the viewpoint i felt compelled to use had been dismissed by one of my literary heroes robert brownings my last duchess supplied the answer its called a dramatic monologue a technique hes given credit for creating not in a play where a soliloquys an accepted convention but on a page in a poem thats my last duchess painted on the wall browning begins or rather his narrator does and i thought who is the speaker addressing and how did the reader happen to receive these words the technique is unbelievable artificial yet wonderfully effective around the same time i fell in love with the novels of james m cain they threw me off the hay truck about noon thats how the postman always rings twice begins one of the alltime great first sentences in one of the greatest thrillers ever written but cains narrator wasnt addressing an imagined audience viewing a stage no that damned fatecontrolled aggressorvictim was writing his story as a form of confession while he waited tough and controlled to be executed for murder so i asked myself why not pretend you never read james why not concentrate on browning and cain and that decision broke my short story writers block i embraced the first person technique its direct its intimate its vivid and it allows a writer to compress the tormented narrator blurts out his tale of horror until the end of but at my back i always hear the story is due to browning but when the herovictim picks up the pen and paper in his hotel room and reveals that all along hes been writing his tale of terror as a document so the people who find his body will understand his predestined doom thats cain and god bless him he showed me the way now about theme for reasons too complex to elaborate in this brief space im obsessed about security that topic is manifest in all of my work the worst horror i could ever imagine was to lose my family to lose a member of my family to be separated from those i love in real life that horror became all too factual on june my wonderful fifteenyearold son matthew died after six months of agony from bone cancer i described that ordeal in a book called fireflies but in the dripping and other stories before matthews death i was already terrified by versions of that ultimate horror the narrator in but at my back i always hear loses everything he cherishes not because its his fault but because of fate because sometimes things dont work out because god help me life isnt fair then too i was a professor of literature and i did have a student who claimed i was sending sexual telepathic messages to her she did keep calling threatening haunting not only me i can deal with that but my family most of but at my back i always hear is true except that the student is still alive and for all i know lurking finally after i moved from where i was raised in canada to graduate school in pennsylvania and then to the university of iowa i fell in love with the boundless sky and intoxicating fertile beauty of my adopted state i call it exotic watch the movie field of dreams to understand what i mean it occurred to me that horror didnt have to fester in the traditional hawthorneinvented gloom of new england or in the oppressive ghettos of decaying major cities but in bright sunlight in the midst of splendor remember cary grant racing desperately to escape the machinegun bullets from the innocent cropduster in hitchcocks north by northwest i began to envision a series of stories that would take advantage of the broad midwest and interstate and the space the sublime hence terrifying space between one isolated community and another i explored that notion in several stories the storm for these and all my sins others even the time zone changes are fraught with danger so if you desperately need security as the hero of but at my back i always hear does and as its author does you choose this story as representative of your work my alterego professor sacrifices his life and his soul for his family good man i understand him all too well because given the chance i would gladly have sacrificed my life and soul to save my son but at my back i always hear she phoned again last night at three am the way she always does im scared to death i cant keep running on the hotels register downstairs i lied about my name address and occupation although im here in johnstown pennsylvania im from iowa city iowa i teach or used to teach until three days ago american literature at the university i cant risk going back there but i dont think i can hide much longer each night she comes closer from the start she scared me i came to school at eight to prepare my classes through the side door of the english building i went up a stairwell to my third floor office which was isolated by a fire door from all the other offices my colleagues used to joke that id been banished but i didnt care for in my faroff corner i could concentrate few students interrupted me regardless of the busy noises past the fire door i sometimes felt that there was no one else inside the building and indeed at eight am i often was the only person in the building that day i was wrong however clutching my heavy briefcase i trudged up the stairwell my scraping footsteps echoed off the walls of pale red cinderblock the stairs of pale green imitation marble first floor second floor the fluorescent lights glowed coldly then the stairwell angled toward the third floor and i saw her waiting on a chair outside my office pausing i frowned up the stairs at her i felt uneasy eight am for you is probably not early youve been up for quite a while so you can get to work on time or get your children off to school but eight am for college students is the middle of the night they dont like morning classes when their schedules force them to attend one they dont crawl from bed until they absolutely have to and they dont come stumbling into class until im just about to start my lecture i felt startled then to find her waiting ninety minutes early she sat tensely lifeless dull brown hair a shapeless dingy sweater baggy faded jeans with patches on the knees and frays around the cuffs her eyes were haunted and wild deep and dark i climbed the last few steps and stopped before her do you want an early conference instead of answering she nodded bleakly youre concerned about a grade i gave you this time though in pain she shook her head from side to side confused i fumbled with my key and opened the office stepping in the room was small and narrow a desk two chairs a wall of bookshelves and a window as i sat behind the desk i watched her slowly come inside she glanced around uncertainly distraught she shut the door that made me nervous when a female student shuts the door i start to worry that a colleague or a student might walk up the stairs and hear a female voice and wonder whats so private that i want to keep the door closed although i should have told her to reopen it her frantic eyes aroused such pity in me that i sacrificed my principle deciding her torment was so personal that she could talk about it only in strict secrecy sit down i smiled and tried to make her feel at ease although i myself was not at ease what seems to be the difficulty miss im sorry but i dont recall your name samantha perry i dont like samantha though she fidgeted ive shortened it to yes to what to sam im in your ninethirty tuesdaythursday class she bit her lip you spoke to me i frowned not understanding you mean what i taught seemed vivid to you mr ingram no i mean you spoke to me you stared at me while you were teaching you ignored the other students you directed what you said to me when you talked about hemingway how frederic henry wants to go to bed with catherine she swallowed you were asking me to go to bed with you i gaped to disguise my shock i quickly lit a cigarette youre mistaken but i heard you you kept staring straight at me i felt all the other students knew what you were doing i was only lecturing i often look at students faces to make sure they pay attention you received the wrong impression you werent asking me to go to bed with you her voice sounded anguished no i dont trade sex for grades but i dont care about a grade im married happily ive got two children anyway suppose i did intend to proposition you would i do it in the middle of a class id be foolish then you never meant to she kept biting her lip im sorry but you speak to me outside class i hear your voice when im in my room or walking down the street you talk to me when im asleep you say you want to go to bed with me my skin prickled i felt frozen youre mistaken your imaginations playing tricks but i hear your voice so clearly when im studying or how if im not there you send your thoughts you concentrate and put your voice inside my mind adrenaline scalded my stomach i frantically sought an argument to disillusion her telepathy i dont believe in it ive never tried to send my thoughts to you unconsciously i shook my head from side to side i couldnt bring myself to tell her of all the female students in her class she looked so plain even if i wasnt married id never have wanted sex with her youre studying too hard i said you want to do so well youre preoccupied with me thats why you think you hear my voice when im not there i try to make my lectures vivid as a consequence you think im speaking totally to you then you shouldnt teach that way she shouted its not fair its cruel its teasing tears streamed down her face you made a fool of me i didnt mean to but you did you tricked me you misled me no she stood so quickly that i flinched afraid shed lunge at me or scream for help and claim id tried to rape her that damned door i cursed myself for not insisting she leave it open she rushed sobbing toward it she pawed at the knob and stumbled out hysterically retreating down the stairwell shaken i stubbed out my cigarette grabbing another my chest tightened as i heard the dwindling echo of her wracking sobs the awkward scuffle of her dimming footsteps then the low deep rumble of the outside door silence settled over me an hour later i found her waiting in class shed wiped her tears the only signs of what had happened were her red puffy eyes she sat alertly pen to paper i carefully didnt face her as i spoke she seldom glanced up from her notes after class i asked my graduate assistant if he knew her you mean sam sure i know her shes been getting ds she had a conference with me instead of asking how to get a better grade though all she did was talk about you pumping me for information shes got quite a thing for you too bad about her why well shes so plain she doesnt have many friends i doubt she goes out much theres a problem with her father she was vague about it but i had the sense her three sisters are so beautiful that daddy treats her as the ugly duckling she wants very much to please him he ignores her though hes practically disowned her you remind her of him who of her father she admits youre ten years younger than him but she says you look exactly like him i felt heartsick two days later i found her waiting for me again at eight am outside my office tense i unlocked the door as if she heard my thought she didnt shut it this time sitting before my desk she didnt fidget she just stared at me it happened again she said in class i didnt even look at you no afterward when i went to the library she drew an anguished breath and later i ate supper in the dorm i heard your voice so clearly i was sure you were in the cafeteria what time was that fivethirty i was having cocktails with the dean believe me sam i wasnt sending messages to you i didnt even think of you i couldnt have imagined it you wanted me to go to bed with you i wanted research money from the dean i thought of nothing else my mind was totally involved in trying to convince him when i didnt get the money i was too annoyed to concentrate on anything else but getting drunk your voice it isnt real if i sent thoughts to you wouldnt i admit what i was doing when you asked me wouldnt i confirm the message why would i deny it im afraid youre troubled by your father what my graduate assistant says you identify me with your father she went ashen thats supposed to be a secret sam i asked him he wont lie to me if you remind me of my father if i want to go to bed with you then i must want to go to bed with sam my father you must think im disgusting no i think youre confused you ought to find some help you ought to see a but she never let me finish weeping again ashamed hysterical she bolted from the room and thats the last i ever saw of her an hour later when i started lecturing she wasnt in class a few days later i received a dropslip from the registrar informing me shed canceled all her classes i forgot her summer came then fall arrived november on a rainy tuesday night my wife and i stayed up to watch the close results of the national election worried for our presidential candidate at am the phone rang no one calls that late unless the jangle of the phone made me bang my head as i reached for a beer in the fridge i rubbed my throbbing skull and swung in alarm as jean my wife came from the living room and squinted toward the kitchen phone it might be just a friend i said election gossip but i worried about our parents maybe one of them was sick or i watched uneasily as jean picked up the phone hello she listened apprehensively frowning she put her hand across the mouthpiece its for you a woman what shes young she asked for mr ingram damn a student at three am i almost didnt think to shut the fridge annoyed i yanked the poptab off the can of beer my marriage is successful ill admit weve had our troubles so has every couple but weve faced those troubles and were happy jean is thirtyfive attractive smart and patient but her trust in me was clearly tested at that moment a woman had to know me awfully well to call at am lets find out i grabbed the phone to prove my innocence to jean i roughly said yeah what i heard you the female voice was frail and plaintive trembling who is this i asked angrily its me i heard a lowpitched crackle on the line who the hell is me just tell me what your name is sam my knees went weak i slumped against the wall jean stared whats wrong her eyes narrowed with suspicion sam its three am whats so damned important that you cant wait to call me during office hours three it cant be no its one its three for gods sake sam i know what time it is please dont get angry on my radio the news announcer said it was one oclock where are you sam at berkeley california sam the time zone difference in the midwest its two hours later here its three oclock i guess i forgot but thats absurd have you been drinking are you drunk no not exactly what the hell does that mean well i took some pills im not sure what they were oh jesus then i heard you you were speaking to me no i told you your minds playing tricks the voice isnt real youre imagining you called to me you said you wanted me to go to bed with you you wanted me to come to you to iowa no youve got to understand dont do it im not sending thoughts to you youre lying tell me why youre lying i dont want to go to bed with you im glad youre in berkeley stay there get some help lord dont you realize those pills they make you hear my voice they make you hallucinate i trust me sam believe me im not sending thoughts to you i didnt even know youd gone to berkeley youre two thousand miles away from me what youre suggesting is impossible she didnt answer all i heard was lowpitched static sam the dial tone abruptly droned my stomach sank appalled i kept the phone against my ear i swallowed dryly shaking as i set the phone back on its cradle jean glared who was that she wasnt any sam she wants to go to bed with you at three am what games have you been playing none i gulped my beer but my throat stayed dry youd better sit down ill get a beer for you jean clutched her stomach its not what you think i promise im not screwing anybody but its bad im scared i handed jean a beer i dont know why it happened but last spring at eight am i went to school and jean listened troubled afterward she asked for sams description somewhat mollified to learn that she was plain and pitiful the truth jean asked i promise you jean studied me you did nothing to encourage her i guarantee it i wasnt aware of her until i found her waiting for me but unconsciously sam asked me that as well i was only lecturing the best way i know how jean kept her eyes on me she nodded glancing toward her beer then shes disturbed theres nothing you can do for her im glad she moved to berkeley in your place id have been afraid i am afraid she spooks me at a dinner party the next saturday i told our host and hostess what had happened motivated more than just by the need to share my fear with someone else for while the host was both a friend and colleague he was married to a clinical psychologist i needed professional advice diane the hostess listened with slim interest until halfway through my story when she suddenly sat straight and peered at me i faltered whats the matter dont stop what else i frowned and finished waiting for dianes reaction instead she poured more wine she offered more lasagna something bothered you she tucked her long black hair behind her ears it could be nothing i need to know diane nodded grimly i cant make a diagnosis merely on the basis of your story id be irresponsible but hypothetically and only hypothetically she hears your voice thats symptomatic of a severe disturbance paranoia for example schizophrenia the man who shot john lennon heard a voice and so did manson so did son of sam my god jean said her name sam jean set her fork down loudly the parallel occurred to me diane said chuck if she identifies you with her father she might be dangerous to jean and to the children why jealousy to hurt the equivalent of her mother and her rival sisters i felt sick the wine turned sour in my stomach theres another possibility no more encouraging if you continue to reject her she could be dangerous to you instead of dealing with her father she might redirect her rage and jealousy toward you by killing you shed be venting her frustration toward her father i felt panicked for the good news understand im speaking hypothetically possibly shes lying to you and she doesnt hear your voice or as you guessed the drugs she takes might make her hallucinate there could be many explanations without seeing her without the proper tests i wouldnt dare to judge her symptoms youre a friend so im compromising possibly shes homicidal tell me what to do for openers id stay away from her im trying she called from california shes threatening to come back here to see me talk her out of it im no psychologist i dont know what to say to her suggest she get professional advice i tried that try again but if you find her at your office dont go in the room with her find other people crowds protect you but at eight am theres no one in the building think of some excuse to leave her jean if she comes to the house dont let her in jean paled ive never seen her how could i identify her chuck described her dont take chances dont trust anyone who might resemble her and keep a close watch on the children how rebeccas twelve sues nine i cant insist they stay around the house diane turned her wine glass saying nothing oh dear lord jean said the next few weeks were hellish every time the phone rang jean and i jerked startled staring at it but the calls were from our friends or from our childrens friends or from some insulationmagazinehomesiding salesman every day i mustered courage as i climbed the stairwell to my office silent prayers were answered sam was never there my tension dissipated i began to feel she no longer was obsessed with me thanksgiving came the last day of peace ive known we went to church our parents live too far away for us to share the feast with them but we invited friends to dinner we watched football i helped jean make the dressing for the turkey i made both the pumpkin pies the friends wed invited were my colleague and his wife the clinical psychologist she asked if my student had continued to harass me shaking my head from side to side i grinned and raised my glass in special thanks the guests stayed late to watch a movie with us jean and i felt pleasantly exhausted mellowed by good food good drink good friends when after midnight we washed all the dishes went to bed made love and drifted wearily to sleep the phone rang shocking me awake i fumbled toward the bedside lamp jeans eyes went wide with fright she clutched my arm and pointed toward the clock it was three am the phone kept ringing dont jean said suppose its someone else you know it isnt if its sam and i dont answer she might come to the house instead of phoning for gods sake make her stop i grabbed the phone but my throat wouldnt work im coming to you the voice wailed sam i heard you i wont disappoint you ill be there soon no wait listen ive been listening i hear you all the time the anguish in your voice youre begging me to come to you to hold you to make love to you that isnt true you say your wifes jealous of me ill convince her she isnt being fair ill make her let you go then well be happy sam where are you still in berkeley yes i spent thanksgiving by myself my father didnt want me to come home you have to stay there sam i didnt send my voice you need advice you need to see a doctor will you do that for me as a favor i already did but dr campbell doesnt understand he thinks im imagining what i hear he humors me he doesnt realize how much you love me sam you have to talk to him again you have to tell him what you plan to do i cant wait any longer ill be there soon ill be with you my heart pounded frantically i heard a roar in my head i flinched as the phone was yanked away from me jean shouted to the mouthpiece stay away from us dont call again stop terrorizing jean stared wildly at me no ones there the line went dead i hear just the dial tone im writing this as quickly as i can i dont have much more time its almost three oclock that night we didnt try to go back to sleep we couldnt we got dressed and went downstairs where drinking coffee we decided what to do at eight as soon as we got the kids dressed and into the car we drove to the police they listened sympathetically but there was no way they could help us after all sam hadnt broken any law her calls werent obscene it was difficult to prove harassment shed made no overt threats unless she harmed us there was nothing the police could do protect us i insisted how the sergeant asked assign an officer to guard the house for how long a day a week a month that woman might not even bother you again were overworked and understaffed im sorry i cant spare an officer whose only duty is to watch you i can send a car to check the house from time to time no more than that but if this woman does show up and bother you then call us well take care of her but that might be too late back at home we made the children stay inside sam couldnt have arrived from california yet but what else could we do i dont own any guns if all of us stayed together we had some chance for protection that was friday i slept lightly three am the phone rang it was sam of course im coming sam where are you reno youre not flying no i cant turn back sam go to berkeley see that doctor i cant wait to see you please the dial tone was droning the first thing in the morning i phoned berkeley information sam had mentioned dr campbell but the operator couldnt find him in the yellow pages try the university i blurted student counseling i was right a dr campbell was a university psychiatrist on saturday i couldnt reach him at his office but a woman answered at his home he wouldnt be available until the afternoon at four oclock i finally got through to him you have a patient named samantha perry i began i did not anymore i know shes left for iowa she wants to see me im afraid i think she might be dangerous well you dont have to worry shes not dangerous potentially she was but tell me what to do when she arrives youre treating her youll know what i should do no mr ingram she wont come to see you on thanksgiving night at one am she killed herself an overdose of drugs my vision failed i clutched the kitchen table to prevent myself from falling thats impossible i saw the body i identified it but she phoned that night what time at three am midwestern time or one oclock in california no doubt after or before she took the drugs she didnt leave a note but she phoned you she gave no indication she mentioned you quite often she was morbidly attracted to you she had an extreme unhealthy certainty that she was telepathic that you put her voice inside her mind i know that was she paranoid or homicidal mr ingram ive already said too much although shes dead i cant violate her confidence but i dont think shes dead i beg your pardon if she died on thursday night then tell me how she phoned again on friday night the line hummed i sensed the doctors hesitation mr ingram youre upset you dont know what youre saying youve confused the nights im telling you she called again on friday and im telling you she died on thursday either someones tricking you or else the doctor swallowed with discomfort or i trembled im the one whos hearing voices mr ingram dont upset yourself youre honestly confused i slowly put the phone down terrified im sure i heard her voice that night sam called again at three am from salt lake city when i handed jean the phone all she heard was the dial tone but you know the goddamn phone rang i insisted maybe a short circuit chuck im telling you there was no one on the line then sunday three am cheyenne wyoming coming closer but she couldnt be if she was dead the student newspaper at the university subscribes to all the other major student newspapers monday jean and i took the children with us and drove to its office fridays copy of the berkeley campus newspaper had arrived in desperation i searched its pages there a twoinch item sudden student death samantha perry tactfully no cause was given outside in the parking lot jean said now do you believe shes dead then tell me why i hear her voice ive got to be crazy if i think i hear a corpse youre feeling guilty that she killed herself because of you you shouldnt there was nothing you could do to stop her youve been losing too much sleep your imaginations taking over you admit you heard the phone ring yes its true i cant explain that if the phones broken well have it fixed to put your mind at rest well get a new unlisted number i felt better after several drinks i even got some sleep but monday night again the phone rang three am i jerked awake cringing i insisted that jean answer it but she heard just the dial tone i grabbed the phone of course i heard sams voice im almost there ill hurry im in omaha this number isnt listed but you told me the new one your wifes the one who changed it shes trying to keep us apart ill make her sorry darling i cant wait to be with you i screamed jean jerked away from me sam youve got to stop i shouted into the phone i spoke to dr campbell no he wouldnt dare he wouldnt violate my trust he told me you were dead i couldnt live without you soon well be together my shrieks woke the children i was so hysterical that jean had to call for an ambulance two attendants struggled to sedate me omaha was one days drive from where we live jean came to visit me in the hospital on tuesday are you feeling better she frowned at the restraints that held me down please you have to humor me i said all right suspect ive gone crazy but for gods sake humor me i cant prove what im thinking but i know youre in danger i am too you have to get the children and leave town you have to hide somewhere tonight at three am shell reach the house jean studied me with pity promise me i said jean saw the anguish on my face and nodded maybe she wont try the house i said she seems to know everything she might know im in the hospital she might come here i have to get away im not sure how but later when youre gone ill find a way to get out of these restraints jean peered at me distressed her voice sounded totally discouraged chuck ill check the house if youre still there youll make me more upset i promise ill take susan and rebecca well drive somewhere i love you jean began to cry i wont know where you are if i survive this ill get word to you but how the english department ill leave a message with the secretary jean leaned down to kiss me crying certain id lost my mind i reached the house shortly after dark as jean had promised shed left with the children i got in my sports car and raced to the interstate a chicago hotel where at three am sam phoned from iowa city shed heard my voice she said id told her where i was she was hurt and angry tell me why youre running i fled from chicago in the middle of the night driving until i absolutely had to rest i checked in here at one am in johnstown pennsylvania i cant sleep ive got an awful feeling last night sam repeated soon youll join me in the desk i found this stationery god its three am i pray that ill see the sun come up its almost four she didnt phone i cant believe i escaped i keep staring at the phone its four dear christ i hear the ringing finally ive realized sam killed herself at one in iowa the time zone difference made it three but im in pennsylvania in the east a different time zone one oclock in california would be four oclock not three in pennsylvania now the ringing persists but ive realized something else this hotels unusual designed to seem like a home the ringing god help me it isnt the phone its the doorbell as i mentioned in my note for but at my back i always hear there is something about the flat wide open spaces of the midwest that can cause fright as much as awe when i lived in pennsylvania i thought i knew how bad a thunderstorm could be but no weather there prepared me for the terror of an iowa thunderstorm as a character in this story points out some iowa storms can be seven miles high when the weather forecasters announce a thunderstorm warning you pay attention green skies eightymileanhour winds look out one summer lightning struck my house three times in the middle of the night while i lay in bed awake feeling thunder shake the windows i decided to write a story about it the storm was included in the years best fantasy stories for the storm gail saw it first she came from the howard johnsons toward the heat haze in the parking lot where our son jeff and i were hefting luggage into our station wagon actually jeff supervised he gave me his excited tenyearold advice about the best place for this suitcase and that knapsack grinning at his sunbleached hair and nutbrown freckled face i told him i could never have done the job without him it was eight am tuesday august second but even that early the thermometer outside our motel unit had risen to eightyfive the humidity was thick and smothering just from my slight exertion with the luggage id sweated through my shirt and jeans wishing id thought to put on shorts to the east the sun blazed white and swollen the sky an oppressive chalky blue this would be one day when the station wagons air conditioning wouldnt be just a comfort but a necessity my hands were sweatslick as i shut the hatch jeff nodded satisfied with my work then grinned beyond me turning i saw gail coming toward us when she left the brown parched grass her brow creased as her sandals touched the heatsoftened asphalt parking lot all set she asked her smooth white shorts and cool blue top emphasized her tan she looked trim and lithe and wonderful im not sure how she did it but she seemed completely unaffected by the heat her hair was soft and golden her subtle trace of makeup made the day seem somehow cooler ready thanks to jeff i told her jeff grinned up proudly well i paid the bill i gave them back the key gail said lets go she paused except whats wrong those clouds she pointed past my shoulder i turned and frowned in contrast to the blinding eastern sky thick black clouds seethed on the western horizon they roiled and churned in the distance lightning flickered like a string of flashbulbs thunder rumbling hollowly now where the hell did that come from i said it wasnt there before i packed the car gail squinted toward the thunderheads you think we should wait till it passes it isnt close i shrugged but its coming fast gail bit her lip and it looks bad jeff grabbed my hand i glanced at his worried face its just a storm son jeff surprised me though id misjudged what worried him i want to go back home he said i dont want to wait i miss my friends please cant we leave i nodded im on your side two votes out of three gail if youre really scared though no i gail drew a breath and shook her head im being silly its just the thunder you know how storms bother me she ruffled jeffs hair but i wont make us wait im homesick too wed spent the past two weeks in colorado fishing camping touring ghost towns the vacation had been perfect but as eagerly as wed gone we were just as eager to be heading back last night wed stopped here in north platte a small quiet town off interstate halfway through nebraska now today we hoped we could reach home in iowa city by nightfall lets get moving then i said its probably a local storm well drive ahead of it well never see a drop of rain gail tried to smile i hope jeff hummed as we got in the station wagon i steered toward the interstate went up the eastbound ramp and set the cruise control for the speed limit of fiftyfive ahead the morning sun glared through the windshield after i tugged down the visors i turned on the air conditioner then the radio the local weatherman said hot and hazy hear that i said he didnt mention a storm no need to worry those are only heat clouds i was wrong from time to time i checked the rearview mirror and the clouds loomed thicker blacker closer seething toward us down the interstate ahead the sun kept blazing fiercely jeff wiped his sweaty face i set the air conditioner for desert but it didnt seem to help jeff reach in the ice chest grab us each a coke he grinned but i suddenly felt uneasy realizing too late that hed have to turn to open the chest in the rear compartment gosh he murmured staring back awestruck whats the matter gail swung around before i could stop her oh my god the clouds they were angry midnight chasing us lightning flashed thunder jolted they still havent reached us i said if you want ill try outrunning them do something i switched off the cruise control and sped to sixty then sixtyfive the strain of squinting toward the whitehot sky ahead of us gave me a piercing headache i put on my sunglasses but all at once i didnt need them abruptly the clouds caught up to us the sky went totally black we drove in roiling darkness seventy im doing seventy i said but the clouds are moving faster almost a hurricane gail said that isnt possible not in nebraska im scared jeff said he wasnt the only one lightning blinded me stabbing to the right and left of us thunder shook the car then the air became an eerie dirty shade of green and i started thinking about tornadoes find a place to stop gail shouted but there wasnt one wed already passed the exit for the next town kearny i searched for a roadside park but a sign said rest stop thirty miles i couldnt just pull off the highway on the shoulder if the rain obscured another drivers vision we could all be hit and killed no choice i had to keep driving at least it isnt raining i said the clouds unloaded no preliminary sprinkle massive raindrops burst around us gusting roaring pelting i cant see i flicked the windshield wipers to their highest setting they flapped in sharp staccato triple time i peered through murky undulating wind swept waves of water struggling for a clear view of the highway i was going too fast when i braked the station wagon fishtailed we skidded on the slippery pavement i couldnt breathe the tires gripped i felt the jolt then the car was in control i slowed to forty but the rain heaved with such force against the windshield i still couldnt see pull your seatbelts tight although i never found that rest stop i got lucky when a flash of lightning showed a sign the exit for a town called grand island shaking from tension i eased down the off ramp at the bottom across from me a best western motel was shrouded with rain we left a wake through the flooded parking lot and stopped under the motels canopy my hands were stiff from clenching the steering wheel my shoulders ached my eyes felt swollen raw gail and jeff got out rain gusting under the canopy as they ran inside i had to move the car to park it in the lot i locked the doors but although i sprinted i was drenched and chilled when i reached the motels entrance inside a small group stared past me toward the storm two clerks two waitresses a cleaning lady i trembled mister use this towel the cleaning lady said she took one from a pile on her cart i thanked her wiping my dripping face and soggy hair see any accidents a waitress asked with the towel around my neck i shook my head no a storm this sudden there ought to be accidents the waitress said as if doubting me i frowned when she said sudden you mean its just starting here a skinny clerk stepped past me to the window not too long before you came a minute maybe i looked out this window and the sky was bright i knelt to tie my shoe when i stood up the clouds were here as black as night i dont know where they came from all of a sudden but i never saw it rain so hard so fast but i shivered puzzled the storm hit us back near kearny weve been driving in it for an hour you were on the edge of it i guess the clerk said spellbound by the devastation outside it followed you my cold wet shirt clung to me but i felt a deeper chill looks like weve got other customers the second clerk said pointing out the window other cars splashed through the torrent in the parking lot yeah well be busy thats for sure the clerk said he switched on the lights but they didnt dispel the outside gloom the wind howled i glanced around the lobby suddenly noticing that gail and jeff werent in sight my wife and son theyre in the restaurant the second waitress said smiling to reassure me through that arch they ordered coffee for you hot and strong i need it thanks dripping travelers stumbled in we waited an hour although the coffee was as hot as promised it didnt warm me in the air conditioning my soggy clothes stuck to the chilly chromeandplastic seat a bonedeep freezing numbness made me sneeze you need dry clothes gail said youll catch pneumonia id hoped the storm would stop before i went out for the clothes but even in the restaurant i felt the thunder rumble i couldnt wait my muscles cramped from shivering ill get a suitcase i stood dad be careful jeff looked worried smiling i leaned down and kissed him son i promise near the restaurants exit one of the waitresses id talked to came over you want to hear a joke i didnt but i nodded politely on the radio she said the local weatherman he claims its hot and clear i shook my head confused the storm she laughed he doesnt know its raining all his instruments his radar and his charts he hasnt brains enough to look outside and see what kind of day it is if anything the rain got worse she laughed again the biggest joke that dummys my husband i laughed to be agreeable and went to the lobby it was crowded more raindrenched travelers pushed in cursing the weather they tugged at dripping clothes and bunched before the motels counter wanting rooms i squeezed past them stopping at the big glass door squinting out at the wildest rain id ever seen above the exclamations of the crowd i heard the shriek of the wind my hand reached for the door it hesitated i really didnt want to go out the skinny desk clerk suddenly stood next to me it could be youre not interested he said i frowned surprised were renting rooms so fast well soon be all full up he said but fair is fair you got here first i saved a room in case you plan on staying i appreciate it but were leaving soon youd better take another look i did lightning split a tree the window shook from thunder a steaming bath i thought a sizzling steak warm blankets while my clothes get dry i changed my mind well take that room all night thunder shook the building even with the drapes shut i saw brilliant streaks of lightning i slept fitfully waking with a headache six am it was still raining on the radio the weatherman sounded puzzled as the lightnings static garbled what he said i learned that grand island was suffering the worst storm in its history streets were flooded sewers blocked basements overflowing an emergency had been declared the damage in the millions but the cause of the storm seemed inexplicable the weather pattern made no sense the front was tiny localized and stationary half a mile outside grand island north and south east and west the sky was cloudless that last statement was all i needed to know we quickly dressed and went downstairs to eat we checked out shortly after seven driving in this rain the desk clerk shook his head he had the tact not to tell me i was crazy listen to the radio i answered half a mile away the sky is clear id have stayed if it hadnt been for gail her fear of storms the constant lightning and thunder made her frantic get me out of here and so we went and almost didnt reach the interstate the car was hubcapdeep in water the distributor was damp i nearly killed the battery before i got the engine started the brakes were soaked they failed as i reached the local road skidding blinded i swerved around the blur of an abandoned truck missing the entrance to the interstate backing up i barely saw a ditch in time but finally we headed up the ramp rising above the flood doing twenty down the highway jeff was whitefaced id bought some comics for him but he was too scared to read them the odometer i told him watch the numbers half a mile and well be out of this i counted tenths of a mile with him one two three the storm grew darker stronger four five six the numbers felt like broken glass wedged in my throat but dad were half a mile away the rains not stopping just a little farther but instead of ending it got worse we had to stop in lincoln the next day the storm persisted we pressed on to omaha we could normally drive from colorado to our home in iowa city in two leisurely days but this trip took us seven long slow agonizing days we had to stop in omaha and then des moines and towns whose names id never heard of when we at last reached home we felt so exhausted so frightened we left our bags in the car and stumbled from the garage to bed the rain slashed against the windows it drummed on the roof i couldnt sleep when i peered out i saw a waterfall from the overflowing eaves lightning struck an electricity pole i settled to my knees and recollected every prayer id ever learned and then invented stronger ones the electricity was fixed by morning the phone still worked gail called a friend and asked a question as she listened to the answer i was startled by the way her face shrank and her eyes receded mumbling thanks she set the phone down its been dry here she said then last night at eight the storm began but thats when we arrived my god whats happening coincidence gail frowned the storm front moved in our direction we kept trying to escape instead we only followed it the fridge was bare i told gail id get some food and warned jeff not to go outside but dad i want to see my friends watch television dont go out till the rain stops it wont end i froze what makes you say that not today it wont the skys too dark the rains too hard i nodded relaxing then call your friends but dont go out when i opened the garage door i watched the torrent eight days since id seen the sun damp clung on me gusts angled toward me i drove from the garage and was swallowed gail looked overjoyed when i came back it stopped for forty minutes she grinned with relief not where i was the nearest supermarket was half a mile away despite my umbrella and raincoat id been drenched when i lurched through the hissing automatic door of the supermarket fighting to catch my breath id fumbled with the insideout umbrella and muttered to a clerk about the goddamn endless rain the clerk hadnt known what i meant but it started just a minute ago id shuddered but not from the water dripping off me gail heard me out and paled her joy turned into frightened disbelief as soon as you came back the storm began again i flinched as the bottom fell out of my soggy grocery bag ignoring the cans and boxes of food on the floor i hurried to find a weather station on the radio but the announcers staticgarbled voice sounded as bewildered as his counterparts throughout nebraska his report was the same the weather pattern made no sense the front was tiny localized and stationary half a mile away the sky was cloudless in a small circumference however iowa city was enduring its most savage storm on record downtown streets were i shut off the radio thinking frantically i told gail i was going to my office at the university to see if i had mail but my motive was quite different and i hoped she wouldnt think of it she started to speak as jeff came into the kitchen interrupting us his eyes bleak with cabin fever drive me down to freddies dad i didnt have the heart to tell him no at the school the parking lot was flecked with rain but there werent any puddles i live a mile away i went in the english building and asked a secretary although i knew what shed tell me no mr price all morning its been clear the rains just beginning in my office i phoned home the rain stopped gail said you wont believe how beautiful the sky is bright and sunny i stared from my office window toward a storm so black and ugly i barely saw the whitecaps on the angry churning river fear coiled in my guts the pattern was always the same no matter where i went the storm went with me when i left the storm left as well it got worse nine days of it then ten eleven twelve our basement flooded as did all the other basements in the district streets eroded there were mudslides shingles blew away attics leaked retaining walls fell over lightning struck the electricity poles so often the food spoiled in our freezer we lit candles if our stove hadnt used gas we couldnt have cooked as in grand island an emergency was declared the damage so great it couldnt be calculated what hurt the most was seeing the effect on gail and jeff the constant chilly dampness gave them colds i sneezed and sniffled too but didnt care about myself because gails spirits sank the more it rained her eyes became a dismal gray she had no energy she put on sweaters and rubbed her listless aching arms jeff went to bed much earlier than usual he slept later he looked thin his eyes had dark circles and he had nightmares as lightning cracked his screams woke us again the electricity wasnt working we used flashlights as we hurried to his room wake up jeff youre only dreaming the indian moaning he rubbed his frightened eyes thunder rumbled making gail jerk what indian i said he warned you son i dont know what in colorado gail turned sharply startling me with the hollows the darkness cast on her cheeks the weather dancer you mean that witch doctor on our trip wed stopped in a dingy desert town for gas and seen a meager group of tourists studying a roadside indian display a shack rickety tables beads and drums and belts skeptical id walked across a scruffy indian who looked to be at least a hundred dressed in threadbare faded vestments had chanted gibberish while he danced around a circle of rocks in the dust whats going on i asked a woman aiming a camera hes a medicine man hes dancing to make it rain and end the drought i scuffed the dust and glanced at the burning sky my head ached from the heat and the long oppressive drive id seen too many sleazy roadside stands too many indians ripping off tourists selling overpriced inauthentic artifacts imperfect turquoise shoddy silver theyd turned their back on their heritage and prostituted their traditions i didnt care how much they hated us for what wed done to them what bothered me was that behind their stoical faces they laughed as they duped us whiskey fumes wafted from the ancient indian as he clumsily danced around the circle chanting can he do it jeff asked can he make it rain its a gimmick i said watch these tourists put money in that socalled native bowl he bought at sears the tourists heard me their rapt faces suddenly suspicious the old man stopped performing gimmick he glared i didnt mean to speak so loud im sorry if i ruined your routine i made that bowl myself of course you did he lurched across the whiskey fumes stronger you dont think my dance can make it rain i couldnt care less if you fool these tourists but my son should know the truth you want convincing i said i was sorry white men always say theyre sorry gail came over glancing furtively around embarrassed she tugged at my sleeve the gas tanks full lets go i backed away youll see it rain youll pray it stops the old man shouted jeff looked terrified and that made me angry shut your mouth you scared my son he wonders if i can make it rain watch the sky i dance for you now when the lightning strikes remember me we got in the car that crazy coot dont let him bother you the sun cooked his brain all right he threatened me so what i asked gail you surely cant believe he sent this storm by dancing think it isnt possible then tell me why its happening a hundred weather experts tried but cant explain it how can i the storms linked to you it never leaves you its i meant to say coincidence again but the word had lost its meaning and died in my throat i studied gail and jeff and in the glare of the flashlights i realized they blamed me we were adversaries both of them against me the rain dad cant you make it stop i cried when he whispered please department of meteorology it consisted of a full professor one associate and one assistant id met the full professor at a cocktail party several years ago we sometimes played tennis together on occasion we had lunch i knew his office hours and braved the storm to go see him again the parking lot was speckled with increasing raindrops when i got there i ran through raging wind and shook my raincoat in the lobby of his building id phoned ahead he was waiting fortyfive freckled almost bald in damn fine shape though as i knew from many tennis games id lost the rains back he shook his head disgustedly no explanation yet im supposed to be the expert your guess would be as good as mine if this keeps up ill take to reading tea leaves maybe superstitions i wanted to say the answer but i couldnt force myself what he leaned ahead i rubbed my aching forehead what causes thunderstorms he shrugged two different fronts collide ones hot and moist the others cold and dry they bang together so hard they explode the lightning and thunder are the blast the rains the fallout but in this case thats the problem we dont have two different fronts even if we did the storm would move because of vacuums the winds create but this storm stays right here it only shifts a half a mile or so and then comes back its forcing us to reassess the rules i dont know how to say this but somehow i told him everything he frowned and you believe this im not sure my wife and son do is it possible he put some papers away he poured two cups of coffee he did everything but rearrange his bookshelves is it possible i said if you repeat this ill deny it how much crazier can in the sixties when i was in grad school i went on a field trip to mexico the mountain valleys have such complicated weather patterns theyre perfect for a dissertation one place gets so much rain the villages are flooded ten miles away another valley gets no rain whatsoever in one valley i studied something had gone wrong it normally had lots of rain for seven years though it had been completely dry the valley next to it normally dry was getting all the rain no explanation god knows i worked hard to find one people were forced to leave their homes and go where the rain was in this seventh summer they stopped hoping the weather would behave the way it used to they wanted to return to their valley so they sent for special help a weather dancer he claimed to be a descendent of the mayans he arrived one day and paced the valley praying to all the compass points where they intersected in the valleys middle he arranged a wheel of stones he put on vestments he danced around the wheel one day later it was raining and the weather pattern went back to the way it used to be i told myself hed been lucky that hed somehow read the signs of nature and danced when he was positive it would rain but i saw those clouds rush in and they were strange they didnt move on until the streams were flowing and the wells were full coincidence special knowledge who can say but it troubles me when i think about what happened in that valley then the indian i met could cause this storm who knows look im a scientist i trust in facts but sometimes superstitions a word we use for science we dont understand what happens if the storm continues if it doesnt stop whoever lives beneath it will have to move or else theyll die but what if it follows someone you really believe it would it does he studied me you ever hear of a superstorm dismayed i shook my head on rare occasions several storms will climb on top of each other they can tower as high as seven miles i felt my heart lurch but this storms already climbed that high its heading up to ten miles now itll soon tear houses from foundations itll level everything a stationary halfmilewide tornado if im right though if the old man wants to punish me i cant escape unless my wife and son are separate from me theyll die too assuming youre right but i have to emphasize theres no scientific reason to believe your theory i think im crazy eliminate the probable then the possible whats left must be the explanation either gail and jeff would die or theyd have to leave me but i couldnt bear losing them i knew what i had to do i struggled through the storm to get back home jeff was feverish gail kept coughing glaring at me in accusation they argued when i told them but in desperation they agreed if what we think is true i said once im gone the stormll stop youll see the sun again but what about you whatll happen pray for me the interstate again heading west the storm of course went with me iowa nebraska it took me three insane disastrous weeks to get to colorado driving through rainswept mountains was a nightmare but i finally reached that dingy desert town i found that sleazy roadside stand no trinkets no beads as the storm raged turning dust to mud i searched the town begging for information that old indian the weather dancer he took sick a store owner said where is he how should i know try the reservation it was fifteen miles away the road was serpentine narrow and mucky i passed rocks so hot they steamed from rain the car slid crashing into a ditch resting on its driveshaft i ran through lightning and thunder drenched and moaning when i stumbled to the largest building on the reservation it was low and wide made from stone i pounded on the door a man in a uniform opened it the agent for the government i told him he frowned with suspicion turning he spoke a different language to some indians in the office they answered he nodded you must want him bad he said if you came out here in this storm youre almost out of time the old mans dying in the reservations hospital the old man lay motionless under sheets an iv in his arm shriveled he looked like a dry empty corn husk he slowly opened his eyes they gleamed with recognition i believe you now i said please make the rain stop he breathed in pain my wife and son believe it isnt fair to make them suffer please my voice rose i shouldnt have said what i did im sorry make it stop the old man squirmed i sank to my knees kissed his hand and sobbed i know i dont deserve it but im begging you ive learned my lesson stop the rain the old man studied me and slowly nodded the doctor tried to restrain him but the old mans strength was extraordinary he crawled from bed he hobbled slowly in evident pain he chanted and danced the lightning and thunder worsened rain slashed the windows the old man strained to dance harder the frenzy of the storm increased its strident fury soared it reached a crescendo hung there and stopped the old man fell gasping i ran to him and helped the doctor lift him into bed the doctor scowled you almost killed him he isnt dead no thanks to you but that was the word i used thanks to the old man and the powers in the sky i left the hospital the sun a once common sight overwhelmed me four days later back in iowa i got the call the agent from the government he thought id want to know that morning the old man had died i turned to gail and jeff their colds were gone from warm sunny weeks while i was away their skin was brown again they seemed to have forgotten how the nightmare had nearly destroyed us more than just our lives our love indeed they were now skeptical about the indian and told me that the rain would have stopped no matter what i did but they hadnt been in the hospital to see him dance they didnt understand i set the phone down and swallowed with sadness stepping from our house it rests on a hill i peered in admiration toward the glorious sky i turned and faltered to the west a massive cloudbank approached dark and thick and roiling wind began bringing a chill september twelfth the temperature was seventyeight it dropped to fifty then thirtytwo the rain had stopped the old man had done what i asked but i hadnt counted on his sense of humor he had stopped the rain all right but i had a terrible feeling that the snow would never end if theres a touch of humor in the storm theres nothing at all humorous in this further story about the midwest a grossout shocker although the story was published in its origin is eleven years earlier in the summer of i spent thirtyfive days on a survival course in the wind river mountains of wyoming the course was conducted by paul petzoldts national outdoor leadership school and trained its students in a variety of mountaineering skills climbing camping without a trace crossing wild streams living in snow caves scavenging etc at the end of the course our food was taken away from us we were each allowed to keep a compass a map and a canteen we were shown a spot on the map fifty miles away over the continental divide and told that three days later a truck would be waiting to pick us up how did we eat we werent supposed to the idea was to replicate an emergency situation scavenging uses more energy than is supplied by the plants that are scavenged so that was out we could have caught and eaten fish which would have given us adequate protein but that would have been as a last measure the idea was to prove to us that we could go three days without food in strenuous conditions and still be functional at the end i was weak and lightheaded when we came over the mountains and reached the dusty trailhead that was our destination but i could have gone a day or two longer and i certainly had acquired confidence about the outdoors the course completed i set out toward iowa along interstate but my old fourcylinder porsche developed engine trouble and in the nebraska panhandle i had to leave the highway hoping to find a mechanic thats when i came to this very unusual very scary town while the story is fictional the setting is not for these and all my sins there was a tree i remember it i swear id be able to recognize it because it looked so unusual it stood on my left in the distance by interstate at first it was just a blur in the shimmering heat haze but as i drove closer its skeletal outline became distinct skeletal thats what struck me at first as being strange after all in august even in the sunparched nebraska panhandle trees the few you see are thick with leaves but this one was bare so its dead i thought so what nothing to frown about but then i noticed the second thing about it and i guess id subconsciously been reacting before i even realized what its silhouette resembled stronger than resembled i felt uneasy the tree was very menorahlike a giant counterpart of the candelabrum used on jewish religious services eight candles in a row except in this case the candles were barren branches standing straight i shrugged off an eerie tingle its just a freak an accident of nature i concluded although i briefly wondered if someone had pruned the tree to give it that distinctive appearance and in the process had unavoidably killed it but coincidence or not the shape struck me as being uncanny a religious symbol formed by a sterile tree ironically blessing a droughtwracked western plain i thought of the waste land for the past two weeks id been camping with friends in the wind river mountains of wyoming fishing exploring rockclimbing mostly sitting around our cook fire drinking reminiscing after our longpostponed reunion our time together had gone too quickly again wed separated heading our different ways across the country back to wives and children jobs and obligations for me that meant iowa city home and the university as much as i wanted to see my family again i dreaded the prospect of still another fall semester preparing classes grading freshmen papers weary from driving eight hours east since a wrenching emotional farewell breakfast i glanced from the weird menorah tree and realized i was doing seventy slow down i told myself youll end up getting a ticket or killed and thats when the engine started shuddering i drive a secondhand porsche the kind with four cylinders from the sixties i bought it cheap because it needed a lot of body work but despite its age it usually works like a charm the trouble is i didnt know the carburetors had to be adjusted for the thinner air of higher altitude so when id reached the mountains in wyoming the engine had sputtered the carburetors had overflowed and id rushed to put out a devastating fire on the engine in lander wyoming a garage had repaired the damage while i went camping with my friends but when id come back to get it the accelerator hadnt seemed as responsive as it used to be all day the motor had sounded a little noisier than usual and now as it shuddered it wasnt just noisy it was thunderous oh christ i thought the fire must have cracked the engine block whatever was wrong i didnt dare go much farther the steering wheel was jerking in my hands scared i slowed to thirty the roar and shudder persisted i needed to find a mechanic fast i said this happened in nebraska s panhandle imagine the state as a wide rectangle cut away the bottom left corner the remaining top left corner thats the panhandle just to the east of wyoming its nothing but broad flat open range scrub grass sagebrush tumbleweed the lands as desolate as when the pioneers struggled across it a hundred years ago a couple more hours into nebraska i wouldnt have worried too much towns start showing up every twenty miles or so but heading through the panhandle i hadnt seen a sign for a town in quite a while despite the false security of the four lane interstate i might as well have been on the moon as a consequence when i saw the off ramp i didnt think twice thanking whatever god had smiled on me i struggled with the spastic tremors of the steering wheel and exited wincing as the engine not only roared but crackled as if bits of metal were breaking off inside and scraping gouging there wasnt a sign for a town at this exit but i knew there had to be a reason for the off ramp reaching a stop sign i glanced right and left along a two lane blacktop but saw no buildings either way so which direction i asked myself on impulse i chose the left and crossed the bridge above the interstate only then realizing i headed toward the menorah tree again i felt that eerie tingle but the shuddering roar of the engine distracted me the accelerator heaved beneath my foot sending spasms up my leg the car could barely do twenty miles an hour now i tried to control my nervous breathing vaguely sensing the tree as i passed it on my left im sure of it i wasnt so preocuppied i wouldnt remember the tree was on the left of the unmarked two lane road im positive i know im not wrong i drove and drove the porsche seemed ready to fall apart at any moment jolting rattling the road stretched ahead leading nowhere seemingly forever with the menorah tree behind me nothing relieved the dismal prairie landscape any time now i thought ill see some buildings just another mile or so if the car can manage that far it did and another mile after that but down to fifteen now my stomach cramped i had the terrible sense i should have gone the other way along this road for all i knew id have reached a town in a minute but now id gone so far in this direction i had to keep going i wasnt sure the car could fight its way back to the interstate when id first seen the menorah tree the clock on my dashboard had shown near five as i glanced at the clock again i winced when i saw near six christ just a few more hours of light and even if i found a garage the chances were it wouldnt stay open after six premonitions squeezed my chest i should have stayed on the interstate i thought there at least if the car broke down i could have flagged down someone going by and asked them to send a tow truck here i hadnt seen any traffic visions of a night spent at the side of the road in my disabled car were dismally matched by the wearying prospect of the long hike back to the interstate id been planning to drive all night in hopes of reaching home in iowa city by noon tomorrow but if my luck kept turning sour i might not get there for at best another day and likely more supposing the engine was as bad as the roar made it seem i had to find a phone and tell my wife not to worry when i didnt reach home at the time id said i would my thoughts became more urgent i had to thats when i saw the building in the distance hard to make out a vague rectangular object but unmistakably a building its metal roof reflecting the glint of the lowering sun then i saw another building and another trees thank god a town my heart pounded almost as hard as the engine rattled i clutched the steering wheel frantically trying to control it lurching past a water tower and an empty cattle pen the buildings became distinct houses a car lot a diner and a service station where i lurched to a rawnerved stop my hands still shaking from the vibrations of the steering wheel i shut off the engine grateful for the sudden quiet and noticed two men at the pump their backs to me selfconscious about my beard stubble and my sweatdrenched clothes i got out wearily to ask directions they had their backs to me that should have told me right away that something was wrong id made such a racket pulling up it wasnt normal for them not to turn curious wondering what the hell was coming but they didnt and i was too exhausted for my instincts to jangle warning me stifflegged i approached them excuse me i said i guess you can tell ive got some trouble is the mechanic still on duty neither turned or answered they must have heard me i thought all the same i repeated louder the mechanic is he still on duty no response for christ sake are they deaf or what so i walked around to face them even as they pivoted to show me their backs again i gaped because id seen a brief glimpse of their faces oh my god i felt as if an ice cold needle had pierced my spine ive never seen a leper all the same from what ive read i imagine a leper might have been less ugly than what i was looking at ugly isnt strong enough to describe what i saw not just the swollen goiter bulging from each throat like an obscene adams apple not just the twisted jaws and cheekbones or the massive lumps on their forehead or the distended lips and misshapen nostrils worse their skin itself seemed rotten gray and mushy like open festering sores i nearly gagged my throat contracted so i couldnt breath get control i told myself whatevers wrong with them its not their fault dont gape like a sixyearold whos never seen someone malformed before obviously thats why they didnt want to look at me because they hated the disgusted reaction the awful sickened stare they faced the door to the service station now and i certainly wasnt about to walk in front of them again so i repeated the mechanic where is he as one they each raised their right arm and pointed horribly twisted fingers toward the right toward a gravel road that led out of town parallel to the interstate miles away well damn it i thought im sorry about whats happened to you i wish there was some way to help you but right now i need help myself and you two guys are rude i stalked away my head beginning to ache my throat feeling raw a quick glance at my watch showed seven oclock the sun of course was lower if i didnt find a mechanic soon across the street on the corner i saw a restaurant perhaps too kind a word greasy spoon would have been more accurate the windows looked grimy the posters for pepsi and schlitz looked ten years old barbcue a dingy neon sign said why not shorten it i thought to bbc which if you change the c to g stands for botulism and bad gas and why not stop with the jokes you might be eating there tonight thats almost funny now eating i mean dear god i dont know how long i can stand this so i walked across the dusty street and opened the flycovered creaky screen door peering in at five customers hey anybody know where the words caught in my throat my mind reeled because the customers had already shifted turning with their backs to me and these had humps and twisted spines and shoulders wrenched in directions nature had never intended in shock i hurriedly glanced at the waitress behind the corner and shed turned her back as well the mirror though the goddamn mirror her face reflecting off it seemed the result of a hideous genetic experiment she had no jaw and only one eye i stumbled back letting the door swing shut with a creak and a bang my mind still retaining the terrible impression of it couldnt be two slits where there should have been a nose ill make this quick everywhere i went growing ever more apprehensive i found monsters the town was like a hundred horror movies squeezed together lon chaneys worst makeup inventions almost seemed normal by comparison the island of dr moreau would have been a resort for beauty contest winners jesus eight oclock the eastern sky was turning gray the western horizon was the red of blood i wondered if id gone insane a town of monsters no one speaking to me everyone turning away most pointing toward the gravel road that headed east out of town appalled i scrambled into the porsche turned the key and the rest hadnt done the car any good if anything the engine roared and shuddered more extremely stomach scalding i prayed although the porsche shook and protested it blessedly managed to move a town i thought maybe theres another town a few miles along that gravel road maybe thats why they pointed down there i rattled and heaved and jolted out of town switching on my emergency flashers although i didnt know why since id seen no traffic all the same with dusk coming on it didnt hurt to be careful a quarter mile then half a mile thats as far as i got before the engine failed completely its probable that only one cylinder was working by then id hear a bang then three silent beats then another bang and three more silent beats with every bang the car crept forward a little then it finally wheezed and coasted to a stop the motor pinged from the heat a porsche doesnt have a radiator but i swear i heard a hiss and that was that stuck in the middle of nowhere a town of horrors behind me an empty landscape ahead of me and an interstate god knew how far away with night approaching on the prairie ive said i was frightened but then i got mad at my luck and the guy in lander whod fixed my car at me and my stupidity for having left the highway not to mention my failure to think ahead when i was back in town i should have bought some soft drinks anyhow some candy bars and potato chips or something anything to keep from starving all night out here in the dark a beer hell considering the way i felt a sixpack might as well get shitfaced angry i stepped from the car i leaned against a fender and lit a cigarette and cursed eightthirty now dusk thickened what was i going to do i try to convince myself i was being logical by nine id made my choice the town was only half a mile away ten minutes walk at most if that stupid barbcue had stayed open i could still get some beer and chips at the moment i didnt care how revolting those people looked id be damned if i was going to spend the night out here with my stomach rumbling thatd be one discomfort too many so i walked and when i reached the outskirts night at last had fallen the lights were on in the barbcue at least my luck hadnt failed entirely or so i thought because the lights quickly went off as i came closer swell i thought in disgust the place stayed dark but then the door creaked open the waitress a vague white shape stepped out she locked the door behind her i almost asked if shed mind waiting so i could buy some food naturally i assumed she hadnt seen me thats why she surprised me when she turned i blinked astonished in contrast with the way the town had treated me she actually spoke her voice was frail and wispy the words slurred suggestive of a cleft palate or a hair lip i saw you she said through the window coming back maybe i imagined it but her whispered cadence sounded musical and this is important too although we faced each other the street had no lights and the darkness had thickened enough that i couldnt see her features for the first time since id arrived in town i felt as if i was having a normal conversation it wasnt hard to pretend as long as i forced myself not to remember the horror of what she looked like i managed a shrug a laugh of despair my car broke down im stuck out there although i knew she couldnt see my gesture i pointed down the pitch dark road i hoped youd still be open so i could get something to eat she didnt answer for a moment then abruptly she said im sorry the owner closed a half hour ago i stayed to clean up and get things ready for tomorrow the grills cold but just some beer potato chips or something cant the cash registers empty but i dont care about change ill pay you more than the stuff is worth again she didnt answer for a moment beer and potato chips please my hopes rose if you wouldnt mind while you spend the night in your car unless theres a hotel there isnt you need a decent meal a proper place to sleep considering the trouble youre in she paused i remember the night was silent not even crickets sang i live alone she said her cadence even more musical you can sleep on the sofa in the living room ill broil a steak for you i couldnt i said the thought of seeing her face again filled me with panic i wont turn the lights on i wont disgust you i lied its just that i dont want to inconvenience you no trouble she sounded emphatic i want to help ive always believed in charity she began to walk away paralyzed i thought about it for sure the steak sounded good and the sofa a hell of a lot better than sleeping hunched in the car but jesus the way she looked and maybe my attitude was painfully familiar to her how would i feel i wondered if i was deformed and people shunned me charity hadnt she said she believed in charity well maybe it was time i believed in it myself i followed her less motivated by the steak and the sofa than by my determination to be kind she lived three blocks away on a street as dark as the one wed left the houses were still no sounds no sign of anyone it was the strangest walk of my life from what i could tell in the dark she lived in an old twostory victorian house the porch floor squeaked as we crossed it to go inside and true to her word she didnt turn on the lights the living rooms through an arch to your left she said the sofas against the wall straight ahead ill fix the steak i thanked her and did what she said the sofa was deep and soft i hadnt realized how tired i was until i leaned back in the dark i heard the sizzle of the steak from somewhere at the back of the house i assume she turned the kitchen lights on to cook it but i didnt see even the edge of a glow then the fragrance of the beef drifted toward me echoing footsteps came near i should have asked how well done you like it most customers ask for medium rare her wispy voice sounded like wind chimes great i no longer cared if she was ugly by then i was ravenous in the dark she cautiously set up a tray brought the steak bread and butter al sauce and a beer although awkward because i couldnt see i ate amazingly fast i couldnt get enough of it delicious couldnt describe it mouthwatering tastebud expanding incredible i sopped up sauce and steak juice with my final remnant of bread stuffed it in my mouth washed it down with my final sip of beer and sagged back knowing id eaten the best meal of my life throughout shed sat in a chair across the room and hadnt spoken once that was wonderful i said i dont know how to thank you you already have i wasnt sure what she meant my belly felt reassuringly packed to the bursting point you havent asked she said i frowned asked what i dont understand you do youre dying to ask i know you are they always are they why the people here are horribly deformed i felt a chill in truth i had been tempted to ask the town was so unusual the people so strange i could barely stifle my curiosity shed been so generous though i didnt want to draw attention to her infirmity and be rude at once her reflection in the mirror at the barbcue popped up terribly in my mind no chin one eye flat slits where there should have been a nose oozing sores i almost vomited and not just from the memory something was happening in my stomach it churned and complained growling swelling larger as if it were crammed with a million tiny darting hornets sins she said i squirmed afraid long ago she said in the middle ages certain priests used to travel from village to village instead of hearing confessions they performed a ceremony to cleanse the souls of the villagers each member of the group brought something to eat and set it on a table in front of the priest at last an enormous meal awaited him he said the necessary words all the sins of the village were transferred into the food i swallowed bile unaccountably terrified and then he ate the meal their sins she said he stuffed himself with sins her tone was so hateful i wanted to scream and run the villagers knew hed damned himself to save their souls for this they gave him money of course there were disbelievers who maintained the priest was nothing more than a cheat a con man tricking the villagers into feeding him and giving him money they were wrong i heard her stand because the evidence was clear the sins had their effect the evil spread through the sineaters body festering twisting bulging to escape i heard her doing something in the corner i tensed from the sound of scratching and not just priests ate sins she said sometimes special women did it too but the problem was suppose the sineater wanted to be redeemed as well how could a sineater get rid of the sins get rid of the ugliness by passing the sins along of course by having them eaten by someone else youre crazy i said im getting out of here no not just yet i realized the scratching sound was a match being struck a tiny flame appeared my stomach soured in pulsing agony a town filled with sineaters she said monsters shunned by the world bearable only to each other suffering out of charity for the millions of souls whove been redeemed she lit a candle the light grew larger in the room i saw her face and gaped again but this time for a different reason she was beautiful stunning gorgeous her skin seemed to glow with sensuality it also seemed to shimmer to ripple to no my god i said you put something in my food i told you not that foolishness i tried to stand but my legs wouldnt respond my body seemed to expand contract and twist my vision became distorted as if i peered at funhouse mirrors lsd was that it mescaline im hallucinating each word echoed more loudly yet seemed to murmur from far away i cringed as she approached growing more beautiful with every step and its been so long she said ive been so ugly so long since anyone wanted me reality cracked the universe spun she stripped off her uniform showing her breasts her her body was despite the torture in my stomach the insanity of my distorted senses i wanted her i suddenly needed her as desperately as anything id ever coveted passion was endless powerful frantic rolling we bumped the tray sending glass and plate knife and fork and steak sauce crashing down a lamp fell shattering my naked back slammed against the sharp edge of a table making me groan not from pain i screamed in ecstacy and just before i came with an explosive burst as if from the core of my soul as if after foisting her sins upon me she needed something from me in return i felt her drawing me close to her down ever down she moaned and pleaded eat me eat me i lost consciousness the nebraska state police claim they found me wandering naked down the middle of interstate at one oclock in the afternoon two days later they say i was horribly sunburned i dont know i dont remember all i recall is waking up in the hospital in iowa city in the psych ward the doctors lied they claimed i wasnt ugly then why would they have locked me up and taken the mirrors away why would the nurses have flinched when they came in with guards to feed me they thought they were so smart but i knew the truth despite the thick wire screen across the window at night i saw my reflection i dont have a chin theres only one eye in place of a nose ive got two flat repulsive slits im being punished i understand that now for all the evil in the world i used to be a catholic but i dont go to church anymore when i was young though learning to go to confession the nuns made me learn a speech to say to the priest in the booth bless me father for i have sinned my last confession was and then id tell him how long ago and then id confess and then id finish by saying im sorry for these and all my sins i am you know im sorry except i didnt commit them the sins arent mine my wife and children came to visit i refused to let them see me i couldnt bear to see the sickened reaction in their eyes how can a sineater get rid of the sins thats what she said to me by passing the sins along of course by having them eaten by someone else ive known for several weeks now what i had to do it was simply a matter of pretending to be calm of waiting for my chance i hope the guard wasnt badly hurt i tried not to hit him too hard but his head made a terrible sound when i cracked it against the wall ive been very clever ive stolen three cars and ive never kept one long enough for the state police to catch me its taken me two days to return thats why the trees so important its my landmark you see remember the offramp had no sign the trees all i had to give me direction but im puzzled oh i found the tree all right its branches in the shape of the menorah candelabrum and its so distinctive i cant believe thered be another like it but i swear it had eight upright branches then and it was bare but now its got nine and leaves have sprouted dear god help me save me i pressed the accelerator to the floor racing along the twolane blacktop as before the road stretched forever doubt made me frantic i tried not to glance at the rearview mirror all the same i weakened and my ugliness made me wail i saw the building in the distance the glint of sunlight off the metal roof i whimpered rushing closer and i found the town again exactly the same the water tower the cattle pen but its full now the service station the barbcue i dont understand though everyones normal i see no goiters no hunchbacks no twisted limbs and festering sores they stare as i drive past i cant stand to see their shock and disgust ive found her house im in here waiting in the hospital the doctors said i was having delusions they agreed my initial suspicion might have been correct that some chemical in my food could have made me hallucinate and now the effects of the drug persist making me think im ugly distorting my memory of the trip i wish i could believe that i even wish i could believe ive gone crazy anything would be better than the truth but i know what it is she did it she made me eat her sins but dammit ill get even with her ill make her take them back ive been writing this in her living room while i glance hurriedly out the window in case something happens to me so people will understand it wasnt my fault but shell come home soon yes she will and then i hear a car door on the street someones stepping from a station wagon oh sweet christ at last but no its not one person two a man and a woman but the woman isnt the one i want what happened did she leave theyll come in theyll find me i dont care i cant bear this anymore i have to pass the sins along i have to i found a knife in the kitchen see i dont know the words i dont know how to put my sins in the food but i remember the last thing she said to me i know how to do it i have to use the knife and a fork and make them eat me the following three stories were written as a group and published together in as part of the night visions series their common theme is ambition and the dark side of success each is about a specific occupation in this case a paper boy i have a special fondness for this story because when my son matt was twelve he liked to earn extra money delivering newspapers he had more than an adequate allowance but like the chatty likeable boy youre about to meet he was determined to be an entrepreneur because the route required him to get up every morning at fivethirty my wife and i couldnt resist helping often before dawn i set out with matt and in winter that help was especially appreciated it was appreciated even more when over the space of a year two paper boys disappeared in a neighboring city those boys were never found as you might expect the route had its tense moments and part of the purpose of this story was to communicate how alone a paper carrier can feel early in the morning these days the job is usually done by adults in cars but if youre in one of those rare places that still has paper boys or girls next time your carrier comes to the door give a big tip black and white and red all over you probably read about me in the paper this morning fact is if you live near the corner of benton and sunset im the kid who normally delivers it to you course i couldnt bring it to you today being in the hospital and all with my arm busted and my skull what the doctor says is fractured my dad took over for me to tell the truth i kinda miss doing the route ive been delivering three years now since i was nine and it gets to be a habit even if i do have to wake up at fivethirty christmas and new years and every day but if you think i slept in this morning youre wrong the nurses wake you up early here just the same as if my mom was nudging me to crawl out of bed and make sure i put on my longjohns before i take the papers cause its awful cold these snowy mornings you have to walk the route instead of riding your bike and that takes a half hour longer especially with the sky staying dark so long and sometimes you cant see the numbers on the houses when youre looking for where a new customer lives the way this works the gazette has this guy in a truck come along and drop a bundle in front of my house and my dad goes out to get the bundle and fold the papers in my sack while i get dressed a lot of times therell be this card with the name of a new customer or else the name of a customer who doesnt want the paper anymore and then my mom and ill have to add or subtract the name from my list and figure out how much the customer owes me especially if hes starting or stopping in the middle of a week its pretty complicated but my dad says it teaches me how to run a business and the extra money comes in handy for buying cds or playing video games even if i do have to put a third of what i earn away in my bank account but i was telling you about my customers youd be surprised how close a kid can feel to the people he delivers the paper to they wake up early and rush to get ready for work or whatever and i figure the only fun they have is when they sit down at breakfast to read what happened while they were sleeping its sorta like catching up on gossip i guess they depend on me and ive never been late delivering the papers and the only times ive missed are when i was sick or like now from what happened yesterday morning the bandages around my head feel itchy and the cast on my arms awful heavy the nurses have written lots of jokes on it though so im looking forward to going back to school in two or three weeks the doctor says and showing it to all the kids you get to notice things about your customers stuff a guy wouldnt think of unless he delivers papers like after a big football game you cant believe how many people are awake with all the lights on before i even get there waiting for the paper so they can find out something new about the game they already heard or went to or watched on tv or like this house on gilby street where for a week or so i had to hold my breath when i came up the sidewalk past the shrubs because of the worst scuzzy smell like something really rotten even when i held my breath it almost made me sick like the bad potatoes mom found in the cellar last month nobody was picking up the papers i left they just kept piling up beside the door and after i told my dad he looked at my mom kinda strange and said hed better go over to see what was wrong i could tell he figured maybe somebody was dead and i guess i wondered that myself but the way things turned out those people were just on vacation which is why the papers kept piling up and the smell was only from these plastic bags of garbage theyd forgotten to put out and some dogs had torn open at the side of the house that smell really made me nervous for a while though and then theres the carrigans he lost his job at the mill last summer and his wife likes fancy clothes and theyre always yelling about money when im next door playing with ralph or when i come around to collect or even at six in the morning when i bring them the paper imagine that getting up way before dawn to argue or what about old mr blanchard his wifes old too and shes sick with what my mom says is cancer and i havent seen mrs blanchard in a couple months but old mr blanchard hes up when i put the paper under the mat i can see through his living room window where the lights on in the kitchen and hes sitting at the table hunched over holding his head and his shoulders are shaking even out front i can hear him sobbing it makes my throat tight he always wears this gray old lumpy sweater id feel sorry for him no matter what but he cries like its tearing his chest apart and then theres mr lang hes got this puffy face and a redveined nose and squinty angry eyes hes always complaining about how much the paper costs and claims im cheating him by coming around more often than i should to collect which of course ive never done two months ago he started swearing at me so im afraid to go over there my dad says its the whiskey makes him act like that and now my dad collects from him the last time my dad came back from there he said mr langs not bad if you get to know him and realize he doesnt like his life but i dont care i want my dad to keep collecting from him i guess i was spooked by what you read about that happened in granite falls two months ago when mr lang swore at me that paper boy who disappeared his parents waited for him to come home from his sunday morning route and after they got calls from customers wanting to know where the paper was his dad went out looking and found his sack full of papers a block away in an empty lot behind some bushes you remember how the police and the neighbors went out searching and the paper he worked for put his picture on the front page and offered a reward if anybody knew where he was but they didnt find him the police said he mightve run away but that didnt make any sense to me it was too darn cold to run away and where would he go my dad says he read how the police even seemed to think the parents might have done something to him themselves and how the parents got so mad they wanted to sue the police for saying that one man was cruel enough to phone the parents and pretend he had the boy and ask for money but the police traced the calls and the man didnt have him now the man says it was just a joke but i read where hes in lots of trouble granite falls thats not too far from here my dad said some nut from there could easily drive to other towns like ours i wasnt going to give up my route though just because of what happened there like i said im used to the money i make and going downtown on saturdays to buy a new cd but i felt kinda fluttery in my stomach i sure didnt want to disappear myself im old enough to know about the creepy things perverts do to kids so my dad went with me the next few mornings on my route and i took a flashlight when i started going alone again and i delivered the papers fast believe me you cant guess what the wind scraping through bushes behind you in the dark can make you feel when its early and theres nobody around to shout to for help but after a month when nothing happened i started feeling easier ashamed of myself for getting scared like i was a little kid i slipped back into my old routine delivering the papers halfasleep looking forward to the homemade orange julius my mom always has waiting for me when i get back from the route i read the comics in the gazette before i catch an extra hour of sleep till its time for school after being out in the snow those blankets feel great three weeks ago another paper boy disappeared this time right here in crowell and you remember how the neighbors searched the same as in granite falls and his picture was in the gazette and the parents offered a reward but they didnt find him only his sack of papers stuffed behind some bushes like the last time the police said it looked like the same mo thats fancy police talk for pattern but heck you dont have to go to police school to figure out that both kids disappeared the same way and one kid might have run away but not two of them leastways not in the snow oh yeah thats something i forgot to mention both mornings when the kids disappeared it was snowing real hard so there werent any tracks except for the neighbors searching no kid runs away in a blizzard ill tell you the rest of us paper boys nearly went on what my dad calls a strike actually it was our parents wanted us to quit delivering they demanded police protection for us but the police said we were overreacting we shouldnt panic and anyway there werent enough police to protect us all the gazette said if we stopped delivering the paper would go out of business they asked our parents to keep a close watch on us and they made us sign a contract agreeing to give up seventyfive cents a month so the paper could insure us in case something happened to us on the route well that made my dad twice as mad he told me to quit and i almost did but i couldnt stop thinking of all the money i like to spend on saturdays my dad says i was born a capitalist and ill probably grow up to vote republican whatever that means but i told him i won a ribbon last year on the sixthgrade track team and i could run faster than any pervert i bet well he just laughed and shook his head and told me hed go out with me every morning but my mom looked like she was going to cry i guess moms are like that always worrying besides i said i only have to worry if its snowing thats the only time the kids disappeared my dad said that made sense but all my mom said was well see which is always bad news like if you ask for a friend to stay overnight and your mom says well see you figure she means no but she didnt the next morning my dad went with me on the route and it was one of those sharp cold times when your boots squeak on the snow and the airs so clean you can hear a car start up three blocks away i knew for sure id hear any pervert if he tried sneaking up on me and anyway my dad was with me and all the other carriers had it as easy as i did still every morning i got up praying it wasnt snowing and lots of times it had snowed in the night but stopped and when i saw the house across from ours clear in the streetlight i felt like somebody had taken a rope from around my chest so we went on like that getting up at fivethirty and doing the papers and once my dad got the flu so my mom went with me you can believe it she was nervous more than me i guess you should have seen us rushing to finish the route all the time we were looking over our shoulders mr carrigan was yelling at his wife like always and mr blanchard was crying for his own wife and mr lang was drinking beer when he opened his door and scared me getting his paper i almost wet my pants no fooling he asked if i wanted to step in and get warm but i backed off saying no mr lang no thank you holding up my hands and shaking my head i forgot about his stairs behind me i bet id have broken my arm even sooner than now if hed shoveled them but the snow made them soft and when i tumbled to the bottom i landed in a drift he tried to help me but i jumped up and ran away then last sunday i woke up and even before i looked out i knew from the shriek of the wind that it was snowing my heart felt hard and small i almost couldnt move i tasted this sour stuff from my stomach i couldnt see the house across the street the snow was flying so thick and strong i couldnt even see the maple tree in our front yard as warm as id been in bed i shivered like i was outside and the wind was stinging through my pajamas i didnt want to go but i knew thatd be all the excuse my momd need to make me quit so i forced myself i dressed real quick long underwear and the rest and put on my downfilled coat that almost doesnt fit me anymore and my mitts and ski mask and it wasnt just my mom or dad who went with me that time but both of them and i could tell they felt as scared as i was nothing happened as far as we knew we finished the route and came home and made hot chocolate all our cheeks were red and we went back to sleep and when we woke up my dad turned on the radio i guess you know what we heard another paper boy had disappeared right here in crowell thats an mo if i ever heard of one three carriers gone and two of them from town and all three when it was snowing the storm kept on so this time there werent even any tracks from the police and the neighbors searching they couldnt find his sack of papers a couple of people helping out had to go to the hospital because of frost bite the missing boys didnt live on our side of town but even so my dad went over to help with the streets so drifted he couldnt drive he had to walk when he came back after dark with his parka all covered with snow he said it was horrible out there he couldnt get warm he just kept sitting hunched in front of the fireplace throwing logs on rubbing his rawlooking hands and shivering my mom kept bringing him steaming drinks that she called hot toddies and after an hour he slumped back snoring mom and me had to help him up to bed then mom took me back downstairs and sat with me in the living room and told me i had to quit i didnt argue crowells got forty thousand people if you figure threequarters of them get the paper and most of the carriers have forty customers thats seven hundred and fifty paper boys i worked that out on my dads pocket calculator kinda surprising that many paper boys if youre not a carrier yourself but if youre on the streets at fivethirty every morning like i am then you see a lot of us theres a kid on almost every corner walking up somebodys driveway leaving a paper in front of a door not counting the kid in granite falls thats two missing carriers out of seven hundred and fifty that might make the odds seem in my favor but the way i figured it and my mom said it too that many paper boys only gave the nut a lot of choice i like to play video games and all but the money i earned wasnt worth disappearing the way those other boys did with my sack of papers stuffed behind some bushes which by the way is where they found the third kids sack like the others when the snow stopped after we put my dad to bed and my mom looked out the living room window she made a funny noise in her throat i walked to her and saw the house across the street all shimmery covered with snow and glinting from the streetlight any other time it wouldve looked peaceful like a christmas card but i felt sick like all that white had something ugly underneath i was standing on a vent for the furnace and i heard the gas burner turn on warm air rushed up my pajama leg all the same i shivered ive told you i quit but my dad says weve got something called a body clock inside us it comes from being used to a regular routine like when you know even if you dont have your watch on that its time for your favorite tv program or you know youd better get home cause your momll have supper ready i wasnt going to deliver papers but i woke up at fivethirty the same as usual even if mom didnt wake me for just a second i told myself id better hurry then i remembered i wasnt going to deliver the papers anymore i slumped back in bed and tried to go back to sleep but i kept squinting at the digital clock mom and dad gave me last christmas and the red numbers kept changing getting later then at last i couldnt bear feeling guilty like id done something wrong even though i hadnt i crawled from bed and opened my curtains and peered at the dark snow in our driveway i could see the tire tracks on the street where the guy from the gazette had pulled up and thrown my bundle it was all by itself in the driveway sunk in the snow it was wrapped in a garbage bag to keep it dry this big black shape with all this white around it i kept staring at it and the gazette office hadnt been open the day before on sunday even on monday theyre not open till eight so there wasnt any way for the paper to know id quit i kept thinking of my customers getting up looking forward to reading the paper at breakfast going to the door not finding it then i thought of all the calls wed soon be getting forty of them wanting to know where their paper was the more i thought about it the more i felt worse till i reminded myself of what my dad always says theres only one way to do a job and thats the right way i put on my longjohns my jeans and sweater and parka i woke up my dad whose face looked old all of a sudden i guess from being out in the storm searching the day before i told him i had to deliver the papers and he just blinked at me then nodded with his lips pursed like he didnt agree but he understood my mom made a fuss as youd expect but my dad got dressed and went with me i wasnt sure if i was shaking from the cold or from being scared it wasnt snowing though and even shivering i knew id be all right we hurried wed started a half hour late but we got the papers to every customer without seeing any tire tracks in their driveway to tell us theyd left for work already a couple places we met a customer shoveling drifts puffing frost from his mouth from the work and every one of them looked glad to see me like theyd been sure they werent going to get a paper and here id been as dependable as ever they grinned and promised me a tip when i came around next time to collect and i guess i grinned as well it made me feel warm all of a sudden even mr lang whos normally so hard to get along with came out and patted me on the back the way the track coach sometimes does my dad and i did the route the fastest we ever had and when we got home my mom had pancakes ready and syrup hot from the radarange i guess id never been so hungry my dad even gave me a little coffee in a glass i sipped it feeling its steam on my nose actually liking the bitter taste then my dad clicked his cup against my glass and i felt like id grown in the night my chest never felt so big and even my mom had to admit it wed done the right thing but that didnt change what had happened at eight just before i left for school my mom phoned the paper and told them i was quitting when i went outside i felt relieved like something heavy had been taken off my back but that didnt last long a block from school my stomach started getting hard and i couldnt stop thinking id lost something or like the track season was over or id missed a movie i was looking forward to its funny how you get used to things even a job which i know isnt supposed to be fun thats why its called a job but i liked being a paper boy earning money and all and i could tell i was going to feel empty now from not doing it all morning i couldnt concentrate on what the teacher said she asked if i was sick but i told her i was only tired i was sorry id be okay i tried my best to act interested and when i got home for lunch my mom said the paper had called to ask if they could send somebody over to talk to us around suppertime shed done her hardest to tell them no but i guess they insisted cause someone was coming anyhow and i ate my hamburger fast from being curious and ill admit excited from getting attention the afternoon was the longest i ever remember after school i didnt care about hanging around with the guys i just stayed at home and played video games and watched the clock on the tv recorder my dad came home from work a little after five he was just opening a can of beer when the doorbell rang i dont know why but my arm muscles hurt when he went to the door and it was sharon from the paper shes the one who came to the house and explained how to do my route when i first got started lots of times she stopped at the house to give me extra cards for figuring out how much my customers owed me once she brought me the fifty dollars worth of movie passes that i won from going around the neighborhood and convincing the most new customers than any other carrier in town to take the gazette in the morning instead of the chronicle from granite falls which is the evening paper but you know that i guess sharon s younger than my mom shes got a pony tail and rosy cheeks and she reminds me of the student teacher from the college here in town thats helping my regular teacher sharon always shows more interest in talking to me instead of to my parents she makes me feel special and grown up and she always smiles and tells me im the best carrier shes got but last monday she wasnt smiling she looked like she hadnt slept all night and her cheeks were pale she said so many carriers had quit and no new carriers wanted to take their place that the paper was worried like it might go out of business she said her boss had told her to go around to all the carriers that had quit and tell them the paper would pay them three dollars extra a week if they stayed but my mom wouldnt let me answer for myself my mom said no but it was like sharon hadnt heard she said the gazette would promise that any morning it snowed the papers didnt have to be delivered and i could see my dad agreed it was a good idea but my mom kept shaking her head from side to side then sharon rushed on and said at least let her have a few days to find a replacement for me which was going to be hard because i was so dependable and that made my heart beat funny please give her a week she said if she couldnt find somebody else by next monday then i could go ahead and quit and she wouldnt bother us again but at least let her have the chance her voice sounded thick and chokey because her boss said if she couldnt find kids to do the routes hed get somebody else to do her job her eyes looked moist like shed been out in the wind all of a sudden i felt crummy like id let her down i wanted to make myself small i couldnt face her for the first time she paid more attention to my parents than to me blinking at my mom then my dad sorta pleading and my mom didnt seem to breathe then she did long and deep like she felt real tired she said my dad and her would have to talk about it so they went to the kitchen and i tried not to look at sharon while i heard them whispering and when they came back my mom said okay for a week till sharon could find a replacement but no longer in the meantime if it was snowing i wasnt going out to deliver the papers sharon almost cried then she kept saying thanks and after she left my mom said she hoped we werent making a mistake but i knew i wasnt i figured out what had been bothering me not quitting but doing it so fast without making sure my customers got their paper and explaining to them and saying goodbye i was going to miss them funny how you get used to things the next morning i didnt feel nervous as much as glad to have the route back at least for a few more days it was one of the last times id see my customers houses that early and i tried to memorize what it was like taking the paper to the carrigans who still kept arguing and mr blanchard crying for his wife and mr lang still drinking beer for breakfast my dad went with me that tuesday and you could see other parents helping their kids do the routes id never seen so many people out so early and in the cold their whispers and their boots squeaking were as clear as the sharp reflection of the streetlights off the drifts nothing happened though the police kept looking for the boys whod disappeared and wednesday nothing happened either the fact is by saturday everything had gone pretty much back to normal it was never snowing in the morning and my dad says people have awful short memories cause we heard how a lot of paper boys whod quit had asked for their routes back and a lot of other kids had asked for the routes that needed a carrier i know in my own case id stopped feeling scared pretty much the opposite i kept thinking about monday and how it was closer all the time and maybe i could convince my mom to let me go on delivering saturday was clear when my dad came in from the driveway carrying the bundle of papers he said it wasnt hardly cold at all out there i looked through the kitchen window toward the thermometer on the side of the house and the light from the kitchen reached it in the dark the red line was almost at thirtytwo i wouldnt need my ski mask though i made sure to take my mitts and we packed the papers in my sack and we went out that early the air smelled almost sweet from being warmer than usual and under my longjohns i started to sweat we went down benton then over to sunset and started up gilby thats the hardest street cause its got this steep long hill in summer im always puffing when i ride my bike to the top and in winter i have to stop a minute going up with my heavy boots and coat on how we did it was my dad took one side of the street and i took the other we could see each other because of the streetlights and by splitting the work wed do the route twice as fast but wed got a note about a new customer that morning and my dad couldnt find the house number i kept delivering papers going up the hill and the next thing i knew id reached the top i looked back down and my dad was a shadow near the bottom it wasnt snowing so i figured id do a few more papers my next customer was over on crossridge if you went by car you had to drive back down gilby hill then go a block over to crossridge then drive all the way up to the top of the other hill but if you went on foot or bike you could cut through a sidewalk that one of my customers has in his yard connecting gilby and crossridge so i went through there and left the paper and i suddenly felt frozenscared cause flurries began to fall id been looking at the dark sky from time to time there wasnt a moon but the stars had been bright twinkling real pretty i looked up fast now and i couldnt see the stars all i saw were these thick black clouds i swear even in the dark i could see em they were twisting and heaving like something was inside rolling and straining to bust loose the flurries got bigger i shouldve remembered from school thirtytwo thats the perfect temperature for getting snow my legs felt limp i wasnt walking right from being scared i tried to run but i lost my balance and almost fell the snow came fast now i couldnt see the clouds because of it it was falling so thick i couldnt even see the houses across the street a wind started and then it got worse and screechy my cheeks hurt like something was burning them but it wasnt heat it was cold the air had been sweet and warm but now it was freezing and the wind stung and the snow felt like tiny bits of icecold broken glass i swung around looking for dad but i couldnt see the houses next to me the snow kept pelting my face and the wind bit so i kept blinking and tears filled my eyes i wiped them with my mitts that only made them blurry snow froze to my cheeks and hair i moaned wishing id worn my ski mask the shriek of the wind was worse i tried to yell for my dad but the gusting snow pushed the words back into my mouth then i couldnt see the sidewalk i couldnt see my mitts in front of my face all i saw was a wall of moving white as cold as i felt deep in my bones my stomach burned the more it felt hot the more i shook i yelled once more for my dad and in a panic stumbled to find him i didnt know i was off the sidewalk till i hit mr carringtons fence its sharp and pointy like metal spears when i banged against it one of the points jabbed my chest i felt it gouge me even through the padding of my coat it pushed all the air out of me i fell back into a drift where i felt like i was in quicksand going deeper scrambling to stand but my heavy sack of papers held me down and the snow kept piling on me it went down my neck like a cold hand on my back it stung so hard i jumped up screaming but the wind shrieked louder and all i saw was the swirling snow around me in the dark i ran but i mustve got turned around cause nothing was where it shouldve been invisible bushes slashed my face i smacked against a tree and i guess thats how my nose got broken but i didnt feel it i was too scared i just kept running yelling for my dad and when i didnt bump into anything i guessed i was in the street but i know now it was the vacant lot next to mr carrington somebodys digging a foundation for a new house and it was like the ground disappeared i was suddenly falling it seemed like forever and i landed so hard i bit my lip right through you ought to see the stitches my dad says sometimes when something terrible happens to you you dont feel it on account of what he calls shock he says your body has a limit to what it can stand and then it shuts out the pain that mustve been what happened cause my chest and my nose and my lip got numb and all i wanted was to find my dad and get back home i wanted my mom i crawled from the hole and somehow i knew there was someone close with my eyes full of tears i could barely see the snow but then this dark shape rushed at me and i knew it was my dad except it wasnt in the comics when someone gets hit on the head they always show stars and thats what i saw stars bright in the snow and i knew id been hit but i didnt feel it my dad says shock can do that too something can happen to you that would normally slam you flat but if youre scared you somehow get the strength not to fall i almost did though everything got blurry and began to spin and this is the strange part i got hit so hard i dropped my sack of papers the sack fell open and as clear as day i saw my papers in a drift the black ink with white all around it then the papers were splattered with red you know that old joke whats black and white and read all over a newspaper only this is spelled different the red was the blood from my head i turned to run and thats when the shadow grabbed my arm i kept turning and even in the shriek of the wind i heard the crack as clear as if my dad had taken a piece of kindling and snapped it across his knee for the fireplace but the snap was from my arm and i felt it twist at the elbow pointing toward my shoulder the next thing i was on my back and the snow stopped gusting long enough for me to gape up at old mr blanchard kneeling beside me raising the claw end of a hammer i moved my head as he brought it down so the claws glanced past my scalp tearing away some hair i kicked and this time the hammer whacked my collar bone i screamed the claws of the hammer plunged toward the spot between my eyes and another hand shot from the storm grabbing mr blanchards arm before i passed out i saw my dad yank the hammer away from him and jerk him to his feet my dad shouted stuff at him id never heard before i mean terrible words i dont want to remember and i wont repeat then my dad was shaking mr blanchard and mr blanchards head was flopping back and forth and the next thing i knew i was here in the hospital with the bandages around my head and my nose and mouth swollen and my arm in this cast my dad tried to explain it to me i think i understand but im not sure mr blanchards wife died three months ago i thought she was still alive but i was wrong he and his wife they never had any children and my dad says he felt so alone without her he wanted somebody around the house to take care of like a son so the first boy he took home was from granite falls that time two months ago when he went to visit his wifes sister then he wanted another son and another so he took home those two boys from here making sure it was snowing so he could hide his tracks but then he wanted all the sons he could get it makes me sick to think about it how after he realized the boys were dead he took them out to his garage and stacked them under a sheet of canvas in the corner like cord wood a reporter said its been cold enough that the bodies got hard and frozen otherwise they wouldve smelled like that other house i told you about i wonder now if all the times i saw mr blanchard crying it was because of his wife being dead or because he realized he was doing wrong but he couldnt stop himself a part of me feels sorry for him but another part keeps thinking about those missing boys and how scared they mustve been when mr blanchard came at them in the storm and what he looked like when he knelt beside me raising that hammer i have a feeling ill remember that till i grow up earlier i said the nurses wake me early here the same as if my mom was getting me up to do my route i guess i lied the nurses didnt wake me i woke myself screaming remembering the claws of the hammer and the blood on my papers the nurses ran in and someones been sitting with me ever since my mom or my dad is always here and they say my collar bone is broken too but what hurts worst is my arm the gazette sent sharon over though i know shed have come on her own shes writing down what i say but im not sure why cause shes also got a tape recorder turned on you ought to see her smiling when i talk about her she says shes going to put my story in the paper and her boss is going to pay me for it i can sure use the money cause the doctor says i wont be delivering papers for quite a while i guess even after everything thats happened ill go back to my route after all we know why those boys disappeared and there cant be that many crazy people like mr blanchard though my dad says hes beginning to wonder he just read about a girl carrier in ashville that had somebody try to pull her into a car whats going on that even kids who deliver papers cant feel safe my dad says pretty soon nobodyll want to leave their houses well never mind i told sharon ive been talking for quite a while im getting sleepy and i dont believe the paper will print all this but she says my storys what they call an exclusive and maybe some other papers will pick it up my mom says she hopes i wont start acting temperamental whatever that means now that im famous but i dont feel famous i feel sore i hope my customers enjoy reading what i said though cause i like them and i hope they remember what they promised about giving me a tip on account of theres a new video game i want to buy my dad came in and heard this last part he said it again i mustve been born a businessman and ill probably grow up to vote republican i still dont know what a republican is but ive been thinking maybe if i go around to a few houses and show them the bandages around my head and the cast on my arm theyll subscribe to the paper theres a new contest on the kid who finds the most new customers gets a years free pass to the movies now if only theyll throw in the popcorn this middle story about the dark side of success gives us a different occupation sports specifically playing football the main character of the previous story was a boy here we have a teenager the third story will be told by an adult the plot was inspired by a newspaper account of an iowa highschool football team that had a controversial ritual before each game odd how the stars of high school seldom remain stars in later life do they peak too early or is something extra needed to go all the way mumbo jumbo thats what they called it mumbo jumbo you wouldnt think they could have kept it a secret all those years but coach hayes made them promise and he wasnt someone you crossed so there werent even any rumors i didnt know the thing existed until my junior year in high school when i tried out for the football team i promised myself id be honest trying out wasnt my idea it was joeys sure i liked to throw a football around as much as any other guy but showing up for practice after classes every day and dont forget the pain joey you know what im talking about coach hayes makes the team run two miles doubletime before each practice thats not counting all the jumping jacks and pushups and situps and god knows how many other ups he makes them do for starters before they get down to the rough stuff agony joey thats what im talking about youre sure you know what you want to get us in for we were having cherry cokes and fries down at the chicken nest near the school a lot of good times of course the nests torn down now seven years ago the city made it a parking lot but i remember joey bracking through a straw at the bottom of his coke squinting at me across the table joining the team would be something to do he said if we make it of course oh thats no problem wed make it all right im not so sure come on i ate a fry with ketchup on it were big guys and were in shape were overweight and danny were not in shape this morning i had to pull in my gut to button my jeans anyway thats not the point i told you playing with the team would be something to do we cant just hang around here or down in your rec room all the time whats wrong with playing records and nothing but its not enough i stopped eating fries and frowned at him what are you talking about dont you get the feeling were not going anywhere i shook my head confused id never heard joey talk that way before left out he said all the extra stuff they do at school the student council the way theyre always included in whats going on that stuck up bill stedman ever since he got elected president last year he walks around like he owns the goddamned school and the plays the drama club puts on and the debating team and all thats candy ass whats with you you want to be an actor now i dont know what i want to be joey rubbed his forehead but i want to be something those guys on the football team they look like what like they enjoy being good at what they do they look damned proud you can tell theyre glad to belong but all that pain his eyes had been bright they seemed to be looking at something far away then all at once they came back to normal he gave me that sly grin of his but theres a payoff those football players date the sexiest girls in school all those muscles give the cheerleaders the hots i grinned right back why didnt you say so now i get it why hang around here when theres a chance to date rebecca henderson or her girlfriend huh we started laughing so hard that the waitress told us to shut up or leave and thats how we came to try out for the football team and how i learned about mumbo jumbo these days ive got a beer gut and i puff if i walk up a couple flights of stairs and my doctor says my cholesterol counts too high cholesterol back then you should have seen us though granted what joey had said was right we were overweight and soft but we soon changed all that the conversation i just described took place the week before school started and joey had us lifting weights and running laps even before coach hayes announced the dates for tryouts when we showed up on the football field behind the gym that first saturday of the school term asking to join the team coach hayes took his cap off scratched his head and wondered if we were kidding no we mean it joey said we really want to join but you guys know my rules you cant be on the team unless your scholastic average is b then well study harder well raise our grades or waste my time not to mention the teams your record speaks for itself ive got no patience with guys who dont commit themselves well try we promise joey said please its important to us but look at the flab on you two sure youre tall enough six foot joey said dannys a quarter inch taller but how are you going to keep up with the other guys look at welsh over there hes been working out all summer i glanced at welsh who was running through the holes in a double row of tires laid out on the field he made it easily me id have been groaning on my way to the hospital youll give up as soon as things get tough coach hayes said why pretend different all were asking for is a chance joey said coach hayes rubbed a big tanned calloused hand across his mouth a chance okay ill give you one the same chance the other boys have show me you can keep up with the training get in shape and earn decent grades well see thats all we want coach thanks one hundred percent remember i wont accept less if you guys get on the team and then stop trying youll wish you hadnt asked to join one hundred percent and danny what about you you havent said anything i nodded wondering what the hell i was doing there yeah right one hundred percent it was more like two hundred percent of torture the weightlifting and sprints joey and i had been doing were a joke compared to what coach hayes soon made us do even the guys whod stayed in shape all summer had trouble keeping up with the routines that twomile doubletime warmup nearly killed me and the calisthenics i threw up when i got home and smelled the meat loaf my mom had cooked the next morning sunday my knees felt so stiff i hobbled when i crawled out of bed i groaned to joey on the phone this isnt going to work im telling you i cant make the try out today i feel like shit danny my mother said from the kitchen watch your language you think you feel worse than me joey asked all night i dreamed i was doing situps my stomachs got rocks in it then lets not go were going we promised i wont break my word but whats the point even a date with rebecca henderson isnt worth the agony well be going through rebecca henderson who cares the team he said i want to make the team but i thought i said that just to get you interested listen danny weve got a chance to belong to something special to be good at something better than anybody else im tired of being a fuckup on the phone in the background i heard joeys mother tell him to watch his language but my back feels weve been friends a long time right since we started grade school and weve done everything together right we went to the movies together and we went swimming together and we i get the idea but so im asking you lets do this together too i dont want to lose your friendship danny i dont want to do this by myself inside i felt warm knowing what he was trying to tell me sure it was sappy but i guess i loved him like a brother okay i said if it means that much to you it means that much when we showed up that afternoon behind the gym coach hayes blinked wonders never cease we told you were serious joey said and sore you bet legs feel like theyve been run over by a truck a steamroller coach hayes grinned well at least youre honest even the pros admit they hurt the trick is to do the job no matter how much it hurts i silently cursed we wont let you down joey said well see danny you sure dont say much everybody lets get started doubletime around the track after that ive got a few new exercises for you inwardly i groaned after the first mile i nearly threw up again but its funny i guess you can get used to anything monday morning i felt awful i mean really wretched there wasnt a part of me that didnt ache and tuesday morning was worse i dont want to remember wednesday morning plus we didnt hang around the chicken nest anymore or go down to my rec room playing records we didnt have time and i felt so tired all i wanted to do was watch the tube but i had to hit the books every night after supper joey phoned to make sure i was studying what i missed most were those cherry cokes and fries but coach hayes insisted we stay off them we could eat spaghetti but no mashed potatoes beef was okay but the next day had to be chicken or fish my mother went crazy trying to figure out the menus for the life of me i didnt understand the diet but along about saturday after a week of tryouts i started feeling not too bad oh i still ached but it was a different kind of ache solid and tight pulling me in and my mind felt brighter clearer the first quiz i took i got an a two sundays later coach hayes lined us up after our workout the bunch of us stood there facing him breathing hard sweating freddie coach hayes told the kid beside me sorry you just dont have enough weight the west high teamd mash you into the field maybe next year for what its worth youre nimble enough to get on the track team he shifted his glance pete youd make a good tackle harry i like the way you block and so on down until only joey and i were left coach hayes spread his legs put his hands on his hips and scowled as for you two guys ive never seen a more miserable pair of joey made a choking sound but i guess youll do joey breathed out sharply i cheered we made it joey grinned with excitement i cant believe were on the team we stood on the corner where we always separated going home i laughed its the first thing i ever really tried for and got were on the team i owe you i couldnt have done it without you i said same goes here but id have quit if you hadnt naw i was close to quitting a couple times myself joey said i didnt think so hed wanted it more than i had id better go my momll have supper ready i said yeah mine will too ill meet you a half hour early tomorrow so we can study for that science quiz you bet i didnt add what i was thinking joey added it for me now comes the hard part he was right what wed been doing until then was only exercises and sloppy scrimmage now we really got down to business ive diagrammed these plays for you to memorize coach hayes aimed a pointer against a blackboard in the social studies room after mondays final bell ill soon give you plenty more youll have to learn about game psychology how to fake out the other team and youll have to build team spirit thats as important as anything else i want you guys to hang around with each other go to movies together eat lunch together i want you all to understand each other until you can guess what joey or pete or danny will do on the field anticipate each other thats the secret but coach hayes had another secret i didnt learn about it until our first game and that was two weeks away in the meantime the pressure kept building harder longer exercise sessions practice games until my shoulder ached so bad i thought id dislocate it throwing the ball thats right throwing the ball i guess coach hayes had been more impressed with us than he let on after trying different guys in different positions hed actually picked me as a quarterback and joey as a receiver you two think alike lets see if you can make it work for you sure i was proud but there were still grades to keep up and even more plays to memorize i had no time to think about rebecca henderson the school the team and winning were all coach hayes told us mattered sixthirty friday night we showed up at the locker room and put on our uniforms i felt shaky already the other guys hardly spoke their faces were pale coach hayes didnt help any when he started bitching about how good the other team was covington highs gonna stomp us you guys arent ready you look like a bunch of losers eight winning seasons and now im stuck being nursemaid to a bunch of sissies i cant take the embarrassment of going out there with you pussies he went on like that sounding meaner more insulting as he went along until he had us so mad i wanted to shout at him to shut the fuck up i knew what he was doing using psychology to work us up so wed take out our anger on the other team but all of us respected coach hayes so much and wanted him to like us so much that hearing him put us down made me feel like wed been fools you bastard i thought joey kept glancing from coach hayes to me his face in pain at once the insults stopped coach hayes glared and nodded all right he walked to a wooden cabinet at the far end of the room it was always locked id often wondered what was in there now he put a key in the lock and turned it and behind me i heard a kid whod been on last years team whisper mumbo jumbo next to me joey straightened those whod been on last years team started fidgeting and somebody else whispered mumbo jumbo coach hayes opened the cabinets door i couldnt see what was in there because he stood in front of it his back to us then he slowly stepped away several guys breathed in i was looking at a statue it wasnt big a foot tall if that maybe four inches thick pale brown like the color of a cardboard box it was made from some kind of stone not shiny and smooth but dull and grittylooking like the stone was sand squeezed together it had tiny holes here and there the statue was a man distorted creepy he had a round bald head and huge bulging lips his stomach was so swollen he looked pregnant he sat with his legs crossed his hands in his lap so they hid his dong his navel was an upright slit he reminded me of pictures id seen of chinese idols but he also reminded me of those weird statues on easter island wed studied some of this in history class and those ugly ones in ruins in mexico you know the aztecs the mayans and all that the guys whod been on last years team didnt act surprised but they sure looked spellbound the rest of us didnt know what the hell was going on boys id better explain for our new members anyhow this is i dont know what youd call him our mascot i suppose or maybe better our teams good luck charm mumbo jumbo a kid from last year murmured for quite a few years now weve gone through a little ritual before each game coach hayes slid a table into the middle of the room its legs scraped on the concrete floor just as were going out to play i set the statue on this table we walk around it twice we each put our right hand on the statues head then we go out there kick the other teams butt and win what kind of shit is this i thought coach hayes seemed to read my mind oh sure i know its silly childish he grinned in embarrassment but ive been having the team do it so often now and weve had so many winning seasons im almost afraid to stop mind you i dont think for a second that touching old mumbo jumbos head does us any good but well when youve got a good thing going why change the pattern its not as if im superstitious but maybe some of you guys are maybe stopping the ritual would throw off your timing why not leave well enough alone he studied us letting what hed said sink in boy i thought he doesnt miss a trick anything to psych us up for christs sake a lucky statue theres just one other thing a few outsiders might not understand the odd things we sometimes have to do to gear ourselves up for a game they might object to what they thought was who knows what voodoo or something so weve always had this rule no one talks about mumbo jumbo outside this room we dont give away our little secrets i understood now why i hadnt heard about the statue before even from the guys whod been on last years team in a way joey and i hadnt been officially on the team until tonight when we went out to play i mean it coach hayes said if any of you guys blab about this ill boot you off the team he glared do i have your word a few guys mumbled sure i didnt hear you say it promise we did what he said louder we shouted it all right coach hayes took the statue from the cabinet and set it on the table up close the thing looked even uglier we walked around it twice put our right hand on its head i felt stupid as hell then ran out onto the football field and this is what happened i didnt believe it then now through the haze of all these years i try to convince myself that my memorys playing tricks but it happened thats the terrible part deep down knowing the truth but too late five minutes into the game no score coach hayes sent me out as quarterback in the huddle i called a passing play nothing fancy just something basic to get the feel of being in the game so we got set i grabbed the ball and all of a sudden it wasnt like in practice this was the real thing what all the pain and throwing up and weeks of work had been about and covington highs players looked like they wanted to kick in my teeth and make me swallow them our receivers ran out covington s interceptors stayed with them my heart thundered frantic i skipped back to get some room and gain some time straining to see if anybody was in the open covington s blockers charged at me it couldnt have taken five seconds but it seemed even shorter like a flash a swirl of bodies lunged at me my hands felt sweaty on the ball slick i had the terrible fear i was going to drop it then i saw joey hed managed to get in the open he was sprinting toward covington s goal line on the left glancing back across his shoulder hands up wanting the ball i snapped back my arm and shot the ball forward perfect exactly the way coach hayes had taught me one smooth powerful motion and pivoted sideways so i wouldnt get crushed by covington s blockers staring at the ball spinning through the air like a bullet my heart in my throat shouting to joey and thats when i froze i dont think ive ever felt that cold my blood was like ice my spine packed with snow because that end of the field to the left near covington s goal line was empty joey wasnt there nobody was but id seen him id aimed the ball to him i swear to god hed been there how the joey was over to the right streaking away from covington s men suddenly in the open to this day i still dont know how he gained so much yardage so fast in a rush he was charging toward the left toward the goal line and that ball fell in his hands so easily so neatly the fans assumed wed planned it a fakeout tactic a brilliant play coach hayes later said the same or claimed he believed it when joey sprinted across the goal line holding the ball up in triumph the kids from our school broke out in a cheer so loud i didnt hear it as much as feel it like a wall of sound shoving against me pressing me i threw up my hands yelling to get rid of my excitement but i knew it wasnt any fakeout play it wasnt brilliant it had almost been a massive screwup but it had worked almost as if i saw joey there i know it on the left near the goal line except he hadnt been there as if wed intended it to happen or it had been meant to happen or wed been unbelievably lucky i started shaking then i couldnt stop i wasnt steady enough to play for the next ten minutes sitting on the bench i kept seeing the play again in my mind joey in two spots at once maybe i hoped so hard that i saw what id pray i see but it felt spooky coach hayes came over to where i hunched on the bench something the matter i clutched my helmet i guess im just not used to what a real game instead of practice ive never helped score a touchdown before youll help score plenty more i felt a tingle in my gut the game was full of miracles like that plays that shouldnt have worked but they did incredible timing with five minutes to go in the game and the score to nothing in our favor coach hayes walked along our bench and murmured to the defensive squad the next time theyre close to our goal line let them score hold back but dont make it obvious joey and i frowned at each other but somebody said no buts do what youre told coach hayes said its demoralizing for them if they dont get at least a few points we want to let them feel they had a chance good sportsmanship nobody dared to argue with him our defensive squad sure looked troubled though and be convincing coach hayes said and thats why covington scored when our guys failed to stop an end run the school had an aftergame dance in the gym everybody kept coming up to me and joey and the rest of the team congratulating us slapping us on the back rebecca henderson even agreed to dance with me but shed come with some girlfriends and wouldnt let me take her home maybe next time she said believe it or not i didnt mind in fact i was so preoccupied i didnt remember to ask her out for saturday night what i wanted to do was talk to joey by ourselves a little after midnight we started home a vague smell of autumn in the air smoke from somebodys fireplace far off a dog barked the only sound except for the scrape of our shoes as we walked along i shoved my hands in the pockets of my greenandgold varsity jacket and finally said what was on my mind our first play when i threw you the ball and you scored joey didnt answer right away i almost repeated what id said yeah what about it his voice was soft i told him what i thought id seen the coach says we think alike joey shrugged what he calls anticipation you guessed thats where i was headed sure its just i turned to him we won so easily hey ive got bruises on my i dont mean we didnt work but we were so damned lucky everything clicked together thats why coach hayes kept drilling us to play as a team all the guys did what theyd been taught to do like clockwork yeah everybody in the right place at the right time so whats bugging you you thought you saw me in one place while i was in another youre not the only one who thought he was seeing things when we started that play i saw you snap the ball toward that empty slot in the field so i faked out the guy covering me and ran like hell to get there ahead of the ball know what as i started running i suddenly realized you hadnt even thrown the ball yet you were still looking for an opening i saw what you were going to do not what youd already done i felt a chill anticipation no big deal hell luck had nothing to do with it coach hayes had us psyched up the old adrenaline started burning i ran to where i guessed youd throw i tried to look convinced it must be im not used to all the excitement yeah the excitement even in the dark his eyes glowed theres a lot of room for improvement coach hayes said at saturdays game analysis we missed a chance for at least two interceptions our blockings got to be quicker harder he surprised me the score had been so misbalanced our plays so nearly perfect i figured wed done as well as we could he made the team practice sunday afternoon and every day after school just because we won our first game doesnt mean we can afford to slack off overconfidence makes losers we still had to stay on that crazy diet of his in my fantasies i dreamed of mountains of cherry cokes and fries with ketchup for sure we had to keep our grades up the end of the week he went around to all our teachers and asked how wed done on our quizzes let your studies slide he warned us and you dont play friday night we packed our equipment in the school bus and drove across town to meet west high we used the girls locker room in the gym and after wed dressed coach hayes insulted us again he set down a small wooden case it had a big lock on it in the middle of the room opened it and took out mumbo jumbo the thing looked twice as ugly as before scowling with those big bulging lips and that upright slit for a navel but we knew the routine and walked around it twice and put a hand on the statues head i still felt stupid then we went out and won fortytwo to seven that seven wouldnt have happened except that again coach hayes made us let them score a touchdown and again that spooky thing happened coach hayes let me play in the second quarter i got the ball and looked for an opening there was joey far down the field ready to catch it and there was joey twenty yards in front of where i saw him trying to get away from a west high player my mouth hung open my hands felt numb i couldnt breathe at once something snapped inside me and the next thing i knew id thrown the ball joey raced from where hed been trying to dodge the west high player he ran toward the other joey who was in the open the two joeys came together and of course he caught the ball our fans went nuts screaming cheering joey crossed the goal line and jumped up and down even halfway down the field despite the noise i heard him whoop our guys were slapping me on the ass i tried to look as excited as they were the next time i walked to our bench coach hayes said nice pass we studied each other for a second i couldnt tell if he knew how startled id been out there and why well joeys the one who caught it i said thats right team spirit danny everybodys in this together all the same nice pass beside him close its lock shut was the box we played eight games that season sometimes i had nightmares about them double images of joey or other players the images coming together i felt as if everything happened twice as if i could see what was going to happen before it did impossible but thats how it seemed one night i scared my mom and dad when i woke up screaming i didnt tell them what the nightmare was about i didnt talk to joey about it either after that first time id tried to i sensed that he didnt want to listen were winners jesus it feels good he said and the scores were always lopsided we always let the other team score a few points when we were way in front except one time the sixth game the one against central high coach hayes didnt call us names that night before the game in the locker room he sat in a corner watching us put on our uniforms and the guys started glancing at each other nervous sensing something was wrong its tonight a kid from last year said his voice tense i didnt understand coach hayes stood up get out there and give it your best joey looked surprised but what about he turned to the cabinet at the end of the locker room mumbo time to go coach hayes sounded gruff do what youre told theyre waiting but whats the matter with you joey dont you want to play tonight joeys face turned an angry red his jaw stood out with a final look at the cabinet he stalked from the locker room it could be youve already guessed we didnt just lose that night they trounced us hell we never scored a point oh we played hard after all the training wed been through we knew what we were doing but the other team played harder and it was the only game when i wasnt spooked when i didnt see two images of joey or what would happen before it actually did the aftergame dance was a flop and joey was mad as hell walking home with me he kept slamming his fists together its coach hayess fault he changed the routine he got us used to him making us pissed at him before the game calling us names and all that shit we werent prepared we werent worked up enough to go out there and win i tried to calm him down hey its just one loss were still the winning team in the league he spun so fast he scared me he didnt even bring out that dumbass statue he wanted us to look like fools out there he wanted us to lose i cant believe that maybe you like being a loser i dont he surged ahead of me when i reached the corner where we always talked for a bit before splitting up he was already heading down his street joey i wasnt sure what i wanted to say to him it didnt matter he didnt shout back and maybe youve guessed the rest of it too the next game everything was back to normal or abnormal depending on how you look at it coach hayes cussed us out before the game he set mumbo jumbo in the middle of the locker room why didnt you do it the last time joey demanded we couldve won you think so coach hayes squinted maybe youd have won then again maybe not you know we couldve you wanted us to joey it seems to me youve got things turned around youre supposed to get mad at the other team not me im on your side remember not last time you werent coach hayes stood awfully straight then his eyes blazing ill forget you said that listen ill explain this only once last time i broke the routine to make a point it doesnt matter what tricks i use in the locker room to prepare you for a game what counts is how you play and last time you guys didnt give your best its your fault you didnt win not mine you got that joey glared besides its good for you to lose once in a while bullshit dont try my patience its good for you to lose because it makes you try harder next time it makes you hungrier it makes you appreciate how sweet it is to be a winner dont say another word believe me if you want to play tonight dont say another word we walked around mumbo jumbo touched him and started the game of course i saw things again and of course we won finally letting the other team score one more week the final game and after touching mumbo jumbo we won that too city highs ninth winning season yet another gleaming trophy stood in the glass case in the lobby near the principals office a lot had happened my parents couldnt get over my bs and as they raised my allowance they let me borrow the family car more often rebecca henderson and i started going steady and joey and i continued drifting apart he was obsessed with being a star with having attention directed at him all the time so when the football season was over he couldnt get used to being treated the same as everybody else he tried out for the basketball team mr emery the science teacher coached it but he didnt make the squad so what he said but you could tell how disappointed he was they lose more games than they win who wants to be a loser he hated how everybody crowded around the new student council president he finally decided to try out for the drama club it figured i thought being on stage everybody looking at you and he made it he didnt get the starring role in the big production they always put on in december but he did have a halfdecent part he had to fake a german accent and play a maniac doctor called einstein in a murder comedy called arsenic and old lace i took rebecca to it and i have to say joey did okay not great but pretty good i mean at least he made me laugh at the jokes and i hoped that now hed be satisfied although i heard later how he was always grumbling in rehearsals about not being on stage enough and wanting more lines ill skip to all the trouble the following year our last one at city high our grades had put joey and me on the junior honor role he and i had stayed in shape all summer rebecca and i were spending even more time together maybe she was the reason i tried out for the football team again even though i hated the prospect of seeing that ugly statue again not to mention getting spooked seeing that other stuff on the field but i knew we wouldnt have gotten together if i hadnt been a football player and i didnt want things to change between us so i tried out again and made the team joey did too and his reasons were obvious getting attention being a star coach hayes did everything the same i dragged myself home after practice each day i heard the same old speeches about grades and diet i listened to him cuss us out before the starting game but he didnt make me mad anymore and watched him bring out mumbo jumbo our mascot he explained swearing us to secrecy the same routine but that squat brown ugly thing still made me feel creepy and on the field i saw the double images again and felt the chill creep up my spine if it hadnt been for rebecca cheering on the sideline id have but i didnt and because of that sometimes i think i might have caused what happened partly anyhow we won of course in fact it seemed too easy maybe that was why the next game coach hayes didnt cuss us out and didnt show us mumbo jumbo as soon as i noticed he was changing the pattern i said to myself its tonight only then realizing id heard the same thing last year from a kid whod been on the team the year before that the kid had graduated now and i suddenly realized that next year after my own graduation some other kid would repeat what id just said and i wondered how many others had said it before me no joey shouted furious one more word and youre benched coach hayes shouted back joey shut up but leaving the locker room i heard him mutter god damn him ill show him we dont need that frigging statue well win anyhow but we didnt and i didnt see the double images and joey went nearly out of his mind with rage he didnt go to the aftergame dance and he didnt say a word in saturdays game analysis or sundays practice all he did was keep glaring at coach hayes and me how did i help cause all the trouble i got curious is all i started thinking about patterns and patterns so what do you do when youre curious what i did i went to the school newspaper your school probably had one just like ours the student reporters were the same bunch who put together the yearbook and belonged to the creative writing club a gossip column a hit parade column a humor column plenty of announcements a report from the student council and a sports column all of this stuff was typed on stencils and run off on a mimeograph machine three pages on both sides orange sheets stapled together the city high examiner original huh it came out every monday morning mostly i think the school administration set aside money for it because of the weekly report from the principal school spirit and all that anyhow i decided to do some checking so i went to the newspaper office which was also the yearbook office a cluttered room on the third floor between the typing classroom and the janitors closet the place smelled sickishsweet like that white liquid goop you put on stencils to hide your typing mistakes the editor was a kid named albert webb and i guess hed seen too many newspaper movies he was always talking about the student council beat and the drama club beat and going to press all of us called him scoop and he took it as a compliment instead of a putdown he was sitting at a desk shoving his glasses back on his nose glancing back and forth from a handwritten sheet of paper to the stencil he was typing he had a pen behind his ear and a zit on his chin he turned as i walked in hows tricks scoop i just got the word on the nominations for homecoming queen nobodys supposed to know that till next weeks assembly no kidding he grinned maybe youll be interested rebecca hendersons one of them my my i grinned right back somebodys got good taste so listen have you got any old editions of the paper all the ones i edited plus a bunch from a couple editors before me how far back do they go he was proud fifteen years hey swell so where do you keep them in the morgue huh thats what newspapers call where they store old issues over there he pointed past some boxes to a rickety bookshelf in one corner you mind he spread his arms hey be my guest what do you want to look at them for id figured hed ask a couple of us on the football team have been thinking about a reunion game with former players an exhibition thing you know the old guys against the new yeah scoops eyes brightened he reached for his pencil now wait a minute were still just talking scoop if you put this in the paper and it doesnt happen youll look dumb you might even screw up our chances of convincing those guys right he nodded ill make you a deal you look at the former issues but if the plans for the game look definite let me know so i can break the story anything you say so i went to the corner and started sorting through the papers they smelled like a mouldy cellar i almost sneezed fifteen years of them how many weeks in a school year forty a lot of issues but looking through them wasnt as hard as youd think see the only issues i wanted were the ones in the football season and i only wanted the issues since coach hayes had come to the school eleven years ago it took me less than half an hour and this is what i learned the first two seasons when hayes had coached were awful worse than that disastrous the team never won a game a total zip but after that winning season after winning season with these facts in common the games we won had lopsided scores in our favor but the opposing team always managed to get on the board and every season we lost one game the first or the seventh or the third no consistent pattern there and the teams that beat us varied but the score was always zero for us because he didnt bring out mumbo jumbo i know thats crazy next thing youll figure i believe in horoscopes and fortune telling and all that crap but i swear it made me wonder and remember you werent on the field to see those creepy double images in my place youd have started to wonder too by then scoop was leaning over my shoulder squinting at the paper in front of me something the matter scoop just nosey yeah i see youre reading about the game the team lost three years ago i wasnt playing then i know but i was a cub reporter for the paper then i was there that night i remember thinking how weird that game was oh all those perfect games and then a real dog well nobody plays good every game hey thanks scoop anything i can do for you just let me know about the reunion game believe me youll be the first and thats what started things with some bad moves from a new kid on the team whose name was price see he wouldnt keep his grades up maybe he was just stupid he soon started acting that way coach hayes followed through on his threat no grades no play so price got kicked off the team but price had a father with a beer gut whod been a jock when he was in high school and when price started whining the father went whacko over what he said was an insult to his kid i dont care about his grades you think i want him to grow up with ulcers trying to be a brain footballs been good for me it gave me character and i know its good for my boys no major problem just your basic asshole father sticking up for his kid but coach hayes wouldnt budge and thats when price broke the rule you might remember reading about it back then and im not talking about the high school paper the local courier then the major paper in the state then father of high school football player accuses team of devil worship well you can imagine there wasnt any stopping it after that the city council wanted to know what the hell was going on the school board demanded an explanation the principal got angry phone calls my father put down the courier and frowned at me is this story about the statue true mumbo jumbo its not like price says its just a mascot but you touch it before you go out to play hey its nothing its only sort of for good luck my father frowned harder the other guys on the team got the same bit from their parents joey told me his father was so upset he wanted joey to quit are you going to i asked are you kidding christ no the team means too much to me or winning does i thought by then the week was over friday night had come around another game one of the firstaid guys came down to the locker room excited the bleachers are packed a record crowd sure all the publicity everybody wanted to see the team with the voodoo statue at first i thought coach hayes would leave it in the cabinet because of the controversy but as soon as he started insulting us i knew he didnt intend to break the routine looking back to that night i wonder if he guessed that he wouldnt have many more chances to bring it out he meant to take advantage of every one of them so he went to the cabinet i held my breath as he unlocked it the publicity made me selfconscious certainly all the talk about devil worship made me nervous about the double images id seen i watched as he opened the door his throat made a funny sound and when he stepped to the side i understood why where is it joey blurted several players gasped wheres mumbo jumbo joeys cleats scraped on the concrete floor as he stalked to the empty cabinet what happened to coach hayes looked stunned all at once his neck bulged harcourt his lips curled he made the principals name sound like a curse the school board must have told him but the cabinet was locked someone said the janitor could have opened it for him coach hayes stomped across the room toward the door and suddenly stopped as if hed realized something weve got a game to play i cant chase after him while turning he stared at us get out there and show them ill find the statue you can bet on that so we went out and maybe because wed been spooked the other team killed us we couldnt do anything right fumbles interceptions major penalties it must have been the worst game any team from city high ever played the fans started hissing booing a man shouted devil worship my ass these guys dont need a voodoo statue they need a miracle the more we screwed up the more we lost confidence and screwed up worse i saw rebecca wiping tears from her eyes and felt so humiliated i couldnt wait for the game to end so i could hide in the locker room coach hayes kept scurrying around talking to the principal and anybody else he suspected gesturing angrily they shook their heads no by the end of the game he still hadnt found the statue we sat in the locker room bitter silent when somebody knocked on the door i was closest open it coach hayes said so i did and stared at mumbo jumbo on the floor there wasnt anyone in the hall sure we heard rumors but we could never prove that the other team had taken it we even heard that stealing the statue had been the rival coachs idea a practical joke on his good old friend coach hayes scoop put all this in the school newspaper monday morning dont ask me how he found out he must have been a better reporter than any of us gave him credit for he even had a drawing of the statue so accurate that whoever had stolen it must have shown it to him or maybe scoop was the one who stole it whoever i feel partly responsible for the story he wrote i must have made him curious when i went to see him and asked to look at the former issues of the paper maybe he checked and found out id handed him a line about a reunion game for whatever reason he seems to have gone through the same issues i did because he came up with the same pattern id noticed two losing seasons then all of a sudden an unbroken string of winners because of mumbo jumbo he didnt come right out and link the statue with the teams success but you could tell he was trying to raise the issue in every winning season wed lost only one game and our score was always zero in our winning games however wed always had a lopsided spread in our favor but the other team had always somehow managed to gain a few points coincidence scoop asked or was there a better explanation for evidence he quoted from an interview hed had with price he didnt bother mentioning that he had no witness for what had happened in the locker room in the years when price wasnt on the team his whole story was like that making guesses seem like facts then he talked about fridays game and how in the years since coach hayes had been showing the statue this was the first time wed lost two games in one season perhaps because somebody stole the statue friday night scoop repeated the rumor that the rival team had been responsible for the theft wed probably never know the truth he said hed already described the few tiny holes in the statue the size of a pin one of them over the statues heart now several paragraphs later he ended the story by mourning the rival coach whod died from a heart attack on his way home from the game i wanted to get my hands on scoop and strangle the little shit all everybody in the lunch room talked about was how creepy it would be if the statue had really caused that coachs death if someone had stuck a pin in mumbo jumbos chest i dont know if coach hayes wanted to strangle scoop but for sure he wanted scoop expelled every kid at school soon heard about the argument coach hayes had in the principals office his shouts booming down the hall irresponsible libelous scoop was smart enough to stay home sick all week by next fridays game though scoop was the least of our problems the churches in town got worked up over mumbo jumbo i read in the local paper how the school had received at least a dozen letters from local ministers priests and rabbis one of the letters was quoted superstition unwholesome atmosphere satanism counterproductive to education my parents were so upset that they didnt want me to play in the game that night i told them i couldnt let the other guys down and as far as education was concerned what about the bs and as id been bringing home if anything the team had been good for me but this superstition crap was beginning to get to me maybe because i still felt bothered by the weird things id been seeing on the field things that seemed to happen before they happened could the statue really or was joey right and i was only caught up in the speed and excitement of the game enough already i thought mumbo jumbo that describes it all right its a lot of bullshit i had no way to know of course that this would be the last time coach hayes was allowed to bring out the statue i did know this i was sick of touching that creepy thing and if i needed it to make me a good football player i didnt belong in the game so after we dressed in the locker room and coach hayes insulted us and brought out the statue i didnt touch it as the other guys did when we went out to play my right arm still aches when the temperature drops below freezing the cast stayed on for almost three months i hadnt been on the field more than thirty seconds my first play of the game i got the ball and pulled my arm back to throw but i couldnt find an opening and i never saw the four guys who hit me all together at once really plowing into me knocking my wind out taking me down my arm cocked behind my shoulder all that weight on it i fainted but not before i heard the cracks saturday morning joey came to visit me in the hospital hed scored three touchdowns he said through a swirl of pain i tried to seem excited for him did we win i asked does the pope live in italy his grin dissolved about your arm he said he was really sorry i told him thanks he fidgeted how long are they going to keep you here till tomorrow afternoon well look ill visit you at home i nodded feeling sleepy from the painkiller a nurse had given me rebecca came in and joey left he and i drifted farther apart after that he had the team and i had my broken arm after the football season he got a big role in a murder mystery the drama club put on ten little indians everybody said he was wonderful in it i have to admit he was and me i guess i let things slide i couldnt take notes or do class assignments with my writing arm in a cast rebecca helped as much as she could but she had to do her own work too i started getting cs again i also got back in the habit of going down to the chicken nest with rebecca this time instead of joey those cherry cokes and fries with ketchup can really put weight on you especially if youre not exercising the city newspaper reported on the meeting between the school board and coach hayes they asked him to explain he found the statue at a rummage sale he said its owner claimed it was a fertility symbol that the mayans or the polynesians or whoever the name of the tribe kept changing had used in secret rituals coach hayes said he hadnt believed that not when its price was fifteen dollars but hed been looking for a gimmick he said something to work up team spirit especially after two horrible seasons a kind of mascot if the team believed the statue brought them good luck if the statue gave them confidence so what no harm was done besides he said he sometimes didnt bring the statue out to teach the players to depend on themselves the team had lost on those occasions true but as a consequence theyd tried harder next time there was nothing mysterious about it a dramatic gimmick thats all the point was it had worked the team had been winning championships ever since school spirit had never been better what about the statues name a school board member asked that came later in the third winning season one of the players made a joke i forget what it was something about good luck and all that mumbo jumbo the phrase sort of stuck the school board heard him out they held up the stacks of letters from angry parents and clergy their decision was final to show that they were willing to compromise they let him put the statue in the glass case with the trophies the team had won in the schools front lobby the rest of the season was brutal we lost every game sitting with rebecca on the sidelines trying to show enthusiasm for the team i felt terrible for joey you could see how depressed he was not being a winner west high won the championship monday the big news was that over the weekend somebody had smashed the glass in the trophy case and stolen mumbo jumbo nobody knew who had it although all of us suspected coach hayes he resigned that spring im told he teaches now in upstate new york i think about him often joeys grades were good enough that yale accepted him on a scholarship with my cs i wont even tell you what college accepted me i didnt go anyhow rebecca got pregnant that summer in those days abortions werent easy to arrange im not sure id have wanted her to have one anyhow the child a daughter breaks my heart with love every time i look at her rebecca and i got married that halloween both sets of parents were good about it we couldnt have made a go without their help we have three children now two girls and a boy its tough to pay the rent and feed and dress and give them everything we want to both rebecca and i have jobs shes a secretary at our high school i work at the chemical plant in town and joey you know him as joseph footwork summers he played receiver for yale and was picked up by the nfl you saw him play twice in the superbowl for sure you saw him in plenty of beer commercials the one where he beats up five motorcycle guys then walks to the bar and demands a beer is famous what kind the bartender asks what those guys were drinking and joey says that stuffs for losers when i say i want a beer i mean the best and you know what brand he means the commercial got him into the movies i saw dead heat last week and loved it the action was great his acting gets better and better but a part of me ill try to explain three years ago joey came back to town to see his folks imagine how surprised i was when he called me up i mean he hadnt exactly been keeping in touch he asked me over to his parents house for a beer he really drinks the brand he advertises and while i was there he took me up to his old bedroom a lot of good memories he gestured toward his battered dresser i was so busy looking at him hell hes a movie star after all that i didnt know what he meant at first then i really looked and there it was in his open suitcase mumbo jumbo as ugly and shitty and creepy as ever i felt spooked the way id used to and abruptly realized no you dont mean youre the one who stole it he just grinned but i thought it was coach hayes i thought he shook his head no me my stomach felt hollow i dont remember what we talked about after that to tell you the truth the conversation was kind of awkward i finished my beer and went home and joey returned to hollywood but this is what i think the other night my son and i were watching a movie on television david copperfield i never watch that kind of stuff but my son had a book report due and he hadnt read the book so he was cheating sort of watching the movie and i was helping him at the end after david copperfield becomes a success and all his friends have turned out losers theres a part in this movie where you hear what hes thinking it isnt enough to have the luck he says or the talent youve got to have the character maybe so but i keep thinking about mumbo jumbo and how when i didnt touch the statue i got my arm broken in the game that was a turning point if id stayed on the team and kept my grades up could i have gone to yale like joey could i have been a winner too i keep thinking about coach hayes and his winning streak was that streak caused by the statue i cant believe it but i remember joey the movie star pointing at the statue he stole from the glass case in the schools front lobby in his senior year and everything kept getting better for him after that then i think about myself i love my kids and my wife but i felt so tired tonight when i got home from work the bills my son needs braces on his teeth and maybe joey understood maybe david copperfield was wrong maybe it doesnt take talent or character maybe all it takes is mumbo jumbo the road to damascus in my introduction to this collection i told you about philip klass and the influence he had on my fiction i also mentioned a second writer who made a difference in fact if not for him i would never have become a writer at all stirling silliphant a little background earlier i explained that my father died in world war ii and that my mother unable to work and simultaneously look after me put me in an orphanage when i was around four part of me wonders if the woman who finally came to get me was in fact the woman who had left me but lets assume she was still unable to watch me at home while earning a living she arranged for me to live on a mennonite farm there my confusion about where i belonged intensified seasons passed every friday i was put on a bus into town where my mother waited for me at the terminal every sunday i got on a bus to go back to the farm when a child boarding on a different farm was killed by a car as he walked along the highway my mother decided to keep me with her by now she had remarried to give me a father she later said but i was desperate for the affection of a male authority figure and her new husband wasnt prepared to fill the role he looked visibly uncomfortable if i called him father in the years that followed i thought of him as a stranger the marriage itself wasnt a success my mother and my stepfather argued so much that my memories of my youth are mostly about fear many nights the arguments were so loud that i worried about my safety imitating scenes in movies i stuffed pillows under my blankets in my bed making them look as if i slept there then i crawled under my bed and dozed fitfully in what i hoped was a protected space we lived above a bar and later a hamburger joint there wasnt enough money for a television or a phone for entertainment on a saturday night i listened to gunsmoke and tarzan on the radio while watching drunks fight in the alley below me on one occasion my mother went out to use the pay phone in the alley only to have a stray bullet shatter the booths glass but as i grew older i discovered movies in those days theatres were palaces and audiences didnt jabber endlessly to earn the money to see a film i would set up pins in bowling alleys or if i couldnt get the work i would stand at a crowded bus stop and pretend that id lost my bus fare someone was always kind enough to give me the fifteen cents which i immediately spent getting into a movie theater and there i sat hour after hour in the silvery darkness watching film after film they had double features in those days sometimes staying to see the movies twice it didnt matter to me what kind of movies they were although i confess i wasnt crazy about the ones with a lot of kissing what did matter was that i was distracted from reality in retrospect it seems logical that i would have wanted to become a storyteller to distract others from their reality but at the time i was too confused to know what i wanted i ran with a street gang i treated grade school as an interruption of my spare time high school was a little better our finances improved we moved to a small house in the suburbs the family arguments were less still by the time i entered grade eleven i was going nowhere that fall of with little interest in anything except pool halls and eight hours of television a day i found myself like a minorleague saul on his way to damascus struck by a bolt of light that changed my life even now i can be specific about the time and date pm friday october the light was from my television and the first episode of a series called route the show was about two young men who in jack kerouac fashion drove a corvette across the united states in search of america and themselves one of them was tod a rich kid from new york whose father had recently died leaving such massive debts that when the creditors finished the only thing left was tods sports car his partner buz was a tough street kid from hells kitchen who had worked for tods father on the new york docks and had become friends with tod because route was then the principal highway across the united states its name was perfect as a title for the series and because the series was as much about america as it was about tod and buz the producers decided to film each episode on the locations that the characters were supposed to be visiting although many were far from route boston philadelphia biloxi santa fe oregon city the first episode black november involved a small southern town haunted by a grisly secret from years earlier the ax murder of a german prisonerofwar and the minister who tried to protect him id never seen a story like it not merely the mystery suspense and action a scene involving a power saw remains vivid in my mind but the appeal of the characters and the reality conveyed by the writing i discovered that i was waiting eagerly for friday night to come around again and the next friday night and the next there was something about the way the characters talked the emotions they expressed the values they believed in that affected me deeply and woke my mind for the first time in my life i began to study credits who on earth was responsible for this wonderful experience one episode would be about shrimp boats in the gulf of mexico with a plot that paralleled shakespeares the taming of the shrew another would be about street gangs in los angeles with poetical dialogue amid the squalor still another would be about cropdusting in phoenix with tragic overtones of greek myth back then i didnt know anything about sartre or existentialism or the philosophy of the beat generation but even if i couldnt put a name to what i was experiencing it made me feel emotionally and intellectually alive martin milner and george maharis were the stars still despite their considerable acting talents i felt uncharacteristically attracted to the minds behind the scenes to the creative forces that invented the dramatic situations and put the words sometimes spellbinding speeches that lasted five minutes in the actors mouths herbert b leonard was the producer sam manners was the production chief okay but still then i realized that one other name appeared prominently in the credits of almost every episode stirling silliphant writer my my a new thought that gradeeleven student who formerly had no ambition whatsoever managed to find the address of screen gems the company listed at the end of the credits unable to type i sent a handwritten letter scrawled would be more accurate to stirling silliphant and asked how i could learn to do the wonderful things that he was doing one week later i still recall my amazement i received an answer from him two densely typed pages that began with an apology for having taken so long to get back to me hed have written to me sooner he explained but when my letter arrived hed been out at sea in a boat he revealed no secrets and indeed refused to look at anything i might write partly because of my inexperience and partly for legal reasons but he did tell me this the way to be a writer is to write and write and write and millions of words later im still writing if not for stirling i would never have gone on to college i wouldnt have gotten a ba let alone an ma and a phd wouldnt have met philip klass wouldnt have written first blood one of my greatest thrills came on a summer afternoon in when stirling phoned to thank me for having sent him a copy of first blood and to say that hed liked it that he was gratified to have been an inspiration if i were a cat he said id purr we stayed in touch but never met until the summer of when he suggested that i come to los angeles and spend the fourth of july weekend with him twentyfive years after i first experienced his work i finally got to meet him a stocky broadsmiled gentlefeatured man with short gray hair and generous good nature it was like coming facetoface with the father id never known finally in a closing of the circle he took my novel the brotherhood of the rose to nbc and suggested that they do a miniseries of it in when the series was broadcast after the superbowl the most coveted spot in television i was struck by awe when i watched the credits and again saw the magical words executive producer stirling silliphant shortly afterward stirling told me that in one of his former lives he had lived in thailand and that now he was going home he had a beverly hills garage sale moved to bangkok and had the luxury of writing whatever he wanted with no deadlines except his own we often talked about my coming to visit him but our various schedules kept conflicting my only contact with him was via frequent faxes regret is a terrible emotion at a little after am on the morning of april as with the debut of route i can be very specific about this moment i was eating breakfast listening to the news on national public radio when the announcer informed me academyawardwinning screenwriter stirling silliphant died this morning from prostate cancer he was my cheerios stuck in my throat it was two days after my birthday the man i thought of as my father was gone stirling was as determined a writer as i ever encountered he once had two wisdom teeth extracted in the morning and was hitting the typewriter keys by noon he worked almost every day and was religious about meeting deadlines legendary for being prolific and fast he was hesitant to show a complete list of his credits because he was certain that no one would believe that anyone could write that much ive never been prolific or fast but at his best his actionfilled scripts were inventive compelling and thoughtful his oscarwinning screenplay for in the heat of the night for example not to mention his television work for nakedcity i have tried to follow his example thus my first contact with hollywood was positive the troubled street kid who became addicted to movies as an antidote to the darkness of his life found that the dreams those movies inspired could with hard work be fulfilled but many whove been exposed to hollywood have had the opposite experience too often writers are treated with indifference at best and malicious contempt at worst theyre stonewalled misled or blatantly lied to some producers cant imagine showing courtesy to anyone they dont have to impress their inability to relate to others borders on the sociopathic that never happened to me on any of the projects based on my works but i certainly came across it in other contexts enough so that i eventually decided to write about the bottom part of dreams in hollywood this is the final story in my trilogy about the paradoxes of ambition and the dark side of success we began with a paper boy we moved on to a teenaged football player we now meet an adult who tells us about the heartbreak of the movie business i havent updated the financial figures in this story after the million price tag of titanic im amazed to look back at how comparatively cheaply a film once could get made the following story was a finalist for the world fantasy award as the best novella of dead image you know who he looks like dont you watching the scene i just shrugged really the resemblance is amazing jill said mmm we were in the studios screening room watching yesterdays dailies the director and i use the term loosely had been having troubles with the leading actor if actings what you could say that goodlooking bozo does hell he used to be a male model he doesnt act he poses it wasnt enough that he wanted eight million bucks and fifteen upfront points to do the picture it wasnt enough that he changed my scene so the dialogue sounded as if a moron had written it no he had to keep dashing to his trailer snorting more coke for creative inspiration he said then sniffling after every sentence in the big speech of the picture if this scene didnt work the audience wouldnt understand his motivation for leaving his girlfriend after she became a famous singer and believe me nothings more unforgiving than an audience when it gets confused the wordofmouth would kill us come on you big dumb sonofabitch i muttered you make me want to blow my nose just listening to you the director had wasted three days doing retakes and the dailies from yesterday were worse than the ones from the two days before sliding down in my seat i groaned the directors idea of fixing the scene was to have a team of editors work all night patching in reaction shots from the girl and the guys in the countrywestern band she sang with every time mr wonderful sniffled cut we saw somebody staring at him as if he was jesus jesus i moaned to jill those cuts distract from the speech its supposed to be one continuous shot of course this is rough you understand the director told everyone from where he sat in the back row of seats near the door to make a quick getaway if he had any sense we havent worked on the dubbing yet that sniffling wont be on the release print i hope to god not i muttered really just like him jill said next to me huh who i turned to her what are you talking about the guitar player the kid behind the girl havent you been listening she kept her voice low enough that no one else could have heard her thats why i blinked when the studio vp asked from somewhere in the dark to my left whos the kid behind the girl jill whispered watch the way he holds that beer can there the one with the beer can the vp said except for the lummox sniffling on the screen the room was silent the vp spoke louder i said whos the i dont know behind us the director cleared his throat he must have told you his name i never met him how the hell if you all the concert scenes were shot by the secondunit director what about these reaction shots same thing the kid had only a few lines he did his bit and went home hey i had my hands full making mr nose candy feel like the genius he thinks he is theres the kid again jill said i was beginning to see what she meant now the kid looked a lot like james deacon the vp said yeah thats who he reminds me of mr muscle bound had managed to struggle through the speech id recognized only half of it partly because the lines hed added made no sense mostly because he mumbled at the end we had a closeup of his girlfriend the singer crying shed been so heartless clawing her way to the top that shed lost the one thing that mattered the man whod loved her in theory the audience was supposed to feel so sorry for her that they were crying along with her if you ask me theyd be in tears all right from rolling around in the aisles with laughter on the screen mr beefcake turned and trudged from the rehearsal hall as if his underwear was too tight he had his eyes narrowed manfully ready to pick up his oscar the screen went dark the director cleared his throat again he sounded nervous well the room was silent the director sounded more nervous uh so what do you think the lights came on but they werent the reason i suddenly had a headache everybody turned toward the vp waiting for the word of god what i think the vp said he nodded wisely is we need a rewrite this fucking town i gobbled dygel as jill drove us home the santa monica freeway was jammed as usual we had the top down on the porsche so we got a really good dose of car exhaust they wont blame the star after all he charged eight million bucks and next time hell charge more if the studio pisses him off i winced from heartburn theyd never think to blame the director hes a goddamned artist as he keeps telling everybody so who does that leave the underpaid schmuck who wrote what everybody changed take it easy youll raise your blood pressure jill turned off the freeway raise my blood pressure raise my its already raised any higher ill have a stroke i dont know what youre so surprised about this happens on every picture weve been out here fifteen years you ought to be used to how they treat writers whipping boys thats the only reason they keep us around every director producer and actor in town is a better writer just ask them theyll tell you the only problem is they cant read let alone write and they just dont seem to have the time to sit down and put all their wonderful thoughts on paper but thats how the system works hon theres no way to win so either you love this business or leave it i scowled about the only way to make a decent picture is to direct as well as write it hell id star in it too if i wasnt losing my hair from pulling it out and twenty million bucks jill said yeah that would help too so i wouldnt have to grovel in front of those studio heads but hell if i had twenty million bucks to finance a picture what would i need to be a writer for you know youd keep writing even if you had a hundred million youre right i must be nuts wes crane jill said i sat at the word processor grumbling as i did the rewrite the studio vp had decided that mr biceps wasnt going to leave his girlfriend instead his girlfriend was going to realize how much shed been ignoring him and give up her career for love theres an audience out there dying for a movie against womens lib he said it was all i could do not to throw up wes who i kept typing on the keyboard crane the kid in the dailies i turned to where she stood at the open door to my study i must have blinked stupidly because she got that patient look on her face the one who looks like james deacon i got curious so for the hell of it i phoned the casting office at the studio all right so you found out his name so whats the point just a hunch i still dont get it your script about mercenary soldiers i shrugged it still needs a polish anyway its strictly on spec when the studio decides weve ruined this picture sufficiently i have to do that napoleon miniseries for abc you wrote that script on spec because you believed in the story right its something you really wanted to do the subjects important soldiers of fortune employed by the cia unofficially america s involved in a lot of foreign wars then fuck the miniseries i think the kid would be wonderful as the young mercenary who gets so disgusted that he finally shoots the dictator who hired him i stared you know thats not a bad idea when we were driving home didnt you tell me the only way to film something decent was to direct the thing yourself and star in it i raised my eyebrows yeah thats me but i was just making a joke well lover i know you couldnt direct any worse than that asshole who ruined your stuff this morning ive got the hots for you but youre not good looking enough for even a character part that kid is though and the man who discovers him can write his own ticket if he puts the package together properly youve had fifteen years of learning the politics but if i back out on abc half the writers in town wanted that assignment theyll sign someone else in an hour but they offered a lot of dough you just made fourhundredthousand on a story the studio ruined take a flyer why dont you this ones for your selfrespect i think i love you i said when youre sure come down to the bedroom she turned and left i watched the doorway for a while then swung my chair to face the picture window and thought about mercenaries we live on a bluff in pacific palisades you can see the ocean forever but what i saw in my head was the kid in the dailies how he held that beer can just like james deacon deacon if youre a film buff you know who im talking about the farm boy from oklahoma back in the middle fifties at the start a juvenile delinquent almost went to reform school for stealing cars but a teacher managed to get him interested in highschool plays deacon never graduated instead he borrowed a hundred bucks and hitchhiked to new york where he camped on lee strasbergs doorstep till strasberg agreed to give him a chance in the actors studio a lot of brilliant actors came out of that school brando newman clift gazzara mcqueen but some say deacon was the best of the lot a bit part on broadway a talent scout in the audience a screen test the rest as they say is history the part of the younger brother in the prodigal son the juvenile delinquent in revolt on thirtysecond street then the wildcat oil driller in birthright where he upstaged half a dozen major stars there was something about him intensity sure you could sense the pressure building in him swelling inside his skin wanting out and authenticity god knows you could tell how much he believed the parts he was playing he actually was those characters but mostly the camera simply loved him thats the way they explain a star out here some good looking guys come across as plain on the screen and some plain ones look gorgeous its a question of taking a threedimensional face and making it onedimensional for the screen whats distinctive in real life gets muted and vice versa theres no way to figure if the camera will like you it either does or doesnt and it sure liked deacon whats fascinating is that he also looked as gorgeous in real life a walking movie or so they say i never met him of course hes before my time but the word in the industry was that he couldnt do anything wrong thats even before his three movies were released a guaranteed superstar and then cars if you think of his life as a tragedy cars were the flaw he loved to race them im told his body had practically disintegrated when he hit a pickup truck at a hundred miles an hour on his way to drive his modified corvette at a race track in northern california maybe you heard the legend that he didnt die but was so disfigured that hes in a rest home somewhere to spare his fans the disgust of how he looks but dont believe it oh he died all right just like a shooting star he exploded and the irony is that since his three pictures hadnt been released by then he never knew how famous he became but what i was thinking if a star could shine once maybe it could shine again im looking for wes is he around id phoned the screen actors guild to get his address for the sake of privacy sometimes all the guild gives out is the name and phone number of an actors agent and what i had in mind was so tentative that i didnt want the hassle of dealing with an agent right then but i got lucky the guild gave me an address the place was in a canyon north of the valley a dusty winding road led up to an unpainted house with a sundeck supported on stilts and a halfdozen junky cars in front along with a dune buggy and a motorcycle seeing those clunkers i felt selfconscious in the porsche two guys and a girl were sitting on the steps the girl had a butch cut the guys had hair to their shoulders they wore sandals shorts and thats all the girls breasts were as brown as nutmeg the three of them stared right through me their eyes looked big and strange i opened my mouth to repeat the question but the girl beat me to it wes she sounded groggy i think out back hey thanks but i made sure i had the porsches keys in my pocket before i plodded through sand past sagebrush around the house the back had a sundeck too and as i turned the corner i saw him up there leaning against the rail squinting toward the foothills i tried not to show surprise in person wes looked even more like deacon lean intense hypnotic around twentyone the same age deacon had been when he made his first movie sensitive brooding as if he suffered secret tortures but toughlooking too projecting the image of someone whod been emotionally savaged once and wouldnt allow it to happen again he wasnt tall and he sure was thin but he radiated such energy that he made you think he was big and powerful even his clothes reminded me of deacon boots faded jeans a denim shirt with the sleeves rolled up and a pack of cigarettes tucked in the fold and a battered stetson with the rim curved up to meet the sides actors love to pose of course im convinced that they dont even go to the bathroom without giving an imaginary camera their best profile and the way this kid leaned against the rail staring moodily toward the foothills was certainly photogenic but i had the feeling it wasnt a pose his clothes didnt seem a deliberate imitation of deacon he wore them too comfortably and his brooding silhouette didnt seem calculated either ive been in the business long enough to know he dressed and leaned that way naturally thats the word they use for a winner in this business he was a natural wes crane i asked he turned and looked down at me at last he grinned why not he had a vague countryboy accent like deacon im david sloane he nodded then you recognize the name he shrugged sounds awful familiar im a screenwriter i did broken promises the picture you just finished working on i remember the name now on the script id like to talk to you about another script i held it up theres a part in it that i think might interest you so youre a producer too i shook my head no then why come to me even if i like the part it wont do us any good i thought about how to explain ill be honest its a big mistake as far as negotiating goes but im tired of bullshit cheers he raised a beer can to his lips i saw you in the dailies this morning i liked what i saw a lot what i want you to do is read this script and tell me if you want the part with your commitment and me as director id like to approach a studio for financing but thats the package you dont do it if i dont direct and i dont do it unless youre the star so what makes you think theyd accept me my wifes got a hunch he laughed hey im out of work anybody offers me a job i take it why should i care who directs who are you to me my heart sank he opened another beer can guess what though i dont like bullshit either his eyes looked mischievous sure what have i got to lose leave the script my number was on the front of it the next afternoon he called this script of yours ill tell you the same thing you said to me about my acting i liked it a lot it still needs a polish only where the guys best friend gets killed the hero wouldnt talk so much about what he feels the fact is he wouldnt say anything no tears no outburst this is a guy who holds himself in all you need is a closeup on his eyes that says it all he stares down at his buddy he picks up his m he turns toward the palace the audiencell start to cheer theyll know hes set to kick ass most times when an actor offers suggestions my stomach cramps they get so involved in their part they forget about the storys logic they want more lines they want to emphasize their role till everybody else in the picture looks weak now here was an actor who wanted his largest speech cut out he was thinking story not ego and he was right that speech had always bothered me id written it ten different ways and still hadnt figured out what was wrong till now the speech is out i said it wont take fifteen minutes to redo the scene and then ill go to the studio youre really not kidding me you think theres a chance i can get the part as much chance as i have to direct it remember the arrangement were a package both of us or none and you dont want me to sign some kind of promise its called a binder and youre right you dont have to sign a thing let me get this straight if they dont want you to direct but they offer me the part im supposed to turn them down because i promised you sounds crazy doesnt it the truth was even if i had his promise in writing the studios lawyers could have it nullified if wes claimed hed been misled this town wouldnt function if people kept their word yeah crazy wes said youve got a deal in the casting office at the studio i asked a thirtyish thinfaced woman behind a counter have you got any film on an actor named crane wes crane she looked at me strangely frowning she opened a filing cabinet and sorted through some folders she nodded relieved i knew that name was familiar sure weve got a screen test on him what who authorized it she studied a page doesnt say and i never found out and thats one of many things that bother me do you know whos seen the test oh sure we have to keep a record she studied another page but im the only one who looked at it you he came in one day to fill out some forms we got to kidding around its hard to describe theres something about him so i thought id take a look at his test and what can i say i recommended him for that bit part in broken promises if i want to see that test do you have to check with anybody she thought about it youre still on the payroll for broken promises arent you right and cranes in the movie it seems a legitimate request she checked a schedule use screening room four in thirty minutes ill send down a projectionist with the reel so i sat in the dark and watched the test and first felt the shiver that id soon know well when the reel was over i didnt move for quite a while the projectionist came out are you all right mr sloane i mean youre not sick or anything no thanks im what just thinking i took a deep breath and went back to the casting office theres been a mistake that wasnt cranes test the thinfaced woman shook her head theres no mistake but that was a scene from the prodigal son james deacons movie theres been a switch no that was wes crane its the scene he wanted to do the set department used something that looked like the hayloft in the original wes crane she said not deacon we stared and you liked it i asked well i thought he was ballsy to choose that scene and pull it off one wrong move hed have looked like an idiot yeah i liked it you want to help the kid along depends will it get me in trouble exactly the opposite youll earn brownie points how just phone the studio vp tell him i was down here asking to watch a screen test tell him you didnt let me because i didnt have authorization but i acted upset so now youve had second thoughts and youre calling him to make sure you did the right thing you dont want to lose your job so what will that accomplish hell get curious hell ask whose test it was just tell him the truth but use these words the kid who looks like james deacon i still dont see you will i grinned i called my agent and told him to plant an item in variety and hollywood reporter oscarwinning scribe david sloane currently prepping his first behindthelens chore on mercenaries toplining james deacon lookalike wes crane whats going on is somebody else representing you i dont know from chicken livers about mercenaries lou trust me whos the studio all in good time you sonofabitch if you expect me to work for you when somebody else is getting the commission believe me youll get your ten percent but if anybody calls tell them they have to talk to me youre not allowed to discuss the project discuss it how the hell can i discuss it when i dont know a thing about it there you see how easy itll be then i drove to a video store and bought a tape of the prodigal son i hadnt seen the movie in years that evening jill and i watched it fifteen times or at least a part of it that often every time the hayloft scene was over i rewound the tape to the start of the scene for gods sake what are you doing dont you want to see the whole movie its the same i stared in astonishment what do you mean the same have you been drinking the hayloft scene its the same as in wes cranes screen test well of course you told me the set department tried to imitate the original scene i dont mean the hayloft i tingled again see here in the prodigal son deacon does most of the scene sprawled on the floor of the loft he has the side of his face pressed against those bits of straw i can almost smell the dust and the chaff hes talking more to the floor than he is to his father behind him i see it so what are you getting at thats identical in wes cranes test one continuous shot with the camera at the floor crane has his cheek against the wood he sounds the same as deacon every movement every pause even that choking noise right here as if the characters about to start sobbing theyre identical but whats the mystery about it crane must have studied this section before he decided to use it in his test i rewound the tape no not again jill said the next afternoon the studio vp phoned im disappointed in you david dont tell me you didnt like the rewrite on broken promises the rewrite the oh yes the rewrite great david great theyre shooting it now of course you understand i had to make a few extra changes dont worry though i wont ask to share the writing credit with you he chuckled i chuckled right back well thats a relief what im calling about are the trades today since when have you become a director i was afraid of this im not allowed to talk about it i asked your agent he says he didnt handle the deal well yeah its something i set up on my own where walt really i cant talk about it those items in the trades surprised the hell out of me they might screw up the deal i havent finished the negotiations yet with this kid who looks like james deacon honestly ive said as much as i can walt ill tell you flat out i dont think its right for you to try to sneak him away from us im the one who discovered him remember i had a look at his screen test yesterday hes got the makings of a star i knew when hed screened that test right after the woman in the casting department phoned him to ask if i had a right to see the test one thing you can count on in this business everybodys so paranoid they want to know what everybody else is doing if they think a trend is developing theyll stampede to follow it walt im not exactly trying to sneak him away from you you dont have him under contract do you he ignored the question and whats this project called mercenaries whats that all about its a script i did on spec i got the idea when i heard about the ads at the back of soldier of fortune magazine soldier of david i thought we had a good working relationship sure thats what i thought too then why didnt you talk to me about this story hey were friends after all chances are you wouldnt have had to write it on spec i could have given you some development money and after youd finished mucking with it youd have turned it into a musical i thought well i guess i figured it wasnt for you since i wanted to direct and use an unknown in the lead another thing you can count on in this business tell a producer that a project isnt for him and hell feel so left out hell want to see it that doesnt mean hell buy it but at least hell have the satisfaction of knowing that he didnt miss out on a chance for a hit directing david youre a writer what do you know about directing id have to draw the line on that but using the kid as a lead i considered that yesterday after i saw his test like hell you did i thought the test only made you curious the items in the trades today are what gave you the idea you see what i mean i asked i figured you wouldnt like the package thats why i didnt take it to you well the problems hypothetical i just sent the head of our legal department out to see him were offering the kid a longterm option in other words you want to fix it so no one else can use him but youre not committing yourself to star him in a picture and youre paying him a fraction of what you think he might be worth hey ten thousand bucks isnt pickled herring not from his point of view so maybe well go to fifteen against a hundredandfiftythousand if we use him in a picture his agent wont go for it he doesnt have one that explained why the screen actors guild had given me wess home address and phone number instead of an agents i get it now i said youre doing all this just to spite me theres nothing personal in this david its business i tell you what show me the script maybe we can put a deal together but you wont accept me as a director hey with budgets as high as they are the only way i can justify our risk with an unknown actor is by paying him next to nothing if the pictures a hit hell screw us next time anyhow but i wont risk the money im saving by using an inexperienced director whod probably run the budget into the stratosphere i see this picture coming in at fifteen million tops but you havent even read the script its got several big action scenes explosions helicopters expensive special effects twentyfive million minimum thats just my point youre so close to the concept that you wouldnt want to compromise on the special effects youre not directing well as you said before its hypothetical ive taken the package to somebody else not if we put him under option david dont fight me on this remember were friends paramount phoned an hour later trade gossip travels fast theyd heard i was having troubles with my studio and wondered if we could take a meeting to discuss the project theyd been reading about i said id get back to them but now i had what i wanted i could truthfully say that paramount had been in touch with me i could play the studios off against each other walt phoned back that evening what did you do with the kid hide him in your closet couldnt find him huh the head of our legal department says the kid lives with a bunch of freaks way the hell out in the middle of nowhere the freaks dont communicate too well the kid isnt there and they dont know where he went im meeting him tomorrow where cant say walt paramount s been in touch wes met me at a taco stand he liked in burbank hed been racing his motorcycle in a meet and when he pulled up in his boots and jeans his tshirt and leather jacket i shivered from d√©j√† vu he looked exactly as deacon had looked in revolt on thirtysecond street did you win he grinned and raised his thumb yourself some interesting developments he barely had time to park his bike before two men in suits came over i wondered if they were cops but their suits were too expensive then i realized the studio id been followed from my house mr hepner would like you to look at this the blue suit told wes he set a document on the roadside table what is it an option for your services mr hepner feels that the figure will interest you wes shoved it over to me whats it mean i read it quickly the studio had raised the fee they were offering fifty thousand now against a quarter million i told him the truth in your position its a lot of cash i think that at this point you need an agent you know a good one my own but that might be too chummy so what do you think i should do the truth how much did you make last year fifty grands a serious offer is there a catch i nodded chances are youll be put in mercs and i dont direct wes squinted at me this would be the moment id always cherish youre willing to let me do it he asked i told you i cant hold you to our bargain in your place id be tempted its a good career move listen to him the gray suit said but do you want to direct i nodded until now all the moves had been predictable but wes himself was not most unknown actors would grab at the chance for stardom they wouldnt care what private agreements they ignored everything depended on whether wes had a character similar to deacon and no hard feelings if i go with the studio he asked i shrugged what we talked about was fantasy this is real he kept squinting at me all at once he turned to the suits and slid the option toward them tell mr hepner my friend here has to direct youre making a big mistake the blue suit said yeah well here today gone tomorrow tell mr hepner i trust my friend to make me look good i exhaled slowly the suits looked grim ill skip the month of negotiations there were times when i sensed that wes and i had both thrown away our careers the key was that walt had taken a stand and pride wouldnt let him budge but when i offered to direct for union scale and let the studio have the screenplay for the minimum the writers guild would allow and wes agreed to the actors guild minimum walt had a deal that he couldnt refuse greed budged him in our favor he bragged about how hed outmaneuvered us we didnt care i was making a picture i believed in and wes was on the verge of being a star i did my homework i brought the picture in for twelve million these days thats a bargain the rule of thumb says that you multiply the pictures cost by three to account for studio overhead bank interest promotion this and that and youve got the breakeven point so we were aiming for thirtysix million in ticket sales worldwide we did a hundredandtwentymillion now a lot of that went to the distributors the folks that sell you popcorn and a lot of that went into some mysterious black hole of theater owners who dont report all the tickets they sold and foreign chains that suddenly go bankrupt but after the sale to hbo and cbs after the income from tapes and discs and showings on airlines the studio had a solid forty million profit in the bank and that believe me qualifies as a hit we were golden the studio wanted another wes crane picture yesterday the reviews were glowing both wes and i were nominated for but didnt receive an oscar next time i told wes and now that we were hot we demanded fees that were large enough to compensate for the pennies wed been paid on the first one then the trouble started you remember that deacon never knew he was a star he died with three pictures in the can and a legacy that he never knew would make him immortal but what you probably dont know is that deacon became more difficult as he went from picture to picture the theory is that he sensed the power he was going to have and he couldnt handle it because he was making up for his troubled youth he was showing people that he wasnt the fuckup his foster parents and his teachers with one exception said he was but deacon was so intense and so insecure that he started reverting secretly he felt that he didnt deserve his predicted success so he did become a fuckup as predicted on his nexttolast picture he started showing up three hours late for the scenes he was supposed to be in he played expensive pranks on the set the worst of which was lacing the crews lunch with a laxative that shut down production for the rest of the day his insistence on racing cars forced the studio to pay exorbitant premiums to the insurance company that covered him during shooting on his last picture he was drunk more often than not swilling beer and tequila on the set just before he died in the car crash he looked twentytwo going on sixty most of his visuals had been completed just a few closeups remaining but since a good deal of birthright was shot on location in the texas oilfields his dialogue needed rerecording to eliminate background noises on the soundtrack a friend of his whod learned to imitate deacons voice was hired to dub several key speeches the audience loved the finished print but they didnt realize how much of the film depended on careful editing emphasizing other characters in scenes where deacon looked so wasted that his footage couldnt be used so naturally i wondered if wes crane looked like deacon and sounded like deacon dressed like deacon and had deacons style would he start to behave like deacon what would happen when i came to wes with a second project i wasnt the only one offering stories to him the scripts came pouring in i learned this from the trades i hadnt seen him since oscar night in march whenever i called his place either i didnt get an answer or a spacedout womans voice told me wes wasnt home in truth id expected him to have moved from that dingy house near the desert the gang that lived there reminded me of the manson clan but then i remembered that he hadnt come into big money yet the second project would be the gold mine and i wondered if he was going to stake the claim only for himself his motorcycle was parked outside our house when jill and i came back from a writers guild screening of a new clint eastwood movie this was at sunset with sailboats silhouetted against a crimson ocean wes was sitting on the steps that wound up through a rose garden to our house he held a beer can he was wearing jeans and a tshirt again and the white of that tshirt contrasted beautifully with his tan but his cheeks looked gaunter than when id last seen him our exchange had become a ritual did you win he grinned and raised a thumb yourself i grinned right back ive been trying to get in touch with you he shrugged well yeah ive been racing i needed some downtime all that publicity and jill how are you fine wes you the second goarounds the hardest i thought i understood trying for another hit but now i wonder stay for supper jill asked id like to but please do it wont be any trouble are you sure the chilis been cooking in the crackpot all day tortillas and salad wes nodded yeah my mom used to like making chili thats before my dad went away and she got to drinking jills eyebrows narrowed wes didnt notice staring at his beer can then she didnt do much cooking at all he said when she went to the hospital this was back in oklahoma well the cancer ate her up and the city put me in a foster home i guess thats when i started running wild brooding he drained his beer can and blinked at us as if remembering we were there a homecooked meal would go good its coming up jill said but she still looked bothered and i almost asked her what was wrong she went inside wes reached in a paper sack beneath a rose bush anyway buddy he handed me a beer can you want to make another movie the trades say youre much in demand i sat beside him stared at the ocean and popped the tab on the beer can yeah but arent we supposed to be a team you direct and write i act both of us or none he nudged my knee isnt that the bargain it is if you say so right now youve got the clout to do anything you want well what i want is a friend someone i trust to tell me when im fucking up those other guys theyll let you do anything if they think they can make a buck even if you ruin yourself ive learned my lesson believe me this time im doing things right in that case i said vaguely puzzled lets hear it ive been working on something we start with several givens the audience likes you in an action role but youve got to be rebellious antiestablishment and the issue has to be controversial what about a bodyguard hes young hes tough whos supposed to protect a famous movie actress someone who reminds us of marilyn monroe secretly hes in love with her but he cant bring himself to tell her and she dies from an overdose of sleeping pills the cops say its suicide the newspapers go along but the bodyguard cant believe she killed herself he discovers evidence that it was murder he gets pissed at the coverup from grief he investigates further a hit team nearly kills him now hes twice as pissed and what he learns is that the man who ordered the murder its an election year the actress was writing a tellitall about her famous lovers is the president of the united states i think he sipped his beer it would play in oklahoma and chicago and new york its a backlash about big government with a sympathetic hero he chuckled when do we start and thats how we made the deal on grievance i felt excited all evening but later after wed had a pleasant supper and wes had driven off on his motorcycle jill stuck a pin in my swollen optimism what he said about oklahoma about his father running away his mother becoming a drunk and dying from cancer about his going to a foster home i noticed it bothered you you bet youre so busy staring at your keyboard you dont keep up on the handouts about your star i put a bowl in the dishwasher so wes comes from indiana hes a foundling raised in an orphanage the background he gave you isnt his then whose jill stared at me my god not deacons so there it was like a hideous face popping out of a box to leer at me wess physical resemblance to deacon was accidental an act of fate that turned out to be a godsend for him but the rest the mannerisms the clothes the voice were truly deliberate i know what youre thinking im contradicting myself when i first met him i thought his style was too natural to be a conscious imitation and when i realized that his screen test was identical in every respect to deacons hayloft scene in the prodigal son i didnt believe that wes had callously reproduced the scene the screen test felt too natural to be an imitation it was a homage but now i knew better wes was imitating all right but chillingly what wes had done went beyond conventional imitation hed accomplished the ultimate goal of every method actor he wasnt playing a part he wasnt pretending to be deacon he actually was his model hed so immersed himself in a role which at the start was no doubt consciously performed that now he was the role wes crane existed only in name his background his thoughts his very identity werent his own anymore they belonged to a dead man what the hell is this i asked the three faces of eve sybil jill looked at me nervously as long as it isnt psycho what was i to do tell wes he needed help have a hearttoheart and try to talk him out of his delusion all we had was the one conversation to back up our theory and anyway he wasnt dangerous the opposite his manners were impeccable he always spoke softly with humor besides actors use all kinds of ways to psych themselves up by nature theyre eccentric the best thing to do i thought was wait and see with another picture about to start there wasnt any sense in making trouble if his delusion became destructive but he certainly wasnt difficult on the set he showed up a half hour early for his scenes he knew his lines he spent several evenings and weekends no charge rehearsing with the other actors even the studio vp admitted that the dailies looked wonderful about the only sign of trouble was his mania for racing cars and motorcycles the vp had a fit about the insurance premiums hey he needs to let off steam i said theres a lot of pressure on him and on me ill admit i had a budget of twentyfive million this time and i wasnt going to ruin things by making my star selfconscious halfway through the shooting schedule wes came over see no pranks im being good this time hey i appreciate it what on earth did he mean by this time youre probably thinking that i could have stopped what happened if id cared more about him than i did for the picture but i did care as youll see and it didnt matter what happened was as inevitable as tragedy grievance became a bigger success than mercenaries a worldwide twohundredmillion gross variety predicted an even bigger gross for the next one sure the next one number three but at the back of my head a nasty voice was telling me that for deacon three had been the unlucky number i left a conference at the studio walking toward my new ferrari in the executive parking lot when someone shouted my name turning i peered through the burbank smog at a longhaired bearded man wearing beads a serape and sandals running over to me i wondered what he wore if anything beneath the dangling serape i recognized him donald porter the friend of deacon whod played a bit part in birthright and imitated deacons voice on some of the soundtrack after deacon had died porter had to be in his forties now but he dressed as if the sixties had never ended and hippies still existed hed starred and directed in a hit youth film twenty years ago a lot of drugs and rock and sex for a while hed tried to start his own studio in santa fe but the second picture he directed was a flop and after fading from the business for a while hed made a comeback as a character actor the way he was dressed i didnt understand how hed passed the security guard at the gate and because we knew each other id once done a rewrite on a television show he was featured in i had the terrible feeling he was going to ask me for a job i heard you were on the lot ive been waiting for you porter said i stared at his skinny bare legs beneath his serape this man he gestured comically at himself im in the new tv movie theyre shooting here the electric koolaid acid test i nodded tom wolfes book ken kesey dont tell me youre playing no too old for kesey im neal cassidy after he split from kerouac he joined up with kesey driving the bus for the merry pranksters you know its all a load of crap man cassidy never dressed like this he dressed like deacon or deacon dressed like him well good hey great im glad things are going well for you i turned toward my car just a second man thats not what i wanted to talk to you about wes crane you know no i deacon man come on dont tell me you havent noticed shit man i dubbed deacons voice i knew him i was his friend nobody else knew him better crane sounds more like deacon than i did so it isnt possible because hes better cruel man really beneath you i have to tell you something i dont want you thinking im on drugs again i swear im clean a little grass thats it his eyes looked as bright as a nova im into horoscopes astrology the stars thats a good thing for a movie actor dont you think the stars theres a lot of truth in the stars whatever turns you on you think so man well listen to this i wanted to see for myself so i found out where he lives but i didnt go out there want to know why he didnt let me answer i didnt have to cause i recognized the address ive been there a hundred times when deacon lived there i flinched youre changing the subject whats that got to do with horoscopes and astrology cranes birth date well its the same as the day deacon died i realized id stopped breathing so what more shit man dont pretend its coincidence its in the stars you know whats coming cranes your bread and butter but the gravy trainll end four months from now i didnt ask cranes birthdays coming up the anniversary of deacons death and when i looked into it there were other parallels wes would be twentythree deacons age when he died and wes would be close to the end of his third movie about the same place in deacons third movie when he we were doing a script id written rampage about a young man from a tough neighborhood who comes back to teach there a local street gang harasses him and his wife until the only way he can survive is by reverting to the violent life he once led his own gang that he ran away from it was wess idea to have the character renew his fascination with motorcycles i have to admit that the notion had commercial value given wess wellknown passion for motorcycle racing but i also felt apprehensive especially when he insisted on doing his own stunts i couldnt talk him out of it as if his model behavior on the first two pictures had been too great a strain on him he snapped to the opposite extreme showing up late drinking on the set playing expensive pranks one joke involving fire crackers started a blaze in the costume trailer it all had the makings of a death wish his absolute identification with deacon was leading him to the ultimate parallel and just like deacon in his final picture wes began to look wasted hollowcheeked squinty stooped from lack of food and sleep his dailies were shameful how the hell are we supposed to ask an audience to pay to see this shit the studio vp asked ill have to shoot around him cut to reaction shots from the characters hes talking to my heart lurched that sounds familiar jill said beside me i knew what she meant id become the director id criticized on broken promises well cant you control him the vp asked its hard hes not quite himself these days dammit if you cant maybe another director can this garbage is costing us forty million bucks the threat made me seeth i almost told him to take his forty million bucks and abruptly i understood the leverage hed given me i straightened relax just let me have a week if he hasnt improved by then ill back out gladly witnesses heard you say it one week pal or else in the morning i waited for wes in his trailer when as usual he showed up late for his first shot at the open trailer door he had trouble focusing on me if it isnt teach he shook his head no wrong its me whos supposed to play the teach in whats the name of this garbage were making wes i want to talk to you hey funny thing the same goes for me with you just give me a chance to grab a beer okay fumbling he shut the trailer door behind him and lurched through shadows toward the miniature fridge try to keep your head clear this is important i said right sure he popped the tab on a beer can and left the fridge door open while he drank he wiped his mouth but first i want a favor that depends i dont have to ask you know i can just go ahead and do it im trying to be polite what is it mondays my birthday i want the day off theres a motorcyle race near sonora i want to make a long weekend out of it he drank more beer we had an agreement once he scowled beer dribbled down his chin i write and direct you star both of us or none yeah so ive kept the bargain the studios given me a week to shape you up if not im out of the project he sneered ill tell them i dont work if you dont not that simple wes at the moment theyre not that eager to do what you want youre losing your clout remember why you liked us as a team he wavered blearily because you wanted a friend to keep you from making what you called the same mistakes again to keep you from fucking up well wes thats what youre doing fucking up he finished his beer and crumbled the can he curled his lips angry because i want a day off on my birthday no because youre getting your roles confused youre not james deacon but youve convinced yourself that you are and monday youll die in a crash he blinked then he sneered so what are you a fortune teller now a halfbaked psychiatrist unconsciously you want to complete the legend the way youve been acting the parallels too exact i told you the first time we met i dont like bullshit then prove it monday you dont go near a motorcycle a car hell even a gocart you come to the studio sober you do your work as well as you know how i drive you over to my place we have a private party you and me and jill she promises to make your favorite meal tbones baked beans steamed corn homemade birthday cake chocolate again your favorite the works you stay the night in the morning we put james deacon behind us and yeah what you achieve the career deacon never had his eyes looked uncertain or you go to the race and destroy yourself and break the promise you made you and me together a team dont back out of our bargain he shuddered as if he was going to crack in a movie that would have been the climax how he didnt race on his birthday how we had the private party and he hardly said a word and went to sleep in our guest room and survived but this is what happened on the tuesday after his birthday he couldnt remember his lines he couldnt play to the camera he couldnt control his voice wednesday was worse but ill say this on his birthday the anniversary of deacons death when wes showed up sober and treated our bargain with honor he did the most brilliant acting of his career a zenith of tradecraft i often watch the video of those scenes with profound respect and the dailies were so truly brilliant that the studio vp let me finish the picture but the vp never knew how i faked the rest of it overnight wes had totally lost his technique i had enough in the can to deliver a print with a lot of fancy editing and some uncredited but very expensive help from donald porter he dubbed most of wess final dialogue i told you horoscopes astrology donald said i didnt believe him until i took four scenes to an audio expert i know he specializes in putting voices through a computer and making visual graphs of them he spread the charts in front of me somebody played a joke on you or else youre playing one on me i felt so unsteady that i had to press my hands on his desk when i asked him how using this first film deacons scene from the prodigal son as the standard this second film is close but this third one doesnt have any resemblance so wheres the joke in the fourth it matches perfectly whos kidding who deacon had been the voice on the first donald porter had been the voice on the second close to deacons dubbing for wes in rampage wes himself had been the voice on the third the dialogue in rampage that i couldnt use because wess technique had gone to hell and the fourth clip the voice that was identical to deacons authenticated verifiable wes again his screen test the imitated scene from the prodigal son wes dropped out of sight for sure his technique had collapsed so badly he would never again be a shining star i kept phoning him but i never got an answer so for what turned out to be the secondlast time i drove out to his dingy place near the desert the manson lookalikes were gone only one motorcycle stood outside i climbed the steps to the sun porch knocked received no answer and opened the door the blinds were closed the place was in shadow i went down a hall and heard strained breathing turned to the right and entered a room the breathing was louder more strident and forced wes dont turn on the light ive been worried about you friend dont but i did turn on the light and what i saw made me swallow vomit he was slumped in a chair seeping into it would be more accurate rotting decomposing his cheeks had holes that showed his teeth a pool that stank of decaying vegetables spread on the floor around him i should have gone racing on my birthday huh his voice whistled through the gaping flesh in his throat oh shit friend i started to cry jesus christ i should have let you do me a favor huh turn off the light now let me finish this in peace i had so much to say to him but i couldnt my heart broke i turned off the light and buddy he said i think wed better forget about our bargain we wont be working together anymore what can i do to help there must be something i can yeah let me end this the way i need to listen i leave wes said it hurts me too much to have you here to listen to the pity in your voice but i care about you im your friend i thats why i know youll do what i ask the hole in his throat made another whistling sound and leave i stood in the darkness listening to other sounds he made liquid rotting sounds a doctor there must be something a doctor can been there done that whats wrong with me no doctors going to cure now if you dont mind what you werent invited get out i waited another long moment sure love you man he said love you dazed i stumbled outside down the steps across the sand blinded by the sun unable to clear my nostrils of the stench in that room i threw up beside the car the next day i drove out again the last time jill went with me hed moved i never learned where and this is how it ended the final dregs of his career his talent was gone but how his determination lingered movies immortality see special effects are expensive studios will grasp at any means to cut the cost hed told me forget about our bargain i later discovered what he meant he worked without me in one final feature he wasnt listed in the credits though zombies from hell remember how awful bela lugosi looked in his last exploitation movie before they buried him in his dracula cape bela looked great compared to wes i saw the zombie movie in an eightplex out in the valley it did great business jill and i almost didnt get a seat jill wept as i did this fucking town nobody cares how its done as long as it packs them in the audience cheered when wes stalked toward the leading lady and his jaw fell off in a year after the previous story was published i made a decision that surprised me as much as it did anyone else since i had been teaching american literature at the university of iowa i had risen through the ranks gaining tenure and a full professorship i thoroughly enjoyed teaching it was a delight to be around young people eager to learn the stimulation of the university environment and of my colleague friends had been a constant in my life for sixteen years then i woke up one morning and recognized that i didnt have the energy to devote myself to two fulltime professions any longer i had been working seven days a week for as long as i could remember balancing my teaching responsibilities with my writing needs had often required me to get up before dawn and to stay awake after my family went to sleep the idea of a day off or of a free weekend wasnt in my universe but while teaching was my love writing was my passion and when the burden of fatigue finally overwhelmed me there wasnt any doubt what the mildmannered professor with the bloodyminded visions as one critic called me would do in the fall of i resigned from the university the adjustment was painful after all academia had been a crucial part of my life for even longer than my years at iowa all the way back to when id entered graduate school at penn state although i now had the luxury to write full time i continued to feel the tug of the classroom often i reconsidered my decision but in a matter of months neither writing nor teaching mattered any longer in january of my son was diagnosed with bone cancer from then until his death in june the nightmarish rollercoaster of emotions and pain through which matt suffered made me fear for my sanity this cant be happening i told myself it isnt real but despairingly it was and i found myself wanting to escape from reality while sitting in marts intensivecare room watching his septicshockravaged comatose body i was surprised to discover that the novel i was holding was by stephen king stephen is a friend he knew matt and kindly sent him letters along with rock tapes to try to distract him from his ordeal even so it seemed odd to me that in the midst of reallife horror i was reading madeup horror then it occurred to me that the madeup horror was paradoxically providing a barrier from reallife horror i recalled how fans often wrote to me describing disasters in their lives deaths marriage breakups lost jobs fires floods car accidents telling me that a book of mine had helped them make it through the night as the subject of my doctoral dissertation john barth once said reality is a nice place to visit but you wouldnt want to live there while these thoughts went through my mind another friend douglas winter a multiple talent fiction writercriticanthologistattorney asked if i would contribute to an anthology he was putting together prime evil writing was the last thing i wanted to do and yet with dougs encouragement when i wasnt visiting matt in the hospital i wrote the following novella which was suggested by my fascination with the paintings of van gogh a tale about insanity it helped to keep me sane it received the horror writers association award for the best novella of orange is for anguish blue for insanity van dorns work was controversial of course the scandal his paintings caused among parisian artists in the late s provided the stuff of legend disdaining conventions thrusting beyond accepted theories van dorn seized upon the essentials of the craft to which hed devoted his soul color design and texture with those principles in mind he created portraits and landscapes so different so innovative that their subjects seemed merely an excuse for van dorn to put paint onto canvas his brilliant colors applied in passionate splotches and swirls often so thick that they projected an eighth of an inch from the canvas in the manner of a basrelief so dominated the viewers perception that the person or scene depicted seemed secondary to technique impressionism the prevailing avantgarde theory of the late s imitated the eyes tendency to perceive the edges of peripheral objects as blurs van dorn went one step farther and so emphasized the lack of distinction among objects that they seemed to melt together to merge into an interconnected pantheistic universe of color the branches of a van dorn tree became ectoplasmic tentacles thrusting toward the sky and the grass just as tentacles from the sky and grass thrust toward the tree all melding into a radiant swirl he seemed to address himself not to the illusions of light but to reality itself or at least to his theory of it the tree is the sky his technique asserted the grass is the tree and the sky the grass all is one van dorns approach proved so unpopular among theorists of his time that he frequently couldnt buy a meal in exchange for a canvas upon which hed labored for months his frustration produced a nervous breakdown his selfmutilation shocked and alienated such onetime friends as c√©zanne and gauguin he died in squalor and obscurity not until the s thirty years after his death were his paintings recognized for the genius they displayed in the s his soultortured character became the subject of a bestselling novel and in the s a hollywood spectacular these days of course even the least of his efforts cant be purchased for less than three million dollars ah art it started with myers and his meeting with professor stuyvesant he agreed reluctantly im surprised he agreed at all i said stuyvesant hates postimpressionism and van dorn in particular why didnt you ask someone easy like old man bradford because bradford s academic reputation sucks i cant see writing a dissertation if it wont be published and a respected dissertation director can make an editor pay attention besides if i can convince stuyvesant i can convince anyone convince him of what thats what stuyvesant wanted to know myers said i remember that moment vividly the way myers straightened his lanky body pushed his glasses close to his eyes and frowned so hard that his curly red hair scrunched forward on his brow stuyvesant said that even disallowing his own disinclination toward van dorn god the way that pompous asshole talks he couldnt understand why id want to spend a year of my life writing about an artist whod been the subject of countless books and articles why not choose an obscure but promising neoexpressionist and gamble that my reputation would rise with his naturally the artist he recommended was one of stuyvesants favorites naturally i said if he named the artist i think he did myers mentioned the name i nodded stuyvesants been collecting him for the past five years he hopes the resale value of the paintings will buy him a town house in london when he retires so what did you tell him myers opened his mouth to answer then hesitated with a brooding look he turned toward a print of van dorns swirling cypresses in a hollow which hung beside a ceilinghigh bookshelf crammed with van dorn biographies analyses and bound collections of reproductions he didnt speak for a moment as if the sight of the familiar print its facsimile colors incapable of matching the brilliant tones of the original its manufacturing process unable to recreate the exquisite texture of raised swirled layers of paint on canvas still took his breath away so what did you tell him i asked again myers exhaled with a mixture of frustration and admiration i said what the critics wrote about van dorn was mostly junk he agreed with the implications that the paintings invited no less i said even the gifted critics hadnt probed to van dorns essence they were missing something crucial which is exactly stuyvesants next question you know how he keeps relighting his pipe when he gets impatient i had to talk fast i told him i didnt know what i was looking for but theres something myers gestured toward the print something there something nobodys noticed van dorn hinted as much in his diary i dont know what it is but im convinced his paintings hide a secret myers glanced at me i raised my eyebrows well if nobodys noticed myers said it must be a secret right but if you havent noticed compelled myers turned toward the print again his tone filled with wonder how do i know its there because when i look at van dorns paintings i sense it i feel it i shook my head i can imagine what stuyvesant said to that the man deals with art as if its geometry and there arent any secrets in what he said was if im becoming a mystic i ought to be in the school of religion not art but if i wanted enough rope to hang myself and strangle my career hed give it to me he liked to believe he had an open mind he said thats a laugh believe me he wasnt joking he had a fondness for sherlock holmes he said if i thought id found a mystery and could solve it by all means do so and at that he gave me his most condescending smile and said he would mention it at todays faculty meeting so whats the problem you got what you wanted he agreed to direct your dissertation why do you sound so today there wasnt any faculty meeting oh my voice dropped youre screwed myers and i had started graduate school at the university of iowa together that had been three years earlier and wed formed a strong enough friendship to rent adjacent rooms in an old apartment building near campus the spinster who owned it had a hobby of doing watercolors she had no talent i might add and rented only to art students so they would give her lessons in myerss case she had make an exception he wasnt a painter as i was he was an art historian most painters work instinctively theyre not skilled at verbalizing what they want to accomplish but words and not pigment were myerss specialty his impromptu lectures had quickly made him the old ladys favorite tenant after that day however she didnt see much of him nor did i he wasnt at the classes we took together i assumed he spent most of his time at the library late at night when i noticed a light beneath his door and knocked i didnt get an answer i phoned him through the wall i heard the persistent muffled ringing one evening i let the phone ring eleven times and was just about to hang up when he answered he sounded exhausted youre getting to be a stranger i said his voice was puzzled stranger but i just saw you a couple of days ago you mean two weeks ago oh shit he said ive got a sixpack you want to yeah id like that he sighed come over when he opened his door i dont know what startled me more the way myers looked or what hed done to his apartment ill start with myers he had always been thin but now he looked gaunt emaciated his shirt and jeans were rumpled his red hair was matted behind his glasses his eyes looked bloodshot he hadnt shaved when he closed the door and reached for a beer his hand shook his apartment was filled with covered with im not sure how to convey the dismaying effect of so much brilliant clutter van dorn prints on every inch of the walls the sofa the chairs the desk the tv the bookshelves and the drapes and the ceiling and except for a narrow path the floor swirling sunflowers olive trees meadows skies and streams surrounded me encompassed me seemed to reach out for me at the same time i felt swallowed just as the blurred edges of objects within each print seemed to melt into one another so each print melted into the next i was speechless amid the chaos of color myers took several deep gulps of beer embarrassed by my stunned reaction to the room he gestured toward the vortex of prints i guess you could say im immersing myself in my work when did you eat last he looked confused thats what i thought i walked along the narrow path among the prints on the floor and picked up the phone the pizzas on me i ordered the largest supreme the nearest pepis had to offer they didnt deliver beer but i had another sixpack in my fridge and i had the feeling wed be needing it i set down the phone myers what the hell are you doing i told you immersing yourself give me a break youre cutting classes you havent showered in god knows how long you look terrible your deal with stuyvesant isnt worth destroying your health tell him youve changed your mind get an easier dissertation director stuyvesants got nothing to do with this damn it what does it have to do with the end of comprehensive exams the start of dissertation blues myers gulped the rest of his beer and reached for another can no blue is for insanity what thats the pattern myers turned toward the swirling prints i studied them chronologically the more van dorn became insane the more he used blue and orange is his color of anguish if you match the paintings with the personal crises described in his biographies you see a corresponding use of orange myers youre the best friend ive got so forgive me for saying i think youre off the deep end he swallowed more beer and shrugged as if to say he didnt expect me to understand listen i said a personal color code a connection between emotion and pigment thats bullshit i should know youre the historian but im the painter im telling you different people react to colors in different ways never mind the advertising agencies and their theories that some colors sell products more than others it all depends on context it depends on fashion this years in color is next years out but an honesttogod great painter uses whatever color will give him the greatest effect hes interested in creating not selling van dorn could have used a few sales no question the poor bastard didnt live long enough to come into fashion but orange is for anguish and blue means insanity tell that to stuyvesant and hell throw you out of his office myers took off his glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose i feel so maybe youre right theres no maybe about it i am right you need food a shower and sleep a paintings a combination of color and shape that people either like or they dont the artist follows his instincts uses whatever techniques he can master and does his best but if theres a secret in van dorns work it isnt a color code myers finished his second beer and blinked in distress you know what i found out yesterday i shook my head the critics who devoted themselves to analyzing van dorn what about them they went insane the same as he did what no way ive studied van dorns critics theyre as conventional and boring as stuyvesant you mean the mainstream scholars the safe ones im talking about the truly brilliant ones the ones who havent been recognized for their genius just as van dorn wasnt recognized what happened to them they suffered the same as van dorn they were put in an asylum worse than that myers dont make me ask the parallels are amazing they each tried to paint in van dorns style and just like van dorn they stabbed out their eyes i guess its obvious by now myers was what you might call highstrung no negative judgment intended in fact his excitability was one of the reasons i liked him that and his imagination hanging around with him was never dull he loved ideas learning was his passion and he passed his excitement on to me the truth is i needed all the inspiration i could get i wasnt a bad artist not at all on the other hand i wasnt a great one either as i neared the end of grad school i had painfully come to realize that my work would never be more than interesting i didnt want to admit it but id probably end up as a commercial artist in an advertising agency that night however myerss imagination wasnt inspiring it was scary he was always going through phases of enthusiasm el greco picasso pollock each had preoccupied him to the point of obsession only to be abandoned for another favorite and another when hed fixated on van dorn id assumed it was merely one more infatuation but the chaos of van dorn prints in his room made clear hed reached a greater excess of compulsion i was skeptical about his insistence that there was a secret in van dorns work after all great art cant be explained you can analyze its technique you can diagram its symmetry but ultimately theres a mystery words cant communicate genius cant be summarized as far as i could tell myers had been using the word secret as a synonym for indescribable brilliance when i realized he literally meant that van dorn had a secret i was appalled the distress in his eyes was equally appalling his references to insanity not only in van dorn but in his critics made me worry that myers himself was having a breakdown stabbed out their eyes for christs sake i stayed up with myers till five am trying to calm him to convince him he needed a few days rest we finished the sixpack id brought the sixpack in my refrigerator and another sixpack i bought from an art student down the hall at dawn just before myers dozed off and i staggered back to my room he murmured that i was right he needed a break he said tomorrow hed call his folks hed ask if theyd pay his plane fare back to denver hung over i didnt wake up until late afternoon disgusted that id missed my classes i showered and managed to ignore the taste of last nights pizza i wasnt surprised when i phoned myers and got no answer he probably felt as shitty as i did but after sunset when i called again then knocked on his door i started to worry his door was locked so i went downstairs to get the landladys key thats when i saw the note in my mail slot meant what i said need a break went home will be in touch stay cool paint well i love you pal your friend forever myers my throat ached he never came back i saw him only twice after that once in new york and once in lets talk about new york i finished my graduate project a series of landscapes that celebrated iowa s bigsky rolling darkearthed wooded hills a local patron paid fifty dollars for one of them i gave three to the universitys hospital the rest are who knows where too much has happened as i predicted the world wasnt waiting for my goodbutnotgreat efforts i ended where i belonged as a commercial artist for a madison avenue advertising agency my beer cans are the best in the business i met a smart attractive woman who worked in the marketing department of a cosmetics firm one of my agencys clients professional conferences led to personal dinners and intimate evenings that lasted all night i proposed she agreed wed live in connecticut she said of course when the time was right we might have children she said of course myers phoned me at the office i dont know how he knew where i was i remember his breathless voice i found it he said myers i grinned is it really how are you where have im telling you i found it i dont know what youre remember van dorns secret in a rush i did remember the excitement myers could generate the wonderful expectant conversations of my youth the days and especially the nights when ideas and the future beckoned van dorn are you still yes i was right there was a secret you crazy bastard i dont care about van dorn but i care about you why did you i never forgave you for disappearing i had to couldnt let you hold me back couldnt let you for your own good so you thought but i was right where are you exactly where youd expect me to be for the sake of old friendship myers dont piss me off where are you the metropolitan museum of art will you stay there myers while i catch a cab i cant wait to see you i cant wait for you to see what i see i postponed a deadline canceled two appointments and told my fiancee i couldnt meet her for dinner she sounded miffed but myers was all that mattered he stood beyond the pillars at the entrance his face was haggard but his eyes were like stars i hugged him myers its so good to i want you to see something hurry he tugged at my coat rushing but where have you been ill tell you later we entered the postimpressionist gallery bewildered i followed myers and let him anxiously sit me on a bench before van dorns fir trees at sunrise id never seen the original prints couldnt compare after a year of drawing ads for feminine beauty aids i was devastated van dorns power brought me close to tears for my visionless skills for the youth id abandoned a year before look myers said he raised his arm and gestured toward the painting i frowned i looked it took time an hour two hours and the coaxing vision of myers i concentrated and then at last i saw profound admiration changed to my heart raced as myers traced his hand across the painting one final time as a guard who had been watching us with increasing wariness stalked forward to stop him from touching the canvas i felt as if a cloud had dispersed and a lens had focused jesus i said you see the bushes the trees the branches yes oh god yes why didnt i notice before because it doesnt show up in the prints myers said only in the originals and the effects so deep you have to study them forever it seems that long but i knew i was right a secret when i was a boy my father how i loved him took me mushroom hunting we drove from town climbed a barbedwire fence walked through a forest and reached a slope of dead elms my father told me to search the top of the slope while he checked the bottom an hour later he came back with two large paper sacks filled with mushrooms i hadnt found even one i guess your spot was lucky i said but theyre all around you my father said all around me where you didnt look hard enough i crossed this slope five times you searched but you didnt really see my father said he picked up a long stick and pointed it toward the ground focus your eyes toward the end of the stick i did and ive never forgotten the hot excitement that surged through my stomach the mushrooms appeared as if by magic theyd been there all along of course so perfectly adapted to their surroundings their color so much like dead leaves their shape so much like bits of wood and chunks of rock that theyd been invisible to ignorant eyes but once my vision adjusted once my mind reevaluated the visual impressions it received i saw mushrooms everywhere seemingly thousands of them id been standing on them walking over them staring at them and hadnt realized i felt an infinitely greater shock when i saw the tiny faces myers made me recognize in van dorns fir trees at sunrise most were smaller than a quarter of an inch hints and suggestions dots and curves blended perfectly with the landscape they werent exactly human although they did have mouths noses and eyes each mouth was a black gaping maw each nose a jagged gash the eyes dark sinkholes of despair the twisted faces seemed to be screaming in total agony i could almost hear their anguished shrieks their tortured wails i thought of damnation of hell as soon as i noticed the faces they emerged from the swirling texture of the painting in such abundance that the landscape became an illusion the grotesque faces reality the fir trees turned into an obscene cluster of writhing arms and painracked torsos i stepped back in shock an instant before the guard would have pulled me away dont touch the the guard said myers had already rushed to point at another van dorn the original cypresses in a hollow i followed and now that my eyes knew what to look for i saw small tortured faces in every branch and rock the canvas swarmed with them jesus and this myers hurried to sunflowers at harvest time and again as if a lens had changed focus i no longer saw flowers but anguished faces and twisted limbs i lurched back felt a bench against my legs and sat you were right i said the guard stood nearby scowling van dorn did have a secret i said i shook my head in astonishment it explains everything myers said these agonized faces give his work depth theyre hidden but we sense them we feel the anguish beneath the beauty but why would he i dont think he had a choice his genius drove him insane its my guess that this is how he literally saw the world these faces are the demons he wrestled with the festering products of his insanity and theyre not just an illustrators gimmick only a genius could have painted them for all the world to see and yet have so perfectly infused them into the landscape that no one would see because he took them for granted in a terrible way no one you saw myers he smiled maybe that means im crazy i doubt it friend i returned his smile it does mean youre persistent thisll make your reputation but im not through yet myers said i frowned so far all ive got is a fascinating case of optical illusion tortured souls writhing beneath perhaps producing incomparable beauty i call them secondary images in your ad work i guess theyd be called subliminal but this isnt commercialism this is a genuine artist who had the brilliance to use his madness as an ingredient in his vision i need to go deeper what are you talking about the paintings here dont provide enough examples ive seen his work in paris and rome in zurich and london ive borrowed from my parents to the limits of their patience and my conscience but ive seen and i know what i have to do the anguished faces began in when van dorn left paris in disgrace his early paintings were abysmal he settled in la verge in the south of france six months later his genius suddenly exploded in a frenzy he painted he returned to paris he showed his work but no one appreciated it he kept painting kept showing still no one appreciated it he returned to la verge reached the peak of his genius and went totally insane he had to be committed to an asylum but not before he stabbed out his eyes thats my dissertation i intend to parallel his course to match his paintings with his biography to show how the faces increased and became more severe as his madness worsened i want to dramatize the turmoil in his soul as he imposed his twisted vision on each landscape it was typical of myers to take an excessive attitude and make it even more excessive dont misunderstand his discovery was important but he didnt know when to stop im not an art historian but ive read enough to know that whats called psychological criticism the attempt to analyze great art as a manifestation of neuroses is considered offthewall if myers handed stuyvesant a psychological dissertation the pompous bastard would have a fit that was one misgiving i had about what myers planned to do with his discovery another troubled me more i intend to parallel van dorns course hed said after we left the museum and walked through central park i realized how literally myers meant it im going to southern france he said i stared in surprise you dont mean la verge thats right i want to write my dissertation there but what place could be more appropriate its the village where van dorn suffered his nervous breakdown and eventually went insane if its possible ill even rent the same room he did myers this sounds too far out even for you but it makes perfect sense i need to immerse myself i need atmosphere a sense of history so i can put myself in the mood to write the last time you immersed yourself you crammed your room with van dorn prints didnt sleep didnt eat didnt bathe i hope i admit i got too involved but last time i didnt know what i was looking for now that ive found it im in good shape you look strung out to me an optical illusion myers grinned come on ill treat you to drinks and dinner sorry cant ive got a plane to catch youre leaving tonight but i havent seen you since you can buy me that dinner when i finish the dissertation i never did i saw him only one more time because of the letter he sent two months later or asked his nurse to send she wrote down what hed said and added an explanation of her own hed blinded himself of course you were right shouldnt have gone but when did i ever take advice always knew better didnt i now its too late what i showed you that day at the met god help me theres so much more found the truth cant bear it dont make my mistake dont look ever again i beg you at van dorns paintings cant stand the pain need a break going home stay cool paint well love you pal your friend forever myers in her postscript the nurse apologized for her english she sometimes took care of aged americans on the riviera she said and had to learn the language but she understood what she heard better than she could speak it or write it and hoped that what shed written made sense it didnt but that wasnt her fault myers had been in great pain sedated with morphine not thinking clearly she said the miracle was that hed managed to be coherent at all your friend was staying at our only hotel the manager says that he slept little and ate even less his research was obsessive he filled his room with reproductions of van dorns work he tried to duplicate van dorns daily schedule he demanded paints and canvas refused all meals and wouldnt answer his door three days ago a scream woke the manager the door was blocked it took three men to break it down your friend used the sharp end of a paintbrush to stab out his eyes the clinic here is excellent physically your friend will recover although he will never see again but i worry about his mind myers had said he was going home it had taken a week for the letter to reach me i assumed his parents would have been informed immediately by phone or telegram he was probably back in the states by now i knew his parents lived in denver but i didnt know their first names or address so i got in touch with information and phoned every myers in denver until i made contact not with his parents but with a family friend watching their house myers hadnt been flown to the states his parents had gone to the south of france i caught the next available plane not that it matters but i was supposed to be married that weekend la verge is fifty kilometers inland from nice i hired a driver the road curved through olivetree orchards and farmland crested cypresscovered hills and often skirted cliffs passing one of the orchards i had the eerie conviction that id seen it before entering la verge my d√©j√† vu strengthened the village seemed trapped in the nineteenth century except for phone poles and power lines it looked exactly as van dorn had painted it i recognized the narrow cobbled streets and rustic shops that van dorn had made famous i asked directions it wasnt hard to find myers and his parents the final time i saw my friend the undertaker was putting the lid on his coffin i had trouble sorting out the details but despite my burning tears i gradually came to understand that the local clinic was as good as the nurse had assured me in her note all things being equal he would have lived but the damage to his mind had been another matter hed complained of headaches hed also become increasingly distressed even morphine hadnt helped hed been left alone only for a minute appearing to be asleep in that brief interval he had managed to stagger from his bed grope across the room and find a pair of scissors yanking off his bandages hed jabbed the scissors into an empty eye socket and tried to ream out his brain hed collapsed before accomplishing his purpose but the damage had been sufficient death had taken two days his parents were pale incoherent with shock i somehow controlled my own shock enough to try to comfort them despite the blur of those terrible hours i remember noticing the kind of irrelevance that signals the minds attempt to reassert normality myerss father wore gucci loafers and a gold rolex watch in grad school myers had lived on a strict budget i had no idea he came from wealthy parents i helped them make arrangements to fly his body back to the states i went to nice with them and stayed by their side as they watched the crate that contained his coffin being loaded into the baggage compartment of the plane i shook their hands and hugged them i waited as they sobbed and trudged down the boarding tunnel an hour later i was back in la verge i returned because of a promise i wanted to ease his parents suffering and my own because id been his friend youve got too much to take care of i had said to his parents the long trip home the arrangements for the funeral my throat had felt choked let me help ill settle things here pay whatever bills he owes pack up his clothes and i had taken a deep breath and his books and whatever else he had and send them home to you let me do that id consider it a kindness please i need to do something true to his ambition myers had managed to rent the same room taken by van dorn at the villages only hotel dont be surprised that it was available the management used it to promote the hotel a plaque announced the historic value of the room the furnishings were the same style as when van dorn had stayed there tourists to be sure had paid to peer in and sniff the residue of genius but business had been slow this season and myers had wealthy parents for a generous sum coupled with his typical enthusiasm he had convinced the hotels owner to let him have that room i rented a different room more like a closet two doors down the hall and my eyes still burning from tears went into van dorns musty sanctuary to pack my dear friends possessions prints of van dorn paintings were everywhere several splattered with dried blood heartsick i made a stack of them thats when i found the diary during grad school i had taken a course in postimpressionism that emphasized van dorn and id read a facsimile edition of his diary the publisher had photocopied the handwritten pages and bound them adding an introduction translation and footnotes the diary had been cryptic from the start but as van dorn became more feverish about his work as his nervous breakdown became more severe his statements deteriorated into riddles his handwriting hardly neat even when he was sane went quickly out of control and finally turned into almost indecipherable slashes and curves as he rushed to unloose his frantic thoughts i sat at a small wooden desk and paged through the diary recognizing phrases i had read years before with each passage my stomach turned colder because this diary wasnt the published photocopy instead it was a notebook and although i wanted to believe that myers had somehow impossibly gotten his hands on the original diary i knew i was fooling myself the pages in this ledger werent yellow and brittle with age the ink hadnt faded until it was brown more than blue the notebook had been purchased and written in recently it wasnt van dorns diary it belonged to myers glancing sharply away from the ledger i saw a shelf beyond the desk and a stack of other notebooks apprehensive i grabbed them and in a fearful rush flipped through them my stomach threatened to erupt each notebook was the same the words identical my hands shook as i looked again to the shelf found the facsimile edition of the original and compared it with the notebooks i moaned imagining myers at this desk his expression intense and insane as he reproduced the diary word for word slash for slash curve for curve eight times myers had indeed immersed himself straining to put himself into van dorns disintegrating frame of mind and in the end hed succeeded the weapon van dorn had used to stab out his eyes had been the sharp end of a paintbrush in the mental hospital van dorn had finished the job by skewering his brain with a pair of scissors like myers or vice versa when myers had finally broken had he and van dorn been horribly indistinguishable i pressed my hands to my face whimpers squeezed from my convulsing throat it seemed forever before i stopped sobbing my consciousness strained to control my anguish orange is for anguish myers had said rationality fought to subdue my distress the critics who devoted themselves to analyzing van dorn myers had said the ones who havent been recognized for their genius just as van dorn wasnt recognized they suffered and just like van dorn they stabbed out their eyes had they done it with a paintbrush i wondered were the parallels that exact and in the end had they too used scissors to skewer their brains i scowled at the prints id been stacking many still surrounded me on the walls the floor the bed the windows even the ceiling a swirl of colors a vortex of brilliance or at least i once had thought of them as brilliant but now with the insight myers had given me with the vision id gained in the metropolitan museum i saw behind the sundrenched cypresses and hayfields the orchards and meadows toward their secret darkness toward the minuscule twisted arms and gaping mouths the black dots of tortured eyes the blue knots of writhing bodies blue is for insanity myers had said all it took was a slight shift of perception and there werent any orchards and hayfields only a terrifying gestalt of souls in hell van dorn had indeed invented a new stage of impressionism hed impressed upon the splendor of gods creation the teeming images of his own disgust his paintings didnt glorify they abhorred everywhere van dorn had looked hed seen his own private nightmare blue was for insanity indeed and if you fixated on van dorns insanity long enough you too became insane dont look ever again i beg you at van dorns paintings myers had said in his letter in the last stages of his breakdown had myers somehow become lucid enough to try to warn me cant stand the pain need a break going home in a way id never expected he had indeed gone home another startling thought occurred to me the critics who devoted themselves to analyzing van dorn they each tried to paint in van dorns style myers had said a year ago as if attracted by a magnet my gaze swung across the welter of prints and focused on the corner across from me where two canvas originals leaned against the wall i shivered stood and haltingly approached them theyd been painted by an amateur myers was an art historian after all the colors were clumsily applied especially the splotches of orange and blue the cypresses were crude at their bases the rocks looked like cartoons the sky needed texture but i knew what the black dots among them were meant to suggest i understood the purpose of the tiny blue gashes the miniature anguished faces and twisted limbs were implied even if myers had lacked the talent to depict them hed contracted van dorns madness all that had remained were the terminal stages i sighed from the pit of my soul as the villages church bell rang i prayed that my friend had found peace it was dark when i left the hotel i needed to walk to escape the greater darkness of that room to feel at liberty to think but my footsteps and inquiries led me down a narrow cobbled street toward the villages clinic where myers had finished what he had started in van dorns room i asked at the desk and five minutes later introduced myself to an attractive darkhaired thirtyish woman the nurses english was more than adequate she said her name was clarisse you took care of my friend i said you sent me the letter he dictated and added a note of your own she nodded he worried me he was so distressed the fluorescent lights in the vestibule hummed we sat on a bench im trying to understand why he killed himself i said i think i know but id like your opinion her eyes a bright intelligent hazel suddenly were guarded he stayed too long in his room he studied too much she shook her head and stared toward the floor the mind can be a trap it can be a torture but he was excited when he came here yes despite his studies he behaved as if hed come on vacation very much then what made him change my friend was unusual i agree what we call highstrung but he enjoyed doing research he might have looked sick from too much work but he thrived on learning his body was nothing but his mind was brilliant what tipped the balance clarisse tipped the made him depressed instead of excited what did he learn that made him she stood and looked at her watch forgive me i stopped work twenty minutes ago im expected at a friends my voice hardened of course i wouldnt want to keep you outside the clinic beneath the light at its entrance i stared at my own watch surprised to see that it was almost eleventhirty fatigue made my knees ache the trauma of the day had taken away my appetite but i knew i should try to eat and after walking back to the hotels dining room i ordered a chicken sandwich and a glass of chablis i meant to eat in my room but never got that far van dorns room and the diary beckoned the sandwich and wine went untasted sitting at the desk surrounded by the swirling colors and hidden horrors of van dorn prints i opened a notebook and tried to understand a knock at the door made me turn again i glanced at my watch astonished to find that hours had passed like minutes it was almost two am the knock was repeated gentle but insistent the manager come in i said in french the door isnt locked the knob turned the door swung open clarisse stepped in instead of her nurses uniform she now wore sneakers jeans and a sweater whose tightfitting yellow accentuated the hazel in her eyes i apologize she said in english i must have seemed rude at the clinic not at all you had an appointment i was keeping you she shrugged selfconsciously i sometimes leave the clinic so late i dont have a chance to see my friend i understand perfectly she drew a hand through her lush long hair my friend got tired as i walked home passing the hotel i saw a light up here on the chance it might be you i nodded waiting i had the sense that shed been avoiding it but now she turned toward the room toward where id found the dried blood on the prints the doctor and i came as fast as we could when the manager phoned us that afternoon clarisse stared at the prints how could so much beauty cause so much pain beauty i glanced toward the tiny gaping mouths you mustnt stay here dont make the mistake your friend did mistake youve had a long journey youve suffered a shock you need to rest youll wear yourself out as your friend did i was just looking through some things of his ill be packing them to send them back to america do it quickly you mustnt torture yourself by thinking about what happened here it isnt good to surround yourself with the things that disturbed your friend dont intensify your grief surround myself my friend would have said immerse you look exhausted come she held out her hand ill take you to your room sleep will ease your pain if you need some pills to help you thanks but a sedative wont be necessary clarisse continued to offer her hand i took it and went to the hallway for a moment i stared back toward the prints and the horror within the beauty i said a silent prayer for myers shut off the lights and locked the door we went down the hall in my room i sat on the bed sleep long and well clarisse said i hope you have my sympathy she kissed my cheek i touched her shoulder her lips shifted toward my own she leaned against me we sank toward the bed in silence we made love sleep came like her kisses softly smothering but in my nightmares there were tiny gaping mouths sunlight glowed through my window with aching eyes i looked at my watch half past ten my head hurt clarisse had left a note on my bureau last night was sympathy to share and ease your grief do what you intended pack your friends belongings send them to america go with them dont make your friends mistake dont as you said he said immerse yourself dont let beauty give you pain i meant to leave i truly believe that i phoned the front desk and asked the concierge to send up some boxes after i showered and shaved i went to myerss room where i finished stacking the prints i made another stack of books and another of clothes i packed everything into the boxes and looked around to make sure i hadnt forgotten anything the two canvases that myers had painted still leaned against a corner i decided not to take them no one needed to be reminded of the delusions that had overcome him all that remained was to seal the boxes to address and mail them but as i started to close the flap on a box i saw the notebooks inside so much suffering i thought so much waste once more i leafed through a notebook various passages caught my eye van dorns discouragement about his failed career his reasons for leaving paris to come to la verge the stifling backbiting artists community the snobbish critics and their sneering responses to his early efforts need to free myself of convention need to void myself of aesthete politics to shit it out of me to find whats never been painted to feel instead of being told what to feel to see instead of imitating what others have seen i knew from the biographies how impoverished van dorns ambition had made him in paris hed literally eaten slops thrown into alleys behind restaurants hed been able to afford his quest to la verge only because a successful but very conventional and now ridiculed painter friend had loaned him a small sum of money eager to conserve his endowment van dorn had walked all the way from paris to the south of france in those days you have to remember this valley was an unfashionable area of hills rocks farms and villages limping into la verge van dorn must have been a pathetic sight hed chosen this provincial town precisely because it was unconventional because it offered mundane scenes so in contrast with the salons of paris that no other artist would dare to paint them need to create whats never been imagined hed written for six despairing months he tried and failed he finally quit in selfdoubt then suddenly reversed himself and in a year of unbelievably brilliant productivity gave the world thirtyeight masterpieces at the time of course he couldnt trade any canvas for a meal but the world knows better now he must have painted in a frenzy his suddenly found energy must have been enormous to me a wouldbe artist with technical facility but only conventional eyes he achieved the ultimate despite his suffering i envied him when i compared my maudlin wyethlike depictions of iowa landscapes to van dorns trendsetting genius i despaired the task awaiting me back in the states was to imitate beer cans and deodorant packages for magazine ads i continued flipping through the notebook tracing the course of van dorns despair and epiphany his victory had a price to be sure insanity selfblinding suicide but i had to wonder if perhaps as he died hed have chosen to reverse his life if hed been able he must have known how remarkable how truly astonishing his work had become or perhaps he didnt the last canvas hed painted before stabbing his eyes had been of himself a leanfaced brooding man with short thinning hair sunken features pallid skin and a scraggly beard the famous portrait reminded me of how i always thought christ would have looked just before he was crucified all that was missing was the crown of thorns but van dorn had a different crown of thorns not around but within him disguised among his scraggly beard and sunken features the tiny gaping mouths and writhing bodies told it all his suddenly acquired vision had stung him too much as i read the notebook again distressed by myerss effort to reproduce van dorns agonized words and handwriting exactly i reached the section where van dorn described his epiphany la verge i walked i saw i feel canvas paint creation and damnation after that cryptic passage the notebook and van dorns diary became totally incoherent except for the persistent refrain of severe and increasing headaches i was waiting outside the clinic when clarisse arrived to start her shift at three oclock the sun was brilliant glinting off her eyes she wore a burgundy skirt and a turquoise blouse mentally i stroked their cottony texture when she saw me her footsteps faltered forcing a smile she approached you came to say goodbye she sounded hopeful no to ask you some questions her smile disintegrated i mustnt be late for work thisll take just a minute my french vocabulary needs improvement i didnt bring a dictionary the name of this village la verge what does it mean she hunched her shoulders as if to say the question was unimportant its not very colorful the literal translation is the stick thats all she reacted to my frown there are rough equivalents the branch the switch a willow for example that a father might use to discipline a child she looked uncomfortable it can also be a slang term for penis and it doesnt mean anything else indirectly the synonyms keep getting farther from the literal sense a wand perhaps or a rod the kind of forked stick that people who claim they can find water hold ahead of them when they walk across a field the stick is supposed to bend down if theres water we call it a divining rod my father once told me hed seen a man who could actually make one work i always suspected the man just tilted the stick with his hands do you suppose this village got its name because long ago someone found water here with a divining rod why would anyone have bothered when these hills have so many streams and springs what makes you interested in the name something i read in van dorns diary the villages name excited him for some reason but anything could have excited him he was insane eccentric but he didnt become insane until after that passage in his diary you mean his symptoms didnt show themselves until after that youre not a psychiatrist i had to agree again im afraid ill seem rude i really must go to work clarisse hesitated last night was exactly what you described in the note a gesture of sympathy an attempt to ease my grief you didnt mean it to be the start of anything please do what i asked please leave dont destroy yourself like the others others like your friend no you said others my words were rushed clarisse tell me she glanced up squinting as if shed been cornered after your friend stabbed out his eyes i heard talk around the village older people it could be merely gossip that became exaggerated with the passage of time what did they say she squinted harder twenty years ago a man came here to do research on van dorn he stayed three months and had a breakdown he stabbed out his eyes rumors drifted back that he blinded himself in a mental hospital in england ten years before another man came he jabbed scissors through an eye all the way into his brain i stared unable to control the spasms that racked my shoulder blades what the hell is going on i asked around the village no one would talk to me at the hotel the manager told me hed decided to stop renting van dorns room i had to remove myerss belongings at once but i can still stay in my room if thats what you wish i dont recommend it but even france is still a free country i paid the bill went upstairs moved the packed boxes from van dorns room to mine and turned in surprise as the phone rang the call was from my fianc√©e when was i coming home i didnt know what about the wedding this weekend the wedding would have to be postponed i winced as she slammed down the phone i sat on the bed and couldnt help recalling the last time id sat there with clarisse standing over me just before wed made love i was throwing away the life id tried to build for a moment i came close to calling my fianc√©e back but a different sort of compulsion made me scowl toward the boxes toward van dorns diary in the note clarisse had added to myerss letter shed said that his research had become so obsessive that hed tried to recreate van dorns daily habits again it occurred to me at the end had myers and van dorn become indistinguishable was the secret to what had happened to myers hidden in the diary just as the suffering faces were hidden in van dorns paintings i grabbed one of the ledgers scanning the pages i looked for references to van dorns daily routine and so it began ive said that except for telephone poles and electrical lines la verge seemed caught in the previous century not only was the hotel still in existence but so were van dorns favorite tavern and the bakery where he had bought his morning croissant a small restaurant he favored remained in business on the edge of the village a trout stream where he sometimes sat with a midafternoon glass of wine still bubbled along although pollution had long since killed the trout i went to all of them in the order and at the time van dorn recorded in his diary breakfast at eight lunch at two a glass of wine at the trout stream a stroll to the countryside then back to the room after a week i knew the diary so well i didnt need to refer to it mornings had been van dorns time to paint the light was best then hed written and evenings were a time for remembering and sketching it finally came to me that i wouldnt be following the schedule exactly if i didnt paint and sketch when van dorn had done so i bought a notepad canvas pigments a palette whatever i needed and for the first time since leaving graduate school i tried to create i used local scenes that van dorn had favored and produced what youd expect uninspired versions of van dorns paintings with no discoveries no understanding of what had ultimately undermined myerss sanity tedium set in my finances were almost gone i prepared to give up except i had the disturbing sense that id missed something a part of van dorns routine that wasnt explicit in the diary or something about the locales themselves that i hadnt noticed although id been painting them in van dorns spirit if not with his talent clarisse found me sipping wine on the sunlit bank of the nowtroutless stream i felt her shadow and turned toward her silhouette against the sun i hadnt seen her for two weeks since our uneasy conversation outside the clinic even with the sun in my eyes she looked more beautiful than i remembered when was the last time you changed your clothes she asked a year ago i had said the same to myers you need a shave youve been drinking too much you look awful i sipped my wine and shrugged well you know what the drunk said about his bloodshot eyes you think they look bad to you you should see them from my side at least you can joke im beginning to think that im the joke youre definitely not a joke she sat beside me youre becoming your friend why dont you leave im tempted good she touched my hand clarisse yes answer some questions one more time she studied me why because if i get the right answers i might leave she nodded slowly back in town in my room i showed her the stack of prints i almost told her about the faces they contained but her brooding features stopped me she thought i was disturbed enough as it was when i walk in the afternoons i go to the settings van dorn chose for his paintings i sorted through the prints this orchard this farm this pond this cliff and so on yes i recognize these places ive seen them all i hoped if i saw them maybe id understand what happened to my friend you told me he went to them as well each of them is within a fivekilometer radius of the village many are close together it wasnt difficult to find each site except for one she didnt ask which instead she tensely rubbed her arm when id taken the boxes from van dorns room id also removed the two paintings myers had attempted now i pulled them from where id tucked them under the bed my friend did these its obvious he wasnt an artist but as crude as they are you can see they both depict the same area i slid a van dorn print from the bottom of the stack this area i said a grove of cypresses in a hollow surrounded by rocks its the only site i havent been able to find ive asked the villagers they claim they dont know where it is do you know clarisse can you tell me it must have some significance if my friend was fixated on it enough to try to paint it twice clarisse scratched a fingernail across her wrist im sorry what i cant help you cant or wont do you mean you dont know where to find it or you know but you wont tell me i said i cant help whats wrong with this village clarisse whats everybody trying to hide ive done my best she shook her head stood and walked to the door she glanced back sadly sometimes its better to leave well enough alone sometimes there are reasons for secrets i watched her go down the hall clarisse she turned and spoke a single word north she was crying god help you she added ill pray for your soul then she disappeared down the stairs for the first time i felt afraid five minutes later i left the hotel in my walks to the sites of van dorns paintings i had always chosen the easiest routes east west and south whenever id asked about the distant treelined hills to the north the villagers had told me there was nothing of interest in that direction nothing at all to do with van dorn what about cypresses in a hollow i had asked there werent any cypresses in those hills only olive trees theyd answered but now i knew la verge was in the southern end of an oblong valley squeezed by cliffs to the east and west i rented a car leaving a dust cloud i pressed my foot on the accelerator and headed north toward the rapidly enlarging hills the trees id seen from the village were indeed olive trees but the leadcolored rocks among them were the same as in van dorns painting i sped along the road veering up through the hills at the top i found a narrow space to park and rushed from the car but which direction to take on impulse i chose left and hurried among the rocks and trees my decision seems less arbitrary now something about the slopes to the left was more dramatic more aesthetically compelling a greater wildness in the landscape a sense of depth of substance like van dorns work my instincts urged me forward id reached the hills at quarter after five time compressed eerily at once my watch showed ten past seven the sun blazed crimson descending toward the bluffs i kept searching letting the grotesque landscape guide me the ridges and ravines were like a maze every turn of which either blocked or gave access controlling my direction thats the sense i had i was being controlled i rounded a crag scurried down a slope of thorns ignored the rips in my shirt and the blood streaming from my hands and stopped on the precipice of a hollow cypresses not olive trees filled the basin boulders jutted among them and formed a grotto the basin was steep i skirted its brambles ignoring their scalding sting boulders led me down i stifled my misgivings frantic to reach the bottom this hollow this basin of cypresses and boulders this thornrimmed funnel was the image not only of van dorns painting but of the canvases myers had attempted but why had this place so affected them the answer came as quickly as the question i heard before i saw although hearing doesnt accurately describe my sensation the sound was so faint and highpitched it was almost beyond the range of detection at first i thought i was near a hornets nest i sensed a subtle vibration in the otherwise still air of the hollow i felt an itch behind my eardrums a tingle on my skin the sound was actually many sounds each identical merging like the collective buzz of a swarm of insects but this was highpitched not a buzz but more like a distant chorus of shrieks and wails frowning i took another step toward the cypresses the tingle on my skin intensified the itch behind my eardrums became so irritating that i raised my hands to the sides of my head i came close enough to see within the trees and what i noticed with terrible clarity made me panic gasping i stumbled back but not in time what shot from the trees was too small and fast for me to identify it struck my right eye the pain was excruciating as if the whitehot tip of a needle had pierced my retina and lanced my brain i clamped my right hand across that eye and screamed i continued stumbling backward agony spurring my panic but the sharp hot pain intensified surging through my skull my knees bent my consciousness dimmed i fell against the slope it was after midnight when i managed to drive back to the village although my eye no longer burned my panic was more extreme still dizzy from having passed out i tried to keep control when i entered the clinic and asked where clarisse lived she had invited me to visit i claimed a sleepy attendant frowned but told me i drove desperately toward her cottage five blocks away lights were on i knocked she didnt answer i pounded harder faster at last i saw a shadow when the door swung open i lurched into the living room i barely noticed the negligee clarisse clutched around her or the open door to her bedroom where a startled woman sat up in bed held a sheet to her breasts and stood quickly to shut the bedroom door what the hell do you think youre doing clarisse demanded i didnt invite you in i didnt i managed the strength to talk i dont have time to explain im terrified i need your help she clutched her negligee tighter ive been stung i think ive caught a disease help me stop whatevers inside me antibiotics an antidote anything you can think of maybe its a virus maybe a fungus maybe it acts like bacteria what happened i told you no time id have asked for help at the clinic but they wouldnt have understood theyd have thought id had a breakdown the same as myers youve got to take me there youve got to make sure im injected with as much of any and every drug that might possibly kill this thing the panic in my voice overcame her doubt ill dress as fast as i can as we rushed to the clinic i described what had happened clarisse phoned the doctor the moment we arrived while we waited she put disinfectant drops in my eye and gave me something for my rapidly developing headache the doctor showed up his sleepy features becoming alert when he saw how distressed i was true to my prediction he reacted as if id had a breakdown i shouted at him to humor me and saturate me with antibiotics clarisse made sure it wasnt just a sedative he gave me he used every compatible combination if i thought it would have worked id have swallowed drano what id seen within the cypresses were tiny gaping mouths and minuscule writhing bodies as small and camouflaged as those in van dorns paintings i know now that van dorn wasnt imposing his insane vision on reality he wasnt an impressionist after all at least not in his cypresses in a hollow im convinced cypresses was his first painting after his brain became infected he was literally depicting what he had seen on one of his walks later as the infection progressed he saw the gaping mouths and writhing bodies like an overlay on everything else he looked at in that sense too he wasnt an impressionist to him the gaping mouths and writhing bodies were in all those later scenes to the limits of his infected brain he painted what to him was reality his art was representational i know believe me because the drugs didnt work my brain is as diseased as van dorns or myerss ive tried to understand why they didnt panic when they were stung why they didnt rush to a hospital to make a doctor comprehend what had happened my conclusion is that van dorn had been so desperate for a vision to enliven his paintings that he gladly endured the suffering and myers had been so desperate to understand van dorn that when stung hed willingly taken the risk to identify even more with his subject until too late he had realized his mistake orange is for anguish blue for insanity how true whatever infects my brain has affected my color sense more and more orange and blue overpower the other colors i know are there i have no choice i see little else my paintings are rife with orange and blue my paintings ive solved another mystery it always puzzled me how van dorn could have suddenly been seized by such energetic genius that he painted thirtyeight masterpieces in one year i know the answer now whats in my head the gaping mouths and writhing bodies the orange of anguish and the blue of insanity cause such pressure such headaches that ive tried everything to subdue them to get them out i went from codeine to demerol to morphine each helped for a time but not enough then i learned what van dorn understood and myers attempted painting the disease somehow gets it out of you for a time and then you paint harder faster anything to relieve the pain but myers wasnt an artist the disease had no release and reached its terminal stage in weeks instead of van dorns year but im an artist or used to hope i was i had skill without a vision now god help me ive got a vision at first i painted the cypresses and their secret i accomplished what youd expect an imitation of van dorns original but i refuse to suffer pointlessly i vividly recall the portraits of midwestern landscapes i produced in graduate school the darkearthed iowa landscape the attempt to make an observer feel the fecundity of the soil at the time the results were ersatz wyeth but not anymore the twenty paintings ive so far stored away arent versions of van dorn either theyre my own creations unique a combination of the disease and my experience aided by powerful memory i paint the river that flows through iowa city blue i paint the cornfields that cram the bigsky rolling country outside town orange i paint my innocence my youth with my ultimate discovery hidden within them ugliness lurks within the beauty horror festers in my brain clarisse at last told me about the local legend in the middle ages when la verge was founded she said a meteor streaked from the sky it lit the night it burst upon the hills north of here flames erupted trees were consumed the hour was late few villagers saw it the site of the impact was too far away for those few witnesses to rush that night to see the crater in the morning the smoke had dispersed the embers had died although the witnesses tried to find the meteor the lack of the roads that now exist hampered their search through the tangled hills to the point of discouragement a few among the few witnesses persisted the few of the few of the few who had accomplished their quest staggered back to the village babbling about headaches and tiny gaping mouths using sticks they scraped disturbing images in the dirt and eventually stabbed out their eyes over the centuries legend has it similar selfmutilations occurred whenever someone returned from seeking the crater in those hills the unknown had power then the hills acquired the negative force of taboo no villager then or now intruded on what came to be called the place where gods wand touched the earth a poetic description of a blazing meteors impact la verge i dont conclude the obvious that the meteor carried spores that multiplied in the crater which became a hollow eventually filled with cypresses no to me the meteor was a cause but not an effect i saw a pit among the cypresses and from the pit tiny mouths and writhing bodies resembling insects how they wailed spewed they clung to the leaves of the cypresses flailed in anguish as they fell back and instantly were replaced by other spewing anguished souls yes souls for the meteor i insist was just the cause to me the effect was the opening of hell the tiny wailing mouths are the damned as i am damned desperate to survive to escape from the ultimate prison we call hell a frantic sinner lunged he caught my eye and stabbed my brain the gateway to my soul my soul it festers i paint to remove the pus i talk that helps somehow clarisse writes it down while her female lover rubs my shoulders my paintings are brilliant ill be recognized as a genius the way i had always dreamed at such a cost the headaches grow worse the orange is more brilliant the blue more disturbing i try my best i urge myself to be stronger than myers whose endurance lasted only weeks van dorn persisted for a year maybe genius is strength my brain swells how it threatens to split my skull the gaping mouths blossom the headaches i tell myself to be strong another day another rush to complete another painting the sharp end of my paintbrush invites anything to lance my seething mental boil to jab my eyes for the ecstasy of relief but i have to endure on a table near my left hand the scissors wait but not today or tomorrow ill outlast van dorn after matts death in june of i collapsed the dayafterday monthaftermonth tension of watching his painful decline had weakened the part of my brain that controls stress a circuit breaker failed no matter what i tried to do take a walk watch television read eat my body was in a constant state of emergency stress chemicals rushed unchecked through me panic attacks repeatedly hit me my mind swirling my heart racing all i could do was lie on my back and stare at the ceiling experiences i wrote about in the nonfictional fireflies gradually with the love of my family and friends i began to climb from the darkness but the gap of three years between the publication of the league of night and fog in and the fifth professions gives an idea of the black hole that almost swallowed me it took even longer for me to return to short fiction the following storys unusual technique communicates the psychological state i was in if youve ever taken a fictionwriting class you know that there are three main viewpoints first person thirdperson limited and thirdperson omniscient each has strengths and weaknesses but there is a fourth viewpoint one that is almost never used because of its limitations the second person instead of i or he and she the author tells the story as you its unconventional and problematic but why not try it i thought just once to violate a taboo to add to the lack of convention i decided to use the present tense but for a purpose after all the way a story is told ought to have something to do with its subject matter here the main character is so stunned by what he has gone through that he feels detached from himself and thinks of himself as you past horrors are constantly being replayed in the present tense of his savaged mind the beautiful uncut hair of graves received the horror writers association award for the best novella of the beautiful uncut hair of graves despite the rain youve been to the cemetery yet again ignoring the cold autumn gusts slanting under your bowed umbrella the drenched drab leaves blowing against your soaked pantlegs and shoes two graves you shiver blinking through tears toward the freshly laid sod there arent any tombstones there wont be for a year but you imagine what the markers will look like each birth date different the death dates god help you the same simon and esther weinberg your parents you silently mouth the kaddish prayers that rabbi goldstein recited at the funeral losing strength you turn to trudge back to your rainbeaded car to throw your umbrella on the passenger seat and jab the button marked defroster to try to control your trembling hands and somehow suppress your chestswelling rage your heartnumbing grief eyes swollen from tears you manage to drive back to your parents home an estate on lake michigan north of chicago the mansion feels ghostly hollow without its proper occupants you cross the enormous vestibule and enter the oakpaneled study one wall is lined with books another with photographs of your precious father shaking hands with local and national dignitaries even a president as you sit at the massive desk to resume sorting through your fathers papers the last of them the documents unsealed from your parents safedeposit box your wife appears in the studys doorway a coffee cup in her hand she slumps against the wall and frowns as she did when you obeyed your repeated so intense compulsion to go back yet again to the cemetery why she asks you squint up from the documents isnt it obvious i feel the need to be with them thats not what i meant rebecca says shes fortynine tall with dark hair a narrow face and pensive eyes all the work youve been doing all the documents and the meetings all the phone calls cant you let yourself relax you look terrible how the hell should i look my fathers chest was crushed my mothers head was the drunken bastard who hit their car got away with just a few stitches not what i meant rebecca repeats using two hands both of them shaky she raises the coffee cup to her lips dont make sympathy sound like an accusation youve got every right to look terrible its bad enough to lose one parent let alone two at once and the way they died was she shakes her head obscene but what youre doing your compulsion to im afraid youll push yourself until you collapse dont torture yourself your father assigned an executor for his estate a perfectly competent lawyer from his firm let the man do his job i grant youre a wonderful attorney but right now its time to let someone else take charge for gods sake jacob and if not for god then for me get some rest you sigh knowing she means well and wants only whats best for you but she doesnt understand you need to keep busy you need to distract yourself with minutiae so that your mind doesnt snap from confronting the full horror of losing your parents im almost finished you say just a few more documents from the safedeposit box then i promise ill try to rest a bath sounds lord i still cant believe how much i miss pour me a scotch i think my nerves need numbing ill have one with you as rebecca crosses the study toward the liquor cabinet you glance down toward the next document a faded copy of your birth certificate you shake your head dad kept everything what a packrat your tone is bittersweet your throat tight with affection thats why his estates so hard to sort through its so difficult to tell whats important whats sentimental and whats just you glance at the next document almost set it aside take another look frown feel what seems to be a frozen fishhook in your stomach and murmur god your breathing fails jacob your wife turns from pouring the scotch and hurriedly sets down the bottle rushing toward you whats wrong your face youre as gray as you keep staring toward the document feeling as if youve been punched in the ribs the wind knocked out of you rebecca crouches beside you touching your face you swallow and manage to breathe i what jacob tell me whats the matter there has to be some mistake you point toward the document rebecca hurriedly reads it i dont understand its crammed with legal jargon a womans promising to give up two children for adoption is that what this means yes you have trouble speaking look at the date august fifteen nineteen thirtyeight a week before my birthday same year you sound hoarse so what thats just a coincidence your father did all kinds of legal work probably including adoptions but he wouldnt have kept a business affidavit with his personal papers in his private safedeposit box here at the bottom look at the place where this was notarized redwood point california right you say now check this copy of my birth certificate the place of birth is redwood point california rebeccas voice drops still think its just a coincidence it has to be jacob youve been under a lot of strain but this is one strain you dont have to deal with you know youre not adopted do i how well its you gesture impatiently i mean its something a person takes for granted rebecca says why because your parents would have told you why if they didnt need to why would they have taken the chance of shocking me wasnt it better for my parents to leave well enough alone listen to me jacob youre letting your imagination get control of you maybe you stand your legs unsteady you cross to the liquor cabinet and finish pouring the drinks that rebecca had started preparing maybe you swallow an inch of the drink made deliberately strong it burns your throat but i wont know for sure will i unless i find out why my father kept that womans adoption agreemerit with his private papers and how it happened that i was born one week later and in the same place that the woman signed and dated her consent form so what rebecca rubs her forehead dont you see it doesnt make a difference your parents loved you you loved them suppose despite lord knows how many odds suppose your suspicion turns out to be correct what will it change it wont make your grief any less it wont affect a lifetime of love it might affect a lot of things look finish your drink its friday we still have time to go to temple if ever you needed to focus your spirit its now in anguish you swallow a third of your drink take another look at that adoption consent the woman agrees to give up two babies if i was adopted that means somewhere out there ive got a brother or a sister a twin a stranger to you jacob theres more to being a brother or a sister than just the biological connection your stomach recoils as you gulp the last of the your drink keep looking at the consent form at the bottom the womans name mary duncan scot so rebecca asks go to temple think about it have you ever heard of any scot who it could be i wasnt born jewish your uncles normally slackjowled features tighten in confusion adopted what on earth would make you think you sit beside him on the sofa in his living room and explain as you show him the documents his agewrinkled brow contorts he shakes his bald head coincidence thats what my wife claims then listen to her and listen to me jacob your father and i were as close as two brothers can possibly be we kept no secrets from each other neither of us ever did anything important without first asking the others opinion when simon may he rest in peace decided to marry your mother he discussed it with me long before he talked to our parents believe me trust me if he and esther had planned to adopt a child id have been told you exhale wanting to believe but tortured by doubts then why your skull throbs tell me jacob all right lets pretend it is a coincidence that these documents were together in my parents safedeposit box lets pretend that theyre unrelated matters but why as far as i know dad always lived here in chicago i never thought about it before but why wasnt i born here instead of in california your uncle strains to concentrate weary he shrugs that was so long ago nineteen he peers through his glasses toward your birth certificate thirtyeight so many years its hard to remember he pauses your mother and father wanted children very much that i remember but no matter how hard they tried well your father and mother were terribly discouraged then one afternoon he came to my office beaming he told me to take the rest of the day off we had something to celebrate your mother was pregnant thinking of your parents and how much you miss them you wince with grief but restraining tears you cant help saying that still doesnt explain why i was born in california im coming to that your uncle rubs his wizened chin yes im starting to nineteen thirtyeight the worst of the depression was over but times still werent good your father said that with the baby coming he needed to earn more money he felt that california los angeles offered better opportunities i tried to talk him out of it in another year i said chicago will have turned the corner besides hed have to go through the trouble of being certified to practice law in california but he insisted and of course i was right chicago did soon turn the corner whats more as it happened your father and mother didnt care for los angeles so after six or seven months they came back right after you were born that still doesnt what los angeles isnt redwood point you say i never heard of the place what were my parents doing there oh that your uncle raises his thin white eyebrows no mystery redwood point was a resort up the coast in august la was brutally hot as your mother came close to giving birth your father decided she ought to be someplace where she wouldnt feel the heat close to the sea where the breeze would make her comfortable so they took a sort of vacation and you were born there yes you say perfectly logical nothing mysterious except you gesture toward the coffee table why did my father keep this womans adoption agreement your uncle lifts his liverspotted hands in exasperation oy vay for all we know he found a chance to do some legal work while he was in redwood point to help pay your mothers hospital and doctor bills when he moved back to chicago it might be some business papers got mixed in with his personal ones by accident everything to do with redwood point got grouped together and my father never noticed the mistake no matter how many times he must have gone to his safedeposit box i have trouble believing jacob jacob last month i went to my safedeposit box and found a treasury bond that i didnt remember even buying let alone putting in the box oversights happen my father was the most organized person i ever knew god knows i love him and god knows i miss him your uncle bites his pale lower lip then breathes with effort seized with emotion but he wasnt perfect and life isnt tidy well probably never know for sure how this document came to be with his private papers but this much i do know you can count on it youre simon and esthers natural child you werent adopted you stare at the floor and nod thank you no need to thank me just go home get some rest and stop thinking so much what happened to simon and esther has been a shock to all of us well be a long time missing them yes you say a long time rebecca how is the same as me she still cant believe theyre dead your uncles bony fingers clutch your hand i havent seen either of you since the funeral its important for family to stick together why dont both of you come over for honey cake on rosh hashana id like to uncle but im sorry ill be out of town where are you going redwood point the biggest airport nearest your destination is in san jose you rent a car and drive south down the coast passing carmel and big sur preoccupied you barely notice the dramatic scenery the windblown pine trees the rugged cliffs the whitecaps hitting the shore you ask yourself why you didnt merely phone the authorities at redwood point explain that youre a lawyer in chicago and ask for information that you need to settle an estate why do you feel compelled to come all this way to a town so small that it isnt listed in your hammond atlas and could only be located in the chicago library on its large map of california for that matter why do you feel compelled at all both your wife and your uncle have urged you to leave the matter alone youre not adopted youve been assured and even if you were what difference would it make the answers trouble you one you might have a brother or a sister a twin and now that youve lost your parents you feel an anxious need to fill the vacuum of their loss by finding an unsuspected member of your family two you suffer a form of midlife crisis but not in the common sense of the term to have lived these many years and possibly never have known your birth parents makes you uncertain of your identity yes you loved the parents you knew but your present limbo of insecure uncertainty makes you desperate to discover the truth one way or the other so you can dismiss the possibility of your having been adopted or else adjust to the fact that you were but this way not being certain is maddening given the stress of double grief and three the most insistent reason an identity crisis of frantic concern you want to learn if after a lifetime of having been circumsized of hebrew lessons of your bar mitzvah of friday nights at temple of scrupulous observance of sacred holidays of being a jew if after all that you might have been born a gentile you tell yourself that being a jew has nothing to do with race and genes that its a matter of culture and religion but deep in your heart youve always thought of yourself proudly as being completely a jew and your sense of self feels threatened who am i you think you increase speed toward your destination and brood about your irrational stubborn refusal to let rebecca travel here with you why did you insist on coming alone because you decide with grim determination because i dont want anybody holding me back the pacific coast highway pivots above a rocky cliff in crevasses stunted misshapen fir trees cling to shallow soil and fight for survival a weatherbeaten sign abruptly says redwood point with equal abruptness you see a town below you on the right its buildings dismal even from a distance their unpainted listing structures spread along a bay at the center of which a halfdestroyed pier projects toward the ocean the only beauty is the glint of the afternoon sun on the whitecapped waves your stomach sinks redwood point a resort or at least thats what your uncle said maybe in nineteen thirtyeight you think but not anymore and as you steer off the highway tapping your brakes weaving down the bumpy narrow road past shorter more twisted pine trees toward the dingy town where your birth certificate says you entered the world you feel hollow you pass a ramshackle boardedup hotel on a ridge that looks over the town you notice the charred collapsed remnant of what seems to have been another hotel and decide discouraged that your wife and your uncle were right this lengthy fatiguing journey was needless so many years a ghost of a town that might have been famous once youll never find answers here the dusty road levels off and leads past dilapidated buildings toward the skeleton of the pier you stop beside a shack get out and inhale the salty breeze from the ocean an old man sits slumped on a chair on the few safe boards at the front of the pier obeying an impulse you approach your footsteps crunching on seashells and gravel excuse me you say the old man has his back turned staring toward the ocean the odor of decay dead fish along the shore pinches your nostrils excuse me you repeat slowly the old man turns he cocks his shriveled head either in curiosity or antagonism you ask the question that occurred to you driving down the slope why is this town called redwood point this far south there arent any redwoods youre looking at it im not sure what the old man gestures toward the ruin of the pier the planks are made of redwood in its heyday he sips from a beer can used to be lovely the way it stuck out toward the bay so proud he sighs nostalgic redwood point is there a hospital you sick just curious the old man squints the nearest hospitals forty miles up the coast what about a doctor used to be say how come you ask so many questions i told you im just curious is there a courthouse does this look like a county seat we used to be something now were the old man tosses his beer can toward a trash container he misses shit well what about have you got a police force sure chief kitrick the old man coughs for all the good he does not that we need him nothing happens here thats why he doesnt have deputies so where can i find him easy this time of day the redwood bar can you tell me where behind you the old man opens another beer take a left its the only place that looks decent the redwood bar on a cracked concrete road above the beach has fresh redwood siding that makes the adjacent buildings look even more dingy you pass through a door that has an anchor painted on it and feel as if youve entered a tackle shop or have boarded a trawler fishing poles stand in a corner a net rimmed with buoys hangs on one wall various nautical instruments a sextant a compass others you cant identify all looking ancient despite their gleaming metal sit on a shelf beside a polished weathered navigation wheel that hangs behind the bar the sturdy rectangular tables all have captains chairs voices in the far right corner attract your attention five men sit playing cards a haze of cigarette smoke dims the light above their table one of the men in his fifties largechested with short sandy hair and a ruddy complexion wears a policemans uniform he studies his cards a companion calls to the bartender ray another beer huh how about you hank its only ten to five im not offduty yet the policeman says and sets down his cards full house damn beats me its sure as hell better than a straight the men throw in their cards the policeman scoops up quarters my deal sevencard stud as he shuffles the cards he squints in your direction the bartender sets a beer on the table and approaches you whatll it be uh club soda you say what i actually i want to talk to chief kitrick overhearing the policeman squints even harder something urgent no not exactly you shrug selfconscious this happened many years ago i guess it can wait a little longer the policeman frowns then well finish this hand if thats okay go right ahead at the bar you pay for your drink and sip it turning toward the wall across from you you notice photographs dozens of them the images yellowed wrinkled and faded but even at a distance you know what the photographs represent and compelled repressing a shiver you walk toward them redwood point the photographs depict the resort in its prime fifty sixty years ago vintage automobiles gleam with newness on what was once a smoothly paved busy street outside the beach is crowded with vacationers in oldfashioned bathing suits the impressive long pier is lined with fishermen boats dot the bay pedestrians stroll the sidewalks glancing at shops or pointing toward the ocean some eat hot dogs and cotton candy all are welldressed and the buildings look clean their windows shiny the depression you think but not everyone was out of work and here the financially advantaged sought refuge from the summer heat and the city squalor a splendid hotel guests holding frosted glasses or fanning themselves on the spacious porch is unmistakably the ramshackle ruin you saw as you drove in another building expansive with peaks and gables of victorian design sits on a ridge above the town presumably the charred wreckage you noticed earlier ghosts you shake your head most of the people in these photographs have long since died and the buildings have died as well but just havent fallen down what a waste you think what happened here how could time have been so cruel to this place it sure was pretty once a husky voice says behind you you turn toward chief kitrick and notice he holds a glass of beer after five off duty now he says thanks for letting me finish the game what can i do for you something about years ago you said yes about the time these photographs were taken the chiefs eyes change focus oh can we find a place to talk its kind of personal chief kitrick gestures my office is just next door it smells musty a cobweb dangles from a corner of the ceiling you pass a bench in the waiting area go through a squeaky gate and face three desks two of which are dusty and bare in a spacious administration area a phone but no twoway radio a file cabinet a calendar on one wall an office this size obviously at one time several policemen had worked here you sense a vacuum the absence of the bustle of former years you can almost hear the echoes of decadesold conversations chief kitrick points toward a wooden chair years ago you sit nineteen thirtyeight that is years ago i was born here you hesitate my parents both died three weeks ago and i lost my own dad just a year ago you have my sympathy you nod exhale and try to order your thoughts when i went through my fathers papers i found theres a possibility i may have been adopted as in the bar the chiefs eyes change focus and then again maybe not you continue but if i was adopted i think my mothers name was mary duncan i came here because well i thought there might be records i could check what kind of records the birth certificate my father was sent lists the time and place where i was born and my parents names simon and esther weinberg jewish you tense does that matter just making a comment responding to what you said you debate then resume but the type of birth certificate parents receive is a shortened version of the one thats filed at the county courthouse which in this case is forty miles north cape verde i didnt know that before i came here but i did think thered be a hospital it would have a detailed record about my birth no hospital never was the chief says so i learned but a resort as popular as redwood point was in the thirties would have needed some kind of medical facility a clinic the chief says i once heard my father mention it but it closed back in the forties do you know what happened to its records chief kitrick raises his shoulders packed up shipped somewhere put in storage not here though i know every speck of this town and there arent any medical records from the old days i dont see how those records would help my file would mention who my mother was see im a lawyer and the chief frowns the standard practice with adoptions is to amend the birth certificate at the courthouse so it lists the adopting parents as the birth parents but the original birth certificate naming the birth parents isnt destroyed its sealed in a file and put in a separate section of the records then it seems to me you ought to go to the county courthouse and look for that file chief kitrick says the trouble is even with whatever influence i have as a lawyer it would take me months of petitions to get that sealed file opened and maybe never but hospital records are easier all i need is a sympathetic doctor who a thought makes your heart beat faster would you know the names of any doctors who used to practice here maybe theyd know how to help me nope hasnt been a doctor here in quite a while when we get sick we have to drive up the coast i dont want to sound discouraging mr weinberg yeah weinberg nineteen thirtyeight were talking ancient history i suspect youre wasting your time who remembers that far back if theyre even still alive that is and god knows where the clinics records are then i guess ill have to do this the hard way you stand the county courthouse thanks for your help i dont think i helped at all but mr weinberg yes you pause at the gate sometimes its best to leave the past alone how i wish i could cape verde turns out to be a pleasant attractive town of twentythousand people its architecture predominantly spanish redtiled roofs arched doorways and adobecolored walls after the blight of redwood point you feel less depressed but only until you hear a baby crying in the hotel room next to yours after a halfsleepless night during which you phone rebecca to assure her that youre all right but ignore her pleas for you to come home you ask directions from the desk clerk and drive to the courthouse which looks like a spanish mission arriving there shortly after nine oclock the office of the county recorder is on the second floor at the rear and the redhaired young man behind the counter doesnt think twice about your request birth records nineteen thirtyeight sure after all those records are open to the public you dont need to give a reason ten minutes later the clerk returns with a large dusty ledger there isnt a desk so you need to stand at the end of the counter while the young man goes back to work you flip the ledgers pages to august and study them the records are grouped according to districts in the county when you get to the section for redwood point you read carefully what youre looking for is not just a record of your birth but a reference to mary duncan twenty children were born that august for a moment that strikes you as unusual so many for so small a community but then you remember that in august the resort would have been at its busiest and maybe other expecting parents had gone there to escape the summers heat to allow the mother a comfortable delivery just as your own parents had according to your uncle you note the names of various mothers and fathers miriam and david meyer ruth and henry begelman gail and jeffrey markowitz with a shock of recognition you come upon your own birth record parents esther and simon weinberg but that proves nothing you remind yourself you glance toward the bottom of the form medical facility redwood point clinic certifier jonathan adams md attendant june engle rn adams was presumably the doctor who took care of your mother you conclude a quick glance through the other redwood point certificates shows that adams and engle signed every document but nowhere do you find a reference to mary duncan you search ahead to september in case mary duncan was late giving birth no mention of her still you think maybe she signed the adoption consent forms early in her pregnancy so you check the records for the remaining months of nothing you ask the clerk for the birth certificates again he complies but after you reach the april records and go so far as to check those in may and still find no mention of mary duncan you frown even if she impossibly knew during her first month that she was pregnant and even if her pregnancy lasted ten months instead of nine she still ought to be in these records what happened did she change her mind and leave town to hide somewhere and deliver the two children shed promised to let others adopt might be you think and a competent lawyer could have told her that her consent form no matter how official and complex it looked wasnt legally binding or did she death records please you ask the clerk for nineteen thirtyeight and thirtynine this time the young man looks somewhat annoyed as he trudges off to find those records but when he returns and you tensely inspect the ledgers you find no indication that mary duncan died during childbirth thanks you tell the clerk as you put away your notes youve been very helpful the young man grateful not to bring more ledgers grins theres just one other thing the young mans shoulders sag this birth certificate for jacob weinberg you point toward an open ledger what about it it lists esther and simon weinberg as his parents but it may be jacob was adopted if so therell be an alternate birth certificate that indicates the biological mothers name id like to have a look at original birth certificates in the case of adoptions arent available to the public but im an attorney and theyre not available to attorneys either and if youre a lawyer you should know that well yes i do but see a judge bring a court order ill be glad to oblige otherwise man the rule is strict those records are sealed id lose my job sure your voice cracks i understand the countys department of human services is also in the cape verde courthouse on the third floor you wait in a lobby until the official in charge of adoptions returns from an appointment her name you learn is becky hughes she shakes your hand and escorts you into her office shes in her thirties blonde welldressed and slightly overweight her intelligence and commitment to her work are evident the clerk downstairs did exactly what he should have becky says apparently you dont look convinced the sealedfile rule on original birth certificates in the case of adoptions is a good one counselor and when its important so is another rule nothing ventured nothing gained important becky taps her fingers on her desk in the case of adoptions nothings more important than preserving the anonymity of the biological mother she glances toward a coffee pot on a counter you want some you shake your head no my nerves are on edge already decaffeinated all right then sure why not i take it black she pours two cups sets yours on the desk and sits across from you when a woman gives her baby up she often feels so guilty about it maybe she isnt married and comes from a strict religious background that makes her feel ashamed or maybe shes seventeen and realizes she doesnt have the resources to take proper care of the child or maybe shes got too many children already or for whatever reason if a woman chooses to have a child instead of abort it and gives it up for adoption she usually has such strong emotions that her mental health demands an absolute break from the past she trains herself to believe that the child is on another planet she struggles to go on with her life as far as im concerned its cruel for a lawyer or a son or a daughter to track her down many years later and remind her of i understand you say but in this case the mother is probably dead beckys fingers stop tapping keep talking counselor i dont have a client or to put it another way i do but the client is you point toward your chest you i think i you explain about the drunk driver about the deaths of the man and woman that you lovingly thought of as your parents and you want to know if they were your parents becky asks yes and if ive got a twin a brother or a sister that i never knew about and you almost add if i was born a jew counselor i apologize but youre a fool thats what my wife and uncle say not to mention a cop in redwood point redwood point a small town forty miles south of here forty or four thousand miles what difference does any of this make did esther and simon love you they worshipped me your eyes sting with grief then they are your parents counselor i was adopted and the man and woman who adopted me abused me thats why im in this office to make sure other adopted children dont go into homes where they suffer what i did at the same time i dont want to see a mother abused if a womans wise enough to know she cant properly raise a child if she gives it up for adoption in my opinion she deserves a medal she deserves to be protected i understand you say but i dont want to meet my mother shes probably dead all i want is i need to know if the fact was i adopted becky studies you nods picks up the phone and taps three numbers records charley how you doing kid great listen an attorney was down there a while ago wanted a sealed adoption file yeah you did the right thing but heres what i want it wont break the rules if you check to see if there is a sealed file becky tells him the date place and names that you earlier gave her ill hold minutes seem like hours she keeps listening to the phone then straightens yeah charley what have you got she listens again thanks she sets down the phone counselor theres no sealed file relax youre not adopted go back to your wife unless you say unless the adoption wasnt arranged through an agency but instead was a private arrangement between the birth mother and the couple who wanted to adopt the gray market yes but even then local officials have to sanction the adoption there has to be a legal record of the transfer in your case there isnt becky looks uncomfortable let me explain these days babies available for adoption are scarce because of birth control and legalized abortions but even today the babies in demand are wasps a black an hispanic an oriental forget it very few parents in those groups want to adopt and even fewer anglos want children from those groups fifty years ago the situation was worse there were so many wasps who got pregnant by mistake and wanted to surrender their babies counselor this might offend you but i have to say it i dont offend easily your last name is weinberg becky says jewish back in the thirties the same as now the majority of parents wanting to adopt were protestants and they wanted a child from a protestant mother if you were put up for adoption even on the gray market almost every couple looking to adopt would not have wanted a jewish baby the prospects would have been so slim that your mothers final option would have been the black market your cheek muscles twitch baby selling its a violation of the antislavery law paying money for a human being but it happens and lawyers and doctors who arrange for it to happen make a fortune from desperate couples who cant get a child any other way but what if my mother was scot becky blinks youre suggesting jewish couples you frown remembering the last names of parents you read in the ledgers meyer begelman markowitz weinberg jews so desperate for a baby that after looking everywhere for a jewish mother willing to give up her child they adopted wasps and arranged it so none of their relatives would know all speculation you strain to remind yourself theres no way to link mary duncan with you except that you were born in the town where she signed the agreement and the agreement is dated a week before your birthday tenuous evidence to say the least your legal training warns you that youd never allow it to be used in court even the uniform presence of jewish names on the birth certificates from redwood point that august so long ago has a possible benign and logical explanation the resort might have catered to a jewish clientele providing kosher meals for example perhaps thered been a synagogue but logic is no match for your deepening unease you cant account for the chill in the pit of your stomach but you feel that somethings terribly wrong back in your hotel room you pace struggling to decide what to do next go back to redwood point and ask chief kitrick more questions what questions hed react the same as becky hughes had assumptions mr weinberg inconclusive then it strikes you the name you found in the records dr jonathan adams the physician who certified not only your birth but all the births in redwood point your excitement abruptly falters so long ago the doctor would probably be dead by now at once your pulse quickens dead not necessarily simon and esther were still alive until three weeks ago grief squeezing your throat you concentrate dr adams might have been as young as simon and esther theres a chance he but how to find him the redwood point clinic went out of business in the forties dr adams might have gone anywhere you reach for the phone a year ago you were hired to litigate a malpractice suit against a drugaddicted ophthalmologist whose carelessness blinded a patient you spent many hours talking to the american medical association opening the phonenumber booklet that you always keep in your briefcase you call the amas national headquarters in chicago dr jonathan adams the deep male voice on the end of the line sounds eager to show his efficiency even through the static of a longdistance line you hear fingers tap a computer keyboard dr jonathan adams sorry there isnt a wait there is a jonathan adams junior an obstetrician in san francisco his office number is you hurriedly write it down and with equal speed press the numbers on your phone just as lawyers often want their sons and daughters to be lawyers so doctors encourage their children to be doctors and on occasion they give a son their first name this doctor might not be the son of the man who signed your birth certificate but you have to find out obstetricians another common denominator like father like a secretary answers dr adams please you say the doctor is with a patient at the moment may he call you back by all means this is my number you give it but i think hell want to talk to me now just tell him its about his father tell him its about the clinic at redwood point the secretary sounds confused but i cant interrupt when the doctors with a patient do it you say i guarantee hell understand the emergency well if youre certain yes absolutely just a moment please thirty seconds later a tense male voice says dr adams here whats this all about i told your secretary i assumed she told you its about your father its about nineteen thirtyeight its about the redwood point clinic i had nothing to do with oh dear jesus you hear a forceful click then static you set down the phone and nod throughout the stressful afternoon you investigate your only other lead trying to discover what happened to june engle the nurse whose name appears on the redwood point birth certificates if not dead shed certainly have retired by now even so many exnurses maintain ties with their former profession continuing to belong to professional organizations and subscribing to journals devoted to nursing but no matter how many calls you make to various associations you cant find a trace of june engle by then its evening between calls youve ordered room service but the poached salmon goes untasted the bile in your mouth having taken away your appetite you get the home phone number for dr adams from san francisco information a woman answers weary hes still at no just a minute i think i hear him coming in the door your fingers cramp on the phone the nowfamiliar taut male voice slightly out of breath says yes dr adams speaking its me again i called you at your office today about the redwood point clinic about nineteen thirtyeight you son of a dont hang up this time doctor all you have to do is answer my questions and ill leave you alone there are laws against harassment believe me i know all about the law i practice it in chicago then youre not licensed in california so you cant intimidate me by doctor why are you so defensive why would questions about that clinic make you nervous i dont have to talk to you but you make it seem youre hiding something if you dont you hear the doctor swallow why do you i had nothing to do with that clinic my father died ten years ago cant you leave the past alone not my past i cant you insist your father signed my birth certificate at redwood point in nineteen thirtyeight there are things i need to know the doctor hesitates all right such as blackmarket adoptions hearing the doctor inhale you continue i think your father put the wrong information on my birth certificate i think he never recorded my biological mothers name and instead put down the names of the couple who adopted me thats why there isnt a sealed birth certificate listing my actual mothers name the adoption was never legally sanctioned so there wasnt any need to amend the erroneous birth certificate on file at the courthouse jesus the doctor says am i right how the hell would i know i was just a kid when my father closed the clinic and left redwood point in the early forties if you were illegally adopted it wouldnt have anything to do with me exactly and your fathers dead so he cant be prosecuted besides the statute of limitations would have protected him and anyway it happened so long ago who would care except me but doctor youre nervous about my questions that makes it obvious you know something certainly you cant be charged for something your father did so what would it hurt if you tell me what you know the doctors throat sounds dry my fathers memory ah you say yes his reputation look im not interested in spreading scandal and ruining anybody dead or alive all i want is the truth about me who was my mother do i have a brother or a sister somewhere was i adopted so much money what you clutch the phone harder when my father closed the clinic and left redwood point he had so much money i was just a kid but even i knew he couldnt have earned a small fortune merely delivering babies at a resort and there were always so many babies i remember him walking up to the nursery every morning and then it burned down and the next thing he closed the clinic and bought a mansion in san francisco and never worked again the nursery the building on the ridge above town big with all kinds of chimneys and gables victorian yes and thats where the pregnant women lived you shiver your chest feels encased with ice my father always called it the nursery i remember him smiling when he said it why pick on him the doctor asks all he did was deliver babies and he did it well if someone paid him lots of money to put false information on birth certificates which i dont even know if he did but you suspect yes god damn it thats what i suspect dr adams admits but i cant prove it and i never asked its the gunthers you should blame they ran the nursery anyway if the babies got loving parents and if the adopting couples finally got the children they desperately wanted whats the harm who got hurt leave the past alone for a moment you have trouble speaking thank you doctor i appreciate your honesty i have only one more question get on with it i want to finish this the gunthers the people who ran the nursery a husband and wife i dont recall their first names have you any idea what happened to them after the nursery burned down god only knows dr adams says and what about june engle the nurse who assisted your father you said you had only one more question the doctor breathes sharply never mind ill answer if you promise to leave me alone june engle was born and raised in redwood point when we moved away she said she was staying behind it could be shes still there if shes still alive chilled again you set down the phone the same as last night a baby cries in the room next to yours you pace and phone rebecca youre as good as can be expected you say you dont know when youll be home you say you hang up the phone and try to sleep apprehension jerks you awake the morning is overcast as gray as your thoughts after checking out of the hotel you follow the desk clerks directions to cape verdes public library a disturbing hour of research later under a thickening gloomy sky you drive back to redwood point from the highway along the cliff the town looks even bleaker you steer down the bumpy road reach the ramshackle boardedup hotel and park your rented car through weeds that cling to your pantlegs you walk beyond the hotels oncesplendid porch find eroded stone steps that angle up a slope and climb to the barren ridge above the town barren with one exception the charred timbers and flamescorched toppled walls of the peaked gabled victorian structure that dr adams had called the nursery that word makes you feel as if an icy needle has pierced your heart the clouds hang deeper darker a chill wind makes you hug your chest the nursery and in nineteen fortyone you learned from old newspapers on microfilm at the cape verde library thirteen women died here burned to death incinerated their corpses grotesquely blackened and crisped in a massive blaze the cause of which the authorities were never able to determine thirteen women exclusively women you want to shout in outrage and were they pregnant and were there also sickened imagining their screams of fright their wails for help their shrieks of indescribable agony you sense so repressive an atmosphere about this ruin that you stumble back as if shoved with wavering legs that you barely control you manage your way down the unsteady stone slabs lurching through the clinging weeds below the slope you stumble past the repulsive ruins of the hotel to reach your car where you lean against its hood and try not to vomit sweating despite the increasingly bitter wind the nursery you think dear god the redwood bar is no different than when you left it chief kitrick and his friends again play cards at the far right corner table the haze of cigarette smoke again dims the light above them the waiter stands behind the bar on your left the antique nautical instruments gleaming on a shelf behind him but your compulsion directs you toward the wrinkled faded photographs on the wall to your right this time you study them without innocence you see a yellowed image of the peaked gabled nursery you narrow your gaze toward small details that you failed to give importance the first time you saw these photographs several woman diminished because the cameraman took a long shot of the large victorian building sit on a lawn thats bordered by flower gardens their backs to a windowed brick wall of the your mind balks the nursery each of the women young so young holds an infant in her lap the women smile so sweetly are they acting were they forced to smile was one of those women your mother is one of those infants you mary duncan what desperation made you smile like that behind you chief kitricks husky voice says these days not many tourists pay us a second visit yeah i cant get enough of redwood point turning you notice that chief kitrick it isnt yet five oclock holds a glass of beer you might say it haunts me chief kitrick sips his beer i gather you didnt find what you wanted at the courthouse actually i learned more than i expected your voice shakes do you want to talk here or in your office it depends on what you want to talk about the gunthers you pass through the squeaky gate in the office chief kitrick sits behind his desk his face looks more flushed than two days ago the gunthers my my i havent heard that name in years what about them thats the question isnt it what about them tell me chief kitrick shrugs there isnt much i dont remember them i was just a toddler when they all i know is what i heard when i was growing up and thats not a lot a husband and wife they ran a boarding house the nursery chief kitrick frowns i dont believe i ever heard it called the nursery whats that supposed to mean the gunthers took in young women pregnant women and after the babies were born the gunthers arranged to sell them to desperate jewish couples who couldnt have children of their own blackmarket adoptions chief kitrick slowly straightens blackmarket where on earth did you get such a crazy you press your hands on the desk and lean forward see back then adoption agencies didnt want to give babies to jews instead of wasps so the gunthers provided the service they and the doctor who delivered the babies earned a fortune but i dont think thats the whole story ive got a terrible feeling theres something more something worse although im not sure what it is all i do know is that thirteen women they were probably pregnant died in the fire that destroyed the nursery in nineteen fortyone oh sure the fire chief kitrick says i heard about that fact is i even vaguely remember seeing the flames up there on the bluff that night despite how little i was the whole town was lit like day a terrible thing all those women dying like that yes you swallow terrible and then the gunthers left and so did the doctor why chief kitrick shrugs your guess is as good as maybe the gunthers didnt want to rebuild maybe they thought it was time for a change no i think they left because the fire happened in november and the authorities started asking questions about why all those women and only women were in that boarding house after the tourist season was over i think the gunthers and the doctor became so afraid that they left town to make it hard for the authorities to question them they wanted to discourage an investigation that might have led to charges being filed think all you want theres no way to prove it but i can tell you this as i grew up id sometimes hear people talking about the gunthers and everything the townsfolk said was always about how nice the gunthers were how generous sure redwood point was once a popular resort but that was just during the tourist season the rest of the year the thirties the depression this town would have starved if not for that boarding house that place was always busy year round and the gunthers always spent plenty of money here so many guests they ate a lot of food and the gunthers bought it locally and they always hired local help cooks maids ladies in town to do washing and ironing caretakers to manage the grounds and make sure everything was repaired and looked good this town owed a lot to the gunthers and after they left well thats when things started going to hell redwood point couldnt support itself on the tourists alone the merchants couldnt afford to maintain their shops as nice as before the town began looking dingy not as many tourists came fewer and well you can see where we ended at one time though this town depended on the gunthers and you wont find anyone speaking ill about them exactly thats what bothers me i dont understand all those pregnant women coming to that boarding house you say all year round all through the thirties into the early forties even if the gunthers hadnt hired local servants the town couldnt have helped but notice that something was wrong about that boarding house the people here knew what was going on couples arriving childless but leaving with a baby the whole town even the chief of police had to be aware that the gunthers were selling babies now stop right there chief kitrick stands his eyes glinting with fury the chief of police back then was my father and i wont let you talk about him like that you raise your hands in disgust the scheme couldnt have worked unless the chief of police turned his back the gunthers probably bribed him but then the fire ruined everything because it attracted outsiders fire investigators the county medical examiner maybe the state police and when they started asking questions about the nursery the gunthers and the doctor got out of town i told you i wont listen to you insult my father bribes why my father never sure you say a pillar of the community just like everybody else get out right as soon as you tell me one more thing june engle is she still alive is she still here in town i never heard of her chief kitrick growls right chief kitrick glares from the open door to his office you get in your car drive up the bumpy street make a uturn and pass him the chief glares harder in your rearview mirror you see his diminishing angry profile you reduce speed and steer toward the left as if taking the upward jolting road out of town but with a cautious glance toward the chief you see him stride in nervous victory along the sidewalk you see him open the door to the bar and the moment youre out of sight around the corner you stop the clouds are darker thicker lower the wind increases keening sporadic raindrops speckle your windshield you step from the car button your jacket and squint through the biting wind toward the broken skeleton of the pier the old man you met two days ago no longer slumps on his rickety chair but just before you turned the corner movement on your right through a dusty window in a shack near the pier attracted your attention you approach the shack the door to which faces the seething ocean but you dont have a chance to knock before the wobbly door creaks open the old man wearing a frayed rumpled sweater cocks his head frowning a homemade cigarette dangling from his lips you reach for your wallet i spoke to you the other day remember yep you take a hundreddollar bill from your wallet the old mans bloodshot eyes widen beyond him on a table in the shack you notice a halfdozen empty beer bottles want to earn some quick easy money depends june engle so ever heard of her yep is she still alive yep here in town yep where can i find her this time of day what the old man tells you makes your hand shake when you hand him the money shivering but not from the wind you return to your car you make sure to take an indirect route to where the old man sent you lest the chief glance out the tavern window and see you driving past at the synagogue the old man told you or what used to be the aint that what they call it a synagogue the sporadic raindrops become a drizzle a chilling dampness permeates the car despite its blasting heater at the far end of town above the beach you come to a dismal singlestory flatroofed structure the redwood walls are cracked and warped the windows are covered with peeling plywood waisthigh weeds surround it heart pounding you step from the car ignore the wind that whips drizzle against you and frown at a narrow path through the weeds that takes you to the front door a slab of plywood the door hangs by one hinge and almost falls as you enter you face a small vestibule sand has drifted in an animal has made a nest in a corner cobwebs hang from the ceiling the pungent odor of mold attacks your nostrils hebraic letters on a wall are so faded that you cant read them but mostly what you notice is the path through the sand and dust on the floor toward the entrance to the temple the peak of your skull feels naked instinctively you look around in search of a yarmulke but after so many years there arent any removing a handkerchief from your pocket you place it on your head open the door to the temple and find yourself paralyzed astonished by what you see the temple or what used to be the temple is barren of furniture the back wall has an alcove where a curtain once concealed the torah before the alcove an old woman kneels her withered hips on her bony knees a handkerchief tied around her head she murmurs hands fidgeting as if she holds something before her at last youre able to move inching forward pausing beside her you see the surprising incongruous object she clutches a rosary tears trickle down her cheeks as close as you are you still have to strain to distinguish what she murmurs deliver us from evil amen june engle she doesnt respond just keeps fingering the beads and praying hail mary blessed is the fruit of thy womb june my name is jacob weinberg pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death june i want to talk to you about dr adams about the clinic the old womans fingers tighten on the rosary slowly she turns and blinks up through tearbrimmed eyes the clinic yes and about the gunthers about the nursery god help me god help them she wavers her face pale come on june youll faint if you kneel much longer ill help you up you touch her appallingly fleshless arms and gently raise her to her feet she wobbles you hold her husk of a body against you the nursery is that why youre here june youre doing penance thirty pieces of silver yes your voice echoes eerily i think i understand dr adams and the gunthers made a lot of money did you make a lot of money june did they pay you well thirty pieces of silver tell me about the nursery june i promise youll feel better ivy rose heather iris you cringe suspecting that shes gone insane she seems to think that the nursery refers to a plant nursery but she knows better she knows that the nursery had nothing to do with plants but instead with babies from unmarried pregnant women or at least she ought to know unless the consequence of age and what seems to be guilt has affected her mind and her memory she appears to be freeassociating violet lily daisy fern she babbles your chest cramps as you realize that those words make perfect sense in the context of they might be are those names june youre telling me that the women in the nursery called themselves after plants and flowers orval gunther chose them anonymous june weeps nobody would know who they really were they could hide their shame protect their identities but how did they learn about the nursery advertisements junes shriveled knuckles paw at her eyes in bigcity newspapers the personal columns advertisements but that was taking an awful risk the police might have suspected no not orval he never took risks he was clever so clever all he promised was a rest home for unmarried pregnant women feel alone the ad read need a caring trained staff to help you give birth in strictest privacy no questions asked we guarantee to relieve your insecurity let us help you with your burden sweet lord those women understood what the ad was really about they came here by the hundreds june trembles against you her tears soak through your jacket as chilling as the winddriven rain that trickles through the roof did those women get any money for the babies they gave to strangers get the opposite they paid june stiffens her feeble arms gaming amazing strength as she pushes from your grasp orval that son of a he charged them room and board five hundred dollars her knees sag you grasp her five hundred and the couples who took the babies how much did the gunthers get from them sometimes as high as ten thousand dollars the arms with which you hold her shake ten thousand dollars during the depression hundreds of pregnant women dr adams jr hadnt exaggerated the gunthers had earned a fortune and orvals wife was worse than he was eve she was a monster all she cared about was pregnant women didnt matter babies didnt matter money mattered but if you thought they were monsters june why did you help them she clutches her rosary thirty pieces of silver holy mary mother of ivy rose heather iris violet lily daisy fern you force her to look at you i told you my name was jacob weinberg but i might not be i think my mothers name was mary duncan i think i was born here in nineteen thirtyeight did you ever know a woman who june sobs mary duncan if she stayed with the gunthers she wouldnt have used her real name so many women she might have been orchid or pansy theres no way to tell she was pregnant with twins she promised to give up both children do you remember a woman who twins several women had twins the gunthers damn them were ecstatic twenty thousand instead of ten but my parents the word sticks in your mouth took only me was that common for childless parents to separate twins money june cringes it all depended on how much money the couples could afford sometimes twins were separated theres no way to tell where the other child went but werent there records the gunthers were smart they never kept records in case the police and then the fire even if there had been records secret records the fire would have your stomach plummets despite your urgent need for answers you realize youve reached a dead end then june murmurs something that you barely hear but the little you do hear chokes you what i didnt june please say that again thirty pieces of silver for that i how i paid seven stillborn children yours i thought with the money the gunthers paid me my husband and i could raise our children in luxury give them every advantage send them to medical school or god help me what i did for the gunthers cursed my womb it made me worse than barren it doomed me to carry lifeless children my penance it forced me to suffer just like the mothers who gave up their children and possibly later regretted it no like the what you hear next makes you retch blackmarket adoptions you told chief kitrick but i dont think thats the whole story ive got the terrible feeling that theres something more something worse although im not sure what it is now youre sure what that something worse is and the revelation makes you weep in outrage show me june you manage to say take me i promise itll be your salvation you try to remember what you know about catholicism you need to confess and after that your conscience will be at peace ill never be at peace youre wrong june you will youve kept your secret too long it festers inside you you have to let out the poison after all these years your prayers here in the synagogue have been sufficient youve suffered enough what you need now is absolution you think if i go there june shudders and pray one last time yes i beg you show me your torment will finally end so long i havent been there since nineteen fortyone thats what i mean june its time its finally time through biting wind and chilling rain you escort june from the ghost of the synagogue into the sheltering warmth of your car youre so angry that you dont bother taking an indirect route you dont care if chief kitrick sees you driving past the tavern in fact you almost want him to you steer left up the bumpy road out of town its jolts diminished by the stormsoaked earth when you reach the coastal highway you assure june yet again and prompt her for further directions its been so long i dont yes turn to the right she says a half mile later she trembles adding now left here up that muddy road do you think you can force this car through the mud to the top if i have to ill get out and push and if that doesnt work well walk god help me ill carry you ill sink to my knees and crawl but the cars frontwheel drive defeats the mud at once you gain traction thrust over a hill swivel to a stop and frown through the rain toward an unexpected meadow even in early october the grass is lush amazingly horribly so knowing its secret you suddenly recall from your innocent youth lines from a poem you studied in college walt whitmans song of myself a child said what is the grass fetching it to me with full hands how could i answer the child i do not know what it is anymore than he i guess it must be the flag of my disposition you force your way out of the car you struggle around its hood ignore the mud confront the stinging wind and rain and help june waver from the passenger seat the bulletdark clouds roil above the meadow was it here you demand tell me is this the place yes cant you hear them wail cant you hear them suffer the flag of my disposition out of hopeful green stuff woven or i guess it is the handkerchief of the lord or i guess the grass is itself a child the produced babe of the vegetation june in the name of god rain stings your face tell me a uniform hieroglyphic sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones growing among black folks as among white tell me june cant you sense cant you feel the horror yes june you sink to your knees you caress the grass i can and now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves how many june you lean forward your face almost touching the grass two hundred maybe more all those years so many babies june weeps behind you i finally couldnt count anymore but why you raise your head toward the angry rain why did they have to die some were sickly some were deformed if the gunthers decided they couldnt sell them they murdered them smothered them strangled them let them starve to death the wails june cringes those poor hungry suffering babies some took as long as three days to die in my nightmares i heard them wailing i still hear them wailing june hobbles toward you at first the gunthers took the bodies in a boat and dumped them at sea but one of the corpses washed up on the beach and if it hadnt been for the chief of police they bribed junes voice breaks so the gunthers decided they needed a safer way to dispose of the bodies they brought them here and buried them in paper bags or potato sacks or butter boxes butter boxes some of the babies were born prematurely june sinks beside you weeping they were small so terribly small two hundred the frenzied wind thrusts your words down your throat with a shudder you realize that if your mother was mary duncan scot the gunthers might have decided that you looked too obviously gentile they might have buried you here with your brother or your sister your twin is your counterpart under the grass you clutch you shriek two hundred despite the howl of the storm you hear a car its engine roaring its tires spinning fighting for traction in the mud you see a police car crest the rainshrouded hill and skid to a stop chief kitrick shoves his door open stalking toward you through the raging gloom god damn it i told you to leave the past alone you rise from the grass draw back a fist and strike his mouth so hard he drops to the mushy ground you knew you son of a bitch you knew all along the chief wipes blood from his mangled lips in a fury he fumbles to draw his gun thats right go ahead kill me you spread out your arms lashed by the rain but junell be a witness and youll have to kill her as well so what though huh two murders wont matter will they not compared to a couple of hundred children i had nothing to do with killing these babies no but your father did he wasnt involved he let it happen he took the gunthers money and turned his back that makes him involved hes as much to blame as the gunthers the whole fucking town was involved you pivot toward the ridge buffeted by the full strength of the storm in the blinding gale you cant see the town but you scream at it nonetheless you sons of bitches you knew you all let it happen you did nothing to stop it thats why your town fell apart god cursed you bastards abruptly you realize the terrible irony of your words bastards all of these murdered children were bastards you spin toward the grass the beautiful uncut hair of graves falling you hug the rainsoaked earth the drenched lush leaves of grass poor babies you cant prove a thing chief kitrick growls all youve got are suppositions after fifty years there wont be anything left of those babies theyve long since rotted and turned into grass you moan tears scalding your face the beautiful grass the doctor who delivered the babies is dead the gunthers my father kept track of them died as well in agony if that satisfies your need for justice orval got stomach cancer eve died from alcoholism and now they burn in hell june murmurs i was raised to be im a jew you moan and suddenly understand the significance of your pronouncement no matter the circumstances of your birth you are a jew totally completely i dont believe in hell but i wish oh god how i wish the only proof you have chief kitrick says is this old woman a catholic who goes every afternoon to pray in a ruined synagogue shes nuts youre a lawyer you know her testimony wouldnt be accepted in court its over weinberg it ended fifty years ago no it never ended the grass keeps growing you feel the chill wet earth you try to embrace your brother or your sister and quiver with the understanding that all of these children are your brothers and sisters god have mercy on them what do you think has become of the children they are alive and well somewhere the smallest sprout shows there is really no death and if ever there was it led forward life and does not wait at the end to arrest it all goes onward and outward nothing collapses and to die is different from what anyone supposed and luckier luckier you embrace the grass luckier through the rainsoaked earth you think you hear babies crying and raise your face toward the furious storm swallowing rain tasting the salt of your tears you recite the kaddish prayers you mourn mary duncan simon and esther weinberg your brother or your sister all these children and yourself deliver us from evil june engle murmurs pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death back in just after i finished graduate school at penn state i took a weekend off and drove with a close friend to his home near pittsburgh on an august afternoon we went to a compound that some friends of his father had built in the mountains it had a swimming hole a barbecue pit a bunk house and i still see it vividly a shrine its contents haunted me until finally twentytwo years later i had to write about it again the theme is grief a subject i returned to often after marts death the shrine was nominated by the horror writers association as the best novella of the shrine grady was in the mausoleum when the beep from his pager disrupted his sobbing the mausoleum was spacious and bright with shiny marble slabs that concealed the niches into which coffins had been placed in an alcove near the tall wide windows that flanked the main entrance glinting squares of glass permitted mourners to stare within much smaller niches and view the bronze urns that contained the ashes of their loved ones plastic bronzecolored letters and numbers that formed the names of the deceased as well as their birth and death dates were glued upon the squares of glass and it was toward two of those panes toward the urns behind them that grady directed his attention although his vision was blurred by tears hed chosen cremation for his wife and tenyearold son partly because theyd already been burned in a fiery car crash with a drunken driver but more because he couldnt bear the thought of his cherished wife and child decomposing in a coffin in a niche in the mausoleum or worse outside in the cemetery beneath the ground where rain or the deep cold of winter would make him cringe because of their discomfort even though the remaining rational part of gradys mind acknowledged that it didnt matter to his fiercely missed family who now felt nothing because they were dead but it mattered to him just as it mattered that each monday afternoon he made a ritual of driving out here to the mausoleum of sitting on a padded bench across from the wall of glassedin urns and of talking to helen and john about what had happened to him since the previous monday about how he prayed that they were happy and most of all about how much he missed them theyd been dead for a year now and a year was supposed to be a long time but he couldnt believe the speed with which it had gone his pain remained as great as the day hed been told they were dead his emptiness as extreme friends at first had been understanding but after three months and especially after six most of those friends had begun to show polite impatience making wellintentioned speeches about the need for grady to put the past behind him to adjust to his loss to rebuild his life so grady had hidden his emotions and pretended to take their advice his burden made greater by social necessity the fact was he came to realize that no one who hadnt suffered what he had could possibly understand that three months or six months or a year meant nothing gradys weekly visits to the mausoleum became a secret their halfhour concealed within his monday routine sometimes he brought his wife and son flowers and sometimes an emblem of the season a pumpkin at halloween a styrofoam snowball in winter or a fresh maple leaf in the spring but on this occasion just after the fourth of july weekend hed brought a miniature flag and unable to control the strangled sound of his voice he explained to helen and john about the splendor of the fireworks that hed witnessed and that theyd used to enjoy while eating hot dogs at the citys annual picnic in the sloped wooded park near the river on independence day if only you could have seen the skyrockets grady murmured i dont know how to describe their colors were so the beep from the pager on his gunbelt interrupted his halting monologue he frowned the pager was one of many innovations that hed introduced to the police force he commanded after all his officers frequently had to leave their squad cars responding to an assignment or merely sitting in a restaurant on a coffee break but while away from their radios they needed to know whether headquarters was desperate to contact them its persistent beep made grady stiffen he wiped his tears braced his shoulders said goodbye to his wife and son and stood with effort reluctantly leaving the mausoleum locking its door behind him that was important helen and john their remains needed to be protected and the cemeterys caretaker had been as inventive as grady had been about the pager arranging for every mourner to have a key so that only those who had a right could enter outside the july afternoon was bright hot humid and horribly reminiscent of the sultry afternoon a year ago when grady had come here accompanied by friends and a priest to inter the precious urns he shook his head to clear his mind and stifle his tortured emotions then approached the blackandwhite cruiser where he leaned inside to grab the twoway radio microphone grady here dinah whats the problem he released the transmit button on the microphone dinahs staccato response surprised him publicservice dispatch grady frowned on my way five minutes uneasy he drove from the cemetery publicservice dispatch meant that whatever dinah needed to tell him was so sensitive that she didnt want a civilian with a policeband radio to overhear the conversation grady would have to use a telephone to get in touch with her after parking at a gas station across from the cemetery he entered a booth beside an ice machine thrust coins in the telephones slot and jabbed numbers bosworth police dinah said dinah its me whats so important that youre not going to like this the deepvoiced female dispatcher said its never good news when you page me publicservice dispatch why weve got a combination oneeightyseven and tenfiftysix grady winced those numbers meant a murdersuicide youre right his voice dropped i dont like it it gets worse its not in our jurisdiction the state police are handling it but they want you on the scene i dont understand why would that be worse if it isnt in our jurisdiction chief i say it i dont want to say it dinah you know the victims for a moment grady had trouble breathing he clutched the phone harder who brian and betsy roth shit grady thought shit shit shit brian and betsy had been the friends hed depended upon after all his other friends had distanced themselves when his grief persisted now one of them had killed the other and after that the executioner had committed suicide gradys pulse sped making his mind swirl who did what to the huskythroated female dispatcher said brian did a fortyfive semiautomatic christ oh jesus christ grady thought the puzzling directions grady received took him not to brian and betsys home where hed assumed the killings would have occurred but instead through and past the outskirts of bosworth into the mountains west of town pennsylvania mountains low thickly wooded rounded at their peaks between them primitive roads led into hidden hollows in a turmoil confused grady wouldnt have known which lane to take if it hadnt been for the statepolice car blocking one entrance a squarejawed trooper dropped his cigarette crushed it into the gravel with his shoe and narrowed his eyes when grady stopped his cruiser im looking for lieutenant clauson grady said when the trooper heard gradys name he straightened and the lieutenants waiting for you with remarkable efficiency for so large a man the trooper backed his car from the entrance to the lane allowing grady to drive his own car up the narrow draw leaves brushed against gradys side window just before the first sharp curve grady glanced toward his rearview mirror and saw the statepolice car again block the entrance at once he jerked the steering wheel veering left then behind as well as ahead he saw only forest the lane tilted ever more upward it kept forcing grady to zigzag and increased his anxiety as branches scraped the top of his car in addition to his windows the dense shadows of the forest made him feel trapped brian shot betsy and then shot himself no why i needed them i depended on i loved them what on earth had made them come out here why had they been in the woods the lane became level straightened and suddenly brought grady from the forest to a sunbathed plateau between two mountains where an open gate in a chainlink fence revealed a spacious compound several cinderblock buildings of various sizes on the left a barbecue pit adjacent to them and a swimming pool on the right grady parked behind three statepolice cars an ambulance a blue station wagon marked medical examiner and a red jeep cherokee that grady recognized as belonging to brian and betsy several state troopers along with two ambulance attendants and an overweight man in a gray suit formed a cluster at the near rim of the swimming pool their backs to grady but as grady opened his door one of the troopers turned studied him glanced back toward the rim of the pool again studied grady and with a somber expression approached him lieutenant clauson middle forties tall pronounced nose and cheekbones trim clausons doctor had ordered him to lose weight grady remembered short receding sandy hair on occasion clauson and grady had worked together when a crime was committed in one jurisdiction and a suspect was apprehended in the other ben jeff did your dispatcher explain clauson looked uneasy grady nodded grim brian shot betsy and then himself why the hell would he thats what we were hoping you could tell us grady shivered despite the afternoon heat how would i know you and the roths were friends i hate to ask you to do this do you think you can would you look at the bodies yes clauson furrowed his brow more uneasy if you wouldnt mind jeff just because my wife and son died i can still do my job even though brian and betsy were friends of mine i can do whatevers necessary im ready to help i figured then why did you have to ask because youre involved what first things first clauson said you look at the bodies i show you what your friend brian had in his hand clutched around the grip of the fortyfive and then we talk the stench of decay pinched gradys nostrils a waisthigh wooden fence enclosed the swimming pool grady followed clauson through an opening onto a concrete strip that bordered the pool one of the policemen was taking photographs of something on the concrete while the overweight man in the gray suit suggested various angles when the other policemen saw clauson and grady arrive they parted to give them room and grady saw the bodies the shock made him sick his friends lay facedown on the concrete redwood deck chairs behind them their heads toward the pool or what was left of their heads thecaliber bullets had done massive damage behind betsys right ear and brians the impact wound was a thick black clot of blood on the opposite side at the top of each brow near the temple the exit wound was a gaping hole from which blood brain bone and hair had spattered the concrete a repugnant swarm of flies buzzed over the gore the was next to brians right hand are you all right clauson touched gradys arm grady swallowed ill manage although hed been the police chief of bos worth for almost ten years hed seen few gunshot victims after all bosworth was a modestsized town there wasnt much violent crime mostly the corpses hed viewed had been due to car accidents that thought suddenly reminded him of the accident in which his wife and son had died and he felt grief upon grief for his friends for his family determined to keep control grady sought refuge in forcing himself to muster professional habits to try to be objective these corpses grady struggled to order his troubled thoughts have started to bloat even as hot as its been they wouldnt be this swollen unless this didnt happen today clauson nodded as close as we can tell it was early yesterday the overweight man in the gray suit interrupted ill know for sure when i do the autopsy the man was the countys medical examiner he gestured for the trooper to stop taking photographs i think thats enough he turned to the ambulance attendants you can move them now he pivoted toward clauson provided you dont object clauson thought about it and shrugged weve done as much as we can for now go ahead feeling colder grady heard the zip of bodybags being opened to distract himself he stared toward the glistening blue water of the swimming pool while the attendants put on rubber gloves he was grateful when clauson spoke further distracting him brian and betsy were expected home yesterday evening clauson said when brians sister phoned and didnt get an answer she figured they must have changed their plans and spent the night here but when she called again in the morning and still didnt get an answer and when it turned out that brian hadnt opened the restaurant this morning his sister got worried this place doesnt have a phone so she drove out here and found the bodies grady said and then phoned you clauson nodded in the background the attendants strained to lift a bulging bodybag onto a gurney then rolled it toward the ambulance grady forced himself to continue it looks as if they were both sitting in these deck chairs facing the pool the impact of the bullets knocked them out of the chairs thats how we figure it clauson said which tends to suggest they werent arguing at least not so bad that it made brian angry enough to shoot betsy and then shoot himself when he realized what hed done gradys throat tightened people are usually on their feet when theyre shouting at each other but its almost as if the two of them were just sitting here enjoying the view then brian goes to get the pistol or else hes already got it on him but why why would he decide to shoot her and why would betsy just sit there assuming she knew brian had the gun he planned it clauson said obviously or else he wouldnt have had the gun thats not the only reason i know brian planned it clauson pointed downward look at the gun grady lowered his gaze toward the concrete avoiding the black clots at the rim of the pool and the contrasting white chalk silhouettes of where the bodies had been he concentrated on the weapon yes he sighed i get the point the slide on the was all the way back projecting behind the hammer the only time a did that grady knew was when the magazine in the pistols handle was empty brian didnt load the magazine completely he put in only two rounds one for betsy one for himself clauson said so what does that tell you brian thought about this carefully grady felt appalled he respected guns he didnt load the magazine completely because he knew that otherwise the gun would selfcock after he fired the second shot after he killed himself and the pistol dropped from his hand as he fell he didnt want whoever found him to pick up a loaded gun and accidentally fire it maybe killing the person who held it he tried to do this as cleanly as possible grady forcefully shook his head from side to side cleanly what a poor choice of word but that was the way brian had thought brian had always worried that an animal he shot might be only wounded might escape to the forest and suffer for hours maybe days before it finally died in that sense the way brian had arranged to kill his wife and then himself was definitely clean two shots placed efficiently at the soft spot behind each victims ear a direct route to the brain instantaneous nonpainful death at least in theory only the victims knew if their death was truly painless and they couldnt very well talk about it grady frowned so severely that his head ached massaging his temples thinking of the bullets that had plowed through betsys skull and then brians he studied clauson usually someone does this because of marriage problems jealousy one of the partners having an affair but as far as i know brian and betsy had a faithful relationship you can bet ill make sure clauson said so will i the only other reason i can think of is that betsy might have had a fatal illness something they kept hidden because they didnt want to worry their friends when the disease got worse when betsy couldnt bear the pain brian with betsys permission stopped the pain and then because brian couldnt stand the agony of living without betsy he thats something else ill check for when i do the autopsy the medical examiner said and ill talk to her doctor clauson said determined gradys sadness fought with his confusion so how does this involve me you told me it was something about his hand something he clutched clauson looked reluctant im afraid theres no good way to do this im sorry ill just have to show you brian left a note i was going to ask if he did i need answers clauson pulled a plastic bag from a pocket in his shirt the bag contained a piece of paper grady murmured if brian left a note theres no question combined with the way he loaded the fortyfive theres no doubt he made careful plans perhaps along with grady shuddered ive got the terrible feeling betsy agreed that thought occurred to me clauson said but theres no way well ever know he had this piece of paper clutched around the grip of the pistol when the fortyfive dropped from his hand the note stuck to his fingers grady studied it and shivered the note was printed boldly in black ink tell ben grady bring him here that was all and it was too much bring me here why thats why i said we had to talk clauson bit his lip come on lets get away from where this happened i think its time for a stroll they emerged from the swimming pool area and crossed a stretch of gravel their footsteps crunching as they passed the barbecue pit as well as two redwood picnic tables and approached the largest of the cinderblock buildings it was thirty feet long and half as wide a metal chimney projected from the nearest wall and rose above the roof there were three dusty windows bring you here clauson echoed brians note that can mean different things to see the bodies or to see the compound i didnt know brian well but my impression is he wasnt cruel i cant imagine why hed have wanted you to see what hed done it makes me wonder if grady anticipated the rest of the question ive never been here in fact i didnt know this place existed even with the directions you relayed through my office i had trouble finding the lane and yet you and the roths were close only recently within the last year i met them at a meeting of the compassionate friends whats an organization for parents whove lost a child the theory is that only a parent in grief can understand what another parent in grief is going through so the grieving parents have a meeting once a month they begin the meeting by explaining how each child died theres usually a speaker a psychiatrist or some other type of specialist who recommends various ways of coping then the meeting becomes a discussion the parents whove suffered the longest try to help those who still cant believe what happened youre given phone numbers of people to call if you dont think you can stand the pain any longer the people you talk to try their best to encourage you not to give in to despair they remind you to take care of your health not to rely on alcohol or stay in bed all day instead to eat to maintain your strength to get out of the house to walk to find positive ways to fill your time community service that sort of thing clauson rubbed the back of his neck you make me feel embarrassed oh when your wife and son were killed i went to the funeral i came around to your house once but after that well i didnt know what to say or i told myself i didnt want to bother you i suppose i figured youd prefer to be left alone grady shrugged hollow thats a common reaction theres no need to apologize unless youve lost a wife and child of your own its impossible to understand the pain i pray to god i never have to go through it believe me my prayers go with you they reached the largest cinderblock building the lab crew already dusted for prints clauson opened the door and grady peered in there were sleeping bags on cots along each wall two long pine tables benches some cupboards and a woodburning stove obviously more people than brian and betsy used this place clauson said have you any idea who i told you ive never been here clauson closed the door and proceeded toward a smaller cinderblock building next to it this time when clauson unlatched and opened the door grady saw a woodburning cook stove with cans and boxes of food as well as pots pans bowls plates and eating utensils on shelves along the walls i assume clauson said that the barbecue pit was for summer and this was for rainy days or fall or maybe winter grady nodded there were twelve cots in the other building i noticed rain slickers and winter coats on pegs whoever they were they came here often all year round so what its a beautiful location a summer getaway a hunting camp in the fall a place for brian betsy and their friends to have weekend parties even in winter as long as the snow didnt block the lane yeah a beautiful location clauson shut the door to the kitchen directing grady toward the final and smallest structure this was the only building that was locked brian had the key on a ring along with his car keys i found the key in his pants pocket when clauson opened the door grady frowned the floors in the other buildings had been made from wooden planks except for fire bricks beneath the stoves but this floor was smooth gray slate in place of the cinderblock walls in the other buildings the walls in here had oak paneling instead of a stove a handsome stone fireplace had a shielded slab of wood for a mantle an american flag on each side and framed glistening photographs of eight smiling youngsters male and female positioned in a straight line above the flags the age of the youngsters ranged grady estimated from six to nineteen and one image of a boy blond with braces on his teeth with spectacles that made him look uncomfortable despite his determined smile reminded grady distressingly of his own so longedfor son he took in more details a church pew in front of the photographs above the fireplace ceramic candle holders on the mantel and he stepped closer troubled when he realized that two of the smiling faces in the photographs lovely freckled redheaded girls early teens were almost identical twins another pattern he noticed his brow furrowing was that the oldest males in the photographs two of them late teens had extremely short haircuts and wore military uniforms so what do you make of it clauson asked its almost like grady felt pressure in his chest like a chapel no religious objects but it feels like a chapel all the same some kind of shrine those twin girls ive seen them before the photographs i mean brian and betsy had copies in their wallets and showed them to me a couple of times when they invited me over for dinner they also had larger framed copies on a wall in their living room these are brian and betsys daughters gradys stomach hardened they died ten years ago when a roller coaster jumped its tracks at a midway near pittsburgh brian and betsy never forgave themselves for letting their daughters go on the ride guilt thats something else grieving parents suffer a lot of guilt grady stepped even closer to the photographs concentrating on the blond vibrant tenyearold boy with glasses and braces that reminded him so painfully of his son the likeness wasnt exactly the same but it was poignantly evocative guilt he thought yes guilt what if i hadnt been working late that night what if id been home and helen and john hadnt decided to go out for pizza and a movie that drunk driver wouldnt have hit their car theyd still be alive and its all my fault because i decided to catch up on a stack of reports that could just as easily have waited until the morning but no i had to be conscientious and because of that i indirectly killed my wife and son not showing it grady cringed from a deep black torture chamber of his mind he wailed silently in unbearable torment behind him clauson said something but grady didnt register what it was clauson spoke louder ben without removing his intense gaze from the photograph of the young blond boy grady murmured what do you recognize any of the other faces no this is just a hunch but maybe theres a pattern pattern well since those two girls are dead do you suppose could it be that all the kids in these photographs are dead gradys heart lurched abruptly he whirled toward the sound of a splash whats the matter clauson asked that splash grady moved toward the door someone fell into the pool splash i didnt hear anything gradys eyes felt stabbed by sunlight as he left the shadows of the tiny building he stared toward the state policemen at the concrete rim of the swimming pool the medical examiner was getting into his station wagon the ambulance was pulling away but the pool looked undisturbed and if anyone had fallen in the troopers didnt seem to care they merely kept talking among themselves and didnt pay attention what do you mean clauson asked there wasnt any splash you can see for yourself no one fell into the pool grady shook his head in bewilderment but i would have sworn disoriented he did his best to answer more questions and finally left the compound an hour later shortly after five just as clauson and his men were preparing to lock the buildings and the gate to the area then secure a yellow no admittance police crime scene tape across the fence and the gate troubled numb with shock aching with sorrow he trembled he used his twoway radio to contact his office while he drove along the winding road through the looming mountains back to bosworth he had a duty to perform but he couldnt let that duty interfere with his other duties the office had to know where hed be with brian roths sister the deaths of his wife and son the rules hed learned from attending the grief meetings of the compassionate friends had taught him that you had to do your best to offer consolation compassion was the greatest virtue but when he finally stopped at ida roths home a modest trailer in a row of other trailers on the outskirts of bosworth he didnt get an answer after he knocked on her flimsy metal door of course grady thought the undertaker the cemetery the double funeral ida has terrible arrangements to make shell be in a daze i wish id been able to get here in time to help her to gradys surprise the woman next door came over and told him where ida had gone but his surprise wasnt caused by the gossipy womans knowledge of idas schedule what surprised him was idas destination he thanked the neighbor avoided her questions and drove to where hed been directed five minutes away to the restauranttavern that brian and betsy had owned and where grady found ida roth sternly directing waitresses while she guarded the cash register behind the bar the customers mostly factory workers who regularly stopped by for a couple of beers after their shift was over eyed gradys uniform as he sat at the counter whenever he came in to say hello he was usually offduty and in civilian clothes for him to be wearing his uniform made this visit official the narrowed eyes that studied him seemed to say and the somberness of those narrowed eyes suggested as well that word had gotten around about what had happened to brian and betsy grady took off his policemans cap wished that the jukebox playing roy orbisons only the lonely werent so loud and who the hell had been morbid enough to choose that tune then studied idas gaunt determined features brians only and older sibling she was in her early fifties but she looked sixty partly because her hair was completely gray and she combed it back severely into a bun thus emphasizing the wrinkles in her forehead and around her eyes and partly as well because her persistent nervousness made her so thin that her cheeks looked hollow but mostly because her pursed lips made her expression constantly dour ida grady said when some people tell you this youve got every right to feel bitter the automatic reaction is to think bullshit get out of here leave me alone but you know that ive been where you are now a year ago when my wife and son were killed you know that im an expert in what im talking about that these arent empty words i understand what youre feeling with all my heart im sorry about brian and betsy ida glowered jerked her face toward a waitress blurted table fives still waiting for that pitcher of beer and scowled at grady while pressing her hand on the cash register sorry let me tell you something brian shut me out after his children died we visited we spent time together but things between us were never the same for the past ten years its been like we werent blood kin like idas facial expression became skeletal like there was some kind of barrier between us i resented that being made to feel like a stranger i tried all i could to be friendly to him as far as im concerned a part of brian died a long time ago what he did to betsy and himself was wrong but it might be the best thing that could have happened i dont understand grady leaned closer trying hard to ignore roy orbisons mournful song and the stares from the silent intense factory workers its no secret ida said you know the whole town knows my husband divorced me eight years ago after we were married i kept having miscarriages so we never had children it aged me how i hate that young secretary he ran off with all i got from the settlement from the greedy lawyers from the goddamned divorce judge is the rickety trailer im forced to shiver in when the weather gets cold youre sorry well let me tell you right now as much as i hurt im not sorry brian had it all and i had nothing when he shut me out the best thing he ever did for me was to shoot himself now this taverns mine finally ive got something grady felt shocked ida you dont mean that the hell i dont brian treated me like an outcast i earned this tavern i deserve it when they open the will idas stern expression became calculating if theres any justice brian promised me in spite of the distance he kept from me he said hed take care of me this taverns mine and i bet you could use a drink she stiffened her hand on the cash register thanks ida id like to but i cant im on duty grady lowered his gaze and dejectedly studied his hat maybe another time no times better than now this is happy hour if you cant be happy at least drown your sorrow call this a wake its two drinks for the price of one not while im in uniform but please remember i do share your grief ida didnt listen again barking orders toward a waitress disturbed grady picked up his cap and stood from the stool at the bar a professional instinct made him pause ida cant you see im busy i apologize but i need information where brian where betsy was what do you know about where it happened not a hell of a lot but you must know something you knew enough to go out there there ida thickened her voice there i was there only once but i felt so shut out so unwelcome so bitter believe me i made a point of remembering how to get there go over that again why do you think he made you feel unwelcome that place was ida furrowed her already severely pinched forehead his retreat his wall against the world her scowl increased i remember when he bought that hollow his children had been dead five months the summer had turned to fall it was hunting season brians friends made an effort to try to distract him come on lets hunt some rabbits some grouse they told him you cant just sit around all day he was practically dragged from his bedroom while ida continued to keep her left hand rigidly on the cash register she pointed her right hand toward the ceiling above the tavern indicating where brian and betsy had lived so brian he had no energy if it werent for me the tavern would have gone to hell he shuffled his feet and went along and the next day when he came back i couldnt believe the change in him he was filled with energy hed found some land he wanted to buy he said he was frantic that doesnt describe it he kept jabbering about a hollow in the mountains hed wandered into it he absolutely had to own it ida gave more commands to her waitresses and swung her dour gaze toward grady i figured brian must have had a nervous breakdown i told him he couldnt afford a second property but he wouldnt listen he insisted he had to buy it so despite my warning he used this tavern as what do they call it collateral he convinced the bank to loan him money found whoever owned that hollow and bought the damned thing thats the beginning of when he shut me out the next thing i heard it didnt come from him it was gossip from customers in the tavern was hed arranged with a contractor to put in a swimming pool out there some buildings a barbecue pit and the next year when construction was finished he invited me out there to see the grand opening i admit the place looked impressive i figured brian was getting over his loss adjusting to the deaths of his children but after he betsy and i and their friends and my fucking soontobe exhusband had a barbecue brian took me aside he pointed toward the woods toward the pool toward the buildings and he asked me i remember his voice was low hushed the way people talk in church he asked me if i felt anything different anything special anything that reminded me of anything that made me feel close to his dead children i thought about it i looked around i tried to understand what he meant finally i said no the camp looked fine i said he was taking a risk with the bank all the same if he needed a place where he could get away and heal his sorrow despite the financial risk hed probably done the right thing nothing about the swimming pool he asked i told him i didnt understand what he meant except that his children liked to swim and with that he ended the conversation that was the last time he invited me out there that was the real beginning of the distance between us the barrier he put up no matter that i saved his ass by taking care of the tavern back then just as im taking care of it now grady knew that hed exceeded the limit of idas patience he searched his troubled mind for a final question that might settle his confusion do you know who owned that hollow or why brian suddenly felt compelled to buy it you might as well ask me whos going to win the lottery he told me nothing and i told you i dont have time for this please im trying my best not to be rude but ive got customers this is the busiest time of the day happy hour makes all these people hungry ive got to make sure the kitchens ready sure grady said i apologize for distracting you i just wanted im sorry ida thats why i came here to tell you how much i sympathize ida glared toward a waitress table eight still needs those onion rings grady stepped back ignored the stares of the factory workers and left the tavern as the screen door squeaked shut as he trudged past pickup trucks toward his cruiser he heard the customers break their silence and murmur almost loudly enough to obscure another mournful tune this one by buddy holly i guess it doesnt matter anymore he radioed his office and told the dispatcher he was going home then he solemnly drove along sunsetcrimsoned wooded streets to the singlestory house hed shared with his wife and son the house it haunted him often hed thought about selling it to get away from the memories that it evoked but just as he hadnt disposed of helen and johns possessions their clothes the souvenir mugs that helen had liked to collect the video games that john had been addicted to playing so grady hadnt been able to convince himself to dispose of the house the memories tormented him yes but he couldnt bear to live without them at the same time the house troubled him because it felt empty because he hadnt maintained it since helen and john had died because he hadnt planted flowers this spring as helen always had because its interior was drab and dusty when he entered the kitchen there wasnt any question what hed do next the same thing he always did when he came home what hed done every evening since the death of his family he walked directly to a cupboard and pulled out a bottle of jim beam poured two inches into a glass added ice and water and drank most of it in three swallows he closed his eyes and exhaled there the compassionate friends were emphatic in their advice that people in grief shouldnt seek refuge in alcohol brian and betsy had emphasized that advice as well thered been no liquor bottles or beer cans at the camp grady had noticed whatever the cause of the murdersuicide anger caused by drunkenness had not been one of them hed pretended to follow the compassionate friends advice but at night in the depths of his sorrow he more and more had relied on bourbon to give him amnesia except that it didnt really dispel his memories all it did was blur them make them more bearable stupify him enough that he could sleep as soon as the bourbon impaired him enough to slur his speech he would put on his answering machine and if the phone rang if the message was something important from his office he would muster sufficient control to pick up the phone and say a few careful words that managed to hide how disabled he was if necessary he would mutter that he felt ill and order one of his men to take care of the emergency those were the only times grady violated his code of professionalism but just as hed failed to maintain this house so he knew and feared that one night he would make a mistake and inadvertently let outsiders know that hed failed in other ways as well at the moment however that fear didnt matter sorrow did and grady hurriedly poured another glass this time adding less ice and water he drank the refill almost as quickly brian and betsy helen and john no grady slumped against the counter and wept deep outbursts that squeezed his throat and made his shoulders convulse abruptly the phone rang startled he swung toward where it hung on the wall beside the back door it rang again grady hadnt put on the answering machine yet the way he felt he didnt know whether to let the phone keep ringing brian and betsy helen and john all grady wanted was to be left alone so he could mourn but the call might be from his office it might be important wiping his cheeks he straightened brooded and decided the bourbon hadnt begun to take effect he would still be able to talk without slurring his words whatever this call was about he might as well take care of it while he was still able his hand trembled as he picked up the phone hello ben its jeff clauson im sorry to bother you at home but this is important when i phoned your office one of your men told me where youd be something important what is it ive got some names tell me if theyre familiar jennings matson randall langley beck grady concentrated i cant put any faces to them no one ive met at least they didnt impress me enough to make me remember them im not surprised they dont they didnt live in bosworth they all came from nearby towns to the west between here and pittsburgh so why are they important i dont get the point they all died last thursday what after we finished at brians camp we drove back to headquarters we kept talking about what had happened one of my men who wasnt on our assignment jerked to attention at the mention of brian and betsy roth hed heard those names before he told me last thursday one of the worst traffic accidents hed ever investigated ten people killed all in one van a driver of a semitruck had a tire blow lost control and rammed into them the investigation revealed that the victims in the van had all been headed toward a fourth of july celebration in the mountains to a camp and thats why i wanted to talk to you the camp was owned by brian and betsy roth grady clutched the phone so hard that his hand cramped all ten of them were killed they met at one place left their cars and went in the van clauson said another goddamned traffic accident grady thought just like helen and john so on a hunch i made some calls clauson said to the relatives of the victims what i learned was that brian and betsy got around they didnt go to grief meetings just in bosworth they went to towns all around here remember back at the camp when i wondered about the photographs on the wall of the smallest building you called it a shrine well i had the notion that because two of the photographs showed brian and betsys dead children it could be there was a pattern and maybe the other photographs showed dead children too i remember well i was right every one of the couples who were killed in that accident had lost children several years ago your description of that building was correct that building was a shrine according to relatives the parents put up those photographs above the fireplace they lit candles they prayed they what a nightmare grady said you know about that nightmare more than i can ever imagine all twelve of them a private club devoted to sympathy maybe thats why brian lost control maybe he murdered betsy and then shot himself because he couldnt stand more grief maybe grady shuddered the pictures of the older children the two in military uniforms those young men were killed in vietnam thats how far back it goes i have a feeling it lasts forever grady thought the main thing is now weve got an explanation clauson said brian and betsy were prepared for a weekend gettogether but it didnt work out that way it turned out to be a weekend of brooding and depression and with the two of them alone out there brian decided he couldnt go on too much sorrow too damned much so he shot his wife for all we know he had her permission and then he shot himself grady exhaled does that make sense as much as well probably ever find out god help them grady said i realize this is hard for you to talk about clauson said i can handle it you did good jeff i cant say im happy but your theory holds together enough to set my mind to rest i appreciate your call grady wanted to scream i just thought youd like to know sure if theres anything more i hear ill call you back great fine do that ben what i dont want to make a mistake a second time if you need someone to talk to call me sure jeff if i need to count on it i mean what i said of course and i mean what i said if i need to talk to you i will thats all i wanted to hear grady hung up the phone pushed away from the wall and crossed the kitchen toward the bourbon the next morning early at four grady coughed and struggled from his bed the alcohol had allowed him to sleep but as its effects dwindled he regained consciousness prematurely long before he wanted to confront his existence his head throbbed his knees wavered stumbling into the bathroom he swallowed several aspirins palmed water into his mouth and realized that he still wore his uniform that he hadnt removed his clothes before he fell across his bed tell ben grady bring him here the dismaying note remained as vivid in gradys memory as when hed jerked his anguished gaze from the corpses and read the words on the plasticenclosed piece of paper that clauson had handed to him tell ben grady bring him here why grady thought everything jeff told me last night the ten people killed in the van the motive for brians depression made sense brian had reached the end of his endurance what doesnt make sense is brians insistence that i be contacted that i drive to the camp that i see the bullet holes gradys mind revolted chest heaving he leaned over the sink turned on the cold water and repeatedly splashed his clammy face he staggered to the kitchen and slumped at the table where the light hed switched on hurt his eyes alkaseltzer he thought i need but his impulse was canceled by the pile of envelopes and mailorder catalogues on the table when hed returned home last evening hed automatically grabbed his mail from the box outside while hed fumbled for his key hed thrown the mail on the kitchen table impatient to open the cupboard where he kept his bourbon now having propped his elbows on the table spreading the envelopes and catalogues he found himself staring at a letter addressed to him one of the few letters hed received since helen and john had died and helens relatives had stopped sending mail the instructions on the envelope benjamin grady cypress street bosworth pennsylvania then the zip code had been scrawled in black ink no return address but grady recognized the scrawl hed seen it often enough on compassionate cards that hed received not only in the days and weeks after helen and john had died but as well in month after month as the painful year progressed encouraging messages continuing sympathy from brian the postmark on the envelope was four days ago on friday grady grabbed the letter and tore it open dear ben it began and on top of the nightmare that had fractured gradys drunken sleep a further nightmare awaited him grady shuddered as he read the message from his wonderful generous stubbornly supportive friend who no longer existed dear ben when you receive this betsy and i will be dead i deeply regret the sorrow and shock my actions will cause you i dont know which will be worse the shock initially the sorrow persistently both are terrible burdens and i apologize if our bodies are found before you read this letter if the note i plan to write and place in my hand when i pull the trigger doesnt achieve my intention if something goes wrong and youre not asked to come here i want you to come here anyhow not to see the husks that contained our souls not to torment you with our undignified remains but to make sure you see this place its special ben it consoles i cant tell you how what i mean is i wont you have to find out for yourself if i raised your expectations and they werent fulfilled youd feel guilty convinced that you werent worthy and the last thing i want is to cause you more guilt nonetheless that possibility has to be considered it may be you wont be receptive to this place i cant predict for certain my sister wasnt receptive others werent receptive either so i chose carefully my friends who died on thursday were the few who understood the comfort that this place provided but now theyre dead and betsy and i dont want to be alone again too much too awful much ive been watching you carefully ben ive been more and more worried about you i have a suspicion that you drink yourself to sleep every night i know that you hurt as much as betsy and i do but weve been lucky enough to find consolation and im afraid for you i had planned to bring you out here soon i think youre ready i think youd be receptive i think that this place would give you joy so i left the note that instructed the state police to bring you here and now that i presume youve seen it i need to tell you that after i drive into town to mail this letter ill make a sidetrip to visit my lawyer i intend to amend my will my final compassionate act on your behalf is to give you this compound i hope that it will ease your suffering and provide you with peace youll know what i mean if youre truly receptive if youre as sensitive as i believe you are forgive me for the pain that our deaths will cause you but our deaths are necessary you have to accept my word on that we anticipate were eager what im about to do is not the result of despair i love you ben i know that sounds strange but its true i love you because were partners in misfortune because youre decent and good and in pain perhaps my gift to you will ease your pain when you read this betsy and i will no longer be in pain but in our final hours we pray for you we wish you consolation god bless you my friend be well brian beneath brians signature betsy had added her own grady moaned his tears dripping onto the page dissolving the ink on the final words blurring the signatures of his sorely missed friends jeff clausons frown deepened as he read the letter he read it again then again at last he leaned back from his desk and exhaled grady sat across from him brooding lord clauson said im sorry for waking you grady said i waited as long as i could force myself till after dawn before phoning your home really i thought youd be up by then i wanted to make sure you were going straight to your office instead of on an assignment i assumed youd want to see that letter right away clauson looked puzzled see it right away of course that isnt what i meant by a terrible way to start the morning i wasnt referring to me you ben i was sympathizing with you dear god im surprised you waited till after dawn in your place id have called my friend and thats what i hope you think i am at once grady shuddered you dont look so good clauson stood and reached toward a beaker of coffee youd better have another jolt of this he refilled gradys cup thanks gradys hands trembled as he raised the steaming cup the letter jeff what do you make of it clauson debated with himself the most obvious thing is betsys signature proves she agreed to brians plan this wasnt a murdersuicide but a double suicide betsy just needed a little help is all grady stared down at his cup the other obvious thing is the letter has gaps brian insists it was necessary to leave the note at the compound sending for you but he doesnt explain why sure he says he wants you to see the place but after you found out hed given it to you in his will youd have gone up to see it anyhow there wasnt any need for you to be forced to look at the bodies unless grady had trouble speaking suppose i was so repelled that the last thing i wanted was to see where brian shot betsy and himself what if i decided to sell the compound without ever going up there the truth is i dont want the compound brian might have been afraid of that so he left the note to make sure i did go up there clauson shrugged could be he tells you he wants you to see the compound because its clauson traced a finger down the letter special it consoles but he refuses to tell you how he says hes afraid he might give you expectations that wont be fulfilled i thought about that all the time i was driving here gradys throat tightened obviously brian betsy and those ten people who died in the traffic accident considered the compound a refuge a private club away from the world a beautiful setting where they could support each other brian might have felt that if in his letter he praised the compound too much id be disappointed because the place didnt matter as much as the company did at the same time the compound is special it truly is beautiful so he gave it to me maybe brian felt guilty because hed never included me in the group maybe he hoped that id start a group of my own who knows he was under stress he wasnt totally coherent so what are you going to do about it about the compound you said you dont want it are you really so repelled that you dont intend to go back that youll sell the place grady glanced down he didnt speak for several moments i dont know if hed given me something else lets say a watchword i throw it away because i didnt want to be reminded or would i cherish it two days later ida roth helped grady choose not that she intended to at the cemetery grady had hoped to be one of the pallbearers but ida had failed to ask him grady had tried to get in touch with her at her home and at the tavern but hed never been able to succeed sweating from the mornings heat and humidity he was reminded of the heat and humidity a year ago when hed arrived at this same cemetery carrying the urns of his wife and son into the mausoleum about to turn from the coffins and walk back to his car he felt a presence behind him an angry presence although how he sensed the presence he didnt know but the anger was eerily palpable and he froze when ida growled behind him you wont get away with this grady pivoted the glare in idas wrinklerimmed eyes was perplexing hed tried to get close to her before and after the funeral but shed avoided him at the graves hed done his best to make eye contact frustrated at the stubbornness with which shed looked away now though her gaze was disturbingly direct bastard her gaunt face framed by her tuggedback hair looked even more skeletal grady winced why are you calling me that ida i havent done anything against you i miss them im here to mourn them why are you dont play games with me what are you talking about the compound brians attorney told me about the will it wasnt enough that my damned brother had so much selfpity he let the tavern go to hell it wasnt enough that since he shot himself ive been scrambling to balance the taverns accounts so his creditors dont take over the place no i have to find out that while he mortgaged the tavern which i inherited the camp in the woods which you inherited is paid off free and clear i dont know how you tricked him i cant imagine how you used your dead wife and kid to fool him into giving you the compound but you can bet on this if it takes my last breath ill fight you in court brian swore hed take care of me by god i intend to make sure he keeps his word you dont deserve anything you werent there when his twins died you werent there to hold his hand you came later so count on this if its the last thing i do ill own that camp im tempted to have the buildings crushed the swimming pool filled in and everything covered with salt but damn it i need the money so instead ill have the will revoked and sell the place ill get the money i deserve and you you bastard wont get anything grady felt heat shoot through his body idas unforgivable accusation that hed used his grief for his dead wife and son to manipulate brian into willing him the compound made him so furious that he trembled fine ida whatever you want to do he shook more fiercely or try to do but listen carefully because theres something you dont realize until this minute i intended to give up the compound and transfer my title to you i believed you deserved it but you made a mistake you shouldnt have mentioned jesus no ive suddenly changed my mind that compounds mine i didnt want it but now i do to spite you ida for the insult to my wife and son youll rot in hell and ill rot in hell before you ever set foot on that camp again grady tore the yellow no admittance police crime scene tape from the chainlink fence at the compounds entrance using the key clauson had given him he unlocked the gate thrust it open and bitterly entered the camp the hollow between the mountains was oppressively silent as he flicked sweat from his brow and strode with furious determination toward the swimming pool through the wooden gate to the concrete border and the white chalk outlines of where the corpses had lain a few flies still buzzed over the vestiges of blood bone and brain watching them grady swallowed bile then straightened with indignant resolve fine he thought i can clean this up i can deal with the memories the main thing is i intend to keep what brian gave me ida wont have it in outrage grady spun from the chalk outlines left the pool area ignored the barbecue pit and approached the cinderblock bunkhouse despite his preoccupation he was vaguely aware that he repeated the sequence in which lieutenant clauson had taken him from building to building he glanced inside the bunkhouse gave even less attention to the cookstove in the separate kitchen and approached the smallest building the one that hed described to clauson as a shrine inside the gloom and silence were oppressive the slate floor should have made his footsteps echo instead it seemed to muffle them just as the oakpaneled walls seemed to absorb the intruding sounds of his entrance he uneasily studied the church pew before the fireplace he raised his intense gaze toward the photographs of the eight dead smiling children between the candle holders and the american flags above the mantel knees wavering he approached the photographs with reverence he touched the images of brian and betsys dead twin daughters so beautiful so full of life so soon destroyed god help them at last grady shifted his mournful eyes toward the poignant photograph of the tenyearold bespectacled embarrassedtosmilebecauseofthebracesonhisteeth boy who reminded grady so much of his own so profoundly missed son and again grady heard the startling sound of a splash he swung toward the open door with a frown he couldnt help recalling that the last time hed been in here hed also heard a splash from the swimming pool or so grady had been absolutely certain until hed hurried outside and studied the policemen next to the swimming pool and realized that hed been mistaken that no one had fallen in and yet the splash had been so vivid just as now with the difference that this time as grady hurried from the shadowy shrine into the stark glare of the summer sun he flinched at the sight of a young man late teens muscular with short brown hair wearing swimming goggles and a tiny hiphugging nylon suit stroking powerfully from the near end of the swimming pool water rippling muscles flexing toward the opposite rim the young mans speed was stunning his surge amazing grady faltered how the hell he hadnt heard a car approach he couldnt imagine the young man hiking up the lane to the compound taking off his clothes putting on his swimming suit and diving in unless the young man felt he belonged here or unless the teenager assumed that no one would be here but the kid must have seen my cruiser outside the gate grady thought why didnt he yell to get my attention if he belonged here or go back down the lane if he didnt belong there werent any clothes by the pool where had the kid undressed what in gods name was going on scowling grady overcame his surprise and ran toward the swimming pool hey he shouted what do you think youre doing you dont have any right to be here this place is mine get out of the pool get away from gradys voice broke as he rushed through the gate to the swimming pool the young man kept thrusting his arms kicking his legs surging across the swimming pool rebounding off the opposite end reversing his impulse stroking with determination grady shouted more insistently answer me stop damn it im a policeman youre trespassing get out of the pool before i but the swimmer kept stroking rebounded off the near rim and surged yet again toward the opposite edge grady was reminded of an olympic athlete who strained to achieve a gold medal im telling you one last time get out of the pool grady yelled his voice breaking youve got thirty seconds after that i radio for backup well drag you out and the swimmer ignored him churning flexing stroking grady had shouted so rapidly that hed hyperventilated he groped behind him clutched a redwood chair and leaned against it his chest heaved as his heart raced and his vision swirled he struggled to keep his balance and focus on the magnificent swimmer seconds passed minutes time lengthened paradoxically it also seemed suspended at last the swimmers strength began to falter after a final weary lap the young man gripped the far end of the swimming pool breathed deeply fumbled to prop his arms along the side and squirmed onto the concrete deck he stood with determination dripped water and plodded around the pool toward grady so youre finally ready to pay attention grady heaved himself away from the redwood chair are you ready to explain what the hell youre doing here the swimmer approached ignoring him grady unclenched his fists and shoved his angerhardened palms toward the swimmers shoulders but gradys palms he shivered passed through the swimmer at the same time the swimmer passed through him like a subtle shift of air of cold air and as grady twisted unnerved watching the swimmer emerge from his side then his swiveling chest he felt as if hed been possessed consumed then abandoned hey grady managed to shout abruptly the young man his sinewy body dripping water his cropped hair clinging to his drooping head his taut frame sagging vanished the hot humid air seemed to ripple with equal abruptness the air became still again the swimmer was gone gradys lungs felt empty he fought to breathe he fumbled toward the redwood chair but the moment he touched its reassuring firmness his sanity collapsed as did his body impossible a remnant of his logic screamed and as that inward scream echoed he stared toward the concrete the wet footprints of the swimmer were no longer visible grady sat in the chair for quite a while at last he mustered the strength to raise himself the young man had been a stranger and yet the young man had somehow looked unnervingly familiar no grady wavered sweat streaming down his face he obeyed an irresistible impulse and made his way toward the smallest building he entered the shrines brooding confines passed the church pew clasped the mantel above the fireplace raised his disbelieving gaze above the candles and concentrated on a photograph to his right a young man in a military uniform a handsome youngster whom clauson had said had been killed in vietnam the same young man whod been swimming with powerful strokes in the pool who had passed coldly through gradys body and had suddenly disappeared the bottle in the kitchen cupboard beckoned with unsteady hands grady poured gulped grimaced and shivered he didnt recall his drive from the compound through the mountains into bosworth im losing my mind he thought and tilted the bourbon over the glass but his anesthetic wasnt allowed to do its work the phone rang he grabbed it hello his voice seemed to come from miles away so youre finally home you bastard ida said i just thought youd like to know my lawyer agrees with me my brother was obviously out of his mind that wills invalid ida im not in the mood to argue gradys head throbbed well let a judge decide you goddamned bet ill see you in court youre wasting your time i intend to fight you on this but ill fight harder ida said you wont have a chance gradys ear throbbed when she slammed down the phone it rang again of all the he jerked it to his ear ida ive had enough dont call me again from now on have your lawyer talk to mine ben a mans voice sounded puzzled jeff my god im sorry i didnt mean to shout i thought it was you dont sound so good grady trembled it must have been a rough day clauson said you have no idea the reason im calling do you need company is there any way i can help grady slumped against the wall no but i appreciate your concern its good to know someone cares i think i can manage on second thought wait there is something tell me when you phoned me the other night when you told me about the traffic accident about the friends of brian and betsy whod been killed clauson exhaled i remember the names of the victims i was too upset to write them down who were they why on earth would you want to know that i cant explain right now clauson hesitated just a minute he made fumbling noises as if sorting through a file jennings matson randall langley beck i need their addresses and phone numbers grady said clauson supplied them adding mystified i dont understand why you want this information which parents lost their sons in vietnam langley and beck but why do you thanks i really appreciate this ill talk to you later im worried about you ben grady hung up the phone langley and beck grady studied the phone numbers both sets of parents had lived in towns between bosworth and pittsburgh he pressed the numbers for the langley residence no one answered that wasnt surprising since the langleys had been old enough to have lost a son in vietnam their other children if they had any would be in their thirties or forties with homes of their own no one would be living there now grady urgently pressed the other numbers he heard a buzz then another buzz he rubbed his forehead a mans tired voice said yes my name is benjamin grady im the police chief of bosworth thats about forty miles east of i know where bosworth is what do you want if this is about the accident i dont feel up to talking about it again you picked an inconvenient time my wife and i have been trying to sort through my parents effects to settle their estate this isnt about the accident then what is it about your brother jesus dont tell me somethings happened to bob no i didnt mean im referring to your brother who died in vietnam jerry i dont get it why after all this time would you want to know about him was your brother a swimmer a serious swimmer i havent thought about that in the man swallowed thickly the coach in high school said jerry could have been a champion my brother used to train every day three hours minimum he could have made the olympics grady felt as cold as when the swimmer had walked along the side of the pool and passed through him what did you say your name was the voice demanded grady and you claim youre the police chief over in what the hell is this a sick joke no if thered been another way to im sorry for intruding what youve told me is important thank you despite the rising sun grady needed his headlights to drive up the bumpy zigzagging lane through the shadowy trees to the compound finally at the top he stared toward an eerie mist that rose off the swimming pool spreading around it faint sunlight revealed the pines and maples on the dusky ridges that flanked the compound but the compound itself was completely enshrouded gradys headlights glinted off the thick almost crystalline haze he got out of his police car and nearly bumped into the chainlink fence before he saw it after fumbling to unlock the gate he swung it open the silence around him remained as oppressive as the day before so much so that when he stepped onto gravel the crunch startled him the cold mist dampened his clothes and beaded on his hackled skin i ought to turn around and drive back to town he thought this is crazy what am i doing here he wished that hed brought a flashlight as he moved through it the mist became denser it seemed unnatural too thick too be careful he warned himself youre letting your imagination get control of you mist often rises from swimming pools at dawn its something to do with the change in temperature theres nothing unusual about grady faltered suddenly realizing that without a visible object to aim toward he might lose his bearings and wander in a circle he felt disoriented he braved another step and flinched as he bumped against the waisthigh wooden fence that bordered the swimming pool at the same time he flinched for another reason because something passed from left to right before him beyond the fence the shadow of what seemed to be a man the shadows motion caused the mist to swirl then the shadow disappeared the mist became still again when grady heard a splash from the pool he stepped back the splash was followed by the echoing strokes of a powerful swimmer grady froze paralyzed by conflicting impulses to charge through the gate and confront the swimmer but hed done that yesterday and he was terrified that the swimmer would again pass through him to stay where he was and shout to demand an explanation but hed done that yesterday as well with no effect and anyway if grady tried to shout he was certain that the noise from his mouth would be a shriek to pivot and scramble desperately from the pool frantic to find his way back through the gloom to the cruiser but grady heard a further splash someone else diving into the water with increasing dismay he saw another shadow no two pass through the haze beyond the fence a woman it seemed and a child grady screamed swung and recoiled as a further shadow appeared in the mist this one approaching from the direction of the bunkhouse no he saw three more shadows two women and a girl approach from the hazeobscured kitchen he lurched sideways to avoid them and found himself confronted by still another shadow this one coming from the direction of the shrine gradys impetus was so forceful that he couldnt stop he and the shadow converged he lunged through the shadow unbearably chilled and despite the density of the mist he managed to see the shadows face it was brian roth gradys eyes fluttered something small inched across his brow making his skin itch a fly he realized he pawed it away then opened his eyes completely the stark sun was directly above him he was on his back sprawled on the gravel near the swimming pool as his consciousness focused he managed to sit peering around him tense expecting to be confronted by ghosts but all he saw was the silencesmothered compound he glanced at his watch almost noon dear lord ive been lying here for brian no i couldnt have seen him terrified he squirmed to his feet his vision blurred then focused again in place of the dampness from the mist his skin was now clammy from sweat his stained uniform clinging to him he managed to straighten then scanned the otherwise deserted compound ive lost my mind im having a nervous breakdown he stared at his police car his staff would be wondering where he was theyd have tried to get in touch with him he had to let them know that he was all right more important he had to think of an acceptable reason for not having gone to the office for not having responded to their calls he couldnt let them know how out of control he was but as he reached the cruiser about to lean in and grab the twoway radio microphone he stiffened hearing the jolt of a vehicle as it struggled up the bumpy lane pivoting he saw that the vehicle belonged to the state police that it veered from the trees to stop beside his car and that jeff clauson got out glanced solemnly around then proceeded somberly toward him ben jeff the exchange was awkward youve got a lot of people worried about you clauson said im afraid the situations difficult i was just about to your uniform what have you been doing sleeping in a ditch its hard to explain i bet all the same why not give it a try howd you know id be here clauson studied him process of elimination after a while the more i thought about it the more this seemed the most logical place why you how come youre out looking for me when your dispatcher kept failing to reach you when she became concerned enough she contacted all your friends ill say it again youve got a lot of people worried about you ben why didnt you check in the truth is sure why not the truth would be refreshing i yes go on ben the truth i passed out the note brian left suggested youve been drinking a lot but hes not the only one who noticed when i phoned you at night your voice was this morning had nothing to do with alcohol i came up here before i was due at work so i could look around and decide if i was going to keep this place then everything caught up to me i passed out over there by the pool grady turned and pointed what he saw demanded that he use every remnant of his remaining willpower not to react the area around the pool was crowded with people six children including brians twins the two young men whod been killed in vietnam twelve adults ten of whom grady didnt recognize although two were brian and betsy ill bet the five couples i dont recognize are the people who died in that traffic accident last thursday grady thought with a chill the group was having a barbecue eating talking laughing although the scene was weirdly silent no sounds escaping from their mouths gradys cheeks felt numb his body shook he managed not to whimper i really ought to be congratulated he thought im seeing ghosts and im not gibbering clauson looked toward the pool but showed no reaction grady tensed with understanding jeff do you notice anything unusual what do you mean grady was amazed that he repeated almost exactly what ida roth had said that brian had said when hed brought her to the camp do you feel anything different anything special anything that reminds you of that makes you feel close to brian and betsy not particularly clauson frowned except of course the memory of finding their bodies here nothing at the swimming pool thats where the bodies were of course clauson drew his fingers through his short sandy hair otherwise no i dont notice anything unusual about the pool i need help jeff thats why im here havent i been asking you repeatedly to let me help tell me what you need a reason my staff will accept for my not checking in an explanation that wont affect the way they look at me you mean like there was something wrong with your radio or you had to leave town for an appointment that you thought youd told them about exactly sorry ben i cant do it the only explanation ill help you with is the truth and you keep saying youre my friend thats right so what kind of friend would a good one better than you realize ben youve been fooling yourself you claim your problems havent interfered with your work youre wrong and i dont mean just the alcohol your nerves are on edge you always look distracted you have trouble concentrating everybodys noticed it the best way i can help is to give you this advice take a month off get some counseling admit yourself to a substanceabuse clinic dry out accept reality your wife and son are dead you have to adjust to that to try harder to come to terms with your loss youve got to find some peace a month off but my job is all ive got left im telling you this as a friend keep acting the way youve been and you wont even have your job ive been hearing rumors youre close to being fired what grady couldnt believe what clauson was saying it seemed as impossible as the ghosts at the swimming pool as the silent party that clauson couldnt see but grady did jesus no but if you go along with my recommendations no ben dont keep looking at the swimming pool look at me thats right good if you go along with what i recommend ill do everything in my power to make sure your staff and the bosworth town council understand what youve been going through face it youre exhausted burned out what you need is a rest theres nothing disgraceful about that as long as you dont try to hide your condition as long as you admit your problem and try to correct it people will sympathize i swear to you ill make sure they sympathize you used to be a damned good cop and you can be one again if you do what i ask i swear ill use all the influence ive got to fix it so you keep your job thanks jeff i really appreciate that ill try i promise ill really try grady sat in the mausoleum blinking through his tears toward the niches that contained the urns of his beloved wife and son ive got trouble he told them his voice so choked he could barely speak im seeing things im drinking too much im about to lose my job and as far as my mind goes well hey i lost that quite a while ago if only you hadnt died if only i hadnt decided to work late that night if only you hadnt decided to go to that movie if only that drunk hadnt hit you if only its my fault its all my fault i cant tell you how much i miss you id give anything to have you back to make our life perfect the way it used to be a year ago before the pager on gradys gunbelt beeped he ignored it helen when i come home the house feels so empty i cant stand it john when i look in your room when i touch the clothes in your closet when i smell them i feel as if my hearts going to split apart that ill die on the spot i want both of you with me so much i the pager kept beeping grady pulled it from his gunbelt dropped it onto the floor and stomped it with the heel of his shoe he heard a crack and felt a satisfying crunch the pager became silent good grady blinked upward through his tears continuing to address the urns perfect our life was perfect but without you i love you i want you so much id give anything to have you back for the three of us to be together again at last he ran out of words he just kept sitting sobbing staring at the niches at the names of his wife and son at their birth and death dates imagining their ashes in the urns a thought came slowly it rose as if from thick darkness struggling to surface it emerged from the turmoil of his subconscious and became an inward voice that repeated sentences from the puzzling letter that brian had written im afraid for you i had planned to bring you out here soon i think youre ready i think youd be receptive i think that this place would give you joy my final compassionate act on your behalf is to give you this compound i hope that it will ease your suffering and provide you with solace with peace youll know what i mean if youre truly receptive if youre as sensitive as i believe you are grady nodded stood wiped his tears kissed his fingers placed them over the glass that enclosed the urns and left the mausoleum careful to lock its door behind him the compound was enshrouded again this time by a cloud of dust that gradys cruiser raised coming up the lane he stopped the car waited for the dust to clear and wasnt at all surprised to see brian and betsy their twin daughters the other children the young men who died in vietnam and the five couples whod been killed in the accident indeed hed expected to see them grateful that his hopes had not been disappointed some were in the pool others sat in redwood chairs beside the water others grilled steaks on the barbecue they were talking laughing and this time even from inside the cruiser grady could hear them not just the splashes but their voices their mirth even the spatter of grease that dripped from the steaks onto the smoking coals in the barbecue that had puzzled him why hed been able to hear the strokes of the swimmer but not the conversations of the ghosts whom he but not clauson had seen this morning now though he understood it took a while to make contact you had to acquire sensitivity you had to become how had ben put it in his letter receptive each time you encountered them they became more real until grady reached for the paper bag beside him and got out of the cruiser he unlocked the chainlink fence and approached the compound smiling hi brian hello there betsy they didnt acknowledge him well thatll come grady thought no problem i just have to get more receptive he chose an empty chair by the swimming pool and settled into it stretching out his legs relaxing it was evening the sun was nearly down behind the mountains the compound was bathed in a soothing crimson glow the young man hed first encountered the potential champion swimmer whod died in vietnam kept doing his laps a delighted man and woman grayhaired in their sixties kept blurting encouragement to him grady turned again to brian and betsy over by the barbecue hey how have you been its good to see you this time brian and betsy responded looking in his direction yeah all it takes is receptivity grady thought hi ben glad you could make it brian said me too grady reached inside his paper bag and pulled out a bottle of bourbon untwisting its cap he looked around for a glass didnt find one shrugged and raised the bottle to his lips he tilted his head back feeling the yearlong tension in his neck begin to dissipate after the heat of the day the evening was pleasantly cool he tilted the bottle to his lips again and swallowed with satisfaction receptivity he thought yeah thats the secret all i have to do is be sensitive but as he drank and smiled and waited the miracle that hed come for didnt happen he kept looking around struggling to maintain his calm helen and john where were they theyre supposed to be here they have to be he swallowed more bourbon hey brian what is it ben my wife and son where are they im afraid they cant be here yet brian said why not grady frowned theres something you have to do first i dont understand think about it i dont know what you mean help me brian think about the shrine and then everything was clear thank you brian grady set down the bottle stood and left the swimming pool walking toward the shrine inside candles were lit he passed the church pew in the sanctuary and reverently studied the photographs above the mantel the pictures that griefdestroyed parents had hung there the heartbreaking images of the eight dead children is that all it takes grady thought is that all i need to do he removed his wallet from his trousers opened it caressed the photographs of helen and john that he always carried with him and removed them from their protective transparent plastic sleeves after kissing them he set them on the mantel now he wondered his heart pounding now but brian and betsy dont have their photographs up here he thought the couples who were killed in the accident their photographs arent here either maybe though grady wondered maybe if youve been here long enough it isnt necessary to put up photographs on the other hand the children they never had the chance to come here they died before brian built the shrine for them the photographs were necessary just as photographs were necessary for heart pounding faster grady turned and left the shrine hurrying back to the swimming pool he felt terrified that his loneliness wouldnt be broken but at once he saw helen and john waiting for him and his chest hurt unbearably helen was holding out her arms john was jumping up and down with excitement grady ran reached them embraced them and felt his arms go through them just as their arms and bodies went through him no he wailed i need to touch you then he realized he had to give them time in a little while hed be able to hold them he spun to face them i love you ben helen said tears streamed down gradys face dad ive missed you john said and i love both of you and ive missed you so much that gradys voice broke he sobbed harder its so good to grady reached for them again and this time as his arms went through them he felt as if hed reached through a cloud the sensation was subtle but unmistakably physical it was happening theyd soon be gradys knees felt weak sweetheart youd better sit down helen said grady nodded yes the strains been i think i could use a rest as he walked with his wife and son toward the swimming pool brian betsy and the others nodded with approval dad the kids in the pool are having so much fun can i take a swim absolutely anything you want son your mother and i will watch grady sat in his chair by the pool helen sat close beside him stroking his arm the sensation was stronger soon soon hed be able to hold her betsy called to him ben would you like a steak not right now thanks im not hungry maybe later any time all you have to do is ask i appreciate that betsy maybe another drink would improve your appetite i bet it would grady raised the bottle to his lips helen stroked his arm and now her touch was almost solid john dove into the pool together helen said yes grady said at last it became the most wonderful evening of his life in a while helens touch was totally firm grady was able to hold her to hug her to kiss her and john when the sun disappeared a full moon lit the darkness illuminating the festive specters there was just one problem before grady had driven to the compound from the mausoleum hed made several stops in town one had been to the liquor store another had been to the courthouse to find out whod owned the land that brian had purchased to build the compound grady had hoped to be able to question whoever had owned the land and to find out if there was anything unusual about this area anything even an old campfire story that might provide a hint the start of an explanation for this miracle but the former owner had long ago moved away several other stops had been to brian roths former hunting companions grady had hoped that one of them might be able to describe what had happened to brian the day theyd taken him hunting in this area hed hoped that they might have an explanation for brians sudden determination to buy this land but none of them even remembered that afternoon gradys final stop had been to his attorney ida roths lawyer had already been in touch with him ida was determined to contest the will and make sure that grady didnt inherit the property grady was shocked to hear his attorney say that brian had clearly not been in his right mind if hed amended his will while contemplating suicide brians own attorney apparently agreed the consensus was that grady would lose his fight against ida the compound would be denied to him so as grady sat beside his wife and son watching his eerily moonlit companions near the pool he kept drinking and brooding and telling himself that he couldnt bear to be separated from his family again but what was the alternative grady hugged helen and john you might want to take a walk well stay helen said so you wont be afraid youre sure yes i dont want you to feel alone grady kissed her drank more bourbon then unholstered his revolver he understood now why brian and betsy had made this choice how lonely they must have felt seeing their dead children and eventually their dead companions in their presence but not truly with them grady cocked his revolver the final speck of his sanity told him your wife and son arent real you know the others arent either this is all your imagination maybe grady thought maybe not but even if it is my imagination when ida gets control of the compound ill never have the chance to see helen and john again even if i only imagine them it was an agonizing dilemma it required more thought so with his wife and son beside him grady held his revolver in one hand while he drank from his bottle with the other the alcohol made him sleepy the specters were beginning to fade hed soon have to make a choice and he wondered what it would be as the stupor from the bourbon overwhelmed him which would feel heavier would the bottle drop from his hand first or would the revolver afterword from the dripping in to the shrine twenty years later these stories represent a significant portion of my life and significant events along the way the year the final story was published i made a further significant choice by leaving iowa city where i had lived since and taking up residence in santa fe new mexico in the summer of my wife and i did it suddenly watching a segment of public broadcastings this old house that was devoted to santa fe s distinctive adobepueblo style of architecture we found the city of holy faith and its surrounding mountains so picturesque that we decided to spend a long weekend visiting there it was my fortyninth birthday i had just finished a long novel assumed identity a little time off sounded good but we werent prepared for the impact that the mystical mountains and the high desert would have on us in three days we were looking at houses on the fourth day we selected one and flew back to iowa city to make preparations to move three months later we were living in santa fe our decision had nothing to do with a change in our positive feelings about iowa city i had wonderful years at the university there i made lifelong friends there my wife and i raised a daughter and a son there its a special place and it brought us happiness but we also lost a son there and sometimes its necessary to get away from streets and buildings that cause painful memories sometimes too a writer has to redefine himself or as my wife put it to start act three in our new home at an altitude of seven thousand feet with wild flowers in front of our adobe house and pi√±ontreed mountains stretching off in every direction in what the locals call the land of enchantment the land of the dancing sun i began to look at things differently for certain the move affected my fiction not just in the obvious way that i stopped writing about the midwest and switched my attention to new mexico using santa fe as a setting in several pieces a deeper change involved theme the hero of one of my post novels extreme denial is a former intelligence operative who comes to santa fe to shut out his past and find himself substitute former professor and its obvious that i was writing about me from matts death in until our move to santa fe in i wrote more fiction about grief than i included here but after settling in our new home i wrote only one more on the subject a novel called desperate measures in which an obituary writer whose son has died from cancer finds himself trapped in a conspiracy surviving he comes to terms with his loss in the latter respect i was writing about myself thus while this collection doesnt include all my short fiction it is complete inasmuch as it follows the progress of my imagination until the conclusion of act two when after twentytwo years i left iowa city farther into act three ill prepare another collection and bring you up to date sharing more memories with you meanwhile i wasnt prepared for the emotional impact that grouping these stories together had on me pieces written years apart acquired new vividness for me when i read them in sequence over a couple of days in particular i was struck by how many of these stories are about threats to the main characters family philip klass taught me to think of fiction writing as a form of selfpsychoanalysis write about what you most fear he said one day my fear came true but i havent lost my urge to tell stories and that tells me other fears need to be expressed the ferret keeps gnawing at my psyche i persist in going after it let me tell you a story note the stories in this collection were originally published in the following places the dripping ellery queens mystery magazine august the partnership alfred

same time holding a job so she put me in an orphanage and later in a series of boarding homes i grew up unsure of who i was desperately in need of a father figure books and movies were my escape eventually i decided to be a writer and sought help from two men who became metaphorical fathers to me stirling silliphant the head writer for the classic tv series route about two young men in a corvette who travel america in search of themselves and philip klass whose pen name is william tenn a novelist who taught at the pennsylvania state university where i went to graduate school from to the result of their influence is my novel first blood which introduced rambo the search for a father is prominent in that book as it is in later ones most notably the brotherhood of the rose a thriller about orphans and spies during this period i was a professor of american literature at the university of iowa with two professions i worked seven days a week until exhaustion forced me to make a painful choice and resign from the university in one year later my fifteenyearold son matthew died from bone cancer and thereafter my fiction tended to depict the search for a son particularly in fireflies and desperate measures to make a new start my wife and i moved to the mountains and mystical light of santa fe new mexico where my work changed yet again exploring the passionate relationships between men and women highlighting them against a background of action as in the newest burnt sienna to give his stories a realistic edge he has been trained in wilderness survival
