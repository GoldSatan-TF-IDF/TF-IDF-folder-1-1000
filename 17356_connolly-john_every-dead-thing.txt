john connolly every dead thing the first book in the charlie parker series i for i am every dead thingi am rebegot of absence darknesse death things which are not john donne a nocturnall upon s lucies day prologue it is cold in the car cold as the grave i prefer to leave the ac on full to let the falling temperature keep me alert the volume on the radio is low but i can still hear a tune vaguely insistent over the sound of the engine its early rem something about shoulders and rain ive left cornwall bridge about eight miles behind and soon ill be entering south canaan then canaan itself before crossing the state line into massachusetts ahead of me the bright sun is fading as day bleeds slowly into night the patrol car arrived first on the night they died shedding red light into the darkness two patrolmen entered the house quickly yet cautiously aware that they were responding to a call from one of their own a policeman who had become a victim instead of the resort of victims i sat in the hallway with my head in my hands as they entered the kitchen of our brooklyn home and glimpsed the remains of my wife and child i watched as one conducted a brief search of the upstairs rooms while the other checked the living room the dining room all the time the kitchen calling them back demanding that they bear witness i listened as they radioed for the major crime scene unit informing them of a probable double homicide i could hear the shock in their voices yet they tried to communicate what they had seen as dispassionately as they could like good cops should maybe even then they suspected me they were policemen and they more than anyone else knew what people were capable of doing even one of their own and so they remained silent one by the car and the other in the hallway beside me until the detectives pulled up outside the ambulance following and they entered our home the neighbors already gathering on their stoops at their gates some moving closer to find out what had happened what could have been visited on the young couple beyond the couple with the little blond girl bird i ran my hands over my eyes as i recognized the voice a sob shuddered through my system walter cole stood over me mcgee farther back his face bathed by the flashes of the patrol car lights but still pale shaken by what he had seen outside there was the sound of more cars pulling up an emt arrived at the door distracting coles attention from me the medical technicians here said one of the patrolmen as the thin wheyfaced young man stood by cole nodded and gestured toward the kitchen birdman cole repeated this time with greater urgency and a harder tone to his voice do you want to tell me what happened here i pull into the parking lot in front of the flower shop there is a light breeze blowing and my coattails play at my legs like the hands of children inside the store is cool cooler than it should be and redolent with the scent of roses roses never go out of style or season a man is bending down carefully checking the thick waxy leaves of a small green plant he rises up slowly and painfully as i enter evening he says help you id like some of those roses give me a dozen no better make it two dozen two dozen roses yessir he is heavyset and bald maybe in his early sixties he walks stiffly hardly bending his knees the joints of his fingers are swollen with arthritis airconditioning is playing up he says as he passes by the ancient control unit on the wall he adjusts a switch nothing happens the store is old with a long glassfronted hothouse along the far wall he opens the door and begins lifting roses carefully from a bucket inside when he has counted twentyfour he closes the door again and lays them on a sheet of plastic on the counter gift wrap em for ya no plastic is fine he looks at me for a moment and i can almost hear the tumblers fall as the process of recognition begins do i know you from someplace in the city they have short memories

lovemaking the embers of previous fights were stoked back into glowing life my drinking my neglect of jenny my bouts of bitterness and selfpity when i stormed from the house susans cries followed me into the cold night air it was a twentyminute walk to the bar when the first shot of wild turkey hit my stomach the tension dissipated from my body and i relaxed into the familiar routine of the drunk angry then maudlin sorrowful remorseful resentful by the time i left the bar only the hard core remained a chorus of drunks and sots battling with van halen on the jukebox i stumbled at the door and fell down the steps outside barking my knees painfully on the gravel at their base and then i stumbled home sick and nauseous cars swerving wildly to avoid me as i swayed onto the road the faces of the drivers wide with alarm and anger i fumbled for my keys as i arrived at the door and scraped the white paint beneath the lock as i struggled to insert the key there were a lot of scrapes beneath the lock i knew something was wrong as soon as i opened the front door and stepped into the hall when i had left the house had been warm the heating on full blast because jennifer especially felt the winter cold she was a beautiful but fragile child as delicate as a china vase now the house was as cold as the night outside a mahogany flower stand lay fallen on the carpet the flowerpot broken in two pieces amid its own soil the roots of the poinsettia it had contained were exposed and ugly i called susans name once then again louder this time already the drunken haze was clearing and i had my foot on the first step of the stairs to the bedrooms when i heard the back door bang against the sink unit in the kitchen instinctively i reached for my colt de but it lay upstairs on my desk upstairs where i had discarded it before facing susan and another chapter in the story of our dying marriage i cursed myself then later it would come to symbolize all of my failures all of my regrets i moved cautiously toward the kitchen the tips of my fingers glancing against the cold wall on my left the kitchen door was almost closed and i edged it open slowly with my hand susie i called as i stepped into the kitchen my foot slid gently on something sticky and wet i looked down and i was in hell in the florists the old mans eyes are narrowed in puzzlement he shakes his finger goodnaturedly in front of me im sure i know you from someplace i dont think so you from around here canaan maybe monterey otis no someplace else i give him a look that tells him this is a line of inquiry he doesnt want to pursue and i can see him backing off i am about to use my credit card but decide not to instead i count out the cash from my wallet and lay it on the counter someplace else he says nodding as if it has some deep inner meaning for him must be a big place i meet a lot of fellers from there but i am already leaving the store as i pull away i can see him at the window staring after me behind me water drips gently from the rose stems and pools on the floor of the car supplemental crime report contd case number susan parker was seated in a pine kitchen chair facing north toward the kitchen door top of the head was ten feet seven inches from north wall and six feet three inches from east wall her arms were pulled behind her back and tied to the bars at the back of the chair with thin cord each foot was in turn tied to a leg of the chair and i thought her face mostly concealed by her hair seemed so awash with blood that no skin could be seen her head hung back so that her throat gaped open like a second mouth caught in a silent dark red scream our daughter lay splayed across susan one arm hanging between her mothers legs the room was red around them like the stage of some terrible revengers tragedy where blood was echoed with blood it stained the ceiling and the walls as if the house itself had been mortally wounded it lay thick and heavy on the floor and seemed to swallow my reflection in a scarlet darkness susan parkers nose had been broken injury was consistent with impact against wall or floor bloodstain on wall near kitchen door contained fragments of bone nasal hair and mucus susan had tried to run to get help for our daughter and herself but she had made it no farther than the door then he had caught her had grabbed her by the hair and smashed her against the wall before dragging her bleeding and in pain back to the chair and to her death jennifer parker was stretched facing upward across her mothers thighs and a second pine kitchen chair was positioned beside that of her mother cord wrapped around the back of the chair matched marks on jennifer parkers wrists and ankles there was not so much blood around jenny but her nightdress was stained by the flow from the deep cut in her throat she faced the door her hair hanging forward obscuring her face some strands sticking to the blood on her chest the toes of her naked feet dangling above the tiled floor i could only look at her for a moment because susan drew my eyes toward her in death as she had in life even amid the wreckage of our time together and as i looked upon her i felt myself slide down the wall and a wail halfanimal halfchild erupted from deep inside me i gazed at the beautiful woman who had been my wife and her bloody empty sockets seemed to draw me in and envelop me in darkness the eyes of both victims had been mutilated probably with a sharp scalpellike blade there was partial flensing of the chest of susan parker the skin from the clavicle to the navel had been partially removed pulled back over the right breast and stretched over the right arm the moonlight shone through the window behind them casting a cold glow over the gleaming countertops the tiled walls the steel faucets on the sink it caught susans hair coated her bare shoulders in silver and shone through parts of the thin membrane of her skin pulled back over her arm like a cloak a cloak too frail to ward off the cold there was considerable mutilation and then he had cut off their faces it is darkening rapidly now and the headlights catch the bare branches of trees the ends of trimmed lawns clean white mailboxes a childs bicycle lying in front of a garage the wind is stronger now and when i leave the shelter of the trees i can feel it buffeting the car now i am heading toward becket washington the berkshire hills almost there there was no sign of forcible entry complete measurements and a sketch of the entire room were noted bodies were then released dusting for fingerprints gave the following results kitchen hall living roomusable prints later identified as those of susan parker jennifer parker and charles parker rear door of house from kitchenno usable prints water marks on surface indicate that door was wiped down no indication of robbery no prints were developed from tests on victims skin charles parker was taken to homicide and gave statement attached i knew what they were doing as i sat in the interrogation room i had done it so many times myself they questioned me as i had questioned others before using the strange formal locutions of the police interrogation what is your recollection as to your next move do you recall in relation to the bar the disposition of the other drinkers did you notice the condition as to the lock on the rear door it is an obscure convoluted jargon an anticipation of the legalese that clouds any criminal proceedings like smoke in a bar when i gave my statement cole checked with the bartender from toms and confirmed that i was there when i said i was that i could not have killed my own wife and child even then there were whispers i was questioned again and again about my marriage about my relations with susan about my movements in the weeks coming up to the killings i stood to gain a considerable sum in insurance from susan and i was questioned about that as well according to the me susan and jennifer had been dead for about four hours when i found them rigor mortis had already taken hold at their necks and lower jaws indicating that they had died at around maybe a little earlier susan had died from severing of the carotid artery but jennyjenny had died from what was described as a massive release of epinephrine into her system causing ventricular fibrillation of the heart and death jenny always a gentle sensitive child a child with a traitorweak heart had literally died of fright before her killer had a chance to cut her throat she was dead when her face was taken said the me he could not say the same for susan neither could he say why jennifers body had been moved after death further reports to follow walter cole detective sergeant i had a drunks alibi while someone stole away my wife and my child i downed bourbon in a bar but they still come to me in my dreams sometimes smiling and beautiful as they were in life and sometimes faceless and bloodied as death left them beckoning me further into a darkness where love has no place and evil hides adorned with thousands of unseeing eyes and the flayed faces of the dead it is dark when i arrive and the gate is closed and locked the wall is low and i climb it easily i walk carefully so as not to tread on memorial stones or flowers until i stand before them even in the darkness i know where to find them and they in their turn can find me they come to me sometimes in the margin between sleeping and waking when the streets are silent in the dark or as dawn seeps through the gap in the curtains bathing the room in a dim slowgrowing light they come to me and i see their shapes in the darkness my wife and child together watching me silently ensanguined in unquiet death they come to me their breath in the night breezes that brush my cheek and their fingers in the tree branches tapping at my window they come to me and i am no longer alone the waitress was in her fifties dressed in a tight black miniskirt white blouse and black high heels parts of her spilled out of every item of clothing she wore making her look like she had swollen mysteriously sometime between dressing and arriving for work she called me darlin each time she filled my coffee cup she didnt say anything else which was fine by me i had been sitting at the window for over ninety minutes now watching the brownstone across the street and the waitress must have been wondering exactly how long i was planning to stay and if i was ever going to pay the check outside the streets of astoria buzzed with bargain hunters i had even read the new york times from start to finish without nodding off in between as i passed the time waiting for fat ollie watts to emerge from hiding my patience was wearing thin in moments of weakness i sometimes considered ditching the new york times on weekdays and limiting my purchase to the sunday edition when i could at least justify buying it on the grounds of bulk the other option was to begin reading the post although then id have to start clipping coupons and walking to the store in my bedroom slippers maybe in reacting so badly to the times that morning i was simply killing the messenger it had been announced that hansel mcgee a state supreme court judge and according to some one of the worst judges in new york was retiring in december and might be nominated to the board of the citys health and hospitals corporation even seeing mcgees name in print made me ill in the s he had presided over the case of a woman who had been raped when she was nine years old by a fiftyfouryearold man named james johnson an attendant in pelham bay park who had convictions for robbery assault and rape mcgee overturned a jury award to the woman of million with the following words an innocent child was heinously raped for no reason at all yet that is one of the risks of living in a modern society at the time his judgment had seemed callous and an absurd justification for overturning the ruling now seeing his name before me again after what had happened to my family his views seemed so much more abhorrent a symptom of the collapse of goodness in the face of evil erasing mcgee from my mind i folded the newspaper neatly tapped a number on my cell phone and turned my eyes to an upper window of the slightly rundown apartment building opposite the phone was picked up after three rings and a womans voice whispered a cautious hello it had the sound of cigarettes and booze to it like a bar door scraping across a dusty floor tell your fat asshole boyfriend that im on my way to pick him up and hed better not make me chase him i told her im real tired and i dont plan on running around in this heat succinct that was me i hung up left five dollars on the table and stepped out onto the street to wait for fat ollie watts to panic the city was in the middle of a hot humid summer spell which was due to end the following day with the arrival of thunderstorms and rain currently it was hot enough to allow for tshirts chinos and overpriced sunglasses or if you were unlucky enough to be holding down a responsible job hot enough to make you sweat like a pig under your suit as soon as you left the ac behind there wasnt even a gust of wind to rearrange the heat two days earlier a solitary desk fan had struggled to make an impact on the sluggish warmth in the brooklyn heights office of benny low through an open window i could hear arabic being spoken on atlantic avenue and i could smell the cooking scents coming from the moroccan star half a block away benny was a minorleague bail bondsman who had banked on fat ollie staying put until his trial the fact that he had misjudged fat ollies faith in the justice system was one reason why benny continued to remain a minorleague bondsman the money being offered on fat ollie watts was reasonable and there were things living on the bottom of ponds that were smarter than most bail jumpers there was a fiftythousanddollar bond on fat ollie the result of a misunderstanding between ollie and the forces of law and order over the precise ownership of a chevy beretta a mercedes se and a number of wellappointed sport utility vehicles all of which had come into ollies possession by illegal means fat ollies day started to go downhill when an eagleeyed patrolman familiar with ollies reputation as something less than a shining light in the darkness of a lawless world spotted the chevy under a tarpaulin and called for a check on the plates they were false and ollie was raided arrested and questioned he kept his mouth shut but packed a bag and headed for the hills as soon as he made bail in an effort to avoid further questions about who had placed the cars in his care that source was reputed to be salvatore sonny ferrera the son of a prominent capo there had been rumors lately that relations between father and son had deteriorated in recent weeks but nobody was saying why fuckin goomba stuff as benny low had put it that day in his office anything to do with fat ollie fuck do i know you want to call ferrera and ask i looked at benny low he was completely bald and had been since his early twenties as far as i knew his glabrous skull glistened with tiny beads of perspiration his cheeks were ruddy and flesh hung from his chin and jowls like melted wax his tiny office located above a halal store smelled of sweat and mold i wasnt even sure why i had said i would take the job i had moneyinsurance money money from the sale of the house money from what had once been a shared account even some cash from my retirement fundand benny lows money wasnt going to make me any happier maybe fat ollie was just something to do benny low swallowed once loudly what why are you lookin at me like that you know me benny dont you fuck does that mean course i know you you want a reference what he laughed halfheartedly spreading his pudgy hands wide as if in supplication what he said again his voice faltered and for the first time he actually looked scared i knew that people had been talking about me in the months since the deaths talking about things i had done things i might have done the look in benny lows eyes told me that he had heard about them too and believed that they could be true something about fat ollies flight just didnt sit right it wouldnt be the first time that ollie had faced a judge on a stolen vehicles rap although the suspected connection to the ferreras had forced the bond up on this occasion ollie had a good lawyer to rely on otherwise his only connection to the automobile industry would have come from making license plates on rikers island there was no particular reason for ollie to run and no reason why he would risk his life by fingering sonny over something like this nothing benny its nothing you hear anything else you tell me sure sure said benny relaxing again youll be the first to know as i left his office i heard him mutter under his breath i couldnt be sure what he said but i knew what it sounded like it sounded like benny low had just called me a killer like my father it had taken me most of the next day to locate ollies current squeeze through some judicious questioning and another fifty minutes that morning to determine if ollie was with her through the simple expedient of calling the local thai food joints and asking them if they had made any deliveries to the address in the last week ollie was a thai food freak and like most skips stuck to his habits even while on the run people dont change very much which usually makes the dumb ones easy to find they take out subscriptions to the same magazines eat in the same places drink the same beers call the same women sleep with the same men after i threatened to call the health inspectors an oriental roach motel called the bangkok sun house confirmed deliveries to one monica mulrane at an address in astoria leading to coffee the new york times and a phone call to wake ollie up true to form and dim as a tenwatt bulb ollie opened the door of about four minutes after my call stuck his head out and then commenced an awkward shambling run down the steps toward the sidewalk he was an absurd figure strands of hair slicked across his bald pate the elasticated waistband of his tan pants stretched across a stomach of awesome size monica mulrane must have loved him a whole lot to stay with him because he didnt have money and he sure as hell didnt have looks it was strange but i kind of liked fat ollie watts he had just set foot on the sidewalk when a jogger wearing a gray sweat suit with the hood pulled up appeared at the corner ran up to ollie and pumped three shots into him from a silenced pistol ollies white shirt was suddenly polkadotted with red and he folded to the ground the jogger lefthanded stood over him and shot him once more in the head someone screamed and i saw a brunette presumably the by now recently bereaved monica mulrane pause at the door of her apartment block before she ran to the sidewalk to kneel beside ollie passing her hands over his bald bloodied head and crying the jogger was already backing off bouncing on the balls of his feet like a fighter waiting for the bell then he stopped returned and fired a single shot into the top of the womans head she folded over the body of ollie watts her back shielding his head bystanders were already running for cover behind cars into stores and the cars on the street ground to a halt i was almost across the street my smith amp wesson in my hand when the jogger ran he kept his head down and moved fast the gun still held in his left hand even though he wore black gloves he hadnt dropped the gun at the scene either the gun was distinctive or the shooter was dumb i was banking on the second option i was gaining on him when a black chevy caprice with tinted windows screeched out from a side street and stood waiting for him if i didnt shoot he was going to get away if i did shoot there would be hell to pay with the cops i made my choice he had almost reached the chevy when i squeezed off two shots one hitting the door of the car and the second tearing a bloody hole in the right arm of the joggers top he spun firing two wild shots in my direction as he did so and i could see his eyes were wide and ultrabright the killer was wired as he turned toward the chevy it sped away the driver spooked by my shots leaving fat ollies killer stranded he fired off another shot which shattered the window of the car to my left i could hear people screaming and in the distance the wail of approaching sirens the jogger sprinted toward an alley glancing over his shoulder at the sound of my shoes hammering on the road behind him as i made the corner a bullet whined off the wall above me peppering me with pieces of concrete i looked up to see the jogger moving beyond the midpoint of the alley staying close to the wall if he got around the corner at the end i would lose him in the crowds the gap at the end of the alley was briefly clear of people i decided to risk the shot the sun was behind me as i straightened firing twice in quick succession i was vaguely aware of people at either side of me scattering like pigeons from a stone as the joggers right shoulder arched back with the impact of one of my shots i shouted at him to drop the piece but he turned awkwardly his left hand bringing the gun up slightly off balance i fired two more shots from around twenty feet his left knee exploded as one of the hollow points connected and he collapsed against the wall of the alley his pistol skidding harmlessly away toward some trash cans and black bags as i closed on him i could see he was ashen faced his mouth twisted in pain and his left hand gripping the air around his shattered knee without actually touching the wound yet his eyes were still bright and i thought i heard him giggle as he pushed himself from the wall and tried to hop away on his good leg i was maybe fifteen feet from him when his giggles were drowned by the sound of brakes squealing in front of him i looked up to see the black chevy blocking the end of the alley the window on its passenger side down and then the darkness within was broken by a single muzzle flash fat ollies killer bucked and fell forward on the ground he spasmed once and i could see a red stain spreading across the back of his top there was a second shot the back of his head blew a geyser of blood in the air and his face banged once on the filthy concrete of the alley i was already making for the cover of the trash cans when a bullet whacked into the brickwork above my head showering me with dust and literally boring a hole through the wall then the window of the chevy rolled up and the car shot off to the east i ran to where the jogger lay blood flowed from the wounds in his body creating a dark red shadow on the ground the sirens were close now and i could see onlookers gathered in the sunlight watching me as i stood over the body the patrol car pulled up minutes later i already had my hands in the air and my gun on the ground before me my permit beside it fat ollies killer was lying at my feet blood now pooled around his head and linked to the red tide that was congealing slowly in the alleys central gutter one patrolman kept me covered while his partner patted me down with more force than was strictly necessary against the wall the cop patting me down was young perhaps no more than twentythree or twentyfour and cocky as hell shit we got wyatt earp here sam he said shootin it out like it was high noon wyatt earp wasnt in high noon i corrected him as his partner checked my id the cop punched me hard in the kidneys in response and i fell to my knees i heard more sirens nearby including the telltale whine of an ambulance youre a funny guy hotshot said the young cop whyd you shoot him you werent around i replied my teeth gritted in pain if youd been here id have shot you instead he was just about to cuff me when a voice i recognized said put it away harley i looked over my shoulder at his partner sam rees i recognized him from my days on the force and he recognized me i dont think he liked what he saw he used to be a cop leave him be and then the three of us waited in silence until the others joined us two more blueandwhites arrived before a mud brown nova dumped a figure in plain clothes on the curb i looked up to see walter cole walking toward me i hadnt seen him in almost six months not since his promotion to lieutenant he was wearing a long brown leather coat incongruous in the heat ollie watts he said indicating the shooter with an inclination of his head i nodded he left me alone for a time as he spoke with uniformed cops and detectives from the local precinct i noticed that he was sweating heavily in his coat you can come in my car he said when he eventually returned eyeing the cop called harley with illconcealed distaste he motioned some more detectives toward him and made some final comments in quiet measured tones before waving me toward the nova nice coat i said appreciatively as we walked to his car how many girls you got in your stable walters eyes glinted briefly lee gave me this coat for my birthday why do you think im wearing it in this goddamned heat you fire any shots a couple you do know that there are laws against discharging firearms in public places dont you i know that but im not sure about the guy dead on the ground back there im not sure that the guy who shot him knows either maybe you could try a poster campaign very funny now get in the car i did as he said and we pulled away from the curb the onlookers gaping curiously at us as we headed off through the crowded streets five hours had elapsed since the death of fat ollie watts his girlfriend monica mulrane and the shooter as yet unidentified i had been interviewed by a pair of detectives from homicide neither of whom i knew walter cole did not participate i was brought coffee twice but otherwise i was left alone after the questionings once when one of the detectives left the room to consult with someone i caught a glimpse of a tall thin man in a dark linen suit the ends of his shirt collar sharp as razors his red silk tie unwrinkled he looked like a fed a vain fed the wooden table in the interrogation room was pitted and worn caffeinestamped by the edges of hundreds maybe thousands of coffee cups at the lefthand side of the table near the corner someone had carved a broken heart into the wood probably with a nail and i remembered that heart from another time from the last time i sat in this room shit walter walt it aint a good idea for him to be here walter looked at the detectives ranged around the walls slouched on chairs around the table hes not here he said as far as everyone in this room is concerned you never saw him the interrogation room was crowded with chairs and an additional table had been brought in i was still on compassionate leave and as it happened two weeks away from quitting the force my family had been dead for two weeks and the investigation had so far yielded nothing with the agreement of lieutenant cafferty soon to retire walter had called a meeting of detectives involved in the case and one or two others who were regarded as some of the best homicide detectives in the city it was to be a combination of brainstorm and lecture the lecture coming from rachel wolfe wolfe had a reputation as a fine criminal psychologist yet the department steadfastly refused to consult her it had its own deep thinker dr russell windgate but as walter once put it windgate couldnt profile a fart he was a sanctimonious patronizing bastard but he was also the commissioners brother which made him a sanctimonious patronizing influential bastard windgate was attending a conference of committed freudians in tulsa and walter had taken the opportunity to consult wolfe she sat at the head of the table a stern but not unattractive woman in her early thirties with long dark red hair that rested on the shoulders of her dark blue business suit her legs were crossed and a blue pump hung from the end of her right foot you all know why bird wants to be here continued walter youd all want the same thing if you were in his place i had bullied and cajoled him to let me sit in on the briefing i had called in favors i didnt even have the right to call in and walter had relented i didnt regret doing what i had done the others in the room remained unconvinced i could see it in their faces in the way they shifted their gaze from us in the shrug of a shoulder and the unhappy twist of a mouth i didnt care i wanted to hear what wolfe had to say walter and i took seats and waited for her to begin wolfe took a pair of glasses from the tabletop and put them on beside her left hand the carved broken heart shone woodbright she glanced through some notes pulled out two sheets from the sheaf and began right i dont know how familiar you are with all this so ill take it slowly she paused for a moment detective parker you may find some of this difficult there was no apology in her voice it was a simple statement of fact i nodded and she continued what were dealing with here appears to be sexual homicide sadistic sexual homicide i traced the carved heart with the tip of my finger the texture of the grain briefly returning me to the present the door of the interrogation room opened and through the gap i saw the fed pass by a clerk entered with a white i love ny cup the coffee smelled as if it had been brewing since that morning when i put in the creamer it created only the slightest difference in the color of the liquid i sipped it and grimaced a sexual homicide generally involves some element of sexual activity as the basis for the sequence of events leading to death continued wolfe sipping at her coffee the stripping of the victims and the mutilation of the breasts and genitals indicate a sexual element to the crime yet we have no evidence of penetration in either victim by either penis fingers or foreign objects the childs hymen was undamaged and there was no evidence of vaginal trauma in the adult victim we also have evidence of a sadistic element to the homicides the adult victim was tortured prior to death flensing took place specifically on the front of the torso and the face combined with the sexual elements youre dealing with a sexual sadist who obtains gratification from excessive physical and i would think mental torture i think heand im assuming its a white male for reasons ill go into laterwanted the mother to watch the torture and killing of her child before she herself was tortured and killed a sexual sadist gets his kicks from the victims response to torture in this case he had two victims a mother and child to play off against each other hes translating sexual fantasies into violent acts torture and eventually death outside the door of the interrogation room i heard voices suddenly raised one of them was walter coles i didnt recognize the other the voices subsided again but i knew that they were talking about me i would find out what they wanted soon enough okay the largest focus group for sexual sadists consists of white female adults who are strangers to the killer although they may also target males and as in this case children there is also sometimes a correspondence between the victim and someone in the offenders own life victims are chosen through systematic stalking and surveillance the killer had probably been watching the family for some time he knew the husbands habits knew that if he went to the bar then he would be missing for long enough to allow him to complete what he wanted to do in this case i dont think the killer managed that completion the crime scene is unusual in this case firstly the nature of the crime means that it requires somewhere solitary to give the offender time with his victim in some cases the offenders residence may have been modified to accommodate his victim or he may use a converted car or van for the killing in this case the killer chose not to do this i think he may like the element of risk involved i also think he wanted to make for want of a better term an impression an impression like wearing a bright tie to a funeral the crime was carefully staged to impact in the most traumatic way on the husband when he returned home maybe walter had been right maybe i shouldnt have come to the briefing wolfes matteroffactness reduced my wife and child to the level of another gruesome statistic in a violent city but i hoped that she would say something that would resonate inside me and provide some clue to drive the investigation forward two weeks is a long time in a murder case after two weeks with no progress unless you get very very lucky the investigation starts to grind to a halt this seems to indicate a killer of aboveaverage intelligence one who likes playing games and gambling said wolfe the fact that he appeared to want the element of shock to play a part could lead us to conclude that there was a personal element to what he did directed against the husband but thats just speculation and the general pattern of this type of crime is impersonal generally crime scenes can be classified as organized disorganized or some mix of the two an organized killer plans the murder and targets the victim carefully and the crime scene will reflect this element of control the victims will meet certain criteria which the killer has set age hair color maybe occupation lifestyle the use of restraints as we have in this case is typical it reflects the elements of control and planning since the killer will usually have to bring them to the scene in cases of sexual sadism the act of killing is generally eroticized theres a ritual involved its usually slow and every effort is made to ensure that the victim remains conscious and aware up to the point of death in other words the killer doesnt want to end the lives of his victims prematurely now in this case he didnt succeed because jennifer parker the child had a weak heart and it failed following the release of epinephrine into her system combined with her mothers attempted escape and the damage caused to her face by striking it against the wall which may have resulted in temporary loss of consciousness i believe the killer felt he was losing control of the situation the crime scene moved from organized to disorganized and shortly after he commenced flensing his anger and frustration got the better of him and he mutilated the bodies i wanted to leave then i had made a mistake nothing could come of this nothing good as i said earlier mutilation of the genitals and breasts is a feature of this type of crime but this case doesnt conform to the general pattern in a number of crucial ways i think the mutilation in this case was either a result of anger and loss of control or it was an attempt to disguise something else some other element of the ritual which had already commenced and from which the killer was trying to divert attention in all likelihood the partial flensing is the key theres a strong element of displayits incomplete but its there why are you so sure its a white male asked joiner a black homicide detective with whom id worked once or twice the most frequent perpetrators of sexual sadism are white males not women not black males white males youre off the hook joiner someone said there was a burst of laughter an easing of the tension that had built up in the room one or two of the others glanced at me but for the most part they acted as if i wasnt there they were professionals concentrating on amassing any information that might lead to a greater understanding of the killer wolfe let the laughter fade research indicates that as many as fortythree percent of sexual murderers are married fifty percent have children dont make the mistake of thinking that youre looking for some crazy loner this guy may be the hero of his local pta meetings the coach of the little league team he could be engaged in a profession that brings him into contact with the public so hes probably socially adept and he may use that to target his victims he may have engaged in antisocial behavior in the past although not necessarily something serious enough to have gotten him a police record sexual sadists are often police buffs or weapons freaks he may try to stay in touch with the progress of the investigation so keep an eye on individuals who ring in with leads or who try to trade off information he also owns a clean wellmaintained car clean so it doesnt attract attention well maintained because he has to be sure he doesnt get stranded at or near the crime scene the car could have been modified to allow him to transport victims the door and window handles in the rear will have been removed the trunk may have been soundproofed if you think you have a possible suspect check the trunk for extra fuel water ropes cuffs ligatures if you go for a search warrant youll be looking for any items relating to sexual or violent behavior pornographic magazines videos lowend truecrime stuff vibrators clamps womens clothing particularly undergarments some of these may have belonged to victims or he may have taken other personal items from them look out also for diaries and manuscripts they may contain details of victims fantasies even the crimes themselves this guy may also have a collection of police equipment and almost certainly has a knowledge of police procedures wolfe took a deep breath and sat back in her chair is he going to do it again asked walter there was silence in the room for a moment yes but youre making one assumption said wolfe walter looked puzzled youre assuming this is the first i take it a vicap has been done vicap operational since is the fbis violent criminal apprehension program under vicap a report is completed on solved or unsolved homicides or attempted homicides particularly those involving abductions or that are apparently random or motiveless or sexually oriented on missing persons cases when foul play is suspected and on unidentified dead bodies when the manner of death is known or suspected to be homicide the report is then submitted to the national center for the analysis of violent crime at the fbis academy in quantico in an effort to determine if similar pattern characteristics exist elsewhere in the vicap system it was submitted have you requested a profile yes but no profile as yet unofficially the mo doesnt match the removal of the faces marks it out yeah what about the faces it was joiner again im still trying to find out more said wolfe some killers take souvenirs from their victims there may be some kind of pseudoreligious or sacrificial element to this case im sorry im really not sure yet you think he could have done something like this before said walter wolfe nodded he may have if he has killed before then he may have hidden the bodies and these killings could represent an alteration in a previous pattern of behavior maybe after killing quietly and unobtrusively he wanted to bring himself to a more public arena he may have wanted to draw attention to his work the unsatisfactory nature of these killings from his point of view may now cause him to revert to his old pattern alternatively he could recede into a period of dormancy thats another possibility but if i was to gamble id say that hes been planning his next move carefully he made mistakes this time and i dont think he achieved the effect he was looking for the next time he wont make any mistakes the next time unless you catch him first hes really going to make an impact the door of the interrogation room opened and walter entered with two other men this is special agent ross fbi and detective barth from robbery said walter barth was working the watts case agent ross here deals with organized crime close up rosss linen suit looked expensive and tailored barth in his jcpenney jacket looked like a slob by comparison the two men stood against opposite walls and nodded when walter sat barth sat as well ross remained standing against the wall anything youre not telling us here walter asked no i said you know as much as i do agent ross believes that sonny ferrera was behind the killing of watts and his girlfriend and that you know more than youre saying ross picked at something on the sleeve of his shirt and dropped it to the floor with a look of distaste i think it was meant to represent me there was no reason for sonny to kill ollie watts i replied were talking stolen cars and fake license plates here ollie wasnt in a position to scam anything worthwhile from sonny and he didnt know enough about sonnys activities to take up ten minutes of a jurys time ross stirred and moved forward to sit on the edge of the table strange that you should turn up after all this time what is it six seven monthsand suddenly were knee deep in corpses he said as if he hadnt heard a word id said he was forty maybe fortyfive but he looked to be in good condition his face was heavily lined with wrinkles that didnt seem like they came from a life of laughter id heard a little about him from woolrich after woolrich left new york to become the feds assistant special agent in charge in the new orleans field office there was silence then ross tried to stare me out then looked away in boredom agent ross here thinks that youre holding out on us said walter hed like to sweat you for a while just in case his expression was neutral his eyes bland ross had returned to staring at me agent ross is a scary guy he tries to sweat me theres no telling what ill confess to this is not getting us anywhere said ross mr parker is obviously not cooperating in any way and i walter held up a hand interrupting him maybe youd both leave us alone for a while get some coffee or something he suggested barth shrugged and left ross remained seated on the table and looked like he was going to say more then he stood up abruptly and quickly walked out closing the door firmly behind him walter exhaled deeply loosened his tie and opened the top button of his shirt dont dump on ross hell bring a ton of shit down on your head and on mine ive told you all i know on this i said benny low may know more but i doubt it we talked to benny low the way benny tells it he didnt know who the president was until we told him he twisted a pen in his hand hey its just bidness thats what he said it was a pretty fair imitation of one of benny lows verbal quirks i smiled thinly and the tension in the air dissipated slightly how long you been back couple of weeks what have you been doing what could i tell him that i wandered the streets that i visited places where jennifer susan and i used to go together that i stared out of the window of my apartment and thought about the man who had killed them and where he might be that i had taken on the job for benny low because i was afraid that if i did not find some outlet i would eat the barrel of my gun not a lot i plan to look up some old stoolies see if theres anything new there isnt not at this end you got anything no i cant ask you to let it go but no you cant get to it walter this isnt a good place for you to be right now you know why do i walter tossed the pen hard on the table it bounced to the edge and then hung there briefly before dropping to the floor for a moment i thought he was going to take a swing at me but then the anger went from his eyes well talk about this again okay you going to give me anything among the papers on the table i could see reports from ballistics and firearms five hours was a pretty short time in which to get a report agent ross was obviously a man who got what he wanted i nodded at the report what did ballistics say about the bullet that took out the shooter thats not your concern walter i watched the kid die the shooter took a pop at me and the bullet went clean through the wall someones got distinctive taste in weaponry walter stayed silent no one picks up hardware like that without someone knowing i said you give me something to go on maybe i might find out more than you can walter thought for a minute and then flicked through the papers for the ballistics report we got submachine bullets fivepointseven millimeters weighing less than fifty grains i whistled thats a scaleddown rifle round but fired from a handgun the bullet is mainly plastic but has a fullmetal jacket so it doesnt deform on impact when it hits something like your shooterit transfers most of its force theres almost no energy when it exits and the one that hit the wall ballistics reckons a muzzle velocity of over two thousand feet per second that was an incredibly fast bullet a browning millimeter fires bullets of one hundred ten grains at only eleven hundred feet per second they also reckon that this thing could blow through kevlar body armor like it was rice paper at two hundred yards the thing could penetrate almost fifty layers even a magnum will only penetrate body armor at very close range but once it hits a soft target it stops is it domestic no ballistics say european belgian theyre talking about something called a fiveseventhats big f big n after the manufacturers its a prototype made by fn herstal for antiterrorist and hostage rescue operations but this is the first time one has turned up outside national security forces you contacting the maker well try but my guess is well lose it in the middlemen i stood up ill ask around walter retrieved his pen and waved it at me like an unhappy schoolteacher lecturing the class wise guy ross still wants your ass i took out a pen and scribbled my cell phone number on the back of walters legal pad its always on can i go now one condition go on i want you to come over to the house tonight im sorry walter i dont make social calls anymore he looked hurt dont be an asshole this isnt social be there or ross can lock you in a cell till doomsday for all i care i stood up to leave you sure youve told us everything he asked to my back i didnt turn around ive told you all i can walter which was true technically at least twentyfour hours earlier i had found emo ellison emo lived in a dump of a hotel on the edge of east harlem the kind where the only guests allowed in the rooms are whores cops or criminals a plexiglas screen covered the front of the supers office but there was no one inside i walked up the stairs and knocked on emos door there was no reply but i thought i heard the sound of a hammer cocking on a pistol emo its bird i need to talk i heard footsteps approach the door i dont know nothin about it said emo through the wood i got nothin to say i havent asked you anything yet cmon emo open up fat ollies in trouble maybe i can do something let me in there was silence for a moment and then the rattle of a chain the door opened and i stepped inside emo had retreated to the window but he still had the gun in his hand i closed the door behind me you dont need that i said emo hefted the gun once in his hand and then put it on a bedside cabinet he looked more comfortable without it guns werent emos style i noticed that the fingers of his left hand were bandaged i could see yellow stains on the tips of the bandages emo ellison was a thin palefaced middleaged man who had worked on and off for fat ollie for five years or so he was an average mechanic but he was loyal and knew when to keep his mouth shut do you know where he is he aint been in touch he sat down heavily on the edge of the neatly made bed the room was clean and smelled of air freshener there were one or two prints on the walls and books magazines and some personal items were neatly arrayed on a set of home depot shelves i hear youre workin for benny low why you doin that its work i replied you hand ollie over and hes dead thats your work said emo i leaned against the door i may not hand him over benny low can take the loss but id need a good reason not to the conflict inside him played itself out on emos face his hands twisted and writhed over each other and he looked once or twice at the gun emo ellison was scared why did he run emo i asked softly he used to say you were a good guy a standup guy said emo that true i dont know i dont want to see ollie hurt though emo looked at me for a time and then seemed to make a decision it was pili pili pilar you know him i know him pili pilar was sonny ferreras righthand man he used to come once twice a month never more than that and take a car hed keep it for a couple of hours then bring it back different car each time it was a deal ollie made so he wouldnt have to pay off sonny hed fit the car with false plates and have it ready for pili when he arrived last week pili comes collects a car and drives off i came in late that night cause i was sick i got ulcers pili was gone before i got there anyway after midnight im sittin up with ollie talkin and stuff waitin for pili to bring back the car when theres this bang outside when we get out there pilis wrapped the car around the gate and hes lying on the wheel theres a dent in the front too so we figure maybe pili was in a smash and didnt want to wait around after pilis head is cut up bad where he smacked the windshield and theres a lot of blood in the car ollie and me push it into the yard and then ollie calls this doc he knows and the guy tells him to bring pili around pili aint movin and hes real pale so ollie drops him off at the docs in his own car and the doc insists on packing him off to the hospital cause he thinks pilis skull is busted it was all flowing out of emo now once he began the tale he wanted to finish it as if he could diminish the burden of knowing by telling it out loud anyway they argue for a while but the doc knows this private clinic where they wont ask too many questions and ollie agrees the doc calls the clinic and ollie comes back to the lot to sort out the car he has a number for sonny but theres no answer hes got the car in back but he doesnt want to leave it there in case yknow its a cop thing so he calls the old man and lets him know what happened so the old man tells him to sit tight hell send a guy around to take care of it ollie goes out to move the car out of sight but when he comes back in he looks worse than pili he looks sick and his hands are shakin i say to him whats wrong but he just tells me to get out and not to tell no one i was there he wont say nothin else just tells me to get goin next thing i hear the cops have raided the place and then ollie makes bail and disappears i swear thats the last i heard then why the gun one of the old mans guys came by here a day or two back he gulped bobby sciorra he wanted to know about ollie wanted to know if id been there the day of pilis accident i said to him no but it wasnt enough for him emo ellison started to cry he lifted up his bandaged fingers and slowly carefully began to unwrap one of them he took me for a ride he held up the finger and i could see a ringshaped mark crowned with a huge blister that seemed to throb even as i looked at it the cigarette lighter he burned me with the car cigarette lighter twentyfour hours later fat ollie watts was dead walter cole lived in richmond hill the oldest of the seven sisters neighborhoods in queens begun in the s it had a village center and town common and must have seemed like middle america recreated on manhattan s doorstep when walters parents first moved there from jefferson city shortly before world war ii walter had kept the house north of myrtle avenue on th street after his parents retired to florida he and lee ate almost every friday in triangle hofbräu an old german restaurant on jamaica avenue and walked in the dense woods of forest park during the summer i arrived at walters home shortly after nine he answered the door himself and showed me into what for a less educated man would have been called his den although den didnt do justice to the miniature library he had assembled over half a century of avid reading biographies of keats and saintexupéry shared shelf space with works on forensics sex crimes and criminal psychology fenimore cooper stood back to back with borges barthelme looked uneasy surrounded by various hemingways a macintosh powerbook sat on a leathertopped desk beside three filing cabinets paintings by local artists adorned the walls and a small glassfronted case in the corner displayed shooting trophies haphazardly thrown together as if walter was simultaneously proud of his ability yet embarrassed by his pride the top half of the window was open and i could smell freshly mown grass and hear the sound of kids playing street hockey in the warm evening air the door to the den opened and lee entered she and walter had been together for twentyfour years and they shared each others lives with an ease and grace that susan and i had never approached even at the best of times lees black jeans and white blouse hugged a figure that had survived the rigors of two children and walters love of oriental cuisine her ink black hair through which strands of gray wove like moonlight on dark water was pulled back in a ponytail when she reached up to kiss me lightly on the cheek her arms around my shoulders the scent of lavender enfolded me like a veil and i realized not for the first time that i had always been a little in love with lee cole its good to see you bird she said her right hand resting lightly on my cheek lines of anxiety on her brow giving the lie to the smile on her lips she glanced at walter and something passed between them ill be back later with some coffee she closed the door softly behind her on the way out how are the kids doing i asked as walter poured himself a glass of redbreast irish whiskeythe old stuff with the screw top good he replied lauren still hates high school ellens going to study law in georgetown in the fall so at least one member of the family will understand the way it works he inhaled deeply as he raised the glass to his mouth and sipped i gulped involuntarily and a sudden thirst gripped me walter noticed my discomfiture and reddened shit im sorry he said its all right i responded its good therapy i notice youre still swearing in the house lee hated swearing routinely telling her husband that only oafs resorted to profanity in speech walter usually countered by pointing out that wittgenstein once brandished a poker in the course of a philosophical argument proof positive in his eyes that erudite discourse sometimes wasnt sufficiently expressive for even the greatest of men he moved to a leather armchair at one side of the empty fireplace and motioned to its opposite number lee entered with a silver coffeepot a creamer and two cups on a tray and then left glancing anxiously at walter as she did i knew they had been talking before i arrived they kept no secrets from each other and their unease seemed to indicate that they had discussed more than their concerns about my wellbeing do you want me to sit under a light i asked a small smile moved across walters face with the swiftness of a breeze and then was gone i heard things over the last few months he began looking into his glass like a mystic examining a crystal ball i stayed silent i know you talked to the feds pulled in some favors so you could take a look at files i know you were trying to find the man who killed susan and jenny he looked at me for the first time since he had begun talking i had nothing to say so i poured some coffee for both of us then picked up my own cup and sipped it was javan strong and dark i breathed deeply why are you asking me this because i want to know why youre here why youre back i dont know what youve become if some of the things ive heard are true he swallowed and i felt sorry for him for what he had to say and the questions he had to ask if i had answers to some of them i wasnt sure that i wanted to give them or that walter really wanted to hear them outside the kids had finished their game as darkness drew in and there was a stillness in the air that made walters words sound like a portent they say you found the guy who did it he said and this time there was no hesitation as if he had steeled himself to say what he had to say that you found him and killed him is that true the past was like a snare it allowed me to move a little to circle to turn but in the end it always dragged me back more and more i found things in the cityfavorite restaurants bookshops treeshaded parks even hearts carved bone white into the wood of an old tablethat reminded me of what i had lost as if even a moment of forgetfulness was a crime against their memories i slipped from present to past sliding down the snake heads of memory into what was and what would never be again and so with walters question i fell back to late april back to new orleans they had been dead for almost four months woolrich sat at a table at the rear of the café du monde beside a bubble gum machine with his back against the wall of the main building on the table before him stood a steaming cup of café au lait and a plate of hot beignets covered in powdered sugar outside people bustled down decatur past the greenandwhite pavilion of the café heading for the cathedral or jackson square he wore a tan suit cheaply made and his silk tie was stretched and faded so that he didnt even bother to button his shirt at the collar preferring instead to let the tie hang mournfully at half mast the floor around him was white with sugar as was the only visible part of the green vinyl chair upon which he sat woolrich was an assistant sac of the local fbi field office over at poydras he was also one of the few people from my police past with whom id stayed in touch in some small way and one of the only feds i had ever met who didnt make me curse the day hoover was born more than that he was my friend he had stood by me in the days following the killings never questioning never doubting i remember him standing rainsoaked by the grave water dripping from the rim of his outsized fedora he had been transferred to new orleans soon after a promotion that reflected a successful apprenticeship in at least three other field offices and his ability to keep his head in the turbulent environment of the new york field office in downtown manhattan he was messily divorced the marriage over for maybe twelve years his wife had reverted to her maiden name karen stott and lived in miami with an interior decorator whom she had recently married woolrichs only daughter lisanow thanks to her mothers efforts lisa stotthad joined some religious group in mexico he said she was just eighteen her mother and her new husband didnt seem to care about her unlike woolrich who cared but couldnt get his act together enough to do anything about it the disintegration of his family pained him in a very particular way i knew he came from a broken family himself a whitetrash mother and a father who was well meaning but inconsequential too inconsequential to hold on to his hellcat wife woolrich had always wanted to do better i think more than the rest i believed he shared my sense of loss when susan and jennifer were taken he had put on more weight since i last saw him and the hair on his chest was visible through his sweatsoaked shirt rivulets rolled down from a dense thatch of rapidly graying hair and into the folds of flesh at his neck for such a big man the louisiana summers would be a form of torture woolrich may have looked like a clown may even have acted that way when it suited him but no one in new orleans who knew him ever underestimated him those who had in the past were already rotting in angola penitentiary i like the tie i said it was bright red and decorated with lambs and angels i call it my metaphysical tie woolrich replied my george herbert tie we shook hands woolrich wiping beignet crumbs from his shirtfront as he stood damn things get everywhere he said when i die theyll find beignet crumbs up the crack of my ass thanks ill hold that thought an asian waiter in a white paper cap bustled up and i ordered coffee bring you beignets suh he asked woolrich grinned i told the waiter id skip the beignets how you doin asked woolrich taking a gulp of coffee hot enough to scarify the throat of a lesser man im okay hows life same as it ever was gift wrapped tied with a red bow and handed to someone else you still withwhat was her name judy judy the nurse woolrichs face creased unhappily as if hed just encountered a cockroach in his beignet judy the nut you mean we split up shes gone to work in la jolla for a year maybe more i tell you i decide to take her away for a romantic vacation a couple of months back rent us a room in a twohundreddollaranight inn near stowe take in the country air if we left the window of the bedroom open you know the deal anyway we arrive at this place and its older than mosess dick all dark wood and antique furniture and a bed you could lose a team of cheerleaders in but judy she turns whiter than a polar bears ass and backs away from me you know what she says i waited for him to continue she says that i murdered her in the very same room in a previous life shes backed up against the door reaching for the handle and looking at me like shes expecting me to turn into the son of sam takes me two hours to calm her down and even then she refuses to sleep with me i end up sleeping on a couch in the corner and let me tell you those goddamned antique couches may look like a million bucks and cost more but theyre about as comfortable to sleep on as a concrete slab he finished off the last bite of beignet and dabbed at himself with a napkin then i get up in the middle of the night to take a leak and shes sitting up in bed wide awake with the bedside lamp upside down in her hand waiting to knock my head off if i come near her needless to say this put an end to our five days of passion we checked out the next morning with me over a thousand dollars in the hole but you know what the really funny thing is her regression therapist has told her to sue me for injuries in a past life im about to become a test case for all those donut heads who watch a documentary on pbs and think they were once cleopatra or william the conqueror his eyes misted over at the thought of his lost thousand and the games fate plays on those who go to vermont looking for uncomplicated sex you heard from lisa lately his face clouded over and he waved a hand at me still with the jesus huggers last time she called me it was to say that her leg was fine and to ask for more money if jesus saves he must have had all his cash tied up with the savings and loan lisa had broken her leg in a rollerskating accident the previous year shortly before she found god woolrich was convinced that she was still concussed he stared at me for a time his eyes narrowed youre not okay are you im alive and im here just tell me what youve got he puffed his cheeks and then blew out slowly marshaling his thoughts as he did so theres a woman down in st martin parish an old creole shes got the gift the locals say she keeps away the grisgris you know bad spirits all that shit offers cures for sick kids brings lovers together has visions he stopped and rolled his tongue around his mouth and squinted at me shes a psychic shes a witch you believe the locals and do you shes beenhelpful once or twice in the past according to the local cops ive had nothing to do with her before and now my coffee arrived and woolrich asked for a refill we didnt speak again until the waiter had departed and woolrich had drained half of his coffee in a steaming mouthful shes got about ten children and thousands of goddamn grandchildren and greatgrandchildren some of them live with her or near her so shes never alone shes got a bigger extended family than abraham he smiled but it was a fleeting thing a brief release before what was to come she says a young girl was killed in the bayou a while back in the marshlands where the barataria pirates used to roam she told the sheriffs office but they didnt pay much attention she didnt have a location just said a young girl had been murdered in the bayou said she had seen it in a dream sheriff didnt do nothing about it well thats not entirely true he told the local boys to keep an eye out and then pretty much forgot all about it what brings it up again now the old woman says she hears the girl crying at night i couldnt tell whether woolrich was spooked or just embarrassed by what he was saying but he looked toward the window and wiped his face with a giant grubby handkerchief theres something else though he folded the handkerchief and stuffed it back in his trouser pocket she says the girls face was cut off he breathed in deeply and that she was blinded before she died we drove north on i for a time past an outlet mall and on toward west baton rouge with its truck stops and gambling joints its bars full of oil workers and elsewhere blacks all drinking the same rotgut whiskey and watery dixie beer a hot wind heavy with the dense decayed smell of the bayou pulled at the trees along the highway whipping their branches back and forth then we crossed onto the raised atchafalaya highway its supports embedded beneath the waters as we entered the atchafalaya swamp and cajun country i had been here only once before when susan and i were younger and happier along the henderson levee road we passed the sign for mcgees landing where id eaten tasteless chicken and susan had picked at lumps of deepfried alligator so tough even other alligators would have had trouble digesting it then a cajun fisherman had taken us on a boat trip into the swamps through a semisubmerged cypress forest the sun sank low and bloody over the water turning the tree stumps into dark silhouettes like the fingers of dead men pointing accusingly at the heavens it was another world as far removed from the city as the moon was from the earth and it seemed to create an erotic charge between us as the heat made our shirts cling to our bodies and the sweat drip from our brows when we returned to our hotel in lafayette we made love urgently and with a passion that superseded love our drenched bodies moving together the heat in the room as thick as water woolrich and i did not go as far as lafayette we abandoned the highway for a twolane road that wove through the bayou country for a time before turning into little more than a rutted track pitted by holes filled with dank foulsmelling swamp water around which insects buzzed in thick swarms cypress and willow lined the road and through them the stumps of trees were visible in the waters of the swamp relics of the harvestings of the last century lily pads clustered at the banks and when the car slowed and the light was right i could see bass moving languidly in their shadows breaking the water occasionally i had heard once that jean lafittes brigands had made their home here now others had taken their place killers and smugglers who used the canals and marshes as hiding places for heroin and marijuana and as dark green graves for the butchered their bodies adding to the riotous growth of nature their decay masked by the rich stench of vegetation we took one further turn and here the cypress overhung the road we rattled over a wooden bridge the wood gradually returning to its original color as the paint flaked and disintegrated in the shadows at its far end i thought i saw a giant figure watching us as we passed his eyes white as eggs in the darkness beneath the trees you see him said woolrich who is he the old womans youngest son tee jean she calls him petit jean hes kinda slow but he looks out for her they all do all six of em live in the house the old woman her son three kids from her secondeldests marriagehes dead died with his wife in a car crash three years backand a daughter she has five more sons and three daughters all living within a few miles of here then the local folks they look after her too shes kind of the matriarch around these parts i guess big magic i looked to see if he was being ironic he wasnt we left the trees and arrived in a clearing before a long singlestory house raised above the ground on stripped stumps of trees it looked old but lovingly built the wood on the front unwarped and carefully overlapped the shingles on the roof undamaged but here and there darker where they had been replaced the door stood open blocked only by a wire screen and chairs and childrens toys littered the porch which ran the length of the front of the house and disappeared around the side from behind i could hear the sound of children and the splashing of water the screen door was opened and a small slim woman appeared at the top of the steps she was about thirty with delicate features and lush dark hair drawn back in a ponytail from her light coffeecolored skin yet as we stepped from the car and drew nearer i could see her skin was pitted with scars probably from childhood acne she seemed to recognize woolrich for before we said anything she held the door open so i could step inside woolrich didnt follow i turned back toward him you coming in i didnt bring you here if anyone asks and i dont even want to see her he said he took a seat on the porch and rested his feet on the rail watching the water gleam in the sunlight inside the wood was dark and the air cool doors at either side opened into bedrooms and a formallooking living room with old obviously handcarved furniture simple but carefully and skillfully crafted an ancient radio with an illuminated dial and a band dotted with the names of farflung places played a chopin nocturne the music followed me through the house and into the last bedroom where the old woman waited she was blind her pupils were white set in a huge moon face from which rolls of fat hung to her breastbone her arms visible through the gauze sleeves of her multicolored dress were bigger than mine and her swollen legs were like the trunks of small trees ending in surprisingly small almost dainty feet she sat supported by a mountain of pillows on a giant bed in a room lit only by a hurricane lamp the drapes closed against the sunlight she was at least three hundred and fifty pounds i guessed probably more sit down chile she said taking one of my hands in her own and running her fingers lightly over mine her eyes stared straight ahead not looking at me as her fingers traced the lines on my palm i know why you here she said her voice was high girlish as if she were a huge speaking doll whose tapes had been mixed up with a smaller model you hurtin you burnin inside little girl you woman they gone in the dim light the old woman seemed to crackle with hidden energy tante tell me about the girl in the swamp the girl with no eyes poor chile said the old woman her brow furrowing in sorrow she the fust here she was runnin from sumpin and she los her way took a ride wi him and she never came back hurt her so so bad didnt touch her though cept with the knife she turned her eyes toward me for the first time and i realized she was not blind not in any way that mattered as her hands traced the lines of my palm my eyes closed and i felt that she had been there with the girl in her final moments that she might even have brought her some comfort as the blade went about its business hush chile you come with tante now hush chile take my hand you he done hurtin you now as she touched me i heard and felt deep within myself the blade cutting grating separating muscle from joint flesh from bone soul from body the artist working on his canvas and i felt pain dancing through me arcing through a fading life like a lightning flash welling like the notes of a hellish song through the unknown girl in the louisiana swamp and in her agony i felt the agony of my own child my own wife and i was certain that this was the same man even as the pain faded to its last for the girl in the swamp she was in darkness and i knew he had blinded her before he killed her who is he i said she spoke and in her voice there were four voices the voices of a wife and a daughter the voice of an old obese woman on a bed in a winedark room and the voice of a nameless girl who died a brutal lonely death in the mud and water of a louisiana swamp he the travelin man walter shifted in his chair and the sound of his spoon against the china cup was like the ringing of chimes no i said i didnt find him walter had been silent for a while the whiskey now almost drained from his glass i need a favor not for me but for someone else i waited it has to do with the barton trust the barton trust had been founded in his will by old jack barton an industrialist who made his fortune by supplying parts for the aeronautical industry after the war the trust provided money for research into childrelated issues supported pediatric clinics and generally provided childcare money that the state would not its nominal head was isobel barton old jacks widow although the daytoday running of the business was the responsibility of an attorney named andrew bruce and the trusts chairman philip kooper i knew all this because walter did some fundraising for the trust on occasionraffles bowling tournamentsand also because some weeks before the trust had entered the news for all the wrong reasons during a charity fete held on the grounds of the barton house on staten island a young boy evan baines had disappeared in the end no trace of the boy had been found and the cops had pretty much given up hope they believed he had somehow strayed from the grounds and been abducted it merited some mention in the newspapers for a time and then was gone evan baines no at least i dont think so but it may be a missing person a friend of isobel barton a young woman seems to have gone missing its been a few days and mrs bartons worried her names catherine demeter nothing to link her with the baines disappearance she hadnt even met the bartons at that point bartons plural seems she was dating stephen barton you know anything about him hes an asshole apart from that hes a minor drug pusher for sonny ferrera grew up near the ferreras on staten island and fell in with sonny as a teenager hes into steroids also coke i think but its minor stuff walters brow furrowed how long have you known about this he asked cant remember i replied gym gossip jesus dont tell us anything we might find useful ive only known since tuesday youre not supposed to know i said youre the police nobody tells you things youre supposed to know you used to be a cop too walter muttered youve picked up some bad habits gimme a break walter how do i know who youre checking up on what am i supposed to do go to confession to you once a week i poured some hot coffee into my cup anyway you think there might be a connection between this disappearance and sonny ferrera i continued its possible said walter the feds were tracking stephen barton for a while maybe a year ago before he was supposed to have started seeing catherine demeter they were chasing their tails with that kid so they let it go according to the narcotics file she doesnt seem to have been involved at least not openly but what do they know some of them still think a crack pipe is something a plumber fixes maybe she could have seen something she wasnt supposed to see his face betrayed how lame he thought the link was but he left me to voice it cmon walter steroids and minor coke theres money in it but its strictly little league compared to the rest of ferreras business if he knocked off someone over musclehead drugs then hes even more stupid than we know he is even his old man thinks hes the result of a defective gene ferrera senior sick and decrepit but still a respected figure had been known to refer to his only son as that little prick on occasion is that all youve got as you say were the police no one tells us anything useful he replied dryly did you know sonny is impotent i offered walter stood up waving his empty glass in front of his face and smiling for the first time that evening no no i didnt im not sure i wanted to know either what the hell are you his urologist he glanced over at me as he reached for the redbreast i waved my fingers in a gesture of disregard that went no farther than my wrist pili pilar still with him i asked testing the waters far as i know i hear he pushed nicky glasses out of a window a few weeks back because he fell behind on the vig the world bank had loans out that attracted lower interest than sonny ferreras financial operations then again the world bank probably didnt throw people out of the tenth floor because they couldnt keep up with the interest at least not yet tough on nicky another hundred years and hed have had the loan paid off pilid better ease up on his temper or hes gonna run out of people to push through windows walter didnt smile will you talk to her he asked as he resumed his seat mps walter i sighed fourteen thousand people disappear in new york every year it wasnt even clear if this woman was missingin which case she didnt want to be found or someone else didnt want her foundor simply misplaced which meant that she had merely upped sticks and moved off to another town without breaking the news to her good friend isobel barton or to her lovely boyfriend stephen barton those are the kinds of issues pis have to consider when faced with missing persons cases tracing missing persons is bread and butter for pis but i wasnt a pi i had taken on fat ollies skip because it was easy work or seemed to be at the time i didnt want to file for a pi license with the state licensing services in albany i didnt want to get involved in missing persons work maybe i was afraid it would distract me too much maybe i just didnt care enough not then she wont go to the cops said walter the woman isnt even officially missing yet since no one has reported her so how come you know about it you know tony looloo i nodded tony loomax was a smalltime pi with a stammer who had never graduated beyond skips and white trash divorces loomax is an unusual candidate for isobel bartons patronage i said it seems he did some work for one of the household staff a year or two back traced her husband whod run off with their savings mrs barton told him she wanted something similar done but wanted it done quietly still doesnt explain your involvement i have some stuff on tony mild overstepping of legal boundaries which he would prefer i didnt act on tony figured i might like to know that isobel barton had been making lowkey approaches i spoke to kooper he believes the trust doesnt need any more bad publicity i figured maybe i could do him a favor if tony has the call then why are you approaching me weve encouraged tony to pass it on hes told isobel barton that hes passing her on to someone she can trust because he cant take the case seems his mother just died and he has to go to the funeral tony looloo doesnt have a mother he was brought up in an orphanage well someones mother must have died said walter testily he can go to that funeral he stopped and i could see the doubt in his eyes as the rumors he had heard flicked a fin in the depths of his mind and thats why im approaching you even if i tried to do this quietly through the usual channels someone would know christ you take a drink of water at headquarters and ten guys piss it out what about the girls family he shrugged i dont know much more but i dont think there is one look bird im asking you because youre good you were a smart cop if youd stayed on the force the rest of us would have been cleaning your shoes and polishing your shield your instincts were good i reckon they still are plus you owe me one people who go shooting up the boroughs dont usually walk away quite so easily i was silent for a while i could hear lee banging around in the kitchen while a tv show played in the background perhaps it was a remnant of what had taken place earlier the apparently senseless killing of fat ollie watts and his girlfriend the death of the shooter but it felt as if the world had shifted out of joint and that nothing was fitting as it should even this felt wrong i believed walter was holding back on me i heard the doorbell ring and then there was a muffled exchange of voices one of them lees and the other a deep male voice seconds later there was a knock on the door and lee showed in a tall grayhaired man in his fifties he wore a dark blue doublebreasted suitit looked like bossand a red christian dior tie with an interlocking gold cd pattern his shoes sparkled like theyd been shined with spit although since this was philip kooper it was probably someone elses spit kooper was an unlikely figure to act as chairman and spokesman of a childrens charity he was thin and pale faced and his mouth managed the unique trick of being simultaneously slim and pursed his fingers were long and tapering almost like claws kooper looked like he had been disinterred for the express purpose of making people uneasy if he had turned up at one of the trusts kids parties all of the children would have cried this him he asked walter after declining a drink he flicked his head at me like a frog swallowing a fly i played with the sugar bowl and tried to look offended this is parker nodded walter i waited to see if kooper would offer to shake hands he didnt his hands remained clasped in front of him like a professional mourner at a particularly uninvolving funeral have you explained the situation to him walter nodded again but looked embarrassed koopers manners were worse than a bad childs i stayed seated and didnt say anything kooper sniffed and then stood in silence while he looked down on me he gave the impression that it was a position with which he was entirely familiar this is a delicate situation mr parker as im sure youll appreciate any communication in this matter will be made to me in the first instance before you impart any information to mrs barton is that clear i wondered if kooper was worth the effort of annoying and decided after looking at walters look of discomfort that he probably wasnt at least not yet but i was starting to feel sorry for isobel barton and i hadnt even met her my understanding was that mrs barton was hiring me i said eventually thats correct but you will be answerable to me i dont think so theres a small matter of confidentiality ill look into it but if its unconnected with the baines kid or the ferreras i reserve the right to keep what i learn between isobel barton and myself that is not satisfactory mr parker said kooper a faint blush of color rose in his cheeks and hung there for a moment looking lost in the tundra of his complexion perhaps i am not making myself clear in this matter you will report to me first i have powerful friends mr parker if you do not cooperate i can ensure that your license is revoked they must be very powerful friends because i dont have a license i said i stood up and koopers fists tightened slightly you should consider yoga i said youre too tense i thanked walter for the coffee and moved to the door wait he said i turned back to see him staring at kooper after a few moments kooper gave a barely perceptible shrug of his shoulders and moved to the window he didnt look at me again koopers attitude and walters expression conspired against my better judgment and i decided to talk to isobel barton i take it shes expecting me i asked walter i told tony to tell her you were good that if the girl was alive youd find her there was another brief moment of silence and if shes dead mr kooper asked that question as well said walter what did you say he swallowed the last of his whiskey the ice cubes rattling against the glass like old bones behind him kooper was a dark silhouette against the window like a promise of bad news i told him youd bring back the body in the end thats what it all came down to bodiesbodies found and yet to be found and i recalled how woolrich and i stood outside the old womans house on that april day and looked out over the bayou i could hear the water lapping gently at the shore and farther out i watched a small fishing boat bobbing on the water two figures casting out from either side but both woolrich and i were looking deeper than the surface as if by staring hard enough we could penetrate to the depths and find the body of a nameless girl in the dark waters do you believe her he said at last i dont know i really dont know theres no way were gonna find that body if it exists without more than weve got we start trawling for bodies in bayous and pretty soon were gonna be knee deep in bones people been dumping bodies in these swamps for centuries be a miracle if we didnt find something i walked away from him he was right of course assuming there was a body we needed more from the old woman than she had given us i felt like i was trying to grip smoke but what the old woman had said was the closest thing yet to a lead on the man who had killed jennifer and susan i wondered if i was crazy taking the word of a blind woman who heard voices in her sleep i probably was do you know what he looks like tante i had asked her watching as her head moved ponderously from side to side in response only see him when he comes for you she replied then you know him i reached the car and looked back to see a figure on the porch with woolrich it was the girl with the scarred face standing gracefully on the tips of her toes as she leaned toward the taller man i saw woolrich run his finger tenderly across her cheek and then softly speak her name florence he kissed her lightly on the lips then turned and walked toward me without looking back at her neither of us said anything about it on the journey back to new orleans it rained throughout that night breaking the shell of heat that had surrounded the city and the streets of manhattan seemed to breathe easier the next morning it was almost cool as i ran the pavement was hard on my knees but large areas of grass were sparse in this part of the city i bought a newspaper on the way back to my apartment then showered changed and read over breakfast shortly after am i headed out to the barton house isobel barton lived in the secluded house her late husband had built in the seventies on todt hill an admirable if unsuccessful attempt to replicate the antebellum houses of his native georgia in an east coast setting and on a smaller scale old jack barton an amiable soul by all accounts had apparently made up with money and determination for what he lacked in good taste the gate to the drive was open as i arrived and the exhaust fumes of another car hung in the air the cab turned in just as the electronic gates were about to rumble closed and we followed the lead car a white bmw i with tinted windows to the small courtyard in front of the house the cab looked out of place in that setting although how the barton household might have felt about my own battered mustang currently undergoing repairs i wasnt so sure as i pulled up a slim woman dressed conservatively in a gray suit emerged from the bmw and watched me curiously as i paid the cabdriver her gray hair was tied back in a bun that did nothing to soften her severe features a large black man wearing a chauffeurs uniform appeared at the door of the house and moved quickly to intercept me as i walked from the departing cab parker i believe im expected the chauffeur gave me a look that told me if i was lying hed make me wish id stayed in bed he told me to wait before turning back to the woman in gray she glanced at me briefly but nastily before exchanging a few words with the chauffeur who moved off to the back of the house as she approached me mr parker im ms christie mrs bartons personal assistant you should have stayed at the gate until we were sure who you were in a window above the door a curtain twitched slightly and then was still if you have a staff entrance ill use that in future i got the impression from ms christie that she hoped that eventuality wouldnt arise she eyed me coldly for a moment then turned on her heel if youll come with me please she said over her shoulder as she moved toward the door the gray suit was threadbare at the edges i wondered if mrs barton would haggle over my rates if isobel barton was short of cash she could simply have sold off some of the antiques that furnished the house because the interior was an auctioneers wet dream two large rooms opened out at either side of a hallway filled with furniture that looked like it was used only when presidents died a wide staircase curved up to the right a closed door lay straight ahead while another nestled under the stairs i followed ms christie through the latter and into a small but surprisingly bright and modern office with a computer in a corner and a tv and video unit built into the bookshelves maybe mrs barton wouldnt haggle about the rates after all ms christie sat down behind a pine desk removed some papers from her valise and shuffled through them in obvious irritation before finding what she wanted this is a standard confidentiality agreement drawn up by the trusts legal advisers she began pushing it toward me with one hand while clicking a pen simultaneously with the other it is an undertaking on your behalf to keep all communication relating to the matter in hand between mrs barton myself and yourself she used the pen to point to the relevant sections on the agreement like an insurance salesman trying to slip a bum contract past a sucker id like you to sign it before we proceed any further she concluded it seemed like nobody involved with the barton trust had a particularly trusting nature i dont think so i said if youre concerned about possible breaches of confidentiality then hire a priest to do your work otherwise youll have to take my word that what passes between us will go no further perhaps i should have felt guilty about lying to her i didnt i was a good liar its one of the gifts god gives alcoholics thats not acceptable i am already unconvinced about the necessity of hiring you and i certainly feel it is inappropriate to do so without she was interrupted by the sound of the office door opening i turned to see a tall attractive woman enter her age indeterminable through a combination of the gentleness of nature and the magic of cosmetics at a glance i would have guessed she was in her late forties but if this was isobel barton then i knew she was closer to fiftyfive maybe older she wore a pale blue dress that was too subtly simple to be anything but expensive and displayed a figure that was either surgically enhanced or extremely well preserved as she drew closer and the tiny wrinkles in her face became clearer i guessed it was the latter isobel barton did not look like the sort of woman who resorted to plastic surgery around her neck gold and diamonds glittered and a pair of matching earrings sparkled as she walked her hair too was gray but she let it hang long and loose on her shoulders she was still an attractive woman and she walked like she knew it philip kooper had borne the brunt of the media attention following the disappearance of the baines boy but that attention had not been significant the baines boy was from a family of dopers and nohopers his disappearance merited a mention only because of the trust and even then the trusts lawyers and patrons had called in enough favors to ensure that speculation was kept to a minimum the boys mother was separated from his father and they hadnt been getting along any better since he left the police were still trying to trace the father in case of a possible snatch even though every indication was that the father a petty criminal hated his child in some cases that might be enough to justify taking the child and killing him to get at his estranged wife when i was a rookie patrolman i once arrived at a tenement to find a man had abducted his baby daughter and drowned her in the bath because his exwife wouldnt let him have the tv after they separated only one piece of coverage of the baines disappearance stuck in my mind a picture of mrs barton snapped headbowed as she visited the mother of evan baines in a rundown project it was supposed to have been a private visit the photographer returning from the scene of a drug killing just happened to be passing one or two papers took the picture but they ran it small thank you caroline ill talk to mr parker alone for a while she smiled as she said it but her tone brooked no argument her assistant affected a lack of concern at the dismissal but her eyes flashed fire when she had left the room mrs barton seated herself on a stiffbacked chair away from the desk and motioned me toward a black leather couch then turned her smile on me im sorry about that i didnt authorize any such agreement but caroline can be overprotective of me at times can we offer you coffee or would you prefer a drink neither thank you before you go any further mrs barton i should tell you that i dont really do missing persons work in my experience searching for missing persons was best left to specialist agencies with the manpower to chase up leads and possible sightings some solo investigators who took on that kind of work were at best ill equipped and at worst little better than parasites who preyed on the hopes of those who remained to keep funding minimal efforts for even smaller returns mr loomax said you might say that but only out of modesty he told me to say he would regard it as a personal favor i smiled despite myself the only favor i would give tony looloo would be not to piss on his grave when he died according to mrs barton she had met catherine demeter through her son who had seen the girl working at devriess department store and had pestered her for a date mrs barton and her sonher stepson to be accurate since jack barton had been married once before to a southern woman who had divorced him after eight years and moved to hawaii with a singerwere not close she was aware that her son was engaged in activities that were as she put it unsavory and had tried to get him to change his ways both for his own sake and the sake of the trust i nodded sympathetically sympathy was the only possible emotion to feel for anyone involved with stephen barton when she heard he was seeing a new girlfriend she asked if they could all meet together she said and a date had been arranged in the end her son had failed to appear but catherine had turned up and after an initial awkwardness the two quickly struck up a friendship far more amicable than the relationship that existed between the girl and stephen barton the two had continued to meet occasionally for coffee and lunch despite invitations the girl had politely refused offers from mrs barton to come out to the house and stephen barton had never brought her then catherine demeter had simply dropped out of sight she had left work early on saturday and had failed to keep an early dinner appointment on sunday with mrs barton that was the last anyone had heard of catherine demeter said mrs barton two days had now passed and she had heard nothing from her because of well the publicity that the trust has received recently over the disappearance of that poor child i was reluctant to cause a fuss or draw any further adverse attention down on us she said i called mr loomax and he seemed to think that catherine may simply have drifted on somewhere else it happens a lot i believe do you think theres something more to it than that i really dont know but she was so happy with her job and she appeared to be getting on well with stephen she stopped for a moment at this mention of her sons name as if considering whether or not to proceed then stephen has been running wild for some timesince before his fathers death in fact do you know the ferrera family mr parker im aware of them stephen fell in with their youngest son despite all of our efforts i know he keeps bad company and i know hes involved with drugs im afraid he may have dragged catherine into something and she paused again briefly i enjoyed her company there was something gentle about her and she seemed so sad sometimes she said that she was anxious to settle down here after moving around for so long did she say where she had been all over i gather that she had worked in a number of states did she say anything about her past give any indication that something might be troubling her i think something may have happened to her family when she was young she told me that she had a sister who died she didnt say any more she said she couldnt talk about it and i didnt press her on it mr loomax may be right she may simply have moved on again mrs barton shook her head insistently no she would have told me im sure of it stephen hasnt heard from her and neither have i im afraid for her and i want to know that she is safe thats all she doesnt even have to know that i hired you or that i was concerned for her will you take the case i was still reluctant to do walter coles dirty work and to take advantage of isobel barton but i had little else on my plate except an appearance in court the following day on behalf of an insurance firm another case i had taken for the money and to pass the time if there was a connection between the disappearance of catherine demeter and sonny ferrera then she was almost certainly in trouble if sonny had been involved in the killing of fat ollie watts it was clear that he was going off the rails ill give it a few days i said as a favor i added do you want to know my rates she was already writing a check drawn on her private account and not that of the trust heres three thousand dollars in advance and this is my card my private number is on the back she moved her chair forward now what else do you need to know that evening i had dinner at river on amsterdam avenue close to seventieth street where the classic beef made it the best vietnamese in town and where the staff moved by so softly that it was like being waited on by shadows or passing breezes i watched a young couple at a nearby table intertwining their hands running their fingers over each others knuckles and fingertips tracing delicate circles in their palms then gripping their hands together and pressing the heel of each hand forcefully against the other and as they simulated their lovemaking a waitress drifted by and smiled knowingly at me as i watched the day after i visited isobel barton i made a brief visit to court in connection with the insurance case a claim had been made against a phone company by a contracted electrician who said he had fallen down a hole in the road while examining underground cables and was no longer able to work as a result he may not have been able to work but he had still been able to power lift five hundred pounds in a cash contest in a boston gymnasium i had used a palmsize panasonic video camera to capture his moment of glory the insurance company presented the evidence to a judge who suspended any further decision on the matter for one week i didnt even have to give evidence afterward i had coffee in a diner and read the paper before heading over to pete hayess old gym in tribeca i knew stephen barton worked out there sometimes if his girlfriend had disappeared then there was a strong possibility that barton might know where she had gone or equally important why i remembered him vaguely as a strong nordiclooking type his body obscenely pumped from steroid use he was in his late twenties but the combination of training and tanning salons had worn his face to the consistency of old leather adding at least ten years to his age as artists and wall street lawyers had started moving into the tribeca area attracted by loft space in the cast iron and masonry buildings petes gym had moved upmarket filling what used to be a spit and sawdust place with mirrors and potted palms and sacrilege upon sacrilege a juice bar now heavyweight boneheads and serious power lifters worked out alongside accountants with paunches and female executives with powerdress business suits and cell phones the bulletin board at the door advertised something called spinning which involved sitting on a bike for an hour and sweating yourself into a red agony ten years ago even the suggestion that the gym might be used for such a purpose would have caused petes regular clientele to bust the place up a wholesomelooking blonde in a gray leotard buzzed me into petes office the last bastion of what the gym had once been old posters advertising power lifting competitions and mr universe shows shared wall space with pictures of pete alongside steve reeves joe weider and oddly the wrestler hulk hogan bodybuilding trophies sat in a glassfronted cabinet while behind a battered pine desk sat pete himself his muscles slackening in old age but still a powerful impressive figure his saltandpepper hair cut in a short military style i had trained in the gym for almost six years until i was promoted to detective and started to destroy myself pete stood and nodded his hands in his pockets and his loosefitting top doing nothing to conceal the size of his shoulders and arms long time he said sorry about what happened to he trailed off and moved his chin and shoulders in a kind of combination shrug a gesture to the past and what it contained i nodded back and leaned against an old gunmetal gray filing cabinet adorned with decals advertising health supplements and lifting magazines spinning pete he grimaced yeah i know still spinning makes me two hundred dollars an hour i got forty exercise bikes on the floor above us and i couldnt make more money with a printing press and green ink stephen barton around pete kicked at some imaginary obstacle on the worn wooden floor not for a week or so he in trouble i dont know i replied is he pete sat down slowly and wincing stretched his legs out in front of him years of squatting had taken their toll on his knees leaving them weak and arthritic youre not the first person to come here asking about him this week couple of guys in cheap suits were in here yesterday trying to find him recognized one of them as sal inzerillo used to be a good lightmiddleweight until he started taking falls i remember him i paused works for old man ferrera now i hear might do nodded pete might do might have worked for the old man in the ring too if you believe the stories this about drugs i dont know i replied pete glanced at me quickly to see if i was lying decided i wasnt and went back to examining the tops of his sneakers you hear of any trouble between sonny and the old man anything that might have involved stephen barton theres trouble between them sure otherwise whats inzerillo doing damaging my floor with his black rubber soles dont know that it involves barton though i moved on to the subject of catherine demeter do you remember a girl with barton recently she may have been around here sometimes short dark hair slight overbite maybe in her early thirties barton has lots of girls but i dont remember that one dont notice mostly unless theyre smarter than barton which makes me wonder not difficult i said this one probably was smarter is barton a hitter hes mean sure popping pills frazzled his brain gave him bad roid rage its fight or fuck with him fuck mainly my old lady could take him in a fight he looked at me intently i know what he was into but he didnt sell here id have forcefed his shit to him till he burst if he tried it i didnt believe pete but i let it go steroids were part of the game now and there was nothing pete could do except bluster he pursed his lips and pulled his legs slowly in a lot of women were attracted to him by his size barton was a big guy and he sure talked big some women just want the protection someone like him seems to offer they believe if they give the guy what he wants hell look out for them pity she chose stephen barton then i said yeah agreed pete maybe she wasnt so smart after all i had brought my training gear with me and did ninety minutes in the gym the mirrored walls reflecting my efforts back at me from every angle it had been some time since i trained properly to avoid embarrassment i skipped the bench and stuck to shoulders back and light arm work enjoying the sensation of strength and movement in the bentover rows and the pressure on my biceps during the curls i still looked pretty good i thought although the assessment was a result of insecurity instead of vanity at just under six feet i still retained some of my lifters buildthe wide shoulders definition in the biceps and triceps and a chest that was at least bigger than two eggs frying on the sidewalkand i hadnt regained much of the fat i had lost during the year i still had my hair although there was gray creeping back from the temples and sprinkling the fringe my eyes were clear enough to be recognizably grayblue set in a slightly long face now deeply etched at the eyes and mouth with the marks of remembered grief clean shaven with a decent haircut a good suit and some flattering light i could look almost respectable in the right light i could even have claimed to be thirtytwo without making people snigger too loudly it was only two years less than my age on my drivers license but these little things become more important as you get older when i was finished i packed my gear declined petes offer of a protein shakeit smelled like rotten bananas and stopped off for a coffee instead i felt relaxed for the first time in weeks the endorphins pumping through my system and a pleasant tightness developing across my shoulders and back the next call i made was to devriess department store on fifth avenue the personnel manager called himself a human resources manager and like personnel managers the world over was one of the least personable people one could meet sitting opposite him it was difficult not to feel that anyone who could happily reduce individuals to resources to the same level as oil bricks and canaries in coal mines probably shouldnt be allowed to have any human relations that didnt involve locks and prison bars in other words timothy cary was a firstdegree prick from the tip of his closecropped dyed hair to the toes of his patent leather shoes i had contacted his secretary earlier that afternoon to make the appointment telling her that i was acting for an attorney in the matter of an inheritance coming to ms demeter cary and his secretary deserved each other a wild dog on a chain would have been more helpful than cary s secretary and easier to get past my client is anxious that ms demeter be contacted as soon as possible i told him as we sat in his small prissy office the will is extremely detailed and there are a lot of forms to be filled out and your client would be im afraid i cant tell you that im sure you understand cary looked like he understood but didnt want to he leaned back in his chair and gently rubbed his expensive silk tie between his fingers it had to be expensive it was too tasteless to be anything else crisp lines showed along his shirt as if it had just been removed from its packaging assuming timothy cary would have anything to do with something so plebeian as a plastic wrapper if he ever visited the shop floor it must have been like an angel descending albeit an angel who looked like hed just encountered a bad smell miss demeter was due in work yesterday cary glanced down at a file on his desk she had monday off so we havent seen her since saturday is that usual to have monday off i wasnt anxious to know but the question distracted cary from the file isobel barton didnt have catherine demeters new address catherine would usually contact her or mrs barton would have her assistant leave a message at devriess as cary brightened slightly at the opportunity to discuss a subject close to his heart and started mouthing off about work schedules i memorized her address and ssn i eventually managed to interrupt him for long enough to ask if catherine demeter had been ill on her last day at work or had complained of being disturbed in any way im not aware of any such communication miss demeters position with devries is currently under review as a result of her absence he concluded smugly i hope for her sake that her inheritance is considerable i dont think he meant it after some routine delaying tactics cary gave me permission to speak with the woman who had worked with catherine on her last shift in the store i met her in a supervisors office off the shop floor martha friedman was in her early sixties she was plump with dyed red hair and a face so caked with cosmetics that the floor of the amazon jungle probably saw more natural light but she tried to be helpful she had been working with catherine demeter in the china department on saturday it was her first time to work with her since mrs friedmans usual assistant had been taken ill and someone was needed to cover for her did you notice anything unusual about her behavior i asked as mrs friedman took the opportunity afforded by some time in the supervisors office to discreetly examine the papers on his desk did she seem distressed or anxious in any way mrs friedman furrowed her brow slightly she broke a piece of china an aynsley vase she had just arrived and was showing it to a customer when she dropped it then when i looked around she was running across the shop floor heading for the escalators most unprofessional i thought even if she was sick and was she sick she said she felt sick but why run for the escalators we have a staff washroom on each floor i got the feeling that mrs friedman knew more than she was saying she was enjoying the attention and wanted to draw it out i leaned toward her confidentially but what do you think mrs friedman she preened a little and leaned forward in turn touching my hand lightly to emphasize her point she saw someone someone she was trying to reach before they left the store tom the security guard on the east door told me she ran out by him and stood looking around the street were supposed to get permission to leave the store when on duty he should have reported her but he just told me instead toms a schvartze but hes okay do you have any idea who she might have seen no she just refused to discuss it she doesnt have any friends among the staff far as i can tell and now i can see why i spoke to the security guard and the supervisor but they couldnt add anything to what mrs friedman had told me i stopped at a diner for coffee and a sandwich returned to my apartment to pick up a small black bag my friend angel had given me and then took another cab to catherine demeters apartment the apartment was in a converted fourstory redbrick in greenpoint a part of brooklyn that was populated mainly by italians irish and poles the latter counting a large number of former solidarity activists among them it was from greenpoints continental iron works that the ironclad monitor had emerged to fight the confederate ship merrimac when greenpoint was brooklyn s industrial center the cast iron manufacturers the potters and printers were all gone now but many of the descendants of the original workers still remained small clothing boutiques and polish bakeries shared frontage with established kosher delis and stores selling used electrical goods catherine demeters block was still a little down at heel and kids wearing sneakers and lowslung jeans sat on the steps of most of the buildings smoking and whistling and calling at passing women she lived in apartment probably near the top of the building i tried the bell but wasnt surprised when there was no answer from the intercom instead i tried and when an elderly womans voice responded i told her i was from the gas company and had a report of a leak but the supers apartment was empty she was silent for a moment then buzzed me in i guessed shed probably check with the super so time was limited although if the apartment didnt reveal anything about where catherine demeter might have gone id have to talk to the super anyway or approach the neighbors or maybe even talk to the mailman as i passed into the lobby i used a pick to open the mailbox for apartment finding only a copy of the most recent new york magazine and what looked like two junk mail drops i closed the box and took the stairs up to the third floor the third floor was silent with six newly varnished apartment doors along the hall three on each side i walked quietly to number and took the black bag from under my coat i knocked once more on the door just to be sure and removed the power rake from the bag angel was the best b ampe man i knew and even as a cop id had reasons to use him in return id never hassled angel and hed stayed out of my way professionally when he did go down id done my best to make things a little easier for him inside the rake had been a thankyou of sorts an illegal thankyou it looked like an electric drill but was smaller and slimmer with a prong at its tip that acted as a pick and tension tool i stuck the prong in the lock and squeezed the trigger the rake clattered noisily for a couple of seconds and then the lock turned i slipped in quietly and closed the door behind me seconds before another door in the corridor opened i stayed still and waited until it closed again then put the rake back in the bag reopened the door and took a toothpick from my pocket i snapped it into four pieces and jammed them into the lock it would give me time to get to the fire escape if someone tried to enter the apartment while i was there then i closed the door and turned on the lights a short hallway with a threadbare rug led to a clean living room cheaply furnished with a battered tv and a mismatched sofa and chairs to one side was a small kitchen and to the other a bedroom i checked the bedroom first some paperback novels stood on a small shelf beside the bed the only other furniture consisted of a wardrobe and dressing table both of which appeared to have been made up from ikea kits i checked under the bed and found an empty suitcase there were no cosmetics on the dressing table which meant that she had probably packed a small overnight bag when she left and taken them with her she probably hadnt intended to stay away for long and she certainly didnt appear to have left for good i checked the closet but there were only clothes and a few pairs of shoes inside the first two drawers in the dresser also contained only clothes but the last one was filled with papers the accumulated documents tax forms and employment records of a life spent moving from city to city from job to job catherine demeter had spent a long time in the waitressing game moving from new hampshire to florida and back again with the social season she had also spent some time in chicago las vegas and phoenix as well as numerous small towns judging by the collection of wage slips and tax documents in her drawer there were also various bank statements she had about nineteen thousand dollars in a savings account in a citibank as well as some stocks and bonds bound carefully with a thick blue ribbon finally there was a passport updated recently and within it three extra passportsize photos of herself catherine demeter true to isobel bartons description was a small attractive woman in her midthirties fivetwo with dark hair cut short in a bob pale blue eyes and a fair complexion i took the extra photos and put them in my wallet then turned to examine the only item of a very personal nature in the drawer it was a photo album thick and worn at the corners within it was what i assumed to be a history of the demeter family from sepiatinted photos of grandparents through the wedding of what i guessed were her parents and on through the photos of two girls growing up sometimes with parents and friends sometimes together sometimes alone pictures from the beach from family holidays from birthdays and christmas and thanksgiving the memories of two sisters starting off in life the resemblance between the two was clear catherine was the younger the overbite visible even then the girl i took to be her sister was perhaps two or three years older with sandycolored hair a beautiful girl even at eleven or twelve there were no more pictures of the older girl after that age the rest consisted of catherine alone or with her parents and the record of her growth was more periodic the sense of celebration and joyfulness gone eventually the photos dwindled away to nothing with a final picture of catherine on the day of her high school graduation a solemnlooking young woman with dark rings beneath eyes that seemed close to tears the testimonial attached came from the principal of haven high school in virginia something had been removed from the final pages of the album small pieces of what appeared to be newspaper rested at the base of the album pages most merely tiny fragments as thin as threads but one about an inch square the paper was yellowing with age with a fragment of a weather report on one side and part of a picture on the other the tip of some sandblond hair visible in one corner tucked into the last page were two birth certificates one for catherine louise demeter dated march and the other for amy ellen demeter dated december i returned the album to the drawer and went into the bathroom next door it was clean and neat like the rest of the apartment with soap shower gels and foam bath arranged neatly on the white tiles by the bath and towels stored in a small cabinet under the sink i opened one side of the mirrored cabinet on the wall it contained toothpaste floss and mouthwash as well as some nonprescription medicines for cold relief and water retention evening primrose capsules and assorted vitamin pills there were no birth control pills or other contraceptives maybe stephen barton took care of that although i doubted it stephen didnt seem like the sensitive type the other side of the cabinet contained a miniature pharmacy with enough uppers and downers to keep catherine moving like a roller coaster there were librium for mood swings ativan to combat agitation and valium thorazine and lorazepam for anxiety some were empty others half empty the most recent came from a prescription from dr frank forbes a psychiatrist i knew the name fucking frank forbes had screwed or attempted to screw so many of his patients that it was sometimes suggested that they should charge him he had been on the verge of losing his license on a number of occasions but the complaints were either withdrawn never got to court or were suppressed through the judicious application of some of fucking franks funds i heard he had been unusually quiet lately after one of his patients had contracted a dose of the clap after an encounter with frank and then had promptly slapped a lawsuit on him this one i gathered was proving difficult for fucking frank to bury catherine demeter was clearly a very unhappy woman and was unlikely to get any happier if she was seeing frank forbes i wasnt too keen on visiting him he had once tried to come on to elizabeth gordon the daughter of one of susans divorced friends and id paid him a visit to remind him of his duties as a doctor and to threaten to throw him from his office window if it ever happened again after that i tried to take a semiprofessional interest in frank forbess activities there was nothing else of note in catherines bathroom or in the rest of her apartment as i was leaving i stopped at her telephone picked it up and pressed the redial button after the beeps subsided a voice answered haven county sheriffs office hello i hung up and called a guy i knew in the telephone company five minutes later he came back with a list of local numbers called from friday to sunday there were only three and they were all mundanea chinese takeout a local laundry and a movie information line the local company couldnt give me any details of any long distance calls made so i tried a second number this one connected me with one of the many agencies that offer pis and those with a deep and abiding interest in other peoples business the opportunity to purchase confidential information illegally the agency was able to tell me within twenty minutes that fifteen calls had been made to haven virginia numbers on saturday evening through sprint seven to the sheriffs office and eight to a private residence in the town i was given both numbers and i went with the second the message on the answering machine was terse this is earl lee granger im not here right now leave a message after the beep or if it relates to police business contact the sheriffs office at i punched in the number got the haven county sheriffs office again and asked to speak to the sheriff i was told that sheriff granger wasnt available so i asked to speak to whoever was in charge in his absence the ranking deputy was alvin martin i learned but he was out on a case the deputy on the phone didnt know when the sheriff would be back from his tone i guessed the sheriff hadnt simply gone out to buy cigarettes he asked me my name and i thanked him and hung up it seemed that something had caused catherine demeter to get in touch with the sheriff in her hometown but not with the nypd if there was nothing else id have to pay a visit to haven first though i decided to pay a visit to fucking frank forbes i stopped off at azure on third avenue and bought myself some expensive fresh strawberries and pineapple from the deli then took them around to the citicorp center to eat in the public space i liked the buildings simple lines and its strange angled top it was also one of the few new developments where a similar imagination had been applied to its interior its sevenstory atrium was still green with trees and shrubs its shops and restaurants were packed with people and a handful of worshipers sat silently in its simple sunken church two blocks away fucking frank forbes had a swank office in a seventies smokedglass development at least for the present i took the elevator up and entered the reception area where a young and pretty brunette was typing something on the computer she looked up as i entered and smiled brightly i tried not to let my jaw hang as i smiled back is dr forbes available i asked do you have an appointment im not a patient thankfully but frank and i go way back tell him charlie parker wants to see him her smile faltered a little but she buzzed franks office and gave him the message her face paled slightly as she listened to his response but she held herself together remarkably well all things considered im afraid dr forbes cant see you she said the smile now fading rapidly is that really what he said she blushed slightly no not quite are you new here this is my first week frank select you personally she looked puzzled yees get another job hes a deviant and hes on his way out of business i walked past her and entered franks office while she took all this in there was no patient in franks consulting room just the good doctor himself leafing through some notes on his desk he didnt look pleased to see me his thin mustache curled in distaste like a black worm and a red bloom spread from his neck to his highdomed forehead before disappearing into his brush of wiry black hair he was tall over six feet and he worked out he looked real good but looks were as far as it went there was nothing good about fucking frank forbes if he handed you a dollar the ink would be running before it got to your wallet get the fuck out parker in case youve forgotten you cant come barging in here anymore youre not a cop now and the force is probably all the richer for your absence he leaned toward the intercom button but his receptionist had already entered behind me call the police marcie better still call my lawyer tell him im about to file for harassment hear youre giving him a lot of business at the moment frank i said taking a seat in a leather upright opposite his desk i also hear maibaum and locke are handling the lawsuit for that unfortunate woman with the social disease ive done some business with them in the past and theyre real hot maybe i could put them onto elizabeth gordon you remember elizabeth dont you frank frank cast an instinctive glance over his shoulder at the window and twisted his chair away from it its okay marcie he said nodding uneasily to the receptionist i heard the door close softly behind me what do you want you have a patient called catherine demeter come on parker you know i cant discuss my patients even if i could i wouldnt share shit with you frank youre the worst shrink i know i wouldnt let a dog be treated by you because youd probably try to fuck it so save the ethics for the judge i think she may be in trouble and i want to find her if you dont help me ill be in touch with maibaum and locke so fast youll think im telepathic frank tried to look like he was wrestling with his conscience although he couldnt have found his conscience without a shovel and an exhumation order she missed an appointment yesterday she didnt give any notice why was she seeing you involutional melancholia mainly thats depression to you characteristic of middle to later stages of life at least thats what it seemed like initially but parker this is confidential even i have standards youre joking go on frank sighed and fiddled with a pencil on his blotter then moved to a cabinet removed a file and sat back down he opened it leafed through it and began to talk her sister died when catherine was eight or rather her sister was killed she was one of a number of children murdered in a town called haven in virginia in the late sixties early seventies the children males and females were abducted tortured and their remains dumped in the cellar of an empty house outside the town frank was detached now a doctor running through a case history that might have been as distant as a fairy tale to him for all the emotion he put into the telling her sister was the fourth child to die but the first white child after she disappeared the police began to take a real interest a local woman a wealthy local woman was suspected her car had been seen near the house after one of the children disappeared and then she tried an unsuccessful snatch on a kid from another town about twenty miles away the kid a boy scratched up her face then gave a description to the cops they went after her but the locals heard and got to the house first her brother was there he was a homosexual according to locals and the cops believed she had an accomplice a male who might have driven the car while she made the snatches the locals figured the brother was a likely suspect he was found hanged in the basement and the woman burned to death in another of the old houses the case simplyfaded away but not for catherine no not for her she left the town after graduating from high school but her parents stayed the mother died about ten years ago father shortly after and catherine demeter just kept moving did she ever go back to haven no not after the funerals she said everything was dead to her there and thats it pretty much it all comes back to haven any boyfriends or casuals none that she mentioned to me and question time is over now get out if you ever bring this up again in public or in private ill sue your ass for assault harassment and anything else my lawyer can come up with i got up to leave one more thing i said for elizabeth gordon and her continued nonacquaintance with maibaum and locke what the name of the woman who burned to death modine adelaide modine and her brother william now please get the fuck out of my life willie brews auto shop looked run down and unreliable if not blatantly dishonest from the outside inside it wasnt a whole lot better but willie a pole whose name was unpronounceable and had been shortened to brew by generations of customers was just about the best mechanic i knew i had never liked this area of queens only a short distance north from the roars of the cars on the long island expressway ever since i was a boy i seemed to associate it with used car lots old warehouses and cemeteries willies garage close by kissena park had been a good source of information over the years since every deadbeat friend of willies with nothing better to do than listen in on other peoples business tended to congregate there at some time or another but the whole area still made me uneasy even as an adult i hated the drive from jfk to manhattan as it skirted these neighborhoods hated the sight of the rundown houses and liquor stores manhattan by comparison was exotic its skyline capable of seemingly endless change depending upon ones approach my father had moved out to westchester county as soon as he could afford to buying a small house near grant park manhattan was somewhere we went on weekends my friends and i sometimes we would traverse the entire length of the island to stand on the walkway over the brooklyn bridge and stare back at the evolving skyline beneath us the boards would vibrate with the passage of the traffic but to me it seemed like more than that it was the vibration and hum of life itself the cables linking the towers of the bridge would cut and dissect the cityscape before us as if it had been clipped by a childs scissors and reassembled against the blue sky after my fathers death my mother had moved us back to maine to her hometown of scarborough where tree lines replaced cityscapes and only the racing enthusiasts traveling from boston and new york to the races at scarborough downs brought with them the sights and smells of the big cities maybe that was why i always felt like a visitor when i looked at manhattan i always seemed to be seeing the city through new eyes willies place was situated in a neighborhood that was fighting gentrification tooth and nail willies block had been bought by the owner of the japanese noodle house next doorhe had other interests in downtown flushings little asia and seemed to want to extend his reach farther southand willie was involved in a partially legal battle to ensure that he wasnt shut down the japanese responded by sending fish smells through the vents into willies garage willie sometimes got his own back by getting arno his chief mechanic to drink some beers and eat a chinese meal then stumble outside stick his fingers down his throat and vomit outside the noodle house chinese vietnamese japaneseall that shit looks the same when it comes out willie used to say inside arno small wiry and darkwas working on the engine of a beatup dodge the air was thick with the smell of fish and noodles my mustang was raised up on a platform unrecognizable bits and pieces of its internal workings strewn around on the floor it looked no more likely to be on the road again in the near future than james dean id called earlier to tell willie id be dropping by the least he could have done was pretend to be doing something with it when i arrived the sound of loud swearing came from inside willies office which was up a set of wooden stairs to the right of the garage floor the door flew open and willie rumbled down the steps grease on his bald head and his blue mechanics overalls open to the waist to show a dirty white tshirt straining over his huge belly he climbed arduously up a set of boxes placed beneath the vent in a step pattern and put his mouth to the grille you slanteyed sons of bitches he shrieked quit stinkin my garage out with fish or im gonna get nuclear on your ass there was the sound of something shouted in japanese from the other end of the vent and then a burst of oriental laughter willie thumped the grille with the heel of his hand and climbed down he squinted at me in the semidarkness before recognizing me bird how you doin you want a coffee i want a car my car the car youve had for over a week now willie looked crestfallen youre angry with me he said in mocksoothing tones i understand your anger anger is good your car on the other hand is not good your car is bad the engines shot to shit what have you been running it on nuts and old nails willie i need my car the taxi drivers are treating me like an old friend some of them have even stopped trying to rip me off ive considered hiring a rental car to save myself embarrassment in fact the only reason i havent hit you for a car is that you said the repairs would take a day or two at most willie slouched over to the car and nudged a cylindrical piece of metal with the toe of his boot arno whats the deal on birds mustang its shit said arno tell him well give him five hundred dollars to scrap it arno says to give you five hundred to scrap it i heard him tell arno ill burn his house down if he doesnt fix my car day after tomorrow came a voice from under the hood sorry for the delay willie clapped me on the shoulder with a greasy hand come up for a coffee listen to the local gossip then quietly angel wants to see you i told him youd be around i nodded and followed him up the stairs inside the office which was surprisingly neat four men sat around a desk drinking coffee and whiskey from tin mugs i nodded to tommy q who id busted once for handling pirated videocassettes and a thickly mustached hotwire guy known unsurprisingly as groucho beside him sat willies other assistant jay who at sixtyfive was ten years older than willie but looked at least ten years older than that again beside him sat coffin ed harris you know coffin ed said willie i nodded still boosting dead guys ed naw man said coffin ed i gave all that up a long time ago i got a bad back coffin ed harris had been the kidnapper to beat all kidnappers coffin ed figured that live hostages were too much like real work since there was no telling what they might do or who might come looking for them the dead were easier to handle so coffin ed took to robbing mortuaries he would watch the death notices pick a decedent who came from a reasonably wealthy family and then steal the corpse from the mortuary or the funeral home until coffin ed came along and bucked the system funeral homes werent usually well guarded coffin ed would store the corpses in an industrial freezer he kept in his basement and then ask for a ransom usually nothing too heavy most of the relatives were quite happy to pay in order to get their loved ones back before they started to rot he did well until some old polish aristocrat took offense at his wifes remains being held for ransom and hired a private army to go looking for coffin ed they found him although coffin ed just about got away through a bolthole in his cellar that led to his neighbors yard he got the last laugh too the power company had cut off eds electricity three days before because he hadnt been paying his bills the old poles wife stank like a dead possum by the time they found her since then things had gone downhill for coffin ed and he now presented a downattheheel figure in the back of willie brews garage there was an uneasy silence for a moment which was broken by willie you remember vinnie no nose said willie handing me a steaming cup of black coffee which was already turning the tin mug red hot but still couldnt hide the smell of gasoline from its interior waitll you hear tommy qs story you aint missed nothing yet vinnie no nose was a b ampe guy out of newark who had taken one fall too many and had decided to reform or at least to reform as far as any guy can who has made a living for forty years by ripping off other peoples apartments he got his nickname from a long unsuccessful involvement with amateur boxing vinnie small and a potential victim for any new jersey lowlife with a penchant for inflicting violence saw an ability to use his fists as his potential salvation like lots of other short guys from rough neighborhoods sadly vinnies defense was about as good as the son of sams and his nose was eventually reduced to a mush of cartilage with two semiclosed nostrils like raisins in a pudding tommy q proceeded to tell a story involving vinnie a decorating company and a dead gay client that could have put him in court if hed told it in a respectable place of employment so the fruit ends up dead in a bathroom with this chair up his ass and vinnie ends up back in jail for peddling the pics and stealing the dead guys video he concluded shaking his head at the strange ways of nonheterosexual males he was still laughing his ass off at the story when the smile died on his face and the laugh turned into a kind of choking sound in his throat i looked behind me to see angel in the shadows curly black hair spilling out from under his blue watch cap and with a sparse growth of beard that would have made a thirteenyearold laugh a dark blue longshoremans jacket hung open over a black tshirt and his blue jeans ended in dirty wellworn timberlands angel was no more than fivesix and to the casual onlooker it was difficult to see why he should have struck fear into tommy q there were two reasons the first was that angel was a far better boxer than vinnie no nose and could have pummeled tommy q to horse meat if he wanted to which might well have been the case since angel was gay and might have found the source of tommys humor less than amusing the second and probably more compelling reason for tommy qs fear was that angels boyfriend was a man known only as louis like angel louis had no visible means of support although it was widely known that angel now semiretired at the age of forty was one of the best thieves in the business capable of stealing the fluff from the presidents navel if the money was good enough less widely known was the fact that louis tall black and sophisticated in his dress sense was a hit man almost without equal a killer who had been reformed somewhat by his relationship with angel and who now chose his rare targets with what might be termed a social conscience rumor had it that the killing of a german computer expert named gunther bloch in chicago the previous year had been the work of louis bloch was a serial rapist and torturer who preyed on young sometimes very young women in the sex resorts of southeast asia where much of his business was transacted money usually covered all ills money paid to pimps to parents to police to politicians unfortunately for bloch someone in the upper reaches of the government in one of his nations of choice couldnt be bought especially after bloch strangled an elevenyearold girl and dumped her body in a trash bin bloch fled the country money was redirected to a special project and louis drowned gunther bloch in the bathroom of a thousanddollaranight hotel suite in chicago or like i said so rumor had it whatever the truth of the matter louis was regarded as very bad news and tommy q wanted in future to be able to take a bath however rarely without fear of drowning nice story tommy said angel its just a story angel i didnt mean nothing by it no offense meant none taken said angel at least not by me behind him there was a movement in the darkness and louis appeared his bald head gleamed in the dim light his muscular neck emerging from a black silk shirt within an immaculately cut gray suit he towered over angel by more than a foot and as he did so he eyed tommy q intently for a moment fruit he said thats a quaint term mr q to what does it refer exactly the blood had drained from tommy qs face and it seemed to take him a very long time to find enough saliva to enable him to gulp when he did eventually manage it sounded like he was swallowing a golf ball he opened his mouth but nothing came out so he closed it again and looked at the floor in the vain hope that it would open up and swallow him its okay mr q it was a good story said louis in a voice as silky as his shirt just be careful how you tell it then he smiled a bright smile at tommy q the sort of smile a cat might give a mouse to take to the grave with it a drop of sweat ran down tommy qs nose hung from the tip for a moment and then exploded on the floor by then louis had gone dont forget my car willie i said then followed angel from the garage we walked a block or two to a latenight bar and diner angel knew louis strolled a few yards ahead of us the late evening crowds parting before him like the red sea before moses once or twice women glanced at him with interest the men mostly kept their eyes on the ground or found something suddenly interesting in the boardedup storefronts or the night sky from inside the bar came the sound of a vaguely folky singer performing openguitar surgery on neil youngs only love can break your heart it didnt sound like the song was going to pull through he plays like he hates neil young said angel as we entered ahead of us louis shrugged neil young heard that shit hed probably hate himself we took a booth the owner a fat dyspeptic man named ernest shambled over to take our order usually the waitresses in ernests took the orders but angel and louis commanded a degree of respect even here hey ernest said angel hows business if i was an undertaker peopled stop dying replied ernest and before you ask my old ladys still ugly it was a longestablished exchange shit you been married forty years said angel she aint gonna get no better lookin now angel and louis ordered club sandwiches and ernest wandered away i was a kid and looked like him id cut my dick off and make money singin castrato cause it aint gonna be no use no other way remarked angel bein ugly aint done you no harm said louis i dont know angel grinned i was better looking i coulda screwed a white guy they stopped bickering and we waited for the singer to put neil young out of his misery it was strange meeting these two now that i was no longer a cop when we had encountered one another beforein willies garage or over coffee or in central park if angel had some useful information to impart or if he simply wanted to meet to talk to ask after susan and jenniferthere had been an awkwardness a tension between us especially if louis was nearby i knew what they had done what louis i believed still did silent partnerships in assorted restaurants dealerships and willie brews garage notwithstanding on this occasion that tension was no longer present instead i felt for the first time the strength of the bond of friendship that had somehow grown between angel and me more than that from both of them i felt a sense of concern of regret of humanity of trust they would not be here i knew if they felt otherwise but maybe there was something more something i had only begun to perceive i was a cops nightmare cops their families their wives and children are untouchables you have to be crazy to go after a cop crazier still to take out his loved ones these are the assumptions we live by the belief that after a day spent looking at the dead questioning thieves and rapists pushers and pimps we can return to our own lives knowing that our families are somehow apart from all this and that through them we can remain apart from it too but that belief system had been shaken by the deaths of jennifer and susan someone wasnt respecting the rules and when no easy answer was forthcoming when no perp with a grudge could conveniently be apprehended enabling all that had taken place to be explained away another reason had to be found i had somehow drawn it on myself and on those closest to me i was a good cop who was well on the way to becoming a drunk i was falling apart and that made me weak and someone had exploited that weakness other cops looked at me and they saw not a fellow officer in need but a source of infection of corruption no one was sorry to see me go maybe not even walter and yet what had taken place had somehow brought me closer to both angel and louis they had no illusions about the world in which they lived no philosophical constructions that allowed them to be at once a part of and apart from that world louis was a killer he couldnt afford delusions of that kind because of the closeness of the bond that existed between them angel couldnt afford those delusions either now they had also been taken away from me like scales falling from my eyes leaving me to reestablish myself to find a new place in the world angel picked up an abandoned paper from the booth next door and glanced at the headline you see this i looked and nodded a guy had tried to pull some heroic stunt during a bank raid in flushing earlier in the day and ended up with both barrels of a sawedoff emptied into him the papers and news bulletins were full of it heres some guys out doin a job began angel they dont want to hurt nobody they just want to go in take the moneywhich is insured anyway so what does the bank careand get out again they only got the guns cause no ones gonna take them seriously otherwise what else they gonna use harsh words but theres always gotta be some asshole who thinks hes immortal cause hes not dead yet this guy hes young keeps himself in good condition thinks hes gonna get more pussy than long dong silver if he busts up the bank raid and saves the day look at him realtor twentynine single pulling down onefifty a year and he gets a hole blown in him biggern the holland tunnel lance petersen he shook his head in wonderment i never met anyone called lance in my whole life thats cause they all dead said louis glancing seemingly idly around the room fuckers keep standing up in banks and getting shot guy was probably the last lance left alive the clubs arrived and angel started eating he was the only one who did so how you doin okay i said why the ambush you dont write you dont call he smiled wryly louis glanced at me with mild interest and then returned his attention to the door the other tables the doors to the restrooms you been doin some work for benny low i hear what you doin working for that fat piece of shit passing time you want to pass time stick pins in your eyes bennys just using up good air come on angel get to it youre rattling away and louis here is acting like he expects the dillinger gang to walk in and spray the counter angel put down his halfeaten section of club and dabbed almost daintily at his mouth with a napkin i hear youve been asking after some girlfriend of stephen bartons some people are very curious to know why that might be such as such as bobby sciorra i hear i didnt know if bobby sciorra was psychotic or not but he was a man who liked killing and had found a willing employer in old man ferrera emo ellison could testify to the likely result of bobby sciorra taking an interest in ones activities i had a suspicion that ollie watts in his final moments had found that out as well benny low was talking about some kind of trouble between the old man and sonny i said fuckin goombas fighting among themselves was how he put it benny always was a diplomat said angel only surprise is the un didnt pick up on him before now theres something weird going on there sonnys gone to ground and taken pili with him no ones seen them no one knows where they are but bobby sciorras looking real hard for all of them he took another huge bite of his sandwich what about barton i figure hes gone underground too but i dont know hes minor league and wouldnt have much to do professionally with sonny or the old man beyond some muling though he may once have been close to sonny may be nothing to it barton may not be connected maybe not but youve got bigger problems than finding barton or his girl i waited theres a hit out on you who its not local its out of town louis dont know who is it over the fat ollie thing i dont know even sonny isnt such a moron that hed put a contract out over some hired gun who got himself wasted cause you stepped in the kid didnt mean anything to anyone and fat ollies dead all i know is youre irritating two generations of the ferrera family and that cant be good walter coles favor was turning into something more complicated than a missing persons case if it was ever that simple ive got one for you i said know anyone with a gun that can punch holes through masonry with a fivepointsevenmillimeter bullet weighing less than fifty grains submachine rounds you gotta be fuckin kidding last time i saw something like that it was hangin on top of a tank turret well thats what killed the shooter i saw him blown away and there was a hole knocked through the wall behind me the guns belgian made designed for antiterrorist police someone local picked up a piece of hardware like that and took it to the range its gotta get around ill ask said angel any guesses my guess would be bobby sciorra mine too so why would he be cleaning up after sonnys mess the old man told him to angel nodded watch your back bird he finished his sandwich and then stood to go cmon we can give you a ride no i want to walk for a while angel shrugged you packing i nodded he said hed be in touch i left them at the door as i walked i was conscious of the weight of the gun beneath my arm of every face i passed in the crowd and of the dark pulse of the city throbbing beneath my feet bobby sciorra a malevolent demon a vision of ferocity and sadism that had appeared before the old man stefano ferrera when he was on the verge of insanity and death sciorra seemed to have been conjured up from some bleak corner of hell by the old mans anger and grief a physical manifestation of the torture and destruction he wished to inflict on the world around him in bobby sciorra he found the perfect instrument of pain and ugly death stefano had watched his own father build a small empire from the familys modest house in bensonhurst in those days bensonhurst bordered by gravesend bay and the atlantic ocean still had a smalltown feel the scent of deli food mingled with that of woodburning ovens from the local pizza parlors people lived in twofamily houses with wrought iron gates and when the sun shone they would sit out on their porches and watch their kids play in their tiny gardens stefanos ambition would take him beyond his roots when his time came to take over the operation he built a big house on staten island when he stood at his rearfacing windows he could see the edge of paul castellanos mansion on todt hill the million white house and probably from his topmost window the grounds of the barton estate if staten island was good enough for the head of the gambino family and a benevolent millionaire then it was good enough for stefano when castellano died after being shot six times at sparks steak house in manhattan stefano was briefly the biggest boss on staten island stefano married a woman from bensonhurst named louisa she hadnt married him out of any kind of love familiar from romantic novels she loved him for his power his violence and mainly his money those who marry for money usually end up earning it louisa did she was emotionally brutalized and died shortly after giving birth to her third son stefano didnt remarry there was no grief there he just didnt need the bother of another wife especially after the first had produced his heirs the first child vincent was intelligent and represented the best hope for the familys future when he died in a swimming pool from a massive brain hemorrhage at twentythree his father didnt speak for a week instead he shot vincents pair of labradors and retired to his bedroom louisa had been dead for seventeen years niccolo or nicky two years younger than his brother took his place at his fathers right hand as a rookie i watched him roam the city in his huge bulletproofed cadillac surrounded by soldiers carving himself a reputation as a thug to match his father by the early s the family had overcome an initial distaste for the drug trade and was flooding the city with every kind of poison it could lay its hands on most people stayed out of the way and any potential rivals were warned off or ended up as fish chum the yardies were another matter the jamaican gangs had no respect for established institutions for the old ways of doing business they looked at the italians and saw dead meat a shipment of cocaine worth two million dollars was boosted from the ferreras and two soldiers were left dead nicky responded by ordering a cull of the yardies their clubs were hit their apartments even their women in a threeday period twelve of them died including most of those responsible for the cocaine theft maybe nicky imagined that would be the end of it and things would return to normal again he still cruised the streets in his car still ate in the same restaurants still acted as if the threat of violence from the jamaicans had dissipated in the face of this show of force his favorite haunt was da vincenzo an upscale momandpop operation in his fathers old bensonhurst neighborhood that was smart enough not to forget its roots maybe nicky also liked the echoes of his brother in the name but his paranoia led him to have the glass in the windows and doors replaced with some militarystrength panes the sort used by the president nicky could enjoy his fusilli in peace undisturbed by the imminent threat of assassination he had only just ordered one thursday evening in november when the black van pulled into the side street opposite its back facing toward the window nicky may have glanced at it as it stopped may have noticed that its windshield had been removed and replaced with a black wire grille may even have frowned as the rear doors sprang open and something white flared briefly in the darkness of its interior the back blast rattling the grille he may even have had time to register the rpg warhead as it powered toward the window at six hundred feet per second smoke trailing it from behind its roar penetrating the thick panes before they exploded inward glass and hot metal fragments and the slug from the missiles copper liner tearing nicky ferrera into so many pieces that his coffin weighed less than sixty pounds when it was carried up the aisle of the church three days later the three jamaicans responsible disappeared into the underworld and the old man vented his fury on his enemies and his friends in an orgy of abuse of violence and of death his business fell apart around him and his rivals closed in recognizing in his madness the opportunity to rid themselves of him once and for all just as his world seemed about to implode on itself a figure appeared at the gates of his mansion and asked to speak with the old man he told the guard he had some news about the yardies the guard passed on the message and after a search bobby sciorra was admitted the search was not a complete one sciorra held a black plastic bag which he refused to open guns were trained on him as he approached the house and he was told to halt on the lawn about fifty feet from the steps of the house where the old man stood in wait if youre wasting my time ill have you killed said the old man bobby sciorra just smiled and tipped the contents of the bag on the illuminated lawn the three heads rolled and bumped against one another the dreadlocks coiled like dead snakes with bobby sciorra smiling above them like some obscene perseus thick fresh blood hung languorously from the edges of the bag before dripping slowly onto the grass bobby sciorra made his bones that night within one year he was a made guy an ascent up the family ladder made doubly unique by its speed and the relative obscurity of sciorras background the feds had no file on him and ferrera appeared able to add little more i heard rumors that he had crossed the colombos once that he had operated out of florida for a while on a freelance basis but nothing more than that yet the killing of the linchpins of the jamaican posse was enough to earn him the trust of stefano ferrera and a ceremony in the basement of the staten island house that resulted in the pricking of sciorras trigger finger over a holy picture and his tiein to ferrera and his associates from that day on bobby sciorra was the power behind the ferrera throne he guided the old man and his family through the trials and tribulations of postrico new york when the fbis racketeer influenced corruption organization statutes allowed the feds to prosecute organizations and conspirators that benefited from crime instead of just the individuals who committed those crimes the major new york familiesgambino lucchese colombo genovese and bonannonumbering maybe four thousand made guys and associates all took big hits losing the heads of their families to jail or the reaper but not the ferreras bobby sciorra took care of that sacrificing some minor players along the way to ensure the survival of the family the old man might have preferred to take even more of a backseat in the family operation if it hadnt been for sonny poor dumb vicious sonny a man without the intelligence of either of his brothers but with at least their combined capacity for violence any operations he controlled degenerated into bloodshed but none of it bothered sonny corpulent and bloated even in his twenties he enjoyed the mayhem and the killing the death of the innocent in particular seemed to give him an almost sexual thrill gradually his father sidelined him and left him to his own devicessteroids smalltime drug deals prostitution and occasional violence bobby sciorra tried to keep him under some sort of control but sonny was beyond control or reason sonny was vicious and evil and when his father died a line of men would form to ensure sonny joined him as soon as possible i never expected to end up living in the east village susan jennifer and i had lived out in park slope in brooklyn on sundays we could stroll up to prospect park and watch the kids playing ball jennifer kicking at the grass with her sneakers before heading to raintrees for a soda the sound of the band in the band shell drifting in through the stainedglass windows on such days life seemed as long and welcoming as the green vista of long meadow we would walk jenny between us susan and i and exchange glances over her head as she burst forth with an endless stream of questions observations strange jokes that only a child could understand i would hold her hand in mine and through her i could reach out to susan and believe that things would work out for us that we could somehow bridge the gap that was growing between us if jenny ran ahead i would move close to susan and take her hand and she would smile at me as i told her that i loved her then she would look away or look at her feet or call jenny because we both knew that telling her i loved her was not enough when i decided to return to new york at the start of the summer after months of searching for some sign of their killer i informed my lawyer and asked him to recommend a realtor in new york there are about three hundred million square feet of office space and not enough places to put the people who work in them i couldnt say why i wanted to live in manhattan maybe it was just because it wasnt brooklyn instead of a realtor my lawyer produced a network of friends and business acquaintances that eventually led to me renting an apartment in a redbrick house in the east village with white shutters on the windows and a stoop that led up to a fanlighted front door it was a little closer to st marks place than i would have preferred but it was still a good deal since the days when w h auden and leon trotsky had roomed there st marks had become the east village with a vengeance full of bars cafés and overpriced boutiques the apartment was unfurnished and i pretty much left it that way adding only a bed a desk some easy chairs and a stereo and small tv i removed books tapes cds and vinyl from storage along with one or two personal belongings and set up a living space to which i had only the minimum attachment it was dark outside as i lined the guns before me on the desk stripped them down and cleaned each one carefully if the ferreras were coming after me i wanted to be prepared in all my time on the force i had been forced to draw my weapon to protect myself on only a handful of occasions i had never killed a man while on duty and had only once fired at another human being when i shot a pimp in the stomach as he came at me with a longbladed knife as a detective i had spent most of my time in robbery and homicide unlike vice which was a world in which the threat of violence and death to a cop was a real possibility homicide involved a different type of police work as tommy morrison my first partner used to say anybody whos going to die in a homicide investigation is already dead by the time the cops arrive i had abandoned my colt delta elite after the deaths of susan and jennifer now i had three guns in my possession the colt detective special had belonged to my father the only thing of his that i had retained the prancingpony badge on the left side of the rounded butt was worn and the frame was scratched and pitted but it remained a useful weapon light at about a pound in weight and easily concealed in an ankle holster or a belt it was a simple powerful revolver and i kept it in a holster taped beneath the frame of my bed i had never used the heckler amp koch vpm outside a range the millimeter semiautomatic had belonged to a pusher who had died after becoming hooked on his own product i had found him dead in his apartment after a neighbor had complained about the smell the vpm a semiplastic military pistol holding eighteen rounds lay still unused in its case but i had taken the precaution of filing away the serial number like the it had no safety the attraction of the gun lay in the accessory shoulder stock that the pusher had also acquired when fitted it made an internal adjustment to the firing mechanism that turned the weapon into a fullautomatic submachine gun that could fire twentytwo hundred rounds per minute if the chinese ever decided to invade i could hold them off for at least ten seconds with all the ammunition i had for it after that id have to start throwing furniture at them i had removed the h ampk from the compartment in the mustangs trunk where i usually stored it i didnt want anyone stumbling across it while the car was being serviced the thirdgeneration smith amp wesson was the only gun i carried a millimeter model specially developed for the fbi and acquired through the efforts of woolrich after cleaning it i loaded it carefully and placed it in my shoulder holster outside i could see the crowds making for the bars and restaurants of the east village i was just about to join them when the cell phone buzzed beside me and thirty minutes later i was preparing to view the body of stephen barton red lights flashed bathing everything in the parking lot with the warm glow of law and order a patch of darkness marked the nearby mccarren park and to the southwest traffic passed over the williamsburg bridge heading for the brooklynqueens expressway patrolmen lounged by cars keeping the curious and the ghoulish behind barriers one reached out to block my wayhey gotta keep backwhen we recognized each other tyler who remembered my father and would never make it beyond sergeant withdrew his hand its official jimmy im with cole he looked over his shoulder and walter who was talking with a patrolman glanced over and nodded the arm went up like a traffic barrier and i passed through even yards from the sewer i could smell the stench a frame had been erected around the area and a lab technician in boots was climbing out of the manhole can i go down i asked two men in neatly cut suits and london fog raincoats had joined cole who barely nodded the fbi letters werent visible on the backs of their coats so i assumed they were keeping a low profile uncanny i said as i passed they could almost be regular people walter scowled they joined in i slipped on a pair of gloves and climbed down the ladder into the sewer i gagged with my first breath the river of filth that ran beneath the treelined avenues of the city forcing a taste of bile into the back of my throat its easier if you take shallow breaths said a sewer worker who stood at the base of the ladder he was lying i didnt step from the ladder instead i pulled my maglite from my pocket and pointed it to where a small group of maintenance workers and cops stood around an arclit area their feet sloshing through stuff about which i didnt even want to think the cops gave me a brief glance then returned with bored looks to watching the med guys go about their business stephen barton lay about five yards from the base of the ladder in a tide of shit and waste his blond hair moving wildly with the current it was obvious that he had simply been dumped through the manhole at street level his body rolling slightly when it hit the bottom the me stood up and pulled the rubber gloves from his hands a plainclothes homicide detective one i didnt recognize directed a quizzical look at him he returned one of frustration and annoyance well need to look at him in the lab i cant tell shit from shit down here come on give us a fucking break the detective whined lamely the me hissed through his teeth in irritation strangled he said as he elbowed his way through the small group knocked unconscious first with a blow to the back of the head then strangled dont even ask for a time of death he could have been down here for a day or so probably no longer the bodys pretty flaccid then the sound of his feet echoed through the sewer as he began to clack up the ladder the detective shrugged ashes to ashes shit to shit he said then turned back toward the body i climbed up to street level the me behind me i didnt need to look at bartons body the blow to the head was unusual but not extraordinary it can take as long as ten minutes to kill a man by strangulation assuming he doesnt manage to break free in the process i had heard of wouldbe assassins losing handfuls of hair patches of skin and in one case an ear to a struggling victim far better where possible to tap him on the head first tap him hard enough and strangling him might not be necessary at all walter was still talking to the feds so i moved as far away from the sewer as i could get while still remaining within the police cordon and drew deep breaths of night air the smell of human waste underpinned everything clinging to my clothes with the grim resolution of death itself eventually the feds returned to their car and walter walked slowly toward me hands stuck in his trouser pockets theyre going to bring sonny ferrera in he said i snorted for what his lawyer will have him out before he even has time to take a leak thats assuming he was even involved or that they can find him this bunch couldnt find the ground if they fell over walter wasnt in the mood what do you know the kid was running shit for ferrera he fucks him over and ends up dead strangled whats more strangulation had become the mobs preferred method of dispatch in recent years quiet and no mess thats the feds line and anyway theyd bring sonny ferrera in on suspicion of ignoring a nosmoking sign if they thought it would stick cmon walter this isnt a ferrera job dumping a guy in a sewer isnt but he was already walking away a raised right hand indicating that he didnt want to hear any more i followed him what about the girl walter maybe she fits in somewhere he turned back to me and put a hand on my shoulder when i called you i didnt think you were going to come running in like dick tracy he glanced back at the feds any sign of her i think she blew town thats all im saying for the present the me thinks barton could have been killed early tuesday if the girl left town after that it could tie her in are you going to mention her to the feds walter shook his head let them go chasing after sonny ferrera you stay on the girl yassuh i said ima keep lookin i hailed a cab conscious that the feds were looking at me even as i got in and we drove away into the night it was common knowledge that the old man was having trouble keeping his only surviving son under control ferrera had watched the cosa nostra tear itself apart back in italy as it tried with increasing brutality to intimidate and destroy the states investigators instead its methods had served to reinforce the determination of the braver ones to continue the fight the families were now like one of their own victims bound in the incaprettamento the method of execution known as the goat strangling like a victim bound with ropes to his arms legs and neck the more the families struggled the more the rope around them grew tighter the old man was determined that this should not happen to his own organization by contrast sonny saw in the violence of the sicilians a method of tyranny that suited his own aspirations for power maybe that was the difference between father and son wherever possible old ferrera had used the white lupara when an assassination was necessary the complete disappearance of the victim without even a trace of blood to give away the truth of what had taken place the strangling of barton was certainly a mafia hallmark but the dumping was not if the old man had been responsible for his death then his final resting place would probably have been the sewers but not before he had been dissolved in acid and poured down a drain so i didnt believe the old man had ordered the killing of isobel bartons stepson his death and the sudden disappearance of catherine demeter had come too close together to be mere coincidence it was possible of course that sonny had ordered them both to be killed for some reason for if he was as crazy as he seemed to be then another corpse would be unlikely to trouble him on the other hand it was also possible that demeter had killed her own boyfriend and then fled perhaps he hit her once too often in which case mrs barton was now paying me to find someone who was not only a friend but potentially her sons killer the ferrera house was set in treeshrouded grounds entry was by a single iron gate electronically operated an intercom was set into the pillar on the lefthand side i buzzed gave my name and told the voice i wanted to see the old man from the top of the pillar a remote camera was focused on the cab and although no one was visible in the grounds i guessed three to five guns were in my immediate vicinity some one hundred yards from the house sat a dark dodge sedan with two males sitting in the front seat i could expect a visit from the feds as soon as i got back to my apartment possibly sooner walk through wait inside the gate said the voice from the intercom youll be escorted to the house i did as i was told and the cab pulled away a grayhaired man in a dark suit and standardissue shades appeared from behind the trees a heckler amp koch mp held at port arms behind him was another younger man similarly dressed to my right i could see two more guards also armed lean against the wall said the grayhaired man he frisked me professionally while the others watched removing the clip from my own smith amp wesson along with the spare clip on my belt he pulled back the slide to eject the round in the chamber and handed the gun back to me then he motioned me toward the house walking to my right and slightly behind me so that he could keep an eye on my hands one man shadowed us at either side of the road it was hardly surprising that old man ferrera had lived so long the house was surprisingly modest from the outside a long twostory dwelling with narrow windows at the front and a gallery running along the upper level more men patrolled the meticulously kept garden and the graveled driveway a black mercedes stood at the right of the house its driver waiting nearby if needed the door was already open as we approached and bobby sciorra stood in the hallway his right hand clasping his left wrist like a priest waiting for the offerings sciorra was six feet five inches tall and probably weighed less than onesixty his long thin limbs like blades beneath his gray singlebreasted suit his striated neck almost feminine in its length its pallor enhanced by the pristine whiteness of the collarless shirt buttoned beneath it short dark hair surrounded a bald pate which ended in a cone so sharp as to appear pointed sciorra was a knife made flesh a human instrument of pain both surgeon and scalpel the fbi believed that he had personally committed more than thirty killings most of those who knew bobby sciorra believed the fbi was conservative in its estimate he smiled as i approached revealing perfectly white teeth glistening behind narrow slash lips but the smile never reached his blue eyes instead it disappeared in the jagged scar that ran from his left ear across the bridge of his nose and ended just below the right earlobe the scar devoured his smile like a second mouth you got some balls coming here he said still smiling his head shaking gently from side to side as he said it that an admission of guilt bobby i asked the smile never faltered why do you want to see the boss hes got no time for shit like you the smile broadened perceptibly by the way how are your wife and kid kid must bewhatfour by now a dull red throbbing began to pulse in my head but i held it back my hands tightening at my sides i knew id be dead before my hands closed on sciorras white skin stephen barton turned up dead in a sewer this evening the feds are looking for sonny and probably for you as well im concerned for your welfare i wouldnt want anything bad to happen to either of you that i wasnt a part of sciorras smile remained the same he seemed about to answer when a voice low but authoritative sounded over the house intercom system age gave it a gravelly resonance from which the rattle of death was not absent lurking in the background like the traces of don ferreras sicilian roots let him in bobby it said sciorra stepped back and opened a set of draftexcluding double doors halfway down the hall the grayhaired guard walked behind me as i followed sciorra who waited until he had closed the draft doors before opening a second door at the end of the hall don ferrera sat in an old leather armchair behind a big office desk not entirely dissimilar from walter coles desk although its gilt inlay raised it into a different league from walters comparatively spartan possession the curtains were drawn and wall lights and table lamps gave a dim yellow glow to the pictures and bookshelves that lined the walls i guessed from their age that the books were probably worth a lot and had never been read red leather chairs stood against the walls complementing don ferreras own chair and some sofas that surrounded a long low table at the far end of the room even sitting down and stooped by age the old man was an impressive figure his hair was silver and greased back from his temples but an unhealthy pallor seemed to underlie his tanned complexion and his eyes appeared rheumy sciorra closed the door and once more assumed his priestlike stance my escort remaining outside please sit said the old man motioning toward an armchair he opened an inlaid box of turkish cigarettes each ringed with small gold bands i thanked him but refused he sighed pity i like the scent but they are forbidden me no cigarettes no women no alcohol he closed the box and looked longingly at it for a moment then clasped his hands and rested them on the desk before him you have no title now he said among men of honor to be called mister when you had a title was a calculated insult federal investigators sometimes used it to belittle mob suspects dispensing with the more formal don or tio i understand no insult is intended don ferrera i said he nodded and was silent as a detective i had some dealings with the men of honor and always approached them cautiously and without arrogance or presumption respect had to be met with respect and silences had to be read like signs among them everything had meaning and they were as economical and efficient in their modes of communication as they were with their methods of violence men of honor spoke only of what concerned them directly answered only specific questions and would stay silent rather than tell a lie a man of honor had an absolute obligation to tell the truth and only when the behavior of others altered so far as to make it necessary to break these rules of behavior would he do so all of which assumed that you believed pimps and killers and drug dealers were honorable in the first place or that the code was anything more than the incongruous trapping of another age pressed into service to provide a sheen of aristocracy for thugs and murderers i waited for him to break the silence he stood and moved slowly almost painfully around the room and stopped at a small side table on which a gold plate gleamed dully you know al capone used to eat off gold plates did you know that he asked i told him that i hadnt known his men used to carry them in a violin case to the restaurant and lay them on the table for capone and his guests and then theyd all eat off them why do you think a man would feel the need to eat from a gold plate he waited for an answer trying to catch my reflection in the plate when you have a lot of money your tastes can become peculiar eccentric i said after a while even your food doesnt taste right unless its served on bone china or gold its not fitting for someone with so much money and power to eat from the same plates as the little people it goes too far i think he replied but he no longer seemed to be talking to me and it was his own reflection he was examining in the plate theres something wrong with it there are some tastes that should not be indulged because they are vulgar they are obscene they offend nature i take it that isnt one of capones plates no my son gave it to me as a gift on my last birthday i told him the story and he had the plate made maybe he missed the point of the story i said the old mans face looked weary it was the face of a man who had not enjoyed his sleep for some time the boy who was killed you think my son was involved you think this was a piece of work he asked eventually moving back into my direct line of vision and staring away from me at something in the distance i didnt look to see what it was i dont know the fbi appears to think so he smiled an empty cruel smile that reminded me briefly of bobby sciorra and your interest in this is the girl no i was surprised although i should not have been bartons past would have been common knowledge to sciorra at least and would have been passed on quickly when his body was discovered i thought my visit to pete hayes might have played a part too i wondered how much he knew and his next question gave me the answer not much who are you working for i cant say we can find out we found out enough from the old man at the gym so that was it i shrugged gently he was silent again for a while do you think my son had the girl killed did he i responded don ferrera turned back toward me the rheumy eyes narrowing there is a story told about a man who believes he is being cuckolded by his wife he approaches a friend an old trusted friend and says i believe my wife is cheating on me but i dont know with whom i have watched her closely but i cannot find out the identity of this man what do i do now his friend is the man who is cheating with his wife but to divert the others attention he says that he saw the wife with another man a man with a reputation for dishonorable conduct with other mens wives and so the cuckold turns his gaze on this man and his wife continues to cheat on him with his best friend he finished and gazed intently at me everything has to be interpreted everything is codified to live with signs is to understand the necessity of finding meanings in seemingly irrelevant pieces of information the old man had spent most of his life looking for the meanings in things and expected others to do likewise in his cynical little anecdote lay his belief that his son was not responsible for bartons death but that whoever was responsible stood to benefit from the concentration of the police and fbi on sonnys assumed guilt i glanced at bobby sciorra and wondered how much don ferrera really knew about what went on behind those eyes sciorra was capable of anything even of undermining his boss for his own gains i hear maybe sonny has taken a sudden interest in my good health i said the old man smiled what kind of interest in your health mr parker the kind of interest that could result in my health suddenly ceasing to be good i dont know anything about that sonny is his own man that may be but if anyone pulls anything on me ill see sonny in hell ill have bobby look into it he said that didnt make me feel a whole lot better i stood up to leave a clever man would be looking for the girl said the old man also standing up and moving toward a door in a corner of the room behind the desk alive or dead the girl is the key maybe he was right but the old man must have had his own reasons for pointing me toward her and as bobby sciorra escorted me to the front door i wondered if i was the only person looking for catherine demeter there was a cab waiting at the gates of the ferrera house to take me back to the east village as it turned out i had enough time to shower and make a pot of coffee at my apartment before the fbi came knocking on my door i had changed into tracksuit bottoms and a sweatshirt so i felt a little casual next to special agents ross and hernandez the blue nile was playing in the background a walk across the rooftops causing hernandez to wrinkle his nose in distaste i didnt feel the need to apologize ross did most of the talking while hernandez ostentatiously examined the contents of my bookshelf looking at covers and reading the dust jackets he hadnt asked if he could and i didnt like it there are some picture ones on the lower shelf i said no crayolas though i hope you brought your own hernandez scowled at me he was in his late twenties and probably still believed everything he had been taught about the agency in quantico he reminded me of the tour guides in the hoover building the ones who herd the minnesota housewives around while dreaming of gunning down drug dealers and international terrorists hernandez probably still refused to believe that hoover had worn a dress ross was a different matter he had been involved with the feds truck hijack squad in new york in the seventies and his name had been linked to a number of highprofile rico cases since then i believed he was probably a good agent but a lousy human being i had already decided what i was going to tell him nothing why were you at the ferrera house this evening he began after declining an offer of coffee like a monkey refusing a nut ive got a paper route ross didnt even grin hernandezs scowl deepened if id had a nervous disposition the strain might have proved too much for me dont be an asshole said ross i could arrest you on suspicion of involvement with organized crime hold you for a while let you go but what good would that do either of us ill ask you again why were you at the ferrera house this evening im conducting an investigation ferrera might have been connected to it what are you investigating thats confidential who hired you confidential i was tempted to put on a singsong voice but i didnt think ross was in the right frame of mind maybe he was right maybe i was an asshole but i was no nearer to finding catherine demeter than i had been twentyfour hours ago and her boyfriends death had opened up a range of possibilities none of which was particularly appealing if ross was out to nail sonny ferrera or his father then that was his problem i had enough of my own what did you tell ferrera about bartons death nothing he didnt know already seeing as how hansen was at the scene before you were i replied hansen was a reporter with the post a good one there were flies that envied hansens ability to sniff out a corpse but if someone had time to tip hansen off it was pretty certain that someone had informed ferrera even earlier walter was right parts of the police department leaked like a poor mans shoes look i said i dont know any more than you do i dont think sonny was involved or the old man as for anyone else rosss eyes flicked upward in frustration after a pause he asked if id met bobby sciorra i told him id had that pleasure ross stood and picked at some microscopic speck on his tie it looked like the sort you picked up in filenes basement after the good stuff has gone sciorras been mouthing off about teaching you a lesson i hear he thinks youre an interfering prick hes probably right i hope youll do everything in your power to protect me ross smiled a minute hitching of the lips that revealed small pointed canines he looked like a rat reacting to a stick poked in its face rest assured well do everything in our power to find the culprit when something happens to you hernandez smiled too as they headed for the door like father like son i smiled back you can let yourselves out and hernandez he stopped and turned im gonna count those books ross was right to be concentrating his energies on sonny he may have been strictly minor league in many waysa few porn parlors near port authority a social club on mott with a handwritten notice taped above the phone reminding members that it was bugged assorted petty drug deals shylocking and running whores hardly made him public enemy number onebut sonny was also the weak link in the ferrera chain if he could be broken then it might lead to sciorra and to the old man himself i watched the two fbi men from my window as they climbed into their car ross paused at the passenger side and stared up at the window for a time it didnt crack under the pressure neither did i but i had a feeling that agent ross wasnt really trying not yet it was after ten the next morning when i arrived at the barton house an unidentified flunky answered the door and showed me into the same office in which i had met isobel barton the day before with the same desk and the same ms christie wearing what looked like the same gray suit and the same unwelcoming look on her face she didnt offer me a seat so i stood with my hands in my pockets to stop my fingers getting numb in the chilly atmosphere she busied herself with some papers on the desk not sparing me a second look i stood by the fireplace and admired a blue china dog that stood at the far end of the mantelpiece it was part of what had probably once been a pair since there was an empty space on the opposite side he looked lonely without a friend i thought these things usually came in pairs ms christie glanced up her face crumpled in annoyance like an image on old newspaper the dog i repeated i thought china dogs like that came in matching pairs i wasnt particularly concerned about the dog but i was tired of ms christie ignoring me and i derived some petty pleasure from irritating her it was once part of a pair she replied after a moment the other wasdamaged some time ago that must have been upsetting i said trying to look like i meant it while simultaneously failing to do so it was it had sentimental value for you or mrs barton for both of us ms christie realized she had been forced to acknowledge my presence despite her best efforts so she carefully put the cap on her pen clasped her hands together and assumed a businesslike expression how is mrs barton i asked what might have been concern moved swiftly across ms christies features and then disappeared like a gull gliding over a cliff face she has been under sedation since last night as you can imagine she took the news badly i didnt think she and her stepson were that close ms christie tossed me a look of contempt i probably deserved it mrs barton loved stephen as if he were her own son dont forget that you are merely an employee mr parker you do not have the right to impugn the reputation of the living or the dead she shook her head at my insensitivity why are you here theres a great deal to be done before she stopped and for a moment looked lost i waited for her to resume before stephens funeral she finished and i realized that there might be more to her apparent distress at the events of last night than simple concern for her employer for a guy who had all the higher moral qualities of a hammerhead shark stephen barton had certainly attracted his share of admirers i have to go to virginia i said it may take more than the advance i was given i wanted to let mrs barton know before i left is this to do with the killing i dont know it was becoming a familiar refrain there may be a connection between catherine demeters disappearance and mr bartons death but we wont know unless the police find something or the girl turns up well i cant authorize that kind of spending at the present time began ms christie youll have to wait until after i interrupted her frankly i was getting tired of ms christie i was used to people not liking me but most at least had the decency to get to know me first however briefly im not asking you to authorize it and after my meeting with mrs barton i dont think you have anything to do with it but as a common courtesy i thought id offer my sympathies and tell her how far ive got and how far have you got mr parker she hissed she was standing now her knuckles white against the desk in her eyes something vicious and poisonous raised its head and flashed its fangs i think the girl may have left the city i think she went home or back to what used to be home but i dont know why if shes there ill find her make sure shes okay and contact mrs barton and if she isnt i let the question hang without a reply there was no answer for if catherine demeter wasnt in haven then she might as well have dropped off the face of the earth until she did something that made her traceable like using a credit card or making a telephone call to her worried friend i felt tired and frayed at the edges the case seemed to be fragmenting the pieces spinning away from me and glittering in the distance there were too many elements involved to be merely coincidental and yet i was too experienced to try to force them all together into a picture that might be untrue to reality an imposition of order upon the chaos of murder and killing still it seemed to me that catherine demeter was one of those pieces and that she had to be found so that her place in the order of things could be determined im leaving this afternoon ill call if i find anything ms christies eyes had lost their shine and the bitter thing that lived within her had curled back on itself to sleep for a while i was not even sure that she heard me i left her like that her knuckles still resting on the desk her eyes vacant seemingly staring somewhere within herself her face slick and pale as if troubled by what she saw as it turned out i was delayed by further problems with my car and it was pm before i drove the mustang back to my apartment to pack my bag a welcome breeze blew as i walked up the steps fumbling for my keys it sent candy wrappers cartwheeling across the street and set soft drink cans tolling like bells a discarded newspaper skimmed the sidewalk with a sound like the whisperings of a dead lover i walked the four flights of stairs to my door entered the apartment and turned on a lamp i prepared a pot of coffee and packed as it percolated about thirty minutes later i was finishing my coffee my overnight bag at my feet when the cell phone rang hello mr parker said a mans voice the voice was neutral almost artificial and i could hear small clicks between the words as if they had been reassembled from a completely different conversation who is this oh weve never met but we had some mutual acquaintances your wife and daughter you might say i was with them in their final moments the voice alternated between sets of words now high then low first male then female at one point there seemed to be three voices speaking simultaneously then they became a single male voice once again the apartment seemed to drop in temperature and then fall away from me there was only the phone the tiny perforations of the mouthpiece and the silence at the other end of the line ive had freak calls before i said with more confidence than i felt youre just another lonely man looking for a house to haunt i cut their faces off i broke your wifes nose by slamming her against the wall by the kitchen door dont doubt me i am the one youve been looking for the last words were all spoken by a childs voice highpitched and joyous i felt a stabbing pain behind my eyes and my blood sounded loudly in my ears like waves crashing against a headland bleak and gray there was no saliva in my mouth just a dry dusty sensation when i swallowed the feeling was that of dirt traveling down my throat it was painful and i struggled to find my voice mr parker are you okay the words were calm solicitous almost tender but spoken by what sounded like four different voices ill find you he laughed the synthesized nature of the sound was more obvious now it seemed to break up into tiny units just as a tv screen does when you get too close and the picture becomes merely a series of small dots but ive found you he said you wanted me to find you just as you wanted me to find them and to do what i did you brought me into your life for you i flamed into being i had been waiting so long for your call you wanted them to die didnt you hate your wife in the hours before i took her and dont you sometimes in the deep dark of the night have to fight back your sense of guilt at the feeling of freedom it gave you knowing she was dead i freed you the least you could do is show some gratitude youre a sick man but that isnt going to save you i checked caller id on the phone and froze it was a number i recognized it was the number of the public phone at the corner of the street i moved toward the door and began making my way down the stairs no not man in her final moments your wife knew that your susan mouth to mouths kiss as i drew the life from her oh i lusted for her in those last bright red minutes but then that has always been a weakness of our kind our sin was not pride but lust for humanity and i chose her mr parker and i loved her in my way the voice was now deep and male it boomed in my ear like the voice of a god or a devil fuck you i said the bile rising in my throat as i felt sweat bead my brow and run in rivulets down my face a sick fearful sweat that defied the fury in my voice i had come down three flights of stairs there was one flight left to go dont go yet the voice became that of a female child like my child my jennifer and in that moment i had some inkling of the nature of this traveling man well talk again soon by then maybe my purpose will be clearer to you take what i give you as a gift i hope it will ease your suffering it should be coming to you rightabout now i heard the buzzer sound in my apartment upstairs i dropped the phone to the floor and drew the smith amp wesson from my holster i took the remaining steps two at a time racing down the stairs with adrenaline pumping through my system my neighbor mrs damato startled by the noise stood at her apartment door the one nearest the front entrance a housecoat held tight at her neck i rushed past her wrenched open the door and came out low my thumb already clicking down the safety on the step stood a black child of no more than ten years a cylindrical giftwrapped parcel in his hand and his eyes wide in fear and shock i grabbed him by the collar and flung him inside shouting for mrs damato to hold him to get both of them away from the package and ran down the steps of the redbrick and on to the street it was deserted except for the papers and the rolling cans it was a strange desertion as if the east village and its inhabitants had conspired with the traveling man against me at the far end of the street beneath the streetlight a telephone booth stood there was no one there and the handset was hanging in its place i ran toward it moving away from the corner wall as i approached in case anyone was waiting at the other side here the street was alive with passersby gay couples hand in hand tourists lovers in the distance i saw the lights of traffic and i heard around me the sounds of a safer more mundane world i seemed to have left behind i spun at the sound of footsteps behind me a young woman was approaching the telephone fumbling in her purse for change she looked up as she saw me approach and backed off at the sight of the gun find another i said i took one last look around clicked the safety and stuck the gun in the waistband of my pants i braced my foot against the pillar of the phone booth and with both hands i wrenched the connecting cable from the phone with a strength that was not natural to me then i returned to my apartment house carrying the receiver before me like a fish on the end of a line inside her apartment mrs damato was holding the kid by his arms while he struggled and fought with tears rolling down his cheeks i held his shoulders and squatted down to his level hey its okay take it easy youre not in any trouble i just want to ask you some questions whats your name the boy quieted down a little although he still shook with sobs he glanced around nervously at mrs damato and then made an attempt to break for the door he nearly made it too his jacket slipping from his body as he pulled out his arms but the force of his efforts made him slip and fall and i was on him i hauled him to a chair sat him down and gave mrs damato walter coles number i told her to tell him it was urgent and to get over here fast whats your name kid jake okay jake who gave you this i nodded toward the parcel that stood on the table beside us wrapped in blue paper decorated with teddy bears and candy canes and topped with a bright blue ribbon jake shook his head the force sending tears flying off in both directions its all right jake theres no need to be scared was it a man jake jake jake keep using his name calm him get him to concentrate his face swiveled toward me the eyes huge he nodded did you see what he looked like jake his chin crumpled and he started to cry in loud sobs that brought mrs damato back to the kitchen door he said hed hurt me said jake he said hed cucut my face off mrs damato moved beside him and he buried his face in the folds of her housecoat wrapping his small arms around her thick waist did you see him jake did you see what he looked like he turned from the housecoat he had a knife like doctors use on tv the boys mouth hung wide with terror he showed it to me touched me with it here he lifted a finger to his left cheek jake did you see his face he was all dark said jake his voice rising in hysteria there was nuhnuhthin there his voice rose to a scream he didnt have no face i told mrs damato to take jake into the kitchen until walter cole arrived then sat down to examine the gift from the traveling man it was about ten inches high and eight inches in diameter and it felt like glass i took out my pocket knife and gently pulled back an edge of the wrapping examining it for wires or pressure pads there was nothing i cut the two strips of tape holding the paper in place and gently removed the grinning bears the dancing candy canes the surface of the jar was clean and i smelled the disinfectant he had used to erase any traces of himself in the yellowing liquid it contained i saw my own face doubly reflected first on the surface of the glass and then inside on the face of my oncebeautiful daughter it rested gently against the side of the jar now bleached and puffy like the face of a drowning victim scraps of flesh like tendrils rising from the edges and the eyelids closed as if in repose and i moaned in a rising tide of agony and fear hatred and remorse in the kitchen i could hear the boy named jake sobbing and mingled with his cries i suddenly heard my own i dont know how much time elapsed before cole arrived he stared ashen faced at the thing in the jar and then called forensics did you touch it no theres a phone as well the number matches the caller id but there wont be any traces im not even sure he was at that phone that number shouldnt have come up on the cell phone id his voice was synthesized in some way i think he was running his words through some form of sophisticated software something with voice recognition and tone manipulation and maybe bouncing it off that number i dont know im guessing thats all i was babbling words tripping over one another i was afraid of what might happen if i stopped talking what did he say i think hes getting ready to start again he sat down heavily and ran his hand over his face and through his hair then he picked up the paper by one edge with a gloved hand and almost gently used it to cover the front of the jar like a veil you know what we have to do he said well need to know everything he said anything at all that might help us to get a lead on him well do the same with the kid i kept my eyes on cole on the floor anywhere but on the table and the remains of all that i had lost he thinks hes a demon walter cole looked once again at the shape of the jar maybe he is as we left for the station cops milled around the front of the building preparing to take statements from neighbors passersby anyone who might possibly have witnessed the actions of the traveling man the boy jake came with us his parents arriving shortly after with that frightened sick look that poor decent people get in the city when they hear that one of their children is with the police the traveling man must have been following me throughout the day watching my movements so he could put into action what he had planned i traced back my movements trying to remember faces strangers anyone whose gaze might have lingered for just a moment too long there was nothing at the station walter and i went through the conversation again and again pulling out anything that might be useful that might stamp some distinguishing feature on this killer you say the voices changed he asked repeatedly at one point i even thought i heard jennifer there may be something in that voice synthesis of that kind would have to be done using some sort of computer shit he could simply have routed the call through that number like you said the kid says he was given the jar at four pm and told to deliver it at fourthirtyfive pm exactly he waited in an alley counting the seconds on his power rangers digital watch that could have given this guy enough time to get to his home base and bounce the call i dont know enough about these things maybe he needed access to an exchange to do what he did ill have to get someone who knows to check it out the mechanics of the voice synthesis were one thing but the reasons for the synthesis were another it might have been that the traveling man wanted to leave as few traces of himself as possible a voice pattern could be recognized stored compared and even used against him at some point in the future what about the kids comment that this guy with the scalpel had no face asked walter a mask of some kind maybe to avoid any possibility of identification he could be marked in some way thats another option the third choice is that he is what he seems to be a demon i didnt reply i didnt know what a demon was if an individuals inhumanity could cause him to cross over in some way to become something less than human or if there were some things that seemed to defy any conventional notion of what it meant to be human of what it meant to exist in the world when i returned to the apartment that night mrs damato brought me up a plate of cold cuts and some italian bread and sat with me for a time fearful for me after what had taken place that afternoon when she left i stood beneath the shower for a long time the water as hot as i could take it and i washed my hands again and again i lay awake then for a long time sick with anger and fear watching the cell phone on my desk my senses were so heightened that i could hear them hum read me a story daddy what story do you want to hear a funny story the three bears the baby bear is funny okay but then you have to go to sleep okay one story one story then i go to sleep in an autopsy the body is first photographed clothed and naked certain parts of the body may be xrayed to determine the presence of bone fragments or foreign objects embedded in the flesh every external feature is noted the hair color the height the weight the condition of the body the color of the eyes baby bear opened his eyes wide somebodys been eating my porridge and its all gone all gone all gone the internal examination is conducted from top to bottom but the head is examined last the chest is examined for any sign of rib fractures a yshaped incision is made by cutting from shoulder to shoulder crossing over the breasts then moving down from the lower tip of the sternum to the pubic region the heart and lungs are exposed the pericardial sac is opened and a sample of blood is taken to determine the blood type of the victim the heart lungs esophagus and trachea are removed each organ is weighed examined and sliced into sections fluid in the thoracic pleural cavity is removed for analysis slides of organ tissue are prepared for analysis under a microscope and then goldilocks ran away and the three bears never saw her again read it again no we agreed one story thats all we have time for we have more time not tonight another night no tonight no another night therell be other nights and other stories the abdomen is examined and any injuries are noted before the removal of the organs fluids in the abdomen are analyzed and each separate organ is weighed examined and sectioned the contents of the stomach are measured samples are taken for toxicological analysis the order of removal is usually as follows the liver the spleen the adrenals and kidneys the stomach pancreas and intestines what did you read goldilocks and the three bears again again are you going to tell me a story what story would you like to hear something dirty oh i know lots of stories like that i know you do the genitalia are examined for injuries or foreign material vaginal and anal swabs are obtained and any foreign matter collected is sent to a dna lab for analysis the bladder is removed and a urine sample is sent to toxicology kiss me kiss you where everywhere on my lips my eyes my neck my nose my ears my cheeks kiss me everywhere i love your kisses on me suppose i start with your eyes and move down from there okay i can live with that the skull is examined in an effort to find evidence of injury the intermastoid incision is made from one ear to the other across the top of the head the scalp is peeled away and the skull exposed a saw is used to cut through the skull the brain is examined and removed why cant we be like this more often i dont know i want us to be but i cant i love you like this please susan no i could taste the booze on your breath susan i cant talk about this now not now when when are we going to talk about it some other time im going out stay please no ill be back later please rehoboth beach in delaware has a long boardwalk bordered on one side by the beach and on the other by the sort of amusement arcades you remember from your childhood twentyfivecent games played with wooden balls that you roll into holes to score points horse races with metal horses loping down a sloped track with a glasseyed teddy bear for the winner a frog pond game played with magnets on the end of a childs fishing line theyve been joined now by noisy computer games and space flight simulators but rehoboth still retains more charm than say dewey beach farther up the coast or even bethany a ferry runs from cape may in new jersey to lewes on the delaware coast and from there its maybe five or six miles south to rehoboth its not really the best way to approach rehoboth since you run the gamut of burger joints outlet stores and shopping malls on us the approach north through dewey is better running along the shore with its miles of dunes from that direction rehoboth benefits from the contrast with dewey you cross into the town proper over a kind of ornamental lake go past the church and then youre on rehoboths main street with its bookstores its tshirt shops its bars and restaurants set in big old wooden houses where you can drink on the porch and watch people walk their dogs in the quiet evening air four of us had decided on rehoboth as the place to go for a weekend break to celebrate tommy morrisons promotion to lieutenant despite its reputation as something of a gay hot spot we ended up staying in the lord baltimore with its comfortable antiquated rooms harking back to another era less than a block away from the blue moon bar where crowds of welltanned expensively dressed men partied loudly into the night i had just become walter coles partner i suspected walter had pulled strings to have me assigned as his partner although nothing was ever said with lees agreement he traveled with me to delaware along with tommy morrison and a friend of mine from the academy named joseph bonfiglioli who was shot dead a year later while chasing a guy who had stolen eighty dollars from a liquor store each evening at pm without fail walter would call lee to check on her and the kids he was a man acutely aware of the vulnerability of a parent walter and i had known each other for some timefour years by then i think i met him first in one of the bars in which cops used to hold court i was young just out of uniform and still admiring my reflection in my new tin great things were expected of me it was widely believed that i would get my name in the papers i did that although not in the way that anyone would have imagined walter was a stocky figure wearing slightly worn suits a dark shadow of a beard on his cheeks and chin even when he had shaved only an hour before he had a reputation as a dogged concerned investigator one who had occasional flashes of brilliance that could turn an investigation around when legwork had failed to produce a result and the necessary quota of luck upon which almost every investigation depends was not forthcoming walter cole was also an avid reader a man who devoured knowledge in the same way that certain tribes devour their enemies hearts in the hope that they will become braver as a result we shared a love of runyon and wodehouse of tobias wolff raymond carver donald barthelme the poetry of e e cummings and strangely of the earl of rochester the restoration dandy tortured by his failings his love of alcohol and women and his inability to be the husband that he believed his wife deserved i recall walter wandering along the boardwalk at rehoboth with a popsicle in his hand a garish shirt hanging over a pair of khaki shorts his sandals slapping lightly on the sandscattered wood and a straw hat protecting his already balding head even as he joked with us examining menus and losing money on the slots stealing fries from tommy morrisons big thrashers paper tub paddling in the cool atlantic surf i knew that he was missing lee and i knew too that to live a life like walter colesa life almost mundane in the pleasure it derived from small happinesses and the beauty of the familiar but uncommon in the value it attached to themwas something to be envied i met susan lewis as she then was for the first time in lingos market an oldstyle general store that sold produce and cereals alongside expensive cheeses and boasted its own instore bakery it was still a familyrun operationa sister a brother and their mother a tiny whitehaired woman with the energy of a terrier on our first morning in the resort i stumbled out to buy coffee and a newspaper in lingos my mouth dry my legs still unsteady from the night before she stood at the deli counter ordering coffee beans and pecans her hair tied loosely in a ponytail she wore a yellow summer dress her eyes were a deep dark blue and she was very very beautiful i on the other hand was very much the worse for wear but she smiled at me as i stood beside her at the counter oozing alcohol from my pores and then she was gone trailing a hint of expensive scent behind her i saw her a second time that day at the ymca as she stepped from the pool and entered the dressing rooms while i tried to sweat out the alcohol on a rowing machine it seemed to me that for the next day or two i caught glimpses of her everywhere in a bookshop examining the covers of glossy legal thrillers passing the launderette clutching a bag of donuts peering in the window of the irish eyes bar with a girlfriend and finally i came upon her one night as she stood on the boardwalk the sound of the arcades behind her and the waves breaking before her she was alone caught up in the sight of the surf gleaming white in the darkness few people strolled on the beach to obscure her view and at the periphery away from the arcades and the fast food stalls it was startlingly empty she looked over at me as i stood beside her she smiled feeling better now a little you caught me at a bad time i could smell your bad time she said her nose wrinkling im sorry if id known you were going to be there id have dressed up and i wasnt kidding its okay ive had those times and from there it began she lived in new jersey commuted to manhattan each day to work in a publishers office and every second weekend she visited her parents in massachusetts we were married a year later and we had jennifer one year after that we had maybe three very good years together before things started to deteriorate it was my fault i think when my parents married they both knew the toll a policemans life could take on a marriage he because he lived that life and saw its results reflected in the lives around him she because her father had been a deputy in maine and had resigned before the cost became too high susan had no such experience she was the youngest of four children both of her parents were still alive and they all doted on her when she died they ceased to speak to me even at the graveside no words passed between us with susan and jennifer gone it was as if i had been cut adrift from the tide of life and left to float in still dark waters the deaths of susan and jennifer attracted a great deal of attention although it soon faded the more intimate details of the killingthe skinning the removal of the faces the blindingswere kept from the public but it didnt stop the freaks from coming out of the woodwork for a time murder tourists would drive up to the house and videotape one another standing in the yard a local patrolman even caught one couple trying to break in through the back door in order to pose in the chairs where susan and jennifer had died in the days after they had been found the phone rang regularly with calls from people who claimed to be married to the killer or who felt certain that they had met him in a past life or on one or two occasions called only to say they were glad my wife and child were dead eventually i left the house remaining in touch by phone and fax with the lawyer who had been entrusted with the business of selling it i had found the community in southern maine when i was returning to manhattan from chicago after chasing up one more obscure nonlead a suspected child killer named myron able who was dead by the time i arrived killed in the parking lot of a bar after he tangled with some local thugs maybe i was also looking for some peace in a place i knew but i never got as far as the house in scarborough the house that my grandfather had left me in his will i was sick by that time when the girl found me retching and crying in the doorway of a boardedup electronics store and offered me a bed for the night i could only nod when her comrades huge men with muddied boots and shirts that smelled of sweat and pine needles dragged me to their pickup and dumped me in the back i half hoped that they were going to kill me they nearly did by the time i left their community out by sebago lake six weeks later i had lost more than twelve pounds and my stomach muscles stood out like the plates on an alligators back during the day i worked on their small farm and attended group sessions where others like me tried to purge themselves of their demons i still craved alcohol but fought back the desire as i had been taught there were prayers in the evenings and every sunday a pastor would give a sermon on abstinence tolerance the need for each man and woman to find a peace within himself or herself the community funded itself through the produce it sold some furniture it made and donations from those who had availed themselves of its services some of them now wealthy men and women but i was still sick consumed by a desire to revenge myself upon those around me i felt trapped in a limbo the investigation had ground to a halt and would not resume again until a similar crime was committed and a pattern could be established someone had taken my wife and child from me and escaped unpunished inside me the hurt and anger and guilt ebbed and flowed like a red tide waiting to spill its banks i felt it as a physical pain that tore at my head and gnawed at my stomach it led me back to the city where i tortured and killed the pimp johnny friday in the toilet of the bus station where he had been waiting to feast on the waifs and strays drifting into new york i think now that i had always set out to kill him but that i had hidden the knowledge of what i intended to do in some corner of my mind i draped it with selfserving justifications and excuses the sort i had used for so long each time i watched a shot of whiskey poured in front of me or heard the gassy snap of a bottle cap frozen by my own inability and the inability of others to find the killer of susan and jennifer i saw a chance to strike out and i took it from the moment i packed my gun and gloves and set out for the bus station johnny friday was a dead man friday was a tall thin black man who looked like a preacher in his trademark dark threebuttoned suits and his collarless shirts fastened at the neck he would hand out small bibles and religious pamphlets to the new arrivals and offer them soup from a flask and as the barbiturates it contained began to take effect he would lead them from the station and into the back of a waiting van then they would disappear as surely as if they had never arrived until they turned up on the streets as beaten junkies whoring for the fix that johnny supplied at inflated prices while they pulled in the tricks that kept him rich his was a handson operation and even in a business not noted for its humanity johnny friday was beyond any kind of redemption he supplied children to pedophiles delivering them to the doors of selected safe houses where they were raped and sodomized before being returned to their owner if they were rich and depraved enough johnny would give them access to the basement in an abandoned warehouse in the garment district there for a cash payment of ten thousand dollars they could take one of johnnys stable boy or girl child or teen they could torture rape and if they wished kill and johnny would take care of the body he was noted in certain circles for his discretion in my search for the killer of my wife and child i had learned of johnny friday from a former snitch i learned that johnny sometimes dealt in pictures and videos of sexual torture that he was a leading source of this material and that anyone whose tastes ran in that direction would at some point come into contact with johnny friday or one of his agents and so i watched him for five hours from an au bon pain in the station and when he went to the washroom i followed him it was divided into sections the first mirrored with sinks the second lined with urinals along the end wall and two sets of stalls opposite divided by a central aisle an old man in a stained uniform sat in a small glasslined cubicle beside the sinks but he was engrossed in a magazine when i entered behind johnny friday two men were washing their hands at the sinks two were standing at the urinals and three of the stalls were occupied two in the section to the left one in the section to the right piped music was playing some unrecognizable tune johnny friday walked hips swinging to the urinal at the far right of the wall i stood two urinals away from him as i waited for the other men to finish as soon as they had finished i moved behind johnny friday clasping my hand on his mouth and pressing the smith amp wesson into the soft skin beneath his chin as i pushed him into the end stall the farthest away from the other occupied stall on that side hey dont man dont he whispered his eyes wide i brought my knee up hard into his groin and he fell down heavily on his knees as i locked the door behind us he tried weakly to rise and i hit him hard in the face i brought the gun close to his head again dont say a word turn your back to me please man dont shut up turn he inched slowly round on his knees i pulled his jacket down over his arms and then cuffed him from my other pocket i took a rag and a roll of duct tape i stuffed the rag in his mouth and wrapped the tape around his head two or three times then i pulled him to his feet and pushed him down on to the toilet his right foot came up and caught me hard on the shin and he tried to push himself up but he was off balance and i hit him again this time he stayed down i held the gun on him and listened for a moment in case anyone came to see what the noise was there was only the sound of a toilet flushing no one came i told johnny friday what i wanted his eyes narrowed as he realized who i was sweat poured from his forehead and he tried to blink it from his eyes his nose was bleeding slightly and a thin trickle of red ran from beneath the duct tape and rolled down his chin his nostrils flared as he breathed heavily through them i want names johnny names of customers youre going to give them to me he snorted in disdain and blood bubbled from a nostril his eyes were cold now he looked like a long black snake with his slickedback hair and slitted reptilian eyes when i broke his nose they widened in shock and pain i hit him again once twice hard blows to the stomach and head then i pulled the tape down hard and dragged the bloodied rag from his mouth give me names he spat a tooth from his mouth fuck you he said fuck you and your dead bitches what happened after is still not clear to me i remember hitting him again and again feeling bone crunch and ribs break and watching my gloves darken with his blood there was a black cloud in my mind and streaks of red ran through it like strange lightning when i stopped johnny fridays features seemed to have melted into a bloody blur i held his jaw in my hands as blood bubbled from his lips tell me i hissed his eyes rolled toward me and like a vision of some craggy entrance to hell his broken teeth showed behind his lips as he managed one last smile his body arched and spasmed once twice thick black blood rolled from his nose and mouth and ears and then he died i stood back breathing heavily i wiped my bloodspattered face as best i could and cleaned some of the blood from the front of my jacket although it hardly showed against the black leather and my black jeans i took the gloves from my hands stuffed them in my pocket and then flushed the toilet before peering carefully out and pulling the door closed behind me as i left blood was already seeping out of the stall and pooling in the cracks between the tiles i realized that the noise of johnny fridays dying must have echoed around the washroom but i didnt care as i left i passed only an elderly black man at the urinals and he like a good citizen who knows when to mind his own business didnt even glance at me there were other men at the sinks who gave me a cursory look in the mirror but i noticed that the old man was gone from his glass cubicle and i ducked into an empty departure gate as two cops came running toward the washroom from the upper level i made my way to the street through the ranks of buses beneath the station perhaps johnny friday deserved to die certainly no one mourned his passing and the police made little more than a cursory effort to find his killer but there were rumors for walter i think had heard them but i live with the death of johnny friday as i live with the deaths of susan and jennifer if he did deserve to die if what he got was no more than he merited yet it was not for me to act as his judge and executioner in the next life we get justice someone once wrote in this one we have the law in johnny fridays last minutes there was no law and only a kind of vicious justice that was not for me to give i did not believe that my wife and child were the first to die at the hands of the traveling man if that was who he was i still believed that somewhere in a louisiana swamp lay another and in her identity was the clue that would open up the world of this man who believed he was not a man she was part of a grim tradition in human history a parade of victims stretching back to ancient times back to the time of christ and before that back to a time when men sacrificed those around them to placate gods who knew no mercy and whose natures they both created and imitated in their actions the girl in louisiana was part of a bloody succession a modernday windeby girl a descendant of that anonymous woman found in the fifties in a shallow grave in a peat bog in denmark where she had been led nearly two thousand years before naked and blindfolded to be drowned in twenty inches of water a path could be traced through history leading from her death to the death of another girl at the hands of a man who believed he could appease the demons within himself by taking her life but who once blood had been spilled and flesh torn wanted more and took my wife and child we do not believe in evil anymore only evil acts that can be explained away by the science of the mind there is no evil and to believe in it is to fall prey to superstition like checking beneath the bed at night or being afraid of the dark but there are those for whom we have no easy answers who do evil because that is their nature because they are evil johnny friday and others like him prey on those who live on the periphery of society on those who have lost their way it is easy to get lost in the darkness on the edge of modern life and once we are lost and alone there are things waiting for us there our ancestors were not wrong in their superstitions there is reason to fear the dark and just as a trail could be followed from a bog in denmark to a swamp in the south so i came to believe that evil too could be traced throughout the life of our race there was a tradition of evil that ran beneath all human existence like the sewers beneath a city that continued on even after one of its constituent parts was destroyed because it was simply one small part of a greater darker whole perhaps that was part of what made me want to find out the truth about catherine demeter for as i look back i realize that evil had found its way to touch her life too and taint it beyond retrieval if i could not fight evil as it came in the form of the traveling man then i would find it in other forms i believe what i say i believe in evil because i have touched it and it has touched me when i telephoned rachel wolfes private practice the following morning the secretary told me that she was giving a seminar at a conference at columbia university i took the subway from the village and arrived early at the main entrance to the campus i wandered for a while around the barnard book forum students jostling me as i stood browsing in the literature section before making my way to the main college entrance i passed through the universitys large quadrangle with the butler library at one end the administration building at the other and like a mediator between learning and bureaucracy the statue of alma mater in the grass center like most city residents i rarely came to columbia and the sense of tranquillity and study only feet away from the busy streets outside was always surprising to me rachel wolfe was just finishing her lecture as i arrived so i waited for her outside the theater until the session ended she emerged talking to a young earnestlooking man with curly hair and round spectacles who hung on her every word when she saw me she stopped and smiled a goodbye at him he looked unhappy and seemed set to linger but then turned and walked away his head low how can i help you mr parker she asked with a puzzled but not uninterested look hes back we walked over to the hungarian pastry shop on amsterdam avenue where intenselooking young men and women sat reading textbooks and sipping coffee rachel wolfe was wearing jeans and a chunky jumper with a heartshaped design on the front despite all that had happened the previous night i was curious about her i had not been attracted to a woman since susans death and my wife was the last woman with whom i had slept rachel wolfe her long red hair brushed back over her ears aroused a sense of longing in me that was more than sexual i felt a deep loneliness within myself and an ache in my stomach she looked at me curiously im sorry i said i was thinking of something she nodded and picked at a poppyseed roll before pulling off a huge chunk and stuffing it in her mouth sighing with satisfaction i must have looked slightly shocked because she covered her mouth with her hand and giggled softly sorry but im a sucker for these things daintiness and good table manners tend to go out the window when someone puts one in front of me i know the feeling i used to be like that with ben amp jerrys until i realized that i was starting to look like one of the cartons she smiled again and pushed at a piece of roll that was trying to make a break for freedom from the side of her mouth the conversation sagged for a time i take it your parents were jazz fans she said eventually i must have looked puzzled for a moment because she smiled in amusement as i tried to take in the question i had been asked it many times before but i was grateful for the diversion and i think she knew that no my father and mother didnt know the first thing about jazz i replied my father just liked the name the first time he heard about bird parker was at the baptismal font when the priest mentioned it to him the priest was a big jazz fan i was told he couldnt have been happier if my father had announced that he was naming all of his children after the members of the count basie orchestra my father by contrast wasnt too happy at the idea of naming his firstborn after a black jazz musician but by then it was too late to think of another name what did he call the rest of his children i shrugged he didnt get the chance my mother couldnt have any more children after me maybe she thought she couldnt do any better she smiled i dont think so i was nothing but trouble for her as a child it used to drive my father crazy i could see in her eyes that she was about to ask me about my father but something in my face stopped her she pursed her lips pushed away her empty plate and settled herself back in her chair can you tell me what happened i went through the events of last night leaving nothing out the words of the traveling man were burned into my mind why do you call him that a friend of mine led me to a woman who said that she was receiving uh messages from a dead girl the girl had died in the same way as susan and jennifer was the girl found no one looked an old womans psychic messages arent enough to launch an investigation even if she exists are you sure its the same guy i believe it is yes wolfe looked like she wanted to ask more but she let it go go back over what this caller this traveling man said again slowly this time i did until she lifted her hand to stop me thats a quote from joyce mouth to mouths kiss its the description of the pale vampire in ulysses this is an educated man were dealing with the stuff about our kind sounds biblical im not sure of it ill have to check it give it to me again i spoke the words slowly as she took them down in a wirebound notebook i have a friend who teaches theology and biblical studies he might be able to identify a source for these she closed the notebook you know that im not supposed to get involved in this case i told her that i hadnt known following our earlier discussions someone got in touch with the commissioner he wasnt pleased at the snub to his relative i need help with this i need to know all i can suddenly i felt nauseous and when i swallowed my throat hurt im not sure thats wise you should probably leave this to the police i know thats not what you want to hear but after all thats happened you risk damaging yourself do you understand what i mean i nodded slowly she was right part of me wanted to draw back to immerse myself once again in the ebb and flow of ordinary life i wanted to unburden myself of what i felt to restore myself to some semblance of a normal existence i wanted to rebuild but i felt frozen suspended by what had happened and now the traveling man had returned snatching any possibility of that normality from me and simultaneously leaving me as powerless to act as i had been before i think rachel wolfe understood that perhaps that was why i had come to her in the hope that she might understand are you okay she reached over and touched my hand and i almost cried i nodded again youre in a terribly difficult situation if he has decided to contact you then he wants you to be involved and there may be a link that can be exploited from an investigative point of view you probably shouldnt deviate from your routine in case he contacts you again but from the point of view of your own wellbeing she let the unstated hang in the air you might even want to consider some professional help im sorry for being so blunt about it but it has to be said i know and i appreciate the advice it was strange to find myself attracted to someone after all this time and then have her advise me to see a psychiatrist it didnt hold out the promise of any relationship that wasnt conducted on an hourly basis i think the investigators want me to stay i get the feeling youre not going to do it im trying to find someone its a different case but i think this person may be in trouble if i stay here theres no one to help her it may be a good idea to get away from this for a time but from what youre saying well go on it sounds like youre trying to save this person but youre not even sure if she needs saving maybe i need to save her maybe you do i told walter cole later that morning that i would continue looking for catherine demeter and that i would be leaving the city to do so we were sitting in the quietness of chumleys the villages old speakeasy on bedford when walter called i had surprised myself by nominating it for our meeting but as i sat sipping a coffee i realized why i had chosen it i enjoyed its sense of history its place in the citys past which could be traced back like an old scar or the wrinkle at the corner of an eye chumleys had survived the prohibition era when customers had escaped raids by leaving hastily through the back door which led onto barrow street it had survived world wars stock market crashes civil disobedience and the gradual erosion of time which was so much more insidious than all the rest right now i needed its stability you have to stay said walter he still had the leather coat now hanging loosely over the back of his chair someone had whistled at him when he entered wearing it no what do you mean no he said angrily hes opened an avenue of communication you stay we wire up the phone and we try to trace him when he calls again i dont think he will call again at least not for a while and i dont believe we could trace him anyway he doesnt want to be stopped walter all the more reason to stop him then my god look at what hes done what hes going to do again look at what youve done for his i leaned forward and broke in on him my voice low what have i done say it walter say it he stayed silent and i saw him swallow the words back we had come close to the edge but he had pulled back the traveling man wanted me to remain he wanted me to wait in my apartment for a call that might never come i could not let him do that to me yet both walter and i knew that the contact he had established could well be the first link in a chain that would eventually lead us to him a friend of mine ross oakes had worked in the police department of columbia south carolina during the bell killings larry gene bell abducted and smothered two girls one aged seventeen and abducted close to a mailbox the other aged nine and taken from her play area when investigators eventually found the bodies of the children they were too decomposed to determine if they had been sexually assaulted although bell later admitted to assaulting both bell had been tracked through a series of phone calls he made to the family of the seventeenyearold conversing primarily with the victims older sister he also mailed them her last will and testament in the phone calls he led the family to believe that the victim was still alive until her body was eventually found one week later after the abduction of the younger girl he contacted the first victims sister and described the abduction and killing of the girl he told the first victims sister that she would be next bell was found through indented writing on the victims letter a semiobliterated telephone number that was eventually tracked to an address through a process of elimination larry gene bell was a thirtysixyearold white male formerly married and now living with his mother and father he told investigative support unit agents from the fbi that the bad larry gene bell did it i knew of dozens of similar cases where contact with the killer by the victims family sometimes led to his capture but i had also seen what this form of psychological torture had done to those who were left behind the family of bell s first victim were lucky because they had to suffer bell s sick wanderings for only two weeks amid the anger and pain and grief that i had felt the night before there was another feeling that caused me to fear any further contact with the traveling man at least for the present i felt relief for over seven months there had been nothing the police investigation had ground to a halt my own efforts had brought me no nearer to identifying the killer of my wife and child and i feared that he might have disappeared now he had come back he had reached out to me and by doing so opened the possibility that he might be found he would kill again and in the killing a pattern would emerge that would bring us closer to him all these thoughts had raced through my head in the darkness of the night but in the first light of dawn i had realized the implications of what i felt the traveling man was drawing me into a cycle of dependency he had tossed me a crumb in the form of a telephone call and the remains of my daughter and in doing so had caused me to wish however briefly for the deaths of others in the hope that their deaths might bring me closer to him with that realization came the decision that i would not form such a relationship with this man it was a difficult decision to make but i knew that if he decided to contact me again then he would find me meanwhile i would leave new york and continue to hunt for catherine demeter yet deep down perhaps only half recognized by me and suspected by rachel wolfe there was another reason for continuing the search for catherine demeter i did not believe in remorse without reparation i had failed to protect my wife and child and they had died as a result perhaps i was deluded but i believed that if catherine demeter died because i stopped looking for her then i would have failed twice and i was not sure that i could live with that knowledge in her maybe wrongly i saw a chance to atone some of this i tried to explain to waltermy need to avoid a dependent relationship with this man the necessity of continuing the search for catherine demeter for her sake and my ownbut most of it i kept to myself we parted uneasily and on bad terms tiredness had gradually taken hold of me throughout the morning and i slept fitfully for an hour before setting off for virginia i was bathed in sweat and almost delirious when i awoke disturbed by dreams of endless conversations with a faceless killer and images of my daughter before her death just as i awoke i dreamed of catherine demeter surrounded by darkness and flames and the bones of dead children and i knew then that some terrible blackness had descended on her and that i had to try to save her to save us both from the darkness ii eadem mutata resurgo though changed i shall arise the same epitaph of jakob bernoulli swiss pioneer of fluid dynamics and spiral mathematics i drove down to virginia that afternoon it was a long ride but i told myself that i wanted time to open up the cars engine to let it cut loose after its time off the road as i drove i tried to sort through what had happened in the last two days but my thoughts kept coming back to the remains of my daughters face resting in a jar of formaldehyde i spotted the tail after about an hour a red nissan four wheel drive with two occupants they kept four or five vehicles behind but when i accelerated so did they when i fell back they kept me in view for as long as they could then they began to fall back too the plates were deliberately obscured with mud a woman drove her blond hair pulled back behind her and sunglasses masking her eyes a darkhaired male sat beside her i put them both in their thirties but i didnt recognize them if they were feds which was unlikely then they were lame if they were sonnys hired killers then it was just like sonny to hire cheap only a clown would use a wd for a tail or to try to take out another vehicle a wd has a high center of gravity and rolls easier than a drunk on a slope maybe i was just being paranoid but i didnt think so they didnt make a move and i lost them in the backroads between warrenton and culpeper as i headed toward the blue ridge if they came after me again id know they stood out like blood in snow as i drove sunlight speared the trees causing the weblike cocoons of caterpillars to glisten i knew that beneath the strands the white bodies of the larvae were twisting and writhing like victims of tourettes syndrome as they reduced the leaves to brown lifelessness the weather was beautiful and there was a kind of poetry to the names of the towns that skirted shenandoah wolftown quinque lydia roseland sweet briar lovingston brightwood to that list could be added the town of haven but only if you decided not to spoil the effect by actually visiting it it was raining heavily by the time i reached haven the town lay in a valley southeast of the blue ridge almost at the apex of a triangle formed with washington and richmond a sign at the limits read a welcome in the valley but there was little that was welcoming about haven it was a small town over which a pall of dust appeared to have settled that even the driving rain seemed unable to dislodge rusting pickups sat outside some of the houses and apart from a single fast food joint and a convenience store attached to a gas station only the weak neon of the welcome inn bar and the lights of the latenight diner opposite beckoned the casual visitor it was the sort of place where once a year the local veterans of foreign wars got together hired a bus and went somewhere else to commemorate their dead i checked into the haven view motel at the outskirts of the town i was the only guest and a smell of paint hung around the halls of what might once have been a considerable house but had now been converted into a functional anonymous threestory inn second floors being redecorated said the clerk who told me his name was rudy fry have to put you upstairs top floor technically we shouldnt be accepting guests at all but he smiled to indicate the big favor he was doing me by letting me stay rudy fry was a small overweight man in his forties there were longdried yellow sweat stains under his arms and he smelled vaguely of rubbing alcohol i looked around the haven view motel didnt look like the sort of place that would attract visitors in the best of times i know what youre thinkin said the clerk his smile revealing sparkling dentures youre thinkin why throw good money away by decoratin a motel in a shit hole like this he winked at me before leaning over the desk conspiratorially well im tellin you sir it aint gonna be a shit hole much longer them japanese is comin and when they do this place is gonna be a gold mine where else they gonna stay round here he shook his head and laughed shit we gonna be wipin our asses with dollar bills he handed me a key with a heavy wooden block chained to it room twentythree up the stairs elevators busted the room was dusty but clean a connecting door led into the room next door it took me less than five seconds to break the lock with my pocketknife then i showered changed and drove back into town the recession of the seventies had hit haven hard putting an end to what little industry there was the town might have recovered might have found some other way to prosper had its history been other than it was but the killings had tainted it and the town had fallen into decay and so even after the rain had sluiced its way over the stores and streets over the people and the houses over trees and pickups and cars and tarmac there was no freshness about haven it was as if the rain itself had been sullied by the contact i stopped in at the sheriffs office but neither the sheriff nor alvin martin was available instead a deputy named wallace sat scowling behind the desk and shoveling doritos into his mouth i decided to wait until the morning in the hope of finding someone more accommodating the diner was closing as i walked through the town which left only the bar or the burger joint the interior of the bar was ill lit as if it was expending too much power on the pink neon sign outside the welcome inn the sign glowed brightly but the interior seemed to give the lie to the sign some kind of bluegrass music was playing over a speaker and a tv above the bar was showing a basketball game with the volume turned down but no one seemed to be listening or watching anyway maybe twenty people were scattered around the tables and the long dark wood bar including a mountainous couple who looked like theyd left the third bear with a babysitter there was a low tide of conversation which ebbed slightly when i entered although it refused to cease entirely and then resumed at its previous level near the bar a small knot of men lounged around a battered pool table watching a huge heavyset man with a thick dark beard playing an older man who shot pool like a hustler they eyed me as i walked by but continued playing no conversation passed between them pool was obviously a serious business in the welcome inn drinking wasnt the hard men around the pool table were all clutching bottles of bud light the real drinkers equivalent of a club soda and lime i took an empty stool at the bar and asked for a coffee from a bartender whose white shirt seemed dazzlingly clean for such a place he studiously ignored me his eyes seemingly intent on the basketball game so i asked again his glance moved lazily to me as if i were a bug crawling on the bar and he had just had his fill of squashing bugs but was wondering whether he couldnt squash one more for the road we dont do coffee he said i glanced along the bar two stools down an elderly man in a lumber jacket and a battered cat cap sipped at a mug of what smelled like strong black coffee he bring his own i inquired gesturing with a nod down the bar yep said the bartender still looking at the tv a cokell do right behind your knees second shelf down dont hurt yourself leaning over for a long time it seemed he wasnt going to move then he shifted slowly leaned down without taking his eyes from the screen and found the opener on the edge of the counter by instinct then he placed the bottle in front of me and set an iceless glass beside it in the mirror behind the bar i saw the amused smiles of some of the other patrons and heard a womans laugh low and boozy with a promise of sex in it in the mirror over the bar i traced the laugh to a coarsefeatured woman in the corner her hair huge and dark beside her a stout man whispered sour somethings in her ear like the cooings of a sick dove i poured the drink and took a long swig it was warm and sticky and i felt it cleave to my palate my tongue and my teeth the bartender spent a while idly polishing glasses with a bar towel that looked like it had last been cleaned for reagans inauguration when he got bored with redistributing the dirt on the glasses he wandered back toward me and put the bar towel down in front of me passin through he asked although there was no curiosity in his voice it sounded more like advice than a question nope i said he took it in and then waited for me to say more i didnt he gave in first whatcha doin here then he looked over my shoulder at the pool players behind and i noticed that the sound of balls colliding had suddenly ceased he smiled a big shiteating grin maybe i canhe stopped and the grin got wider his tone changing to one of mock formalitybe of some assistance you know anyone named demeter the shiteating grin froze and there was a pause no then i dont believe you can be of any assistance i stood up to leave placing two dollar bills on the counter for the welcome i said put it toward a new sign i turned to find a small ratfeatured guy in a worn blue denim jacket standing in front of me his nose was dotted with blackheads and his teeth were prominent and yellowstained like walrus tusks his black baseball cap was marked with the words boyz n the hood but this wasnt any logo john singleton would have liked instead of homies the words were surrounded by the hooded heads of klan figures beneath his denim jacket i could see the word pulaski under a seal of some sort pulaski was the birthplace of the ku klux klan and the site of an annual rally for aryan crackers everywhere although i bet the face of old thom robb grand high asswipe of the klan must have just lit up at the sight of rat features and his pinched subintelligent face arriving to take in the pulaski air after all robb was trying to make the klan appeal to the educated elite the lawyers and the schoolteachers most lawyers would have been reluctant to have rat features as a client still less a brother in arms but there was probably still a place for rat features in the new klan every organization needs its foot soldiers and this one had cannon fodder written all over him when the time came for the boyz to storm the steps of the capitol and reclaim the jewnited states for their own rat features would be in the front line where he could be certain to lay down his life for the cause behind him the bearded pool player loomed his eyes small piggy and dumb looking his arms were enormous but without definition and his gut bulged beneath a camouflage tshirt the tshirt bore the legend kill em alllet god sort em out but the big guy was no marine he looked as close to retarded as you can get without someone coming by twice a day to feed you and clean up your mess how you doin said the rat the bar was quiet now and the group of men at the pool table were no longer lounging but stood rigid in anticipation of what was to come one of them smiled and poked his neighbor with an elbow obviously the rat and his buddy were the local double act great till now he nodded as if id just said something deeply profound with which he had a natural empathy you know i said i once took a leak in thom robbs garden which was true itd be better if you just got back on the road and kept driving i reckon said the rat after a pause to figure out who thom robb was so why dont you just do that thanks for the advice i moved to go past him but his pal put a hand like a shovel against my chest and pushed me back against the bar by flexing his wrist slightly it wasnt advice said the rat he gestured back at the big guy with his thumb this heres six you dont get back in your fuckin car now and start raisin dust on the highway six is gonna fuck you up bad six smiled dimly the evolutionary curve obviously sloped pretty gently where six came from you know why hes called six let me guess i replied there are another five assholes like him at home it didnt look like i was going to find out how six got his name because he stopped smiling and lunged past the rat his hand clutching for my neck he moved fast for a man his size but not that fast i brought my right foot up and released it heel first onto sixs left knee there was a satisfying crunching sound and six faltered his mouth wide with pain and stumbled sideways and down his friends were already coming to his aid when there was a commotion from behind them and a small tubby deputy in his late thirties pushed his way through one hand on the butt of his pistol it was wallace deputy dorito he looked scared and edgy the kind of guy who became a cop to give him some sort of advantage over the people who used to laugh at him in school steal his lunch money and beat him up except he found that now those people still laughed at him and didnt look like theyd let the uniform stand in the way of another beating still on this occasion he had a gun and maybe they figured he was scared enough to pull it on them whats goin on here clete there was silence for a moment and then the rat spoke up just some high spirits got out of hand wallace aint nothin to concern the law i wasnt talking to you gabe someone helped six to his feet and brought him to a chair looks like more than high spirits to me i reckon you boys better come on down to the cells cool off for a time let it go wallace said a low voice it came from a thin wiry man with cold dark eyes and a beard flecked with gray he had an air of authority about him and an intelligence that went beyond the low cunning of his associates he watched me carefully as he spoke the way an undertaker might eye up a prospective client for his casket okay clete but deputy doritos words trailed off as he realized there was nothing he could say that would matter to any of the men before him he nodded to the crowd as if the decision not to pursue things any further had been his to make youd better leave mister he said looking at me i stood up and walked slowly to the door no one said anything as i left back at the motel i rang walter cole to find out if anything had developed in the stephen barton killing but he was out of the office and his machine was on at home i left the number of the motel and tried to get some sleep the sky was gray and dark the next morning heavy with impending rain my suit was wrinkled from the previous days travel so i abandoned it for chinos a white shirt and a black jacket i even dug out a black silkknit tie so i wouldnt look like a bum i drove once through the town there was no sign of a red jeep or the couple i had seen driving it i parked outside the haven diner bought a copy of the washington post in the gas station across the road and then went into the diner for breakfast it was after nine but people still lounged around at the counter or at the tables mumbling about the weather and i guessed about me since some of them glanced knowingly in my direction directing the attention of their neighbors toward me i sat at a table in the corner and scanned the paper a mature woman in a white apron and blue uniform with dorothy embossed at her left breast walked over to me carrying a pad and took my order of white toast bacon and coffee she hovered over me after i finished ordering you the fella who whupped that six boy in the bar last night thats me she nodded in satisfaction ill give you your breakfast for free then she smiled a hard smile then added but dont you go confusin my generosity with an invitation to stay you aint that good lookin she strolled back behind the counter and pinned my order to a wire there wasnt much traffic on havens main street or much human activity in sight most of the cars and trucks seemed to be passing through on their way to someplace else the town seemed to be permanently stuck in a grim sunday morning i finished my food and left a tip on the table dorothy slouched forward over the counter her breasts resting on its polished surface bye now she said as i left the other diners briefly looked over their shoulders at me before returning to their breakfast and coffee i drove to the haven public library a new singlestory building at the far side of the town a pretty black woman in her early thirties stood behind the counter with an older white woman whose hair was like steel wool and who eyed me with obvious distaste as i entered morning i said the younger woman smiled slightly anxiously while the older one tried to tidy the already immaculate area behind the counter whats the local paper around here used to be the haven leader answered the younger woman after a slight pause its gone now i was looking for something older back issues she glanced at the other woman as if for guidance but she continued to shift pieces of paper behind the counter theyre on microfiche in the cabinets beside the viewer how far back do you want to go not far i said and strolled over to the cabinets the leader files were arranged in date order in small square boxes in ten drawers but the boxes of files for the years of the haven killings were not in their place i ran through them all in case they had been misfiled although i had a feeling that those files werent available to the casual visitor i returned to the counter the elderly woman was no longer in sight the files im looking for dont appear to be there i said the younger girl looked confused but i didnt get the impression that she was what year were you looking for years nineteen sixtynine nineteen seventy maybe nineteen seventyone im sorry those files arentshe seemed to search for an excuse that might be plausibleavailable theyve been borrowed for research oh i said i smiled my best smile never mind ill manage with whats there she seemed relieved and i returned to the viewer idly flicking through the files for anything useful with no return other than boredom it took thirty minutes before the opportunity presented itself a party of schoolchildren entered the junior section of the library separated from the adult section by a halfwood halfglass screen the younger woman followed them and stood with her back to me talking to the children and their teacher a young blonde who didnt look long out of school herself there was no sign of the older woman although a brown door was half open in the small lobby beyond the adult section i slipped behind the counter and began rifling through drawers and cupboards as quietly as i could at one point i passed crouching by the entry door to the junior section but the librarian was still dealing with her young clients i found the missing files in a bottom drawer beside a small coin box i slipped them into my jacket pockets and was just leaving the counter area when the office door outside slammed and i heard soft footsteps approaching i darted beside a shelf as the senior librarian entered she stopped short at the entrance to the counter and shot an unpleasant look in my direction and at the book in my hand i smiled gamely and returned to the viewer i wasnt sure how long it would be before the dragon behind the counter checked that drawer and decided to call for backup i tried the files first it took some time even though the haven leader had been only a weekly newspaper in there was nothing about any disappearances in the paper even in it seemed that black folks didnt count for much the paper contained a lot about church socials history society lectures and local weddings there was some minor crime stuff mostly traffic offenses and drunkanddisorderlies but nothing that might lead a casual reader to suppose that children were disappearing in the town of haven then in a november issue i came upon a reference to a man named walt tyler there was a picture of tyler beside the piece a goodlooking man being led away in handcuffs by a white deputy man held in sheriff attack read the headline above the picture the details contained in the piece below were sketchy but it seemed tyler had come into the sheriffs office and started busting the place up before taking a swing at the sheriff himself the only indication of a reason for the attack came in the last paragraph tyler was among a number of negroes questioned by the sheriffs office in connection with the disappearance of his daughter and two other children he was released without charge the files were more productive on the night of february amy demeter had disappeared after heading out to a friends house to deliver a sample of her mothers jam she never made it to the house and the jar was found broken on a sidewalk about five hundred yards from her home a picture of her was printed beside the story along with details of what she had been wearing and a brief history of the family father earl an accountant mother dorothy a housewife and a schoolteacher younger sister catherine a wellliked child with some artistic potential the story ran for the next few weeks search goes on for haven girl five more questioned in demeter mystery and finally little hope left for amy i spent another half hour going back and forth through the haven leader but there was nothing more on the killings or their resolution if any the only indication was a report of the death of adelaide modine in a fire four months later with a reference to her brothers death buried in the piece there was no description of the circumstances of the death of either but there was one hint once again in the last paragraph the haven sheriffs office had been anxious to talk to both adelaide and william modine in their ongoing investigation into the disappearance of amy demeter and a number of other children it didnt take a genius to read between the lines and see that either adelaide modine or her brother william or possibly both had been the main suspects local newspapers dont necessarily print all the news there are some things everyone knows already and sometimes the local press merely prints enough to throw outsiders off the scent the old librarian was giving me the evil eye so i finished printing off copies of the relevant articles then gathered them and left a haven county sheriffs office cruiser a brownandyellow crown victoria was pulled up in front of my car and a deputy wearing a clean wellpressed uniform was leaning against my drivers door waiting as i drew closer i could see the long muscles beneath his shirt his eyes were dull and lifeless he looked like an asshole a fit asshole this your car he asked in a virginia drawl his thumbs tucked inside a gun belt that glittered with the spotless tools of his trade on his chest the name burns stood out on his perfectly straight identity badge sure is i said mimicking his accent it was a bad habit i had his jaw tightened if it was actually possible for it to tighten more than it was already hear you were looking up some old newspapers im a crossword fan they were better in the old days you another writer judging from his tone i didnt think he read much at least nothing that didnt have pictures or a message from god no i said you get a lot of writers around here i dont think he believed i wasnt a writer maybe i looked bookish to him or maybe anyone with whom he wasnt personally acquainted was immediately suspected of covert literary leanings the librarian had sold me out believing me to be simply another hack trying to make a buck out of the ghosts of havens past im escorting you to the town line he said ive got your bag he moved to the patrol car and took my traveling bag from the front seat i was starting to get very tired of deputy burns im not planning on leaving just yet i said so maybe you could put it back in my room by the way when youre unpacking i like my socks on the left side of the drawer he dropped the bag on the road and started toward me look i began i have id i reached into the inside pocket of my jacket im it was a dumb thing to do but i was hot and tired and pissed at deputy burns and i wasnt thinking straight he caught one flash of the butt of my gun and his own piece was in his hands burns was quick he probably practiced in front of the mirror within seconds i was up against his car my gun was gone and deputy burnss shiny cuffs were biting into my wrists i was left cooling my heels in a cell for what i reckoned to be three or four hours since the careful deputy burns had taken my watch along with my gun my wallet and id my notes and my belt and laces in case i decided to hang myself in a fit of remorse for annoying the librarians these had been entrusted to the safe care of deputy wallace who made some passing reference to burns of my involvement in the previous nights incident in the bar still the cell was just about the cleanest one i had ever visited in my lifeeven the can looked like it could safely be used without needing a course of penicillin later i passed the time by mulling over what i had learned from the library microfiche trying to fit the pieces of the puzzle into some recognizable picture and refusing to let my mind drift to the traveling man and what he might be doing eventually there was a noise outside and the cell door opened i looked up to see a tall black man in a uniform shirt watching me he looked to be in his late thirties but something about the way he walked and the light of experience in his eyes told me he was older i guessed he might have boxed at one time probably middle to lightheavy and he moved gracefully on his feet he looked smarter than wallace and burns put together although no one was likely to hand out gold stars for that particular feat this i guessed was alvin martin i didnt rush to get up in case he thought i didnt like his nice clean cell you want to stay there another couple of hours or you waiting for someone to carry you out he asked the voice wasnt southern detroit chicago maybe i stood and he moved aside to let me pass wallace waited at the end of the corridor his thumbs tucked into his belt to take the weight off his shoulders give him back his things deputy even his gun asked wallace not making a move to do as he was told wallace had that look about him the look that told you he wasnt used to taking orders from a black guy and didnt like it when he had to it struck me that he might have more in common with the rat and his friends than was really wise for a conscientious lawman even his gun replied martin calmly but wearily giving wallace the eye wallace shoved off from the wall like a particularly ugly ship setting out to sea and steamed behind the counter surfacing eventually with a brown envelope and my gun i signed and martin nodded me toward the door get in the car please mr parker outside the light was starting to fade and there was a cool wind blowing from the hills a pickup rattled by on the road beyond a covered shotgun rack on the back guarded by a mangy hound back or front i asked get in the front he replied i trust you he started the cruiser and we drove for a time in silence the ac blasting cool air into our faces and onto our feet the town limits receded behind us and we entered woods thick with trees the road twisting and winding as it followed the contours of the land then in the distance a light shone we pulled up in the parking lot of a white diner topped by a green neon sign blinking green river eatery on the road beyond we took a booth at the rear far away from the handful of other patrons who cast curious glances at us before returning to their food martin took off his hat ordered coffee for both of us then sat back and looked at me its usually considered good manners for an unlicensed investigator packing a pistol to drop into the local lawmen and state his business at least before he goes around beating up pool players and stealing library files he said you werent around when i called i said neither was the sheriff and your friend wallace wasnt too keen on offering me cookies and swapping race jokes the coffee arrived martin added creamer and sugar to his i stuck with milk i made some calls about you said martin stirring his coffee a guy called cole vouched for you thats why im not kicking your ass out of town least not yet that and the fact that you werent afraid to whip some cracker ass in the bar last night shows you got a sense of civic pride so maybe now youd like to tell me why youre here im looking for a woman named catherine demeter i think she might have come to haven in the last week martins brow furrowed she anything to amy demeter sister i figured why do you think she might be here the last call she made from her apartment was to the home of sheriff earl lee granger she made a number of calls to your office as well the same night since then theres been no sign of her you hired to find her im just looking for her i replied neutrally martin sighed i came here from detroit six months ago he said after about a minute of silence brought my wife and child my wifes an assistant librarian i think you may have met her i nodded the governor decided there werent enough blacks in the police force here and that relations between the local minority population and the cops might not be the best so a post came up here and i applied mainly to get my kid away from detroit my father came from gretna just a ways from here i didnt know about the killings before i came here i know more now this town died along with those kids no new people came to live here and anyone with an ounce of sense or ambition got the hell out now the gene pool heres so shallow you couldnt drown a rat in it in the last month or two theres been signs that something might happen to change that theres a japanese firm interested in locating around half a mile out of town they do research and development of computer software i hear and they like the idea of privacy and a quiet little backwater they can call nippon theyd bring a lot of money to this town a lot of jobs for locals and maybe a chance to put the past to rest frankly the people here dont much care for the idea of working for the japanese but they know theyre sucking shit as it is so theyll work for anyone as long as hes not black the last thing they want is someone sniffing around ancient history digging up the past to come up with the bones of dead children they may be dumb in a lot of cases they may also be racists and shit kickers and wife beaters but theyre desperate for a second chance and theyll mess up anyone who gets in their way if they dont do it earl lee will he raised a finger and waved it purposefully in my face do you understand what im saying here nobody wants questions asked about child killings that took place thirty years ago if catherine demeter came back here and frankly i dont know why she would since she aint got no one here to come back to then she wouldnt be welcome either but she aint here because if she had come back it would be all over this town like shit on a shoe he took a sip of his coffee and gritted his teeth damn its cold he gestured to the waitress and called for a fresh mug i dont want to stay here any longer than i have to i said but i think catherine demeter may have come back here or tried to come back here she certainly wanted to talk to the sheriff and i want to talk to him too so where is he he took a couple of days leave to get out of town for a while said martin twisting the brim of his hat so that the hat spun on the vinyl seat hes due backwell he was due back today but he may leave it until tomorrow we dont have too much crime here beyond drunks and domestics and the usual shit that goes with a place like this but he may not be too pleased to see you waiting for him when he returns im not so pleased to see you myself no offense meant none taken i think ill wait around for the sheriff anyway i was also going to have to find out more about the modine killings whether martin liked it or not if catherine demeter had reached into her past then i was going to have to reach into that past too or i would understand nothing about the woman for whom i was searching ill also need to talk to someone about the killings i need to know more martin closed his eyes and ran his hand over them in weariness youre not listening to me he began no youre not listening im looking for a woman who may be in trouble and who may have turned to someone here for help before i leave town im going to find out whether or not shes here even if it means rattling every cage in this godforsaken dump and scaring your japanese saviors back to tokyo but if you help me then this can all be done quietly and ill be out of your hair in a couple of days we were both tensed now leaning toward each other across the table some of the other diners were staring at us their food ignored martin looked around at them then turned back to me again okay he said most of the people who were around then and might know something useful have either left or died or wont talk about it for love or money there are two who might though one is the son of the doc who was around at that time his names connell hyams and he has a law office in town youll have to approach him yourself the other is walt tyler his daughter was the first to die and he lives outside town ill talk to him first and maybe hell see you he stood up to leave when youve got your business done youd better leave and i never want to see your face again understand i said nothing and followed him toward the door he stopped and turned toward me placing his hat on his head as he did so one more thing he said ive had a word with those boys from the bar but remember they aint got no reason to like you frankly i can see a lot of people thinking the same way once they know why youre here and theyre going to find out so youd best step lightly while youre in town i noticed one of them i think his name was gabe had a klan shirt on i said you got much of that around here martin blew breath heavily from puffed cheeks theres no klavern but in a poor town the dumb ones always look for someone to blame for being poor there was one guyyour deputy called him cletewho didnt look so dumb martin eyed me from under his hat brim no cletes not dumb he sits on the council says the only way anyones gonna get him off it is with a gun barrel whipping you could be good for another twenty thirty votes if he had a mind to do it shit maybe hell send you a campaign badge but as for the klan this aint georgia or north carolina or even delaware dont go reading too much into this you can pay for the coffee i left a couple of bucks at the till and walked out toward the car but martin was already pulling away i noticed that hed taken his hat off again inside the car the man just didnt seem comfortable with that damn hat i went back into the diner called havens only cab operator and ordered another coffee it was after six when i got back to the motel connell hyamss office and home address were listed but when i drove by his office all the lights were out i called rudy fry at the motel and got directions for bales farm road where not only hyams but also sheriff earl lee granger had homes i drove cautiously along the winding roads looking for the concealed entrance fry had mentioned and still glancing occasionally in my mirror for any sign of the red jeep there was none i passed the entrance to bales farm road once without seeing it and had to go back over my tracks again the sign was semiobscured by undergrowth and pointed toward a winding rutted track heavy with evergreens which eventually opened out on a small but wellkept row of houses with long yards and what looked like plenty of space out back hyamss home was near the end a large twostory white wooden house a lamp blazed by a screen door which shielded a solid oak front door with a fan of frosted glass near the top there was a light on in the hallway a grayhaired man wearing a red wool cardigan over gray slacks and a striped opennecked shirt opened the inner door as i pulled up and watched me with mild curiosity mr hyams i said as i approached the door yes im an investigator my names parker i wanted to talk to you about catherine demeter he paused for a long time in silence with the screen door between us catherine or her sister he inquired eventually both i guess may i ask why im trying to find catherine i think she may have come back here hyams opened the screen door and stood aside to let me enter inside the house was furnished in dark wood with large expensivelooking mats on the floors he led me into an office at the back of the house where papers were strewn over a desk on which a computer screen glowed can i offer you a drink he asked no thank you he took a brandy glass from his desk and gestured me toward a chair at the other side before seating himself i could see him more clearly now he was grave and patrician in appearance his hands long and slim the nails finely manicured the room was warm and i could smell his cologne it smelled expensive that all took place a long time ago he began most people would rather not talk about it are you most people he shrugged and smiled i have a place in this community and a role to play ive lived here almost all my life apart from the time i spent in college and in practice in richmond my father spent fifty years practicing here and kept working until the day he died he was the doctor i understand doctor counselor legal adviser even dentist when the resident dentist wasnt around he did everything the killings hit him particularly hard he helped perform the autopsies on the bodies i dont think he ever forgot it not even in his sleep and you were you around when they took place i was working in richmond at the time so i was back and forth between haven and richmond i knew of what took place here yes but id really rather not talk about it four children died and they were terrible deaths best to let them rest now do you remember catherine demeter i knew the family yes but catherine would have been much younger than i she left after graduating from high school as i recall and i dont think she ever came back except to attend the funerals of her parents the last time she returned was probably ten years ago at the very least and her family home has been sold since then i supervised the sale why do you believe she might have come back now theres nothing here for her nothing good at any rate im not sure she made some calls to here recently and hasnt been seen since its not much to go on no i admitted its not he twisted the glass in his hand watching the amber liquid swirl his lips were pursed in appraisal but his gaze went through the glass and rested on me what can you tell me about adelaide modine and her brother i can tell you that from my point of view there was nothing about them that might have led one to suspect that they were child killers their father was a strange man a philanthropist of sorts i suppose he left most of his money tied up in a trust when he died he died before the killings five or six years before yes he left instructions that the interest on the trust fund should be divided among certain charities in perpetuity since then the number of charities receiving donations has increased considerably i should know since it is my duty to administer the trust with the assistance of a small committee and his daughter and son were they provided for very adequately i understand what happened to their money their property when they died the state brought an action to take over the property and assets we contested it on behalf of the townspeople and eventually an agreement was reached the land was sold and all assets absorbed into the trust with a portion of the trust used to fund new developments in the town that is why we have a good library our own modern sheriffs office a fine school a topclass medical center this town doesnt have much but what it does have comes from the trust what it has good or otherwise comes from four dead children i replied can you tell me anything more about adelaide and william modine hyamss mouth twitched slightly as ive said it was a long time ago and i really would prefer not to go into it i had very little to do with either of them the modines were a wealthy family their children went to a private school we didnt mix very much im afraid did your father know the family my father delivered both william and adelaide i do remember one curious thing but it will hardly be of any great help to you adelaide was one of twins the male twin died in the womb and their mother died from complications shortly after the birth the mothers death was surprising she was a strong domineering woman my father thought shed outlive us all he took a long sip from his glass and his eyes grew sharp with a remembered perception do you know anything about hyenas mr parker very little i admitted spotted hyenas frequently have twins the cubs are extremely well developed at birth they have fur and sharp incisor teeth one cub will almost invariably attack the other sometimes while still in the amniotic sac death is usually the result the victor is also typically female and if she is the daughter of a dominant female will in turn become the dominant female in the pack its a matriarchal culture female spotted hyena fetuses have higher levels of testosterone than adult males and the females have masculine characteristics even in the womb even in adulthood the sexes can be difficult to differentiate he put his glass down my father was an avid amateur naturalist the animal world always fascinated him and i think he liked to find points of comparison between the animal world and the human world and he found one in adelaide modine perhaps in some ways he was not fond of her were you here when the modines died i returned home the evening before adelaide modines body was found and i attended the autopsy call it gruesome curiosity now im sorry mr parker but i have nothing more to say and a great deal of work to do he led me to the door and pushed open the screen to let me out you dont seem particularly anxious to help me find catherine demeter mr hyams he breathed in heavily who suggested that you talk to me mr parker alvin martin mentioned your name mr martin is a good conscientious deputy and an asset to this town but he is still a comparatively recent arrival said hyams the reason why i am reluctant to talk is a matter of client confidentiality mr parker i am the only lawyer in this town at some point nearly everyone who lives here regardless of color income religious or political belief has passed through the door of my office that includes the parents of the children who died i know a great deal about what happened here mr parker more than i might wish to know and certainly much more than i plan to share with you im sorry but thats the end of the matter i see one more thing mr hyams yes he asked wearily sheriff granger lives on this road too doesnt he sheriff granger lives next door the house on the right here this house has never been burgled mr parker a fact that is surely not unconnected good night he stood at the screen door as i drove away i cast a glance at the sheriffs house as i passed but there were no lights within and there was no car in the yard as i drove back to haven raindrops began to strike the windshield and by the time i reached the outskirts of the town it had turned into a harsh ceaseless downpour the lights of the motel appeared through the rain i could see rudy fry standing at the door staring out into the woods and the gathering darkness beyond by the time i had parked fry had resumed his position behind the reception desk what do folks do around here for fun apart from trying to run other folks out of town i asked fry grimaced as he tried to separate the sarcasm from the substance of the question there aint much to do around here outside of drinking at the inn he replied after a while i tried that didnt care for it he thought for a little while longer i waited for the smell of smoke but it didnt come theres a restaurant in dorien bout twenty miles east of here milanos its called its italian he pronounced it eyetalian in a tone that suggested rudy fry was not overfond of any italian food that didnt come in a box with grease dripping from the vents never eaten there myself he sniffed as if to confirm his suspicion of all things european i thanked him then went to my room showered and changed i was getting tired of the unrelenting hostility of haven if rudy fry didnt like somewhere then that was somewhere i probably wanted to be i checked the parking lot carefully before i stepped out and then i was leaving haven behind and heading for dorien dorien wasnt much bigger than haven but it had a bookstore and a couple of restaurants which made it a cultural oasis of sorts i bought a typescript copy of e e cummings in the bookstore and wandered into milanos to eat milanos had redandwhite check tablecloths and candles set in miniatures of the colosseum but it was almost full and the food looked pretty good a slim maitre d in a red bow tie bustled over and showed me to a table in the corner where i wouldnt scare the other diners i took out the copy of cummings to reassure them and read somewhere i have never traveled while i waited for a menu enjoying the cadence and gentle eroticism of the poem susan had never read cummings before we met and i sent her copies of his poems during the early days of our relationship in a sense i let cummings do my courting for me i think i even incorporated a line of cummings into the first letter i sent her when i look back on it it was as much a prayer as a love letter a prayer that time would be gentle with her because she was very beautiful a waiter strolled over and i ordered bruschetta and a carbonara from the menu with water i cast a glance around the restaurant but no one seemed to be paying me much attention which was fine with me i had not forgotten the warning angel and louis had given to me or the couple in the red jeep the food when it arrived was excellent i was surprised at my appetite and while i ate i turned over in my mind what i had learned from hyams and the microfiche and i remembered the handsome face of walt tyler surrounded by police and i wondered too about the traveling man before forcing him from my mind along with the images that came with him then i got back in my car and returned to haven my grandfather used to say that the most terrifying sound in the world was the sound of a shell being loaded into a pumpaction shotgun a shell that was meant for you it woke me from my sleep in the motel as they came up the stairs the hands of my watch glowing the time at am they came through the door seconds later the sound of the explosions deafeningly loud in the silence of the night as shot after shot was fired into my bed sending feathers and shreds of cotton into the air like a cloud of white moths but by then i was already on my feet my gun in my hand the sound of the shots was blocked slightly by the closed connecting door just as the sound of the door opening into the hall was blocked from them even when the firing had stopped and their ears sang with the hard notes of the gun the decision not to make myself an easy target by sleeping in my assigned room had paid off i came into the hall quickly turned and aimed the man from the red jeep stood in the hall the barrel of the ithaca gauge pump close to his face even in the dim hall light i could see that there were no shell casings on the ground at his feet it had been the woman who fired the shots now he spun toward me as the woman swore from inside the room the barrel of the shotgun came down as he turned in my direction i fired one shot and a dark rose bloomed at his throat and blood fell like a shower of petals on his white shirt the shotgun dropped to the carpet as his hands clutched for his neck he folded to his knees and fell flat on the floor his body thrashing and jerking like a fish on dry ground the barrel of a shotgun appeared from behind the doorjamb and the woman fired indiscriminately into the hall plaster leaping from the walls i felt a tug at my right shoulder and then sharp white pain through my arm i tried to hold on to my gun but i lost it on the ground as the woman continued firing deadly shot zinging through the air and exploding into the walls around me i ran down the hall and through the door leading to the fire stairs tripping and tumbling down the steps as the shooting stopped i knew she would come after me as soon as she had made certain that her partner was dead if there had been any chance of him surviving i think she might have tried to save him and herself i made it to the second floor but i could hear her steps pounding on the stairs above me the pain in my arm was intense and i felt certain she would reach me before i got to the ground level i slipped through the door into the hallway plastic sheeting lay upon the ground and two stepladders stood like steeples at either wall the air was heavy with the smell of paint and thinner twenty feet from the door was a small alcove almost invisible until you were upon it which contained a fire hose and a heavy oldfashioned waterbased extinguisher there was an identical alcove near my own room i slipped into it leaning against the wall and trying to control my breathing lifting the extinguisher with my left hand i tried to hold it underneath with my right in a vain effort to use it as a weapon but my arm bleeding heavily by now was useless and the extinguisher was too awkward to be effective i heard the womans steps slowing and the door sighed softly as she moved into the hall i listened to her steps on the plastic there was a loud bang as she kicked open the door of the first room on the floor then a second bang as she repeated the exercise at the next door she was almost upon me now and though she walked softly the plastic betrayed her i could feel blood pouring down my arm and dripping from the ends of my fingers as i unwound the hose and waited for her to come she was almost level with the alcove when i swung the hose forward like a whip the heavy brass nozzle caught her in the middle of her face and i heard bone crunch she staggered back harmlessly loosing off a blast from the shotgun as she raised her left hand instinctively to her face i swung the hose again the rubber glancing against her outstretched hand while the nozzle connected with the side of her head she moaned and i slipped from the alcove as quickly as i could the brass nozzle of the hose now in my left hand and wrapped the rubber around her neck like the coils of a snake she tried to move her hand on the shotgun the stock against her thigh in an effort to pump a cartridge as blood from her battered face flowed between the fingers of her right hand i kicked hard at the gun and it fell from her hands as i pulled her tightly against my body bracing myself against the wall one leg entwined with hers so she could not pull away the other holding the hose pipe taut and there we stood like lovers the nozzle now warm with blood in my hand and the hose tight against my wrist as she struggled and then went limp in my grip when she stopped moving i released her and she slumped to the ground i unwound the hose from her neck and taking her by the hand i pulled her down the stairs to ground level her face was reddish purple and i realized i had come close to killing her but i still wanted her where i could see her rudy fry lay gray on the floor of his office blood congealing on his face and around the dent in his fractured skull i called the sheriffs office and minutes later heard the sirens and saw the redandblue glow of the lights spinning and reflecting around the darkened lobby the blood and the lights reminding me once again of another night and other deaths when alvin martin entered with his gun in his hand i was nauseous with shock and barely able to stand the red light like fire in my eyes youre a lucky man said the elderly doctor her smile a mixture of surprise and concern another couple of inches and alvin here would have been composing a eulogy i bet that would have been something to hear i replied i was sitting on a table in the emergency room of havens small but wellequipped medical center the wound in my arm was minor but had bled heavily now it had been cleaned and bandaged and my good hand clutched a bottle of painkillers i felt like id been sideswiped by a passing train alvin martin stood beside me wallace and another deputy i didnt recognize were down the hall guarding the room in which the woman was being kept she had not regained consciousness and from what i had heard of the doctors hurried conversation with martin i believed that she might have lapsed into a coma rudy fry was also still unconscious although he was expected to recover from his injuries anything on the shooters i asked martin not yet weve sent photos and prints to the feds theyre going to send someone from richmond later today the clock on the wall read am outside the rain continued to fall martin turned to the doctor could you give us a minute or two in private elise certainly dont strain him though he smiled at her as she left but when he turned back to me the smile was gone you came here with a price on your head id heard a rumor thats all fuck you and your rumor rudy fry almost died in there and ive got an unidentified corpse in the morgue with a hole in his neck you know who called out the hit i know who did it you gonna tell me no not yet anyway im not going to tell the feds either i need you to keep them off my back for a while martin almost laughed now why am i gonna do that i need to finish what i came down here to do i need to find catherine demeter this shooting have anything to do with her i dont know it could have but i dont see where she fits in i need your help martin bit his lip the town councils running wild they reckon if the japanese get wind of this theyll open up a plant in white sands before they come here everyone wants you gone in fact they want you arrested beaten then gone a nurse entered the room and martin stopped talking preferring instead to seethe quietly as she spoke theres a call for you mr parker she said a lieutenant cole from new york i winced at the pain in my arm as i rose and she seemed to take pity on me i wasnt above accepting pity at that point stay where you are she said with a smile ill bring in an extension and we can patch the call through she returned minutes later with the phone and plugged the jack into a box on the wall alvin martin hovered uncertainly for a moment beside me and then stomped out leaving me alone walter a deputy called what happened two of them tried to take me out in the motel a man and a woman how badly are you hurt a nick on the arm nothing too serious the shooters get away nope the guys dead the womans in a coma i think theyre patching in the pics and the prints at the moment anything at your end anything on jennifer i tried to block out the image of her face but it hung at the edge of my consciousness like a figure glimpsed at the periphery of ones vision the jar was spotless it was a standard medical storage jar weve tried checking the batch number with the manufacturers but they went out of business in nineteen ninetytwo well keep trying see if we can access old records but the chances are slim the wrapping paper must be sold in every damn gift shop in the country again no prints the lab is looking at skin samples to see if we can pick up anything from them technical guys figure he bounced the callno other way the cell phone could have shown a callbox numberand theres probably no way we can trace it ill let you know if theres anything further and stephen barton nothing there either the amount i know im starting to think that i may be in the wrong business he was knocked unconscious by a blow to the head like the me said and then strangled probably driven to the parking lot and tipped into the sewer the feds still looking for sonny i havent heard otherwise but i assume theyre out of luck too there doesnt seem to be much luck around at the moment itll break does kooper know what happened here i could hear what sounded like a choked laugh at the other end of the line not yet maybe ill tell him later in the morning once the name of the trust is kept out of it he should be okay but i dont know how he feels about the hired help whacking people outside motel rooms i dont imagine its happened before whats the situation at your end the natives arent exactly greeting me with open arms and leis no sign of her so far but something isnt sitting right here i cant explain it but everything feels wrong he sighed keep in touch anything i can do here i guess theres no way you can keep ross off my back none whatsoever ross couldnt dislike you more if he heard that you screwed his mother and wrote her name on the wall of the mens room hes on his way walter hung up seconds later there was a click on the line i kind of guessed deputy martin might be the cautious sort he came back in after allowing enough time to elapse so that it didnt look like hed been listening the expression on his face had changed though maybe it hadnt been such a bad thing that martin heard what he did i need to find catherine demeter i said thats why im here when thats done ill be gone he nodded i had burns call some of the motels in the area earlier he said theres no catherine demeter checked in at any of them i checked before i left the city she could be using another name i thought of that if you give me a description ill send burns around to talk to the desk clerks thanks believe me i aint doing this out of the kindness of my heart i just want to see you gone from here what about walt tyler if we get time ill drive out there with you later he went to check with the deputies guarding the shooter the elderly doctor appeared again and checked the dressing on my arm are you sure you wont rest up here for a while she asked i thanked her for the offer but turned her down i partly guessed as much she said she nodded toward the vial of painkillers they may make you drowsy i thanked her for the warning and slipped them in my pocket as she helped me to put on my jacket over my shirtless chest i had no intention of taking the painkillers her expression told me that she knew that as well martin drove me to the sheriffs office the motel had been sealed up and my clothes had been moved to a cell i showered wrapping my bandaged arm with plastic first and then slept fitfully in the cell until the rain stopped falling two federal agents arrived shortly after midday and questioned me about what had taken place the questioning was perfunctory which surprised me until i remembered that special agent ross was due to fly in later that evening the woman had still not regained consciousness by pm when martin came into the haven diner did burns turn up anything on catherine demeter burns has been tied up with the feds since this afternoon he said hed check some of the motels before calling it a day hell let me know if theres any sign of her you still want to see walt tyler wed better get going now walt tyler lived in a dilapidated but clean white clapboard house against one side of which leaned a teetering pile of car tires that were according to a sign on the road for sale other items of varying degrees of sellability that rested on the gravel and the welltrimmed lawn included two semirestored mowers various engines and parts of engines and some rusting gym equipment including a full set of bars and weights tyler himself was a tall slightly stooped man with a full head of gray hair he had been handsome once as his picture had suggested and he still held himself with a kind of looselimbed grace as if unwilling to admit that those looks were now largely gone lost to cares and worries and the neverending sorrow of a parent who has lost an only child he greeted alvin warmly enough although he shook my hand less cordially and seemed reluctant to invite us in instead he suggested that we sit on the porch despite the prospect of further rain tyler sat in a comfortablelooking wicker chair and martin and i on two ornate metal lawn chairs the lost elements of a more complete set and also according to the sign hung from the back of mine for sale without tyler making any effort to ask for it coffee was brought out in clean china cups by a woman younger than he by maybe ten years she too had been more beautiful once although in her the beauty of youth had matured into something perhaps more attractive yet the calm elegance of a woman for whom old age held no fears and in whom lines and wrinkles would alter but not erase her looks she cast a glance at tyler and for the first time since we arrived he smiled slightly she returned the smile and went back into the house we didnt see her on the porch again the deputy began to speak but tyler stopped him with a slight movement of his hand i know why youre here deputy theres only one reason why youd bring a stranger to my home he looked hard at me his eyes yellowing and rimmed with red but with an interested almost amused look in them you the fella been shooting up folks in the motel he asked and the smile flickered briefly excitin life you lead your shoulder hurt a little i was shot once in korea shot in the thigh hurt moren a little hurt like hell he winced exaggeratedly at the memory and then was quiet again i heard thunder rumble above us and the porch seemed to grow dark for a time but i could still see walt tyler looking at me and now the smile was gone mr parkers an investigator walt he used to be a detective said alvin im looking for someone mr tyler i began a woman you probably remember her her name is catherine demeter shes amy demeters younger sister i knew you werent no writer alvin wouldnt bring one o themhe searched for the wordleeches here he reached for his coffee and sipped long and quietly as if to stop himself from saying more on the subject and i thought to give him time to consider what i had said i remember her but she aint been back since her pappy died and thats bettern ten years she aint got no reason to come back here that statement was taking on the sensation of an echo still i think she did and i think it can only be connected with what happened before i replied youre one of the only ones left mr tyler you and the sheriff and one or two others the only ones involved with what took place here i think it had been a long time since he had spoken of it aloud yet i knew that no long period went by without him returning to it in his thoughts or without him being dimly or acutely aware of it like an old ache that never fades but that is sometimes forgotten in the throes of some other activity and then returns in the forgetting and i thought that each return had etched a line in his face and so a once handsome man could lose his looks like a fine marble statue being slowly chipped away to a memory of its former self i still hear her sometimes yknow can hear her step on the porch at night can hear her singing in the garden at first i used to run out when i heard her not knowing but i was sleeping or waking but i never saw her and after a while i stopped running though i still waked to her she dont come as often now perhaps he saw something in my face even in the slowdarkening evening that led him to understand i do not know for certain and he gave no sign that he knew or that there was anything more between us than a need to know and a desire to tell but he stopped for a moment in the telling and in that pause we all but touched like two travelers who pass on a long hard road and offer comfort to each other in the journey she was my only child he continued she disappeared on the way back from town on a fall day and i never saw her alive again next i saw her she was bone and paper and i didnt know her my wifemy late wifeshe reported her missing to the police but nobody came for a day or two and in that time we searched the fields and the houses and anywhere we could we walked from door to door knocking and asking but nobody could tell us where she was or where she might have been and then three days after she went a deputy came and arrested me and accused me of killing my child they held me for two days beat me called me a rapist an abuser of children but i never said anything but what i knew to be true and after a week they let me go and my little girl never appeared what was her name mr tyler her name was etta mae tyler and she was nine years old i could hear the trees whispering in the wind and the boards of the house creaking and settling in the yard a childs swing moved back and forth as the wind caught it it seemed that there was movement all around us as we spoke as if our words had awoken something that had been asleep for a long time two other children disappeared three months later black children both one within a week of the other cold it was folks thought the first child dora lee parker might have fallen through some ice while playing she was the very devil for ice that child but all the rivers were searched all the ponds dredged and they didnt find her the police they came and questioned me again and for a while even some of my own neighbors looked at me kinda funny but then the polices interest all died away again these were black children and they saw no reason to go connectin the two vanishings the third child didnt come from haven he came from otterville about forty miles away nother black child little boy namedhe stopped and put the palm of his hand to his forehead pressing lightly his eyes closed tightbobby joiner he finished quietly nodding slightly by then people was getting scared and a deputation was sent to the sheriff and the mayor people started keeping their children inside specially after dark and the police they questioned every black man for miles around and some white folks too poor men they knew to be homosexuals mostly i think then there was a waiting period those people waited for the black folks to breathe easy again to get careless but they did not it went on and on for months till early in nineteen seventy then the little demeter girl disappeared and everything changed the police they questioned people for miles around took statements organized searches but nobody saw a thing it was like the little girl had disappeared into thin air things got bad then for black folks the police figured there might be a connection between the disappearances after all and they called in the fbi after that black men walking around town after dark were liable to get arrested or beaten or both but those people he used the phrase again and there was a kind of mental shake of the head in his voice a gesture of horror at the ways of men those people had a taste for what they were doing and couldnt stop the woman tried to snatch a little boy in batesville but she was alone and the boy fought and kicked and scratched her face and ran away she chased after him too but then she gave up she knew what was coming the boy was a sharp one he remembered the make of the car described the woman even recalled some of the numbers on the license plate but it wasnt till the next day that someone else recalled the car and they went looking for adelaide modine the police no not the police a mob of men some from haven others from batesville two or three from yancey mill the sheriff he was out of town when it happened and the fbi men had left but deputy earl lee granger as was he was with them when they arrived at the modine house but she was gone there was only the brother there and he shut himself in the basement but they broke in he was silent then and i heard him swallow in the gathering dark and i knew that he had been with them he said he didnt know where his sister was didnt know nothing about no dead children so they hanged him from a beam in the roof and called it suicide got doc hyams to certify it though that basement was fourteen feet from floor to ceiling and there was no way that boy could have gotten up there to hang hisself less he could climb walls folks after used to joke that the modine boy wanted to hang hisself real bad to get up without help but you said the woman was alone when she tried to snatch the last child i said how did they know the modine boy was involved they didnt at least they werent sure but she needed someone to help her do what she did a child is a hard thing to take sometimes they struggle and kick and cry for help thats why she failed the last time because she had nobody to help her at least thats what they figured and you the porch was quiet again i knew that boy and he wasnt no killer he was weak andsoft he was a homosexualhed been caught with some boy back in his private school and they asked him to leave my sister heard that when she was cleaning for white folks in the town it was hushed up though there were stories about him i think maybe some people had suspected him for a while just for that when his sister tried to take the child well folks just decided he must have known and he must have i guess or maybe suspected at least i dont know but he glanced at deputy martin and the deputy stared right back at him go on walt theres some things i know myself you wont say anything i havent thought or guessed tyler still looked uneasy but nodded once more to himself than to us and went on deputy earl lee he knew the boy wasnt involved he was with him the night bobby joiner was taken other nights too i looked at alvin martin who stared at the floor nodding slowly how did you know i asked i saw em he said simply their cars were parked out of town under some trees on the night bobby joiner was taken i used to walk the fields sometimes to get away from here though it was dangerous given all that was happenin i saw the cars parked and crept up and saw them the modine boy wasdownon the sheriff and then they got in the back and the sheriff took him and you saw them together after that same place couple of times and the sheriff let them hang the boy he wasnt going to say nothin tyler spat case someone found out about him and he watched them hang that boy and his sister what about adelaide modine they searched for her too searched the house and then the fields but she was gone then someone saw a fire in the shell of an old house on the east road about ten miles from town and pretty soon the whole place was ablaze thomas becker he used to store old paint and inflammables there away from the children and when the fire was out they found a body badly burned and they said it was adelaide modine how did they identify her martin answered there was a bag near the body with the remains of a lot of money some personal papers bank account details mostly jewelry she was known to have was found on the body a gold and diamond bracelet she always wore it was her mothers they said dental records matched too old doc hyams produced her chart he shared a surgery with the dentist but the dentist was out of town that week seems she had holed up maybe waiting for her brother or someone else to come to her and fell asleep with a cigarette in her hand shed been drinking they said maybe to try to keep warm the whole place went up her car was found nearby with a bag of clothes in the trunk do you remember anything about adelaide modine mr tyler anything that might explain explain what he interrupted explain why she did it explain why someone helped her to do what she did i cant explain those things not even to myself she had somethin sure enough somethin strong inside her but it was a dark thing a vicious thing ill tell you somethin mr parker adelaide modine was as close to pure evil as ive met on this earth and ive seen brothers hanged from trees and burned while they were hangin adelaide modine was worse than the people who did the hangin because try as i might i cant see any reason for the things she did theyre beyond explainin less you believe in the devil and hell thats the only way i can explain her she was a thing out of hell i stayed silent for a while trying to sort and balance what i had been told walt tyler watched while these thoughts went through my head and i think he knew what i was thinking i couldnt blame him for not telling what he knew of the sheriff and the modine boy an allegation like that could get a man killed and it didnt provide conclusive proof that the modine boy wasnt directly involved in the killings although if tyler s character assessment was right then william modine was an unlikely child killer but the knowledge that someone involved in the death of his child might have eluded capture must have tortured tyler all these years one part of the story still remained they found the children the next day just as the search had begun concluded tyler a boy out hunting took shelter in an abandoned house on the modine estate and his dog started scraping at the cellar door it was built into the floor like a trapdoor the boy shot the lock off and the dog went down and he followed then he ran home and called the police there were four bodies down there my little girl and the three others they he stopped and his face creased but he did not cry you dont have to go on i said softly no you gotta know he said then louder like the cry of a wounded animal youve gotta know what they did what they did to those children to my child my little girl all her fingers were broken crushed and the bones pulled away from the sockets he was crying openly now his large hands open before him like a supplicant before god how could they do those things to children how and then he seemed to retreat into himself and i thought i saw the womans face at the window and her fingertips brushing the pane we sat with him for a while and then stood up to leave mr tyler i said gently just one more thing where is the house where the children were found about three four miles up the road from here the old modine estate starts there theres a stone cross at the start of the track leading up to it the house is pretty much gone now theres just a few walls part of a roof state wanted to knock it down but some of us protested we wanted to remind them of what had happened here so the dane house still stands we left him then but as i was going down the porch steps i heard his voice behind me mr parker the voice was strong again and there was no quaver in it although there was the lingering sound of grief in its tones i turned to look at him mr parker this is a dead town the ghosts of dead children haunt it you find the demeter girl you tell her to go back where she came from theres only grief and misery for her here you tell her that now you tell her that when you find her yhear at the margins of his cluttered garden the whispering grew in the trees and it seemed that just beyond the line of vision where the darkness became almost too dark to penetrate there was movement figures drifted back and forth skipping just outside the light from the house and there was childish laughter in the air and then there were only the limbs of evergreens fanning the darkness and the empty jangling of a chain in the wreckage of the yard on the casuarina coast of indonesian new guinea lives a tribe called the asmat they are twenty thousand strong and the terror of every other tribe near them in their language asmat means the people the human beings and if they define themselves as the only humans then all others are relegated to the status of nonhuman with all that that entails the asmat have a word for these others they call them manowe it means the edible ones hyams had no answers that would have indicated why adelaide modine behaved as she did and neither did walt tyler maybe she and others like her had something in common with the asmat maybe they too saw others as less than human so that their suffering ceased to matter was below notice apart from the pleasure it gave i recalled a conversation with woolrich after the meeting with tante marie aguillard back in new orleans we walked in silence down royal street past madame lelauries old mansion where slaves were once chained and tortured in the attic until some firefighters found them and a mob ran madame lelaurie out of town we ended up at tee evas on magazine where woolrich ordered sweet potato pie and a jax beer he ran his thumb down the side of the bottle clearing a path through the moisture and then rubbed his damp thumb along his upper lip i read a bureau report last week he began i guess it was a state of the nation address on serial killers on where we stand where were goin and where are we going were goin to hell is where were goin these people are like bacteria spreading and this country is just one big petri dish to them the bureau reckons we could be losing a couple of thousand victims a year to them the folks watching oprah and jerry springer or subscribin to jerry falwell they dont wanna know that they read about them in the crime mags or see them on the tv but thats only when we catch one of them the rest of the time they dont have the least idea whats goin on around them he took a deep swig of jax there are at least two hundred of these killers operating at the present time at least two hundred he was reeling off the numbers now emphasizing each statistic with a stab of the beer bottle nine out of ten are male eight out of ten are white and one in five is never goin to be found never and you know what the strangest thing is weve got more of them than anywhere else the good old us of a is breedin these fuckers like fuckin elmo dolls threequarters of them live and work in this country were the worlds leading producer of serial killers its a sign of sickness is what it is were sick and weak and these killers are like a cancer inside us the faster we grow the quicker they multiply and you know the more of us there are the more distant from each other we become were practically livin on top of each other but were further away from each other in every other way than weve ever been before and then these guys come in with their knives and their ropes and theyre even further removed than the rest of us some of them even have cops instincts they can sniff each other out we found a guy in angola in february who was communicating with a suspected killer in seattle using biblical codes i dont know how these two freaks found each other but they did strange thing is most of them are even worse off than the rest of humanity theyre inadequatesexually emotionally physically whateverand theyre taking it out on those they see around them they have nohe shook his hands in the air searching for the wordno vision they have no larger vision of what theyre doing theres no purpose to it its just an expression of some kind of fatal flaw and the people theyre killing theyre so dumb that they cant understand whats happening around them these killers should be a wakeup call but nobodys listening and that widens the gap even more all they see is the distance and they reach across it and pick us off one by one all we can do is hope that if they do it often enough well spot the pattern and put together a link between us and them a bridge across the distance he finished his beer and raised the bottle up calling for another its the distance he said his eyes on the street but his gaze beyond it the distance between life and death heaven and hell us and them they have to cross it to get close enough to us to take us but its all a matter of distance they love the distance and it seemed to me as rain poured down on the window that adelaide modine the traveling man and the others like them who roamed the country were all united by this distance from the common crowd of humanity they were like small boys who torture animals or take fish from tanks to watch them squirm and gasp in their death throes yet adelaide modine seemed even worse than so many of the others for she was a woman and to do what she had done not only went against law and morality and whatever other titles we give to the common bonds that hold us together and prevent us from tearing each other apart it went against nature too a woman who kills a child seems to bring out something in us that exceeds revulsion or horror it brings a kind of despair a lack of faith in the foundations upon which we have built our lives for we believe that women should not take the life of a child just as lady macbeth begged to be unsexed so as to kill the old king so also a woman who killed a child appeared to be denatured a being divorced from her sex adelaide modine was like milton s night hag lured with the smell of infant blood i cannot countenance the death of children the killing of a child seems to bring with it the death of hope the death of the future i recall how i used to listen to jennifer breathe how i used to watch the rise and fall of my infant daughters chest how i felt a sense of gratitude of relief with every inhalation and exhalation when she cried i would lull her to sleep in my arms waiting for the sobs to fade into the soft rhythms of rest and when she was at last quiet i would bend down slowly carefully my back aching from the strain of the position and lay her in her crib when she was taken from me it was like the death of a world an infinite number of futures coming to an end i felt a weight of despair upon me as the motel drew closer hyams had said that he had seen nothing in the modines that would have indicated the depths of evil that existed within them walt tyler if what he had said was true saw that evil only in adelaide modine she had lived among these people had grown up with them perhaps even played with them had sat with them in church had watched them marry have children and then had preyed upon them and no one had suspected her i think that what i wanted was a power i could not have the power to perceive evil the ability to look at the faces in a crowded room and see the signs of depravity and corruption the thought sparked a memory of a killing in new york state some years before in which a thirteenyearoldboy had killed a younger kid in the woods beating him to death with rocks it was the words of the killers grandfather that had stayed with me my god he said i should have been able to see somehow there should have been something to see are there any pictures of adelaide modine i asked eventually martins brow furrowed there may be one in the files of the original investigation the library may have some stuff too theres a kind of town archive stored in its basement yknow yearbooks photos from the paper there may be something in there why dyou ask curiosity she was responsible for so much of what happened to this town but i find it hard to picture her maybe i want to see what her eyes looked like martin shot me a puzzled look i can get laurie to look in the library archives ill try to get burns to look through our own files but it could take a while theyre all packed in boxes and the filing system is pretty obscure some of the files arent even in date order its a lot of work to satisfy your idle curiosity id appreciate it anyway martin made a sound in his throat but didnt say anything else for a while then as the motel appeared on our right he pulled over to the side of the road about earl lee he said go on the sheriffs a good man he held this town together after the modine killings from what i hear him and doc hyams and a couple of others hes a fair man and ive no complaints about him if what tyler said is true maybe you should have martin nodded thats as may be if hes right then the sheriffs got to live with what hes done hes a troubled man mr parker troubled by the past by himself i dont envy him anything but his strength he spread his hands wide and shrugged slightly part of me figures that you should stay here and talk to him when he comes back but another part of me the smart part tells me that it would be better for all of us if you finished up your business as quickly as you can and then got out have you heard from him no i havent he had some leave coming to him and maybe hes a little overdue on returning but i aint gonna hold that against him hes a lonely man a man who likes the company of other men aint gonna find much comfort here no i said as the neon light of the welcome inn flickered beyond us i guess not the call came through almost as soon as martin pulled away from the curb there had been a death at the medical center the unidentified woman who had tried to kill me the previous night when we arrived two cruisers were blocking the entrance to the parking lot and i could see the two fbi men talking together at the door martin drove us through and as we got out of the car the two agents moved toward me in unison their guns drawn easy easy shouted martin he was with me the whole time put them away boys were detaining him until agent ross arrives said one of the agents whose name was willox you aint detaining or arresting nobody not until we find out whats going on here deputy im warning you youre out of your league here wallace and burns came out of the medical center at that point alerted by the shouts to their credit they moved to martins side their hands hanging close by their guns like i said let it go said martin quietly the feds looked like they might push the issue but then they holstered their weapons and moved back agent ross is going to hear of this hissed willox to martin but the deputy just walked by wallace and burns walked with us to the room in which the woman had been kept what happened asked martin wallace turned bright red and started blabbering shit alvin there was a disturbance outside the center and what kind of disturbance a fire in the engine of a car belonged to one of the nurses i couldnt figure it out there werent nobody in it and she hadnt used it since she got in this morning i only left the door here for maybe five minutes when i got back she was like this we arrived at the womans room through the open door i could see the pale waxy pallor of her skin and the blood on the pillow beside her left ear something metal ending in a wooden handle glinted in the ear the window through which the killer had entered was still open and the glass had been shattered in order to unhook the latch a small sheet of sticky brown paper lay on the floor with glass adhering to it whoever had killed the woman had taken the trouble to stick it to the window before breaking the glass in order to muffle the sound and to ensure that the glass didnt make any noise when it hit the floor whos been in here apart from you the doctor a nurse and the two feds said wallace the elderly doctor called elise appeared behind us she looked shaken and weary what happened to her said martin a blade of some kindi think its an ice pickwas thrust through her ear and into her brain she was dead when we got to her left the pick in her mused martin clean and easy i said nothing to tie the killer to what happened if heor shegets picked up martin turned his back on me and began consulting the other deputies i moved away as they talked and made my way toward the mens washroom wallace looked back at me and i made a gagging expression he looked away with contempt in his eyes i spent five seconds in the washroom and then slipped out of the center through the rear exit time was running out for me i knew martin would try to grill me on the source of the hit agent ross wasnt far behind at the very least hed hold me until he got the information he wanted and any hope i might have of finding catherine demeter would disappear i made my way back to the motel where my car was still parked and drove out of haven the road to the ruin of the dane house was little more than two mud tracks and the car moved along them only with a great effort as if nature itself was conspiring against my approach it had started to rain heavily again and the wind and rain combined to render the wipers almost useless i strained my eyes for the stone cross and took the turning opposite i missed the house the first time realizing my mistake only when the road turned into a mass of mud and fallen rotting trees forcing me to reverse slowly back the way i had come until i spotted two small ruined pillars to my left and between them the almost roofless walls of the dane house briefly silhouetted against the dark sky i pulled up outside the empty eyes of the windows and the gaping mouth of what was once the door pieces of its lintel strewn on the ground like old teeth i took the heavy maglite from under my seat and climbed out the rain painful on my head as i ran for what little shelter the interior of the ruin could offer over half of the roof was gone and in the flashlight beam what remained still showed blackened and charred there were three rooms what had once been a kitchen and eating area identifiable from the remains of an ancient stove in one corner the main bedroom now empty except for a stained mattress around which old prophylactics were scattered like the discarded skins of snakes and a smaller room which might have served as a childrens bedroom once but was now a mass of old timber and rusting metal bars dotted with paint tins left there by someone too lazy to haul them to the municipal dump the rooms smelled of old wood of longextinct fires and human excrement an old couch stood in one corner of the kitchen its springs flowering through the rotting cushions it formed a triangle with the corners of the wall upon which the remains of some faded floral wallpaper hung tenaciously i shined the flashlight over the back of the couch my hand resting on the edge it felt damp but not wet for the remains of part of the roof still sheltered it from the worst of the elements behind the couch and almost flush with the corners of the house was what appeared to be a trapdoor some three feet at each side it was locked and its edges seemed filthy and choked with dirt its hinges were bloodied with rust and pieces of wood and old metal covered most of its surface i pulled back the couch to take a closer look and started as i heard a rat scurry across the floor at my feet it melted into the darkness in a far corner of the room and then was still i squatted down to examine the lock and bolt using my knife to scrape away some of the filth from around the keyhole new steel shone through beneath the dirt i ran the blade of the knife along the bolt exposing a line of steel that shone like molten silver in the darkness i tried the same experiment with the hinge but only flakes of rust greeted me i examined the bolt more closely what had appeared at first sight to be rust now looked more like varnish carefully applied so that it would blend in with the door the bolts battered look could easily have been achieved by dragging it behind a car for a while it wasnt a bad job designed as it was to fool only necking teenagers seeking a thrill in a house of the dead or children daring each other to tempt the ghosts of other children long gone i had a crowbar in the car but i was reluctant to brave the driving rain again as i shined the flashlight around the room a steel bar some two feet long was caught in the beam i picked it up felt its weight inserted it in the u of the lock and jimmied for a moment it seemed the bar might bend or fracture under the strain and then there was a sharp crack as the lock broke i pulled it free released the bolt and raised the door on its complaining hinges a rich heady stench of decay rose from the cellar causing my stomach to churn i covered my mouth and moved away but seconds later i was vomiting by the couch my nostrils filled with my own smell and the odor from the cellar below when i had recovered and breathed in some fresh air outside the house i ran to the car and took the window rag from the dashboard i sprayed it with defogger from the glove compartment and tied it around my mouth the defogger made my head reel but i stuck it in the pocket of my coat in case i needed it again and reentered the house even though i breathed through my mouth tasting the spray the smell of putrefaction was overpowering i descended the wooden stairs carefully my strong left hand on the rail and the maglite in my right with the beam shining at my feet i didnt want to trip on a ruined step and plunge into the darkness below at the base of the steps the flashlight beam caught a glint of metal and bluegray material a heavyset man in his sixties lay near the steps his knees curled beneath him and his hands cuffed behind his back his face was graywhite and there was a wound on his forehead a ragged hole like a dark exploding star for a moment as i shined the flashlight upon it i thought it was an exit wound but moving the light to the back of his head i saw the hole in his skull gape saw the decaying matter within and the white totem of his spine the gun had probably been pressed right against his head there was some gunpowder smudging around the forehead wound and the starshaped rip had been caused by the gases shooting under the skin next to the bone expanding and tearing open the forehead as they exploded the bullet had exited messily taking most of the back of his skull with it the contact wound also explained the unusual position of the body he had been shot while kneeling looking up into the muzzle of the gun as it approached and falling sideways and back when the bullet entered inside his jacket was a wallet with a drivers license identifying him as earl lee granger catherine demeter lay slumped against the far wall of the basement nearly opposite the stairs granger had probably seen her as he walked or was pushed down she was slumped like a doll at the wall her legs spread out before her and her hands resting palms up on the floor one leg was bent at an unnatural angle broken below the knee and i guessed that she had been thrown down the cellar stairs and dragged to the wall she had been shot once in the face at close range dried blood brain tissue and bone fragments surrounded her head like a bloody halo on the wall both bodies had begun to decay rapidly in the cellar which seemed to stretch the length and breadth of the house there were blisters on catherine demeters skin and fluid leaked from her nose and eyes spiders and millipedes scuttled across her face and slipped through her hair hunting the bugs and mites that were already feeding on the body flies buzzed i guessed she had been dead for two or three days i took a quick look around the cellar but it was empty apart from bundles of rotting newspaper some cardboard boxes filled with old clothes and a pile of warped timbers the detritus of lives lived long before and now no more a scuffling noise on the floor above me the sound of wood shifting despite careful footsteps made me turn quickly and run for the stairs whoever was above me heard me for the steps now moved quicker with no regard for any noise that might be made as my feet hit the first stairs the sound of the trapdoor hinges greeted me and i saw the patch of starstudded sky begin to shrink as the door came down two shots were fired randomly through the gap and i heard them impact on the wall behind me the trapdoor was almost to the floor when i jammed the maglite into the gap there was a grunt from above and then i felt the flashlight being kicked repeatedly so that i had to grip it firmly to prevent it being wrenched from my hand still the bellshaped end held firm but my injured right shoulder ached from the strain of pushing up and holding the flashlight above me the entire weight of my assailant was on the trapdoor as he continued to aim kicks at the flashlight below i thought i heard the sound of rats scurrying in alarm but faced with the prospect of being trapped in that cellar i thought it might be something else i felt that i might yet hear the sound of catherine demeter dragging her shattered leg across the floor and up the wooden steps that her white fingers might grip my leg and pull me down to her i had failed her i could not protect her from the violent end in this cellar where four young children before her had met muffled terrified deaths she had returned to the place where her sister had perished and in a strange circularity she had reenacted a death that she had probably replayed many times in her mind before that day in the moments before she died she gained an insight into her sisters awful end and so she would keep me company console me for my weakness and my helplessness in the face of her passing and lie beside me as i died as i breathed through gritted teeth the stench of decay felt like a dead hand over my mouth and nostrils i felt vomit rising once again and forced it down for if i stopped pushing even for a moment i felt sure i would die in this cellar momentarily the pressure above me eased and i pushed upward with all my remaining strength it was an error that my opponent exploited to the full the torch was kicked once hard and slipped through the enlarged gap the trapdoor slammed shut like the door of my tomb its echo mocking me from the walls of the cellar i groaned in despair and began to press futilely against the door once again when there was an explosion from above and the pressure eased entirely the trapdoor shooting upward and coming to rest flat on the floor i flung myself out my hand inside my jacket reaching for my gun and the flashlight beam casting wild shadows on the ceilings and walls as i landed awkwardly and painfully on the floor the beam caught the lawyer connell hyams leaning against the wall just beyond the rim of the trapdoor his left hand to his wounded shoulder while his right hand tried to raise his gun his suit was soaked and his clean white shirt clung to his body like a second skin i held him in the flashlight beam my gun outstretched in the other hand dont i said but the gun was rising now and his mouth curled into a snarl of fear and pain as he brought it up to fire two shots sounded neither of them was from hyams he jerked as each bullet hit and his gaze moved from me to a place over my shoulder as he fell i was already turning the gun still following the beam of the flashlight through the glassless window i caught a glimpse of a thin besuited figure fading into the dark its limbs like sheathed blades and a scar running across its narrow cadaverous features maybe i should have called martin then and let the police and the fbi handle the rest i was sick and weary inside and an almost overpowering sense of loss tore through me and threatened to unman me the death of catherine demeter was like a physical pain so that i lay for a moment on the ground the body of connell hyams slumped opposite and clutched my stomach in agony i could hear the sound of a car as bobby sciorra drove away it was that sound that caused me to scramble to my feet it had been sciorra who had killed the assassin in the medical center probably under orders from the old man in case she implicated sonny in the hit yet i couldnt understand why he had killed hyams and why he had let me live i staggered to my car my shoulder aching and started to drive toward hyamss house as i drove i tried to piece together what had taken place catherine demeter had returned to haven in an effort to contact granger and hyams had intervened maybe he had learned of catherines presence here by chance the other possibility was that someone had informed him that she was coming and had urged him to ensure that she never spoke to anyone when she got here hyams had killed catherine and granger that much seemed certain at a guess i reckoned that he had watched for the sheriffs return and followed him into his house if hyams had a key to the sheriffs housewhich since he was a neighbor and a trusted citizen was a likely possibility hyams could have listened to the messages on the sheriffs machine himself and through that could have learned of catherine demeters location catherine demeter had been dead before the sheriff returned the proof grangers body had not decayed to the same extent as demeters hyams might even have erased the messages but he couldnt be certain that granger had not picked them up by remote contact through a touchtone phone either way hyams couldnt take any chances and acted probably knocking the sheriff unconscious before cuffing him and then taking him to the dane house where he had already killed catherine demeter the sheriffs car his own dodge had probably been dumped or driven to another town and left somewhere it wouldnt attract undue attention at least for the time being the use of the dane house pointed to another part of the puzzle connell hyams was almost certainly adelaide modines accomplice in the killings the man for whom william modine had been hanged that raised the question of why he had been forced to act now and i believed that i was close to an answer to that too although it was a possibility that made me sick to my stomach hyamss house was dark when i arrived there was no other car parked nearby but i kept my gun in my hand as i approached the door the thought of facing bobby sciorra in the darkness made my skin crawl and my hands shook as i used the keys i had taken from hyamss body to open the door inside the house was silent i went from room to room my heart pounding my finger on the trigger of the gun the house was empty there was no sign of bobby sciorra i went through to hyamss office pulled the curtains and turned on the desk light his computer was password protected but a man like hyams would have to keep hard copies of all his documents i wasnt even sure what i was looking for except that it was something that would connect hyams to the ferrera family the connection seemed almost absurd and i was tempted to give up the search and return to haven and explain it all to martin and agent ross the ferreras were many things but they were not the consorts of child killers the key to hyamss filing cabinets was also on the set i had taken from his body i worked fast ignoring local files and others that seemed irrelevant or unrelated there were no files for the trust which seemed extraordinary until i remembered his office in town and my heart sank if the trust files were not kept in the house there was a possibility that other files were not here either if that was the case the search could prove fruitless in the end i almost passed over the link and only some halfremembered italian phrases caused me to stop and consider it it was a rental agreement for a warehouse property in flushing queens signed by hyams on behalf of a company called circe the agreement was over five years old and had been made with a firm called mancino inc mancino i remembered meant lefthanded in italian it derived from another word meaning deceitful it was sonny ferreras idea of a joke sonny was lefthanded and mancino inc was one of a number of paper companies established by sonny in the early part of the decade when he had not yet been reduced to the level of a sick dangerous joke in the ferrera operation i left the house and started driving as i reached the town limits i saw a pickup by the side of the road two figures sat in the back drinking beer from cans enclosed in brown paper bags while a third stood leaning against the cab with his hands in his pockets the headlights identified the standing man as clete and one of the seated figures as gabe the third was a thin bearded man whose face i didnt recognize i caught cletes eye as i passed and saw gabe lean toward him and start talking but clete just raised a hand as i drove away i could see him staring after me caught in the headlights of the pickup a dark shadow against the light i felt almost sorry for him havens chances of becoming little tokyo had just taken a terminal beating i didnt call martin until i reached charlottesville its parker i said anybody near you im in my office and youre in deep shit whyd you run out like that ross is here and wants all our asses but your ass especially man when earl lee gets back theres gonna be hell to pay listen to me grangers dead so is catherine demeter i think hyams killed them hyams martin almost shrieked the name the lawyer youre out of your mind hyams is dead too it was starting to sound like a sick joke except i wasnt laughing he tried to kill me out at the dane house the bodies of granger and catherine demeter were dumped in the cellar there i found them and hyams tried to lock me in there was some shooting and hyams died theres another player the guy who took out the woman in the medical center i didnt want to bring sciorras name into it not yet martin was silent for a moment you gotta come in where are you its not finished youve got to hold them off for me i aint holding anyone off this town is turning into a morgue because of you and now youre a suspect in i dont know how many murders come in you got enough trouble coming to you already im sorry i cant do that listen to me hyams killed demeter to prevent her contacting granger i think hyams was adelaide modines accomplice in the child killings if thats the case if he escaped then she could have escaped too he could have rigged her death he had access to her dental records through his fathers office he could have switched a set of records from another woman maybe a migrant worker maybe someone snatched from another town i dont know but something made catherine demeter run something sent her back here i think she saw her i think she saw adelaide modine because theres no other reason why she would have come back here why she would have contacted granger after all these years away there was silence at the other end of the phone ross looks like a volcano in a linen suit hes going to be onto you he got your plates from your motel registration i need your help you say hyams was involved yes why i had burns check our files didnt take as long as i thought it would earl lee has had the file relating to the killings he used to check it out every so often hyams came looking for it day before yesterday my guess is that if you find it any photos will be gone i think hyams probably searched the sheriffs house for it he had to eliminate any traces of adelaide modine anything that might link her to her new identity it is hard to disappear a trail of paper of public and private records follows us from birth for most of us they define what we are to the state the government the law but there are ways to disappear obtain a new birth certificate maybe from a death index or by using someone elses birth name and dob and age the cert by carrying it around in your shoe for a week apply for a library card and from that obtain a voters registration card head for the nearest dmv clerk flash the birth certificate and the vrc and you now have a drivers license its a domino effect each step based on the validity of the documents obtained in the preceding step the easiest way of all is to take on anothers identity someone who wont be missed someone from the margins my guess was that with hyamss help adelaide modine took on the identity of the girl who burned to death in a virginia ruin theres more said martin there was a separate file on the modines the photos from that are all gone as well could hyams have got access to those files i could hear martin sigh at the other end of the phone sure he said eventually he was the town lawyer he was trusted by everyone check the motels again i reckon youll find catherine demeters belongings in one of them there might be something there man you gotta come back here sort this out theres a lot of bodies here and your name is connected with all of them i cant do any more than ive done already just do what you can im not coming in i hung up and tried another number yeah answered a voice angel its bird where the fuck have you been things are going down here are you on the cell phone call me back on a landline i called him back seconds later from a phone outside a convenience store some of the old mans goons have picked up pili pilar theyre holding him until bobby sciorra gets back from some trip its bad hes being held in isolation at the ferrera placeanyone talks to him and they get it in the head only bobby gets access to him did they get sonny no hes still out there but hes alone now hes gonna have to sort whatever it is out with his old man im in trouble angel i explained to him briefly what had taken place im coming back but i need something from you and louis just ask man i gave him the address of the warehouse watch the place ill meet you there as soon as i can i didnt know how long it would take them to start tracking me i drove as far as richmond and parked the mustang in a longterm parking garage then i made some calls for fifteen hundred dollars i bought silence and a flight on a small plane from a private airfield back to the city you sure you wanna be dropped here the cabdriver was a huge man his hair lank with sweat which dribbled down his cheeks and over the rolls of fat in his neck eventually losing itself in the greasy collar of his shirt he seemed to fill the whole front of the cab the door looked too small for him to have entered through he gave the impression that he had lived and eaten in the cab for so long that it was no longer possible for him to leave the cab was his home his castle and his bulk gave the impression that it would be his tomb im sure i replied this is a tough area thats okay i have tough friends the morelli wine warehouse was one of a number of similar premises that lined one side of a long illlit street west of northern boulevard in flushing it was a redbrick building its name reduced to a white flaking shadow below the edge of its roof wire screens covered the windows on both the ground and upper levels there were no visible lights on the walls the area between the gate and the main building was in almost total darkness on the other side of the street stood the entrance to a large yard filled with storage depots and railroad containers the ground inside was pitted with ponds of filthy water and discarded pallets i saw a mongrel dog its ribs almost bursting through its fur tearing at something in the dim light of the lots filthy spotlights as i stepped from the cab headlights flashed briefly from the alleyway by the warehouse seconds later as the cab pulled away angel and louis emerged from the black chevy van angel carrying a heavylooking training bag louis immaculate in a black leather coat a black suit and a black polo shirt angel screwed up his face as he drew nearer it wasnt hard to see why my suit was torn and covered with mud and dirt from the encounter with hyams in the dane house my arm had begun to bleed again and the right cuff of my shirt was a deep red color i ached all over and i was tired of death you look good said angel wheres the dance i looked toward the morelli warehouse in there have i missed anything not here louis just got back from ferreras place though bobby sciorra arrived there about an hour ago by chopper said louis reckon him and pili are having a real hearttoheart i nodded lets go i said the warehouse was surrounded by a high brick wall topped with barbed wire and spiked fencing the gate inset slightly as the wall curved inward at the entrance was also wire topped and solid except for a gap where a heavy lock and chain linked its two halves together while louis lounged semidiscreetly nearby angel removed a small custombuilt drill from his bag and inserted the bit into the lock he pressed the trigger and a highpitched grinding sound seemed to fill the night instantly every dog in the vicinity started to bark shit angel you got a fuckin whistle built into that thing hissed louis angel ignored him and moments later the lock fell open we entered and angel gingerly removed the lock and placed it inside the gate he replaced the chain so that to a casual observer it would still appear secure if oddly locked from the inside the warehouse dated from the thirties but would have appeared functional even then old doors at the right and left sides had been sealed shut leaving only one way in at the front even the fire exit at the back had been welded in place the security lights which might once have lit up the yard now no longer functioned and the illumination from the streetlights did not penetrate the darkness here angel went to work on the lock with a selection of picks a small flashlight in his mouth and less than a minute later we were in lighting our heavy mags as we went a small booth which was probably once occupied by a security guard or watchman when the building was in use stood directly inside the door empty shelves stretched along the walls of the room paralleled by similar shelving through the center creating two aisles the shelves were separated into alcoves each sufficient to hold a bottle of wine the floor was stone this had originally been the display area where visitors could examine the stock below in the cellars was where the cases were kept at the far end of the room stood a raised office reached by three stairs to the right beside the small flight of stairs up to the office a larger staircase descended down there was also an old freight elevator unlocked angel stepped in and pulled the lever and the lift descended a foot or two he brought it back to its original level stepped out again and raised an eyebrow at me we started down the stairs there were four flights the equivalent of two stories but there were no other floors between the shop floor and the cellars at the base was another locked door this one wooden with a glass window through which the flashlight beam revealed the cellars arches i left angel to the lock it took him seconds to open the door he looked ill at ease entering the cellars the training bag appeared suddenly heavy in his hand want me to take that for a while asked louis when im that old youll be feeding me through a straw replied angel although the cellars were cool he licked at sweat on his upper lip practically feeding you through a straw already muttered the voice from behind us in the basement a series of curved cavelike alcoves stretched away before us each had bars running vertically down from ceiling to floor with a gate set in the middle they were the old storage bins for the wine they were obviously disused strewn with litter the flashlight beams caught the edge of the floor of one bin that differed from the others it was the one nearest us on the right bare earth showing where the cement floor had been removed its gate stood ajar our footsteps echoed around the stone walls as we approached inside the floor was clean and the dirt neatly raked in one corner was a green metal table with two slits on either side through which ran leather restrainers in another corner stood a large industrialsized roll of what appeared to be plastic sheeting two layers of shelving ran around the walls they were empty except for a bundle tightly wrapped in plastic that had been tucked in against the far wall i walked toward it and the beam of the flashlight caught denim and a green check shirt a pair of small shoes and a mop of hair a discolored face whose skin had cracked and burst with a pair of open eyes the corneas milky and cloudy the smell of decay was strong but dulled somewhat by the plastic i recognized the clothing i had found evan baines the child who had disappeared from the barton estate sweet jesus i heard angel say louis was silent i drew closer to the body checking the fingers and face apart from natural decay the body was undamaged and the boys clothing appeared undisturbed evan baines had not been tortured before he died but there was some heavier discoloration at his temple and there was dried blood in his ear the fingers of his left hand were splayed against his chest but his small right hand had formed into a tightly closed fist angel come here bring the bag he stood beside me and i saw the anger and despair in his eyes its evan baines i said did you bring the masks he bent down and took out two dust masks and a bottle of aramis aftershave he sprinkled the aftershave on each mask handed one to me and put the other one on himself then he handed me a pair of plastic gloves louis stood farther back but didnt take a mask angel held the flashlight beam on the body i took my pocketknife and sliced through the plastic by the childs right hand even through the mask the stench grew stronger and there was a hiss of escaping gas i took the blunt edge of the knife and pried at the boys fist the skin broke and a nail came loose hold the light steady dammit i hissed i could see something small and blue in the boys grip i pried again heedless now of the damage i was causing i had to know i had to find the answer to what had happened here eventually the object came loose and fell to the floor i bent to pick it up and examined it by the light of my own flashlight it was a shard of blue china angel had begun scanning the far corners of the room with his flashlight as i examined the shard and then had left the room as i clutched the piece of china i heard the sound of his drill and then his voice calling us from above we went back up the stairs and found him in a small room little bigger than a closet almost directly above the room where the boy lay three linked videocassette recorders were stacked one above the other on some shelving and a thin cable snaked through a hole at the base of the wall and disappeared into the floor of the warehouse on one of the vcrs the seconds ticked off inexorably until angel stilled them in the corner of that cellar theres a tiny hole not much bigger than my fingernail but big enough to take a fisheye and a motion sensor he said an ordinary joe couldnt have found them unless he knew they were there and he knew where to look i reckon the wire follows the ventilation system someone wanted to record what went on in that room anytime it was entered someone but not whoever went to work on the children in that room a regular video camera set up in the room would give betterquality pictures there was no reason for concealment unless the viewer didnt want to be noticed there was no monitor in the room so whoever was responsible either wanted to watch the tapes in the comfort of his or her own home or wanted to be sure that whoever picked them up couldnt sample what was on them before handing them over i knew a lot of people who could put together a deal like that and so did angel but i had one in particular in mind pili pilar we went back down to the basement i took the folding spade from angels bag and began to break the earth it didnt take long for me to hit something soft i dug wider and then began to scrape away the earth angel beside me using a small garden trowel to help a film of plastic was revealed and through it barely discernible i could see brown wrinkled skin we scraped away the rest of the dirt until the childs body was visible curled in a fetal position with its head hidden by its left arm even in decay we could see the fingers had been broken although i couldnt tell if it was a boy or a girl without moving it angel looked slowly around the floor of the cellar and i knew what he was thinking it was probably worse than that this child had been buried barely six inches beneath the ground which meant there were probably others below this room had been in use for a long time louis slipped into the room his finger pressed to his lips he glanced once at the child then he pointed slowly above us with his right hand we stayed still hardly breathing and i heard the sound of soft steps on the stairs angel retreated into the shadows beside the shelves clicking off the flashlight as he went louis was already gone when i stood up i moved to take up a position at the other side of the door and was reaching for my gun when a flashlight beam hit me in the face the voice of bobby sciorra simply said dont and i withdrew my hand slowly he had moved quickly surprisingly so he emerged from the shadows the ugly fiveseven in his right hand and his flashlight focused on me as he neared the open gate he stopped about ten feet away from me and i could see his teeth shining as he smiled dead man he said dead as the kids in the room behind you i was gonna kill you back in that house but the old man wanted you left alive less there was no other option i just ran out of options still doing ferreras dirty work i replied even you should have scruples about this we all have our weaknesses he shrugged sonnys is shorteyes he likes looking you know cant do nothing else with his limp dick hes a sick fuck but his daddy loves him and now his daddy wants the mess cleaned up and so it was sonny ferrera who had recorded the death agonies of these children who had watched while hyams and adelaide modine tortured them to death their screams echoing around the walls as the silent unblinking eye of the camera took it all in to spew out again into his living room he must have known who the killers were must have watched them kill again and again yet he did nothing because he liked what he was seeing and didnt want it to end how did the old man find out i asked but i already knew the answer i knew now what had been in the car with pili when he crashed or thought i knew it turned out that i was as wrong in that as i had been in so much else there was a scuffle of movement in the corner of the alcove and sciorra reacted with the swiftness of a cat the flashlight beam widened and he stepped back the gun moving minutely from me to the corner the beam caught the bowed head of angel he glanced up into bobby sciorras eyes and smiled sciorra looked puzzled for a moment and then his mouth opened in slowdawning realization he was already turning to try to locate louis when the darkness seemed to come alive around him and his eyes widened as he realized too late that death had come for him too louiss skin gleamed in the light and his eyes were white as his left hand clamped tight over sciorras jaw sciorra seemed to tighten and spasm his eyes huge with pain and fear he rose up on his toes and his arms stretched wide at either side he shook hard once twice then the air seemed to leave him and his arms and body sagged yet his head remained rigid his eyes wide and staring louis pulled the long thin blade from the back of sciorras head and pushed him forward and he fell to the ground at my feet small shudders running through his body until they stopped entirely angel emerged from the darkness of the room behind me i always hated that fucking spook he said looking at the small hole at the base of sciorras skull yeah said louis i like him a whole lot better now he looked at me what do i do with him leave him give me his car keys louis frisked sciorras body and tossed me the keys hes a made guy is that gonna be a problem i dont know let me handle it stay close to here at some point im going to call cole when you hear the sirens disappear angel bent down and gingerly lifted the fn from the ground using the end of a screwdriver we gonna leave this here he asked thats some gun what you say is true it stays i said if i was right bobby sciorras gun was the link between ollie watts connell hyams and the ferrera family the link between a set of child killings that spanned thirty years and a mob dynasty that was more than twice as old again i stepped over sciorras body and ran from the warehouse his black chevy was pulled into the yard its trunk facing the warehouse and the gates had been closed behind it it looked a lot like the car that had taken out fat ollie wattss killer i reopened the gates and drove away from the morelli warehouse and queens itself queens a mass of warehouses and cemeteries and sometimes both together i was close now close to an end a termination of sorts i was about to witness the cessation of something that had been happening for over three decades and that had claimed enough young lives to fill the catacombs of an abandoned warehouse but no matter what the resolution might be it was insufficient to explain what had taken place there would be an ending there would be a closure there would be no solution i wondered how many times each year hyams had traveled up to the city in his neat lawyers clothes clutching an expensive yet understated overnight bag in order to tear another child apart as he boarded the train in front of the ticket collector or smiled at the girl behind the airline checkin desk or passed the woman at the toll booth in his cadillac the interior redolent with the scent of leather had there been anything in his face that might have caused them to pause to reconsider their assessment of this polite reserved man with his trim gray hair and his conservative suit and i wondered also at the identity of the woman who had burned to death in haven all those years ago for it was not adelaide modine i remembered hyams telling me that he had returned to haven the day before the body was found it was not difficult to put together a chain of events the panicked call from adelaide modine the selection of a suitable victim from the files of doc hyams the alteration of the dental files to match the body the planting of the jewelry and purse beside the corpse and the flickering of the first flames the smell like roasting pork as the body began to burn and then she disappeared back into the darkness to hibernate to find time to reinvent herself so the killing could continue adelaide modine was like a dark spider squatting in the corner of a web rushing out when a victim wandered into her sphere of influence and cocooning it in plastic she had moved unhindered through thirty long years presenting one face to the world and revealing another to the children she was a figure glimpsed only by the young a bogeyman the creature waiting in the darkness when all the world was asleep i believed i could see her face now i believed also that i understood why sonny ferrera had been hunted by his own father why i had been tracked to haven by bobby sciorra why fat ollie watts had fled in fear of his life and died in the roar of a gun in a street soaked in late summer sunlight the streetlights flashed by like pistol flares there was dirt beneath my fingernails as i clutched the wheel and i had an almost irresistible desire to pull into a gas station and wash them clean to take a wire brush and to scrub my skin until it bled scraping away all the layers of filth and death that seemed to have adhered to me in the past twentyfour hours i could taste bile in my mouth and i swallowed back hard focusing on the road ahead on the lights of the car in front and just once or twice on the careless dusting of stars in the black skies above when i arrived at the ferrera house the gates were open and there was no sign of the feds who had watched the house earlier in the week i drove bobby sciorras car up the driveway and parked in the shadows beneath some trees my shoulder ached badly now and bouts of nauseous sweating racked my body the front door of the house was ajar and i could see men moving inside beneath one of the front windows a darksuited figure sat slouched with his head in his hands his automatic lying discarded beside him i was almost on top of him when he saw me you aint bobby he said bobbys dead he nodded to himself as if this was no more than he expected then he stood up frisked me and took my gun inside the house armed men stood in corners talking in hushed tones the place had a funereal air a sense of barely suppressed shock i followed him to the old mans study he left me to open the door for myself standing back to watch me as i did so there was blood and gray matter on the floor and a dark blackred stain on the thick persian carpet there was blood also on the tan pants of the old man as he cradled his sons head in his lap his left hand its fingers red toyed with sonnys lank thinning hair a gun hung limply from the right its barrel pointing at the floor sonnys eyes were open and in his dark pupils i could see the light of a lamp reflected i guessed that he had shot sonny as he held his head in his lap as his son knelt beside him pleading forwhat for help for a reprieve for forgiveness sonny with his maddog eyes dressed in a cheap cream suit and an opennecked shirt gaudy with gold even in death the old mans face was stern and unyielding but when he turned to look at me his eyes were huge with guilt and despair the eyes of a man who has killed himself along with his son get out said the old man softly but distinctly but he wasnt looking at me now a slight breeze blew in through the open french windows from the garden beyond bringing with it some petals and leaves and the sure knowledge of the end of things a figure had appeared one of his own men an older soldier whose face i recognized but whose name i did not know the old man raised the gun and pointed it at him his hand shaking now get out he roared and this time the soldier moved pulling the windows closed instinctively as he departed the breeze simply blew them open again and the night air began to make the room its own ferrera kept the gun trained there for a few seconds longer and then it wavered and fell his left hand stilled by the appearance of his man returned to its methodical stroking of his dead sons hair with the soothing insane monotony of a caged animal stalking its pen hes my son he said staring into a past that was and a future that might have been hes my son but theres something wrong with him hes sick hes bad in the head bad inside there was nothing for me to say i stayed silent why are you here he said its over now my son is dead a lot of people are dead the children for an instant the old man winced ollie watts he shook his head slowly his eyes unblinking fucking ollie watts he shouldnt have run when he ran we knew sonny knew what did you know i think that if i had entered the room only minutes later the old man would have had me killed instantly or would have killed me himself instead he seemed to seek some sort of release through me he would confess to me unburden himself to me and that would be the last time he would bring himself to speak it aloud that hed looked in the car he shouldnt have looked he shoulda just walked away what did he see what did he find in the car videos pictures the old mans eyes closed tightly but he couldnt hide from what he had seen tears squeezed themselves from wrinkled corners and ran down the sides of his cheeks his mouth formed silent words no no more worse when he opened his eyes again he was dead inside tapes and a child there was a child in the trunk of the car my boy my sonny he killed a child he turned to look at me again but this time his face was moving twitching almost as if his head could not contain the enormity of what he had seen this man who had killed and tortured and who had ordered others to kill and torture in his name had found in his own son a darkness that was beyond naming a lightless place where slain children lay the black heart of every dead thing watching had no longer been enough for sonny he had seen the power these people had the pleasure they took in tearing the life slowly from the children and wanted to experience it too i told bobby to bring him to me but he ran ran as soon as he heard about pili his face hardened then i told bobby to kill them all all the rest every one of them and then he seemed to be talking to bobby sciorra again his face red with fury destroy the tapes find the kids find where they are and then put them somewhere theyll never be found dump them at the bottom of the fucking ocean if you can i want it like it never happened it never happened then he seemed to remember where he was and what he had done at least for a time and his hand returned to its stroking and then you came along trailing the girl asking questions how could the girl know i let you go after her to get you away from here to get you away from sonny but sonny had come after me through his hired killers and they had failed their failure forced his father to act if the woman lived and was forced to testify sonny would be cornered again and so sciorra had been dispatched and the woman had died but why did sciorra kill hyams what sciorra killed a lawyer in virginia a man who was trying to kill me why for a moment ferreras eyes grew wary and the gun rose you wearing a wire i shook my head wearily and painfully ripped open the front of my shirt the gun fell again he recognized him from the tapes thats how he found you in the old house bobbys driving through the town and suddenly he sees this guy driving in the opposite direction and its the guy in the video the guy who he stopped again and rolled his tongue in his mouth as if to generate enough saliva to keep talking all the traces had to be wiped out all of them but not me maybe he shouldve killed you too when he had the chance no matter what your cop friends would have done he should have i said hes dead now ferrera blinked hard did you kill him yes bobby was a made guy you know what that means you know what your son did he was silent then as the enormity of his sons crime swept over him once more but when he spoke again there was a barely suppressed fury in his voice and i knew that my time with him was drawing to a close who are you to judge my son he began you think because you lost a kid that youre the patron saint of dead children fuck you ive buried two of my sons and now now ive killed the last of them you dont judge me you dont judge my son the gun rose again and pointed at my head its all over he said no who else was on the tapes his eyes flickered the mention of the tapes was like a hard slap to him a woman i told bobby to find her and kill her too and did he hes dead do you have the tapes theyre gone all burned he stopped as he remembered again where he was as if the questions had briefly taken him away from the reality of what he had done and of the responsibility he bore for his son for his crimes for his death get out he said if i ever see you again youre a dead man no one stood in my way as i left my gun was on a small table by the front door and i still had the keys to bobby sciorras car as i drove away from the house it looked silent and peaceful in the rearview as if nothing had ever happened each morning after the deaths of jennifer and susan i would wake from my strange disordered dreams and for an instant it seemed that they would still be near me my wife sleeping softly by my side my child surrounded by her toys in a room nearby for a moment they still lived and i experienced their deaths as a fresh loss with each waking so that i was unsure whether i was a man waking from a dream of death or a dreamer entering a world of loss a man dreaming of unhappiness or a man waking to grief and amid all there was the constant aching regret that i had never really known susan until she was gone and that i loved a shadow in death as in life the woman and the child were dead another woman and child in a cycle of violence and dissolution that seemed unbreakable i was grieving for a young woman and a boy whom i had never encountered when they were alive about whom i knew almost nothing and through them i grieved for my own wife and child the gates of the barton estate stood open either someone had entered and planned to leave quickly or someone had already gone there were no other cars in sight as i parked on the gravel drive and walked toward the house light was visible through the glass above the front door i rang the bell twice but there was no answer so i moved to a window and peered in the door into the hallway was open and in the gap i could see a womans legs one foot bare the other with a black shoe still clinging to its toes the legs were bare to the tops of the thighs where the end of a black dress still covered her buttocks the rest of her body was obscured i shattered the glass with the butt of my gun half expecting to hear an alarm but there was only the sound of the glass tinkling on the floor inside i reached in carefully to open the latch and climbed through the window the room was illuminated by the hallway lights i could feel my blood pounding through my veins could hear it in my ears as i opened the door wider sensed it tingling at the tips of my fingers as i stepped into the hall and looked at the body of the woman blue veins marbled the skin on her legs and the flesh at the thighs was dimpled and slightly flabby her face had been pounded in and strands of gray hair adhered to the torn flesh her eyes were still open and her mouth was dark with blood only the stumps of teeth remained within she was almost unrecognizable there was only the gold emeraldstudded necklace the deep red nail varnish and the simple yet expensive de la renta dress to suggest the body was that of isobel barton i touched the skin at her neck there was no pulsei hardly expected anybut she was still warm i stepped into the study where we had first met and compared the shard of china i had taken from evan bainess hand with the single blue dog on the mantelpiece the pattern matched i imagined evan had died quickly when the damage was discovered the victim of a fit of rage at the loss of one of adelaide modines family heirlooms from the kitchen down the hall came a series of uneven clicking sounds and i could smell a faint odor of burning like a pot left on a stove for too long above it almost unnoticed until now was the faint hint of gas no light showed around the edge of the closed door as i approached although the acrid smell grew more definite more intense and the odor of gas was stronger now i opened the door carefully and stepped back and to one side my finger rested gently on the trigger but even as i noticed the pressure i was aware that the gun was useless if there was gas leaking there was no movement from within but the smell was very strong now the strange irregular clicking was loud with a low drone above it i took a deep breath and flung myself into the room my useless gun attempting to draw a bead on anything that moved the kitchen was empty the only illumination came from the windows the hall and the three large industrial microwave ovens side by side in front of me through their glass doors i could see blue light dance over a range of metal objects inside pots knives forks pans all were alive with tiny flickers of silverblue lightning the stench of gas made my head swim as the tempo of the clicks increased i ran i had the front door open when there was a dull whump from the kitchen followed by a second louder bang and then i was flying through the air as the force of the explosion hurled me to the gravel there was the sound of glass breaking and the lawn was set aglow as the house burst into flames behind me as i stumbled toward my car i could feel the heat and see the dancing fire reflected in the windows at the gate to the barton estate a pair of red brake lights glowed briefly and then a car turned into the road adelaide modine was covering her tracks before disappearing into the shadows once again the house was ablaze the flames escaping to scale the outside walls like ardent lovers as i pulled into the road and followed the rapidly receding lights she drove fast down the winding todt hill road and in the silence of the night i could hear the shriek of her brakes as she negotiated the bends i took her at ocean terrace as she headed for the staten island expressway to the left a steep slope dense with trees fell down to sussex avenue below i gained on her mounted the verge at ocean and swung hard to the left the weight of the chevy forcing the bmw closer and closer to the verge the tinted windows revealing nothing of the driver within ahead of me i saw todt hill road curve viciously to the right and i pulled away to stay with the curve just as the bmws front wheels left the road and the car plunged down the hill the bmw rolled on garbage and scree striking two trees before coming to a stop halfway down the leafstrewn slope its progress arrested by the dark mass of a young beech the roots of the tree were partially yanked from the ground and it arched backward its branches eventually coming to rest unsteadily against the trunk of another tree farther down the slope i pulled my car onto the verge its headlights still on and ran down the slope my feet slipping on the grass so that i was forced to steady myself with my good arm as i approached the bmw the drivers door opened and the woman who was adelaide modine staggered out a huge gash had opened in her forehead and her face was streaked with blood so that amid the woods and the leaves in the bleak reflected light of the heads she seemed a strange feral being her clothes inappropriate trappings to be shed as she returned to her ferocious natural state she was hunched over slightly clutching her chest where she had slammed into the steering column but she straightened painfully as i approached despite her pain isobel bartons eyes were alive with viciousness blood flowed from her mouth when she opened it and i saw her test something within with her tongue and then release a small bloodied tooth onto the ground i could see the cunning in her face as if even now she was seeking a means of escape there was evil still in her a foulness that went far beyond the limited viciousness of a cornered beast i think concepts of justice of right of recompense were beyond her she lived in a world of pain and violence where the killing of children their torture and mutilation were like air and water to her without them without the muffled cries and the futile despairing twistings existence had no meaning and would come to an end and she looked at me and seemed almost to smile cunt she said spitting the word out i wondered how much ms christie had known or suspected before she died in that hallway not enough obviously i was tempted to kill adelaide modine then to kill her would be to stamp out one part of that terrible evil that had taken my own child along with the lives of the children in the cellars the same evil that had spawned the traveling man and johnny friday and a million other individuals like them i believed in the devil and pain i believed in torture and rape and vicious prolonged death i believed in hurt and agony and the pleasure they gave to those who caused them and to all these things i gave the name evil and in adelaide modine i saw its red sputtering spark exploded into bloody flame i cocked the pistol she didnt blink instead she laughed once and then grimaced at the pain she was now curled over again almost fetal near the ground i could smell gasoline on the air as it flowed from the ruptured tank i wondered what catherine demeter had felt when she saw this woman in de vriess department store had she glimpsed her in a mirror in the glass of a display case had she turned in disbelief her stomach tightening as if in the grip of a fist and when their eyes met when she knew that this was the woman who had killed her sister did she feel hatred or anger or simply fear fear that this woman could turn on her as she had once turned on her sister for a brief moment had catherine demeter become a frightened child again adelaide modine might not have recognized her immediately but she must have seen the recognition in the eyes of the other woman maybe it was that slight overbite that gave it away or perhaps she looked into the face of catherine demeter and was instantly back in that dark cellar in haven killing her sister and then when catherine could not be found she had set about finding a resolution to the problem she had hired me on a pretext and had killed her own stepson not only so that he could not give the lie to her story but as the first step in a process that would lead to the eventual death of ms christie and the destruction of her home as she covered the traces of her existence maybe stephen barton bore some blame for what happened for only he could have provided a link between sonny ferrera connell hyams and his stepmother when hyams was seeking somewhere to take the children a property owned by someone who wouldnt ask too many questions i doubt if barton ever really knew what was taking place and that lack of understanding killed him in the end and i wondered when adelaide modine had learned of the death of hyams and realized that she was now alone that the time had come to move on leaving ms christie as a decoy just as she had left an unknown woman to burn in her place in virginia but how would i prove all this the videos were gone sonny ferrera was dead pilar was certainly dead hyams sciorra granger catherine demeter all gone who would remember a child killer from three decades ago who would recognize her in the woman before me would the word of walt tyler be enough she had killed christie true but even that might never be proved would there be enough forensic evidence in the wine cellars to prove her guilt adelaide modine curled in a ball unraveled like a spider that senses a shift in its web and sprang toward me the nails of her right hand digging into my face scratching for my eyes while the left sought the gun i struck her in the face with the heel of my hand pushing her back simultaneously with my knee she came at me again and i shot her the bullet catching her above the right breast she stumbled back against the car supporting herself on the open door her hand clutching at the wound in her chest and she smiled i know you she said forcing the words out through the pain i know who you are behind her the tree shifted slightly as the weight of the car forced its roots up from the ground the big bmw moved forward a little adelaide modine swayed before me blood pouring now from the wound in her chest there was something bright in her eyes something that made my stomach tighten who told you i know she said and smiled again i know who killed your wife and child i moved toward her as she tried to speak again but her words were swallowed by the sound of grinding metal from the car as the tree finally gave way the bmw shifted on the slope and then plummeted down the hill as it rolled impacting on trees and stones the rending metal sparked and the car burst into flame and as i watched i realized that it was always meant to end this way adelaide modines world exploded into yellow flame as the gasoline around her ignited and then she was enveloped her head back and her mouth wide for an instant before she fell striking feebly at the flames as she toppled burning into the darkness the car was blazing at the bottom of the slope thick black smoke ascending in plumes into the air i watched it from the road the heat searing my face farther down the hill in the wooded dark a smaller pyre burned i sat in the same police interview room with the same wooden table with the same wooden heart carved into its surface my arm was freshly bandaged and i had showered and shaved for the first time in over two days i had even caught a few hours sleep stretched across three chairs despite agent rosss best effort i was not in a jail cell i had been interrogated comprehensively first by walter and another detective then by walter and the assistant chief and finally by ross and one of his agents with walter in attendance to make sure they didnt beat me to death out of frustration once or twice i thought i caught glimpses of philip kooper striding around outside like a corpse that had exhumed itself to sue the undertaker i guessed that the trusts public profile was about to take a terminal hammering i told the cops nearly everything i told them about sciorra about hyams about adelaide modine about sonny ferrera i did not tell them that i had become involved in the case at walter coles instigation the other gaps in my story i left them to fill in for themselves i told them simply that i had taken some leaps of the imagination ross almost had to be forcibly restrained at that point now there was only walter and me and a pair of coffee cups have you been down there i asked eventually breaking the silence walter nodded briefly i didnt stay how many eight so far but theyre still digging and they would continue digging not just there but in scattered locations across the state and maybe even farther afield adelaide modine and connell hyams had been free to kill for thirty years the morelli warehouse had been rented for only a portion of that time which meant that there were probably other warehouses other deserted basements old garages and disused lots that contained the remains of lost children how long had you suspected i asked he seemed to think i was asking about something else maybe a dead man in the toilet of a bus station because he started and turned to me suspected what that someone in the barton household was involved in the baines disappearance he almost relaxed almost whoever took him had to know the grounds the house assuming he was taken at the house and hadnt wandered assuming that yes and you sent me to find out i sent you i felt culpable for catherine demeters death not only because of my failure to find her alive but because unwittingly i might have brought modine and hyams to her i may have led them to catherine demeter i said to walter after a while i told ms christie i was going to virginia to follow a lead it might have been enough to give her away walter shook his head she hired you as insurance she must have alerted hyams as soon as she was seen he was probably on the lookout for her already if she didnt turn up in haven then they were relying on you to find her as soon as you did i think youd both have been killed i had a vision of catherine demeters body slumped in the basement of the dane house her head surrounded by a circle of blood and i saw evan baines wrapped in plastic and the decayed body of a child half covered in earth and the other corpses still to be discovered in the morelli basement and elsewhere and i saw my own wife my own child in all of them you could have sent someone else i said no only you if evan bainess killer was there i knew youd find out i knew youd find out because youre a killer yourself the word hung in the air for a moment then tore a rift between us like a knife cutting through our past together walter turned away i stayed silent for a time and then as if he had never spoken i said she told me that she knew who killed jennifer and susan he seemed almost grateful for the break in the silence she couldnt have known she was a sick evil woman and that was her way of trying to torture you after she died no she knew she knew who i was before she died but i dont think she knew when she hired me she would have suspected something she wouldnt have taken the chance youre wrong he said let it go i didnt say anything more but i knew that somehow the dark worlds of adelaide modine and the traveling man had come together im considering retirement said cole i dont want to look at death anymore ive been reading sir thomas browne you ever read thomas browne no christian morals behold not deaths heads til thou doest not see them nor look upon mortifying objects til thou overlookst them his back was to me but i could see his face reflected in the window and his eyes seemed far away ive spent too long looking at death i dont want to force myself to look any longer he sipped his coffee you should go away from here do something to put your ghosts behind you youre no longer what you once were but maybe you can still step back before you lose yourself forever a film was forming on my untouched coffee when i didnt respond walter sighed and spoke with a sadness in his voice that i had never heard before id prefer it if i didnt have to see you again he said ill talk to some people see if you can go something had changed within me that much was true but i was not sure that walter could see it for what it was maybe only i could really understand what had happened what adelaide modines death had unlocked within me the horror of what she had done through the years the knowledge of the hurt and pain she had inflicted on the most innocent among us could not be balanced in this world and yet it had been brought to an end i had brought it to an end all things decay all things must end the evil as well as the good what adelaide modines death had done in its brutal flamered way was to show me that this was true if i could find adelaide modine and could bring her to an end then i could do the same with others i could do the same with the traveling man and somewhere in a dark place a clock began to tick counting off the hours the minutes the seconds before it would toll the end for the traveling man all things decay all things must end and as i thought of what walter had said of his doubts about me i thought too of my father and the legacy he left me i have only fragmented memories of my father i remember a large redfaced man carrying a christmas tree into the house his breath rising into the air like the puffs of steam from an old train i remember walking into the kitchen one evening to find him caressing my mother and her laughter at their shared embarrassment i remember him reading to me at night his huge fingers following the words as he spoke them to me so that they might be familiar to me when i returned to them again and i remember his death his uniform was always freshly pressed and he kept his gun oiled and cleaned he loved being a policeman or so it seemed i did not know then what it was that drove him to do what he did maybe walter cole gained some knowledge of it when he looked upon the bodies of those dead children maybe i too have knowledge of it maybe i have become like my father what is clear is that something inside him died and the world appeared to him in different darker colors he had looked upon deaths heads for too long and become a reflection of what he saw the call had been a routine one two kids fooling around in a car late at night on a patch of urban wasteland flashing the lights and sounding the horn my father had responded and found one of the local boys a petty criminal well on the road to graduating into felonies and his girlfriend a middleclass girl who was flirting with danger and enjoying the sexual charge it brought my father couldnt recall what the boy said to him as he tried to impress his girl words were exchanged and i can imagine my fathers voice deepening and hardening in warning the boy made mocking movements toward the inside pocket of his jacket enjoying the effect on my fathers nerves and bathing in the ripples of laughter from the young woman beside him then my father drew his gun and the laughter stopped i can see the boy raising his hands shaking his head explaining that there was no weapon there that it was all just fun that he was sorry my father shot him in the face blood streaking the interior of the car the windows the face of the girl in the passenger seat his mouth wide in shock i dont think she even screamed before my father shot her too then he walked away internal affairs came for him as he stripped in the locker room they took him before his brother officers to make an example of him no one got in their way by then they all knew or thought they knew he admitted everything but could not explain it he simply shrugged his shoulders when they asked they took his gun and his badgehis backup the one i now hold remained back in his bedroomand then they drove him home under the nypd rule that prevented a policeman from being questioned about the possible commission of a crime until fortyeight hours had elapsed he looked dazed when he returned and wouldnt speak to my mother the two internal affairs men sat outside in their car smoking cigarettes while i watched from my bedroom window i think they knew what would happen next when the gunshot sounded they didnt leave their car until the echoes of the shot had faded into the cool night air i am my fathers son with all that entails the door of the interview room opened and rachel wolfe entered she was dressed casually in blue jeans hightop sneakers and a black hooded cotton top by calvin klein her hair was loose hanging over her ears and resting on her shoulders and there was a sprinkling of freckles on her nose and at the base of her neck she took a seat across from me and gave me a look of concern and sympathy i heard about the death of catherine demeter im sorry i nodded and thought of catherine demeter and how she looked in the basement of the dane house they werent good thoughts how do you feel she asked there was curiosity in her voice but tenderness too i dont know do you regret killing adelaide modine she called it there was nothing else i could do i felt numb about her death about the killing of the lawyer about the sight of bobby sciorra rising up on his toes as the blade entered the base of his skull it was the numbness that scared me the stillness inside me i think that it might have scared me more but for the fact that i felt something else too a deep pain for the innocents who had been lost and for those who had yet to be found i didnt know you did house calls i said why did they call you in they didnt she said simply then she touched my hand a strange faltering gesture in which i felti hoped that there was something more than professional understanding i gripped her hand tightly in mine and closed my eyes i think it was a kind of first step a faltering attempt to reestablish my place in the world after all that had taken place over the previous two days i wanted to touch however briefly something positive to try to awaken something good within myself i couldnt save catherine demeter i said at last i tried and maybe something came out of that attempt im still going to find the man who killed susan and jennifer she nodded slowly and held my gaze i know you will rachel had been gone for a short time when the cell phone rang yes mista parker it was a womans voice this is charlie parker my name is florence aguillard mista parker my mother is tante marie aguillard you came to visit us i remember what can i do for you florence i felt the tightening in my stomach but this time it was born of anticipation born of the feeling that tante marie might have found something to identify the figure of the girl who was haunting us both in the background i could hear the music of a jazz piano and the laughter of men and women thick and sensual as treacle i been tryin to get you all afternoon my momma say to call you she say you gotta come to her now i could hear something in her voice something that conspired to trip her words as they tumbled from her mouth it was fear and it hung like a distorting fog around what she had to say mista parker she say you gotta come now and you gotta tell no one you comin no one mista parker i dont understand florence whats happening i dont know she said she was crying now her voice wracked by sobs but she say you gotta come you gotta come now she regained control of herself and i could hear her draw a deep breath before she spoke again mista parker she say the travelin man comin there are no coincidences only patterns we do not see the call was part of a pattern linked to the death of adelaide modine which i did not yet understand i said nothing about the call to anyone i left the interrogation room collected my gun from the desk then headed for the street and took a cab back to my apartment i booked a firstclass ticket to moisant field the only ticket left on any flight leaving for louisiana that evening and checked in shortly before departure declaring my gun at the desk my bag swallowed up in the general confusion the plane was full half of the passengers tourists who didnt know better heading for the stifling august heat of new orleans the stewards served ham sandwiches with potato chips and a packet of dried raisins all tossed in the sort of brown paper bag you got on school trips to the zoo there was darkness below us when the pressure began building in my nose i was already reaching for a cocktail napkin when the first drops came but quickly the pressure became pain a ferocious shooting pain that caused me to jerk back in my seat the passenger beside me a businessman who had earlier been cautioned about using his laptop computer while the plane was still on the runway stared at me in surprise and then shock as he saw the blood i watched his finger pressing repeatedly to summon the steward and then my head was thrown back as if by the force of a blow blood spurted violently from my nose drenching the back of the seat in front of me and my hands shook uncontrollably then just as it seemed that my head was going to explode from the pain and the pressure i heard a voice the voice of an old black woman in the louisiana swamps chile said the voice chile hes here and then she was gone and my world turned black iii the concavities of my body are like another hell for their capacity sir thomas urquhart rabelais gargantua there was a loud thud as the insect hit the windshield it was a large dragonfly a mosquito hawk shit that thing must have been big as a bird said the driver a young fbi agent named oneill brouchard outside it was probably in the high nineties but the louisiana humidity made it seem much hotter my shirt felt cold and uncomfortable where the airconditioning had dried it against my body a smear of blood and wings lay across the glass and the wipers struggled to remove it the blood matched the drops that still stained my shirt an unnecessary reminder of what had happened on the plane since my head still ached and the bridge of my nose felt tender to the touch beside brouchard woolrich remained silent intent upon loading a fresh clip into his sig sauer the assistant sac was dressed in his usual garb of cheap tan suit and wrinkled tie beside me a dark windbreaker marked with the agencys letters lay crumpled on the seat i had called woolrich from the satellite phone on the plane but couldnt get a connection at moisant field i left a number with his message service telling him to contact me immediately then hired a car and set out toward lafayette on i just outside baton rouge the cell phone rang bird said woolrichs voice what the hell are you doing down here there was concern in his voice in the background i could hear the sound of a car engine you get my message i got it listen were already on our way someone spotted florence out by her house with blood on her dress and a gun in her hand were going to meet up with the local cops at exit onetwentyone wait for us there woolrich it may be too late just wait no hotdogging on this one bird i got a stake in this too i got florence to think about in front of us i could see the taillights of two other vehicles patrol cars out of the st martin parish sheriffs office behind us its headlights illuminating the inside of the fbi chevy and the blood on the windshield was an old buick driven by two st martin detectives i knew one of them john charles morphy vaguely having met him once before with woolrich in lafittes blacksmith shop on bourbon as he swayed quietly to the sound of miss lily hoods voice morphy was a descendant of paul charles morphy the world chess champion from new orleans who retired in at the grand old age of twentytwo it was said that he could play three or four games simultaneously while blindfolded by contrast john charles with his hard bodybuilders frame never struck me as a man much given to chess power lifting competitions maybe but not chess he was a man with a past according to woolrich a former detective in the nopd who had left the force in the shadow of an investigation by the public integrity division over the killing of a young black man named luther bordelon near chartres two years earlier i looked over my shoulder and saw morphy staring back at me his shaven head glowing in the buicks interior light his hands tight on the wheel as he negotiated the rutted track through the bayou beside him his partner toussaint held the winchester model pump upright between his legs the stock was pitted and scratched the barrel worn and i guessed that it wasnt regulation issue but toussaints own it had smelled strongly of oil when i spoke to morphy through the window of the car back where the bayou courtableau intersected with i the lights of the car caught the branches of palmetto tupelo and overhanging willows huge cypress heavy with spanish moss and occasionally the stumps of ancient trees in the swamps beyond we turned into a road that was dark as a tunnel the branches of the cypress trees above us like a roof against the starlight and then we were rattling over the bridge that led to the house of tante marie aguillard before us the two sheriffs office cars turned in opposing directions and parked diagonally the lights of one shining out into the dark undergrowth that led down to the swamp banks the lights of the second hit the house casting shadows over the tree trunks that raised it from the ground the buildings overlapping boards the steps leading up the screen door which now stood open on the porch allowing the night creatures easy access to the interior of the house woolrich turned around as we pulled up you ready for this i nodded i had my smith amp wesson in my hand as we stepped from the car into the warm air i could smell rotting vegetation and a faint trace of smoke something rustled through the vegetation to my right and then splashed lightly into the water morphy and his partner came up beside us i could hear the sound of a shell being jacked into the pump two of the deputies stood uncertainly beside their car the second pair advanced slowly across the neat garden their guns drawn whats the deal said morphy he was six feet tall with the v shape of a lifter his head hairless and a circle of mustache and beard around his mouth no one enters before us said woolrich send those two jokers around the back but tell them to stay out of the house the other two stay at the front you two back us up brouchard stay by the car and watch the bridge we moved across the grass stepping carefully around the discarded childrens toys on the lawn there were no lights on in the house no sign of any occupants i could hear the blood pumping in my head and the palms of my hands were slick with sweat we were ten feet from the porch steps when i heard a pistol cock and the voice of the deputy to our right ah sweet jesus he said sweet jesus lord this cant be a dead tree little more than an extended trunk stood about ten yards from the waters edge branches some no more than twigs others as thick as a mans arm commenced some three feet up the trunk and continued to a height of eight or nine feet against the tree trunk stood tee jean aguillard the old womans youngest son his naked body glistening in the flashlight beam his left arm was hooked around a thick branch so that his forearm and empty hand hung vertically his head rested in the crook of another branch his ruined eyes like dark chasms against the exposed flesh and tendons of his flayed face tee jeans right arm was also wrapped around a branch but this time his hand was not empty in his fingers he grasped a flap of his own skin a flap that hung like an opened veil and revealed the interior of his body from his exposed ribs to the area above his penis his stomach and most of the organs in his abdomen had been removed they lay on a stone by his left foot a pile of white blue and red body parts in which coils of intestine curled like snakes beside me i heard one of the deputies begin to retch i turned to see woolrich grabbing him by the collar and hauling him to the waters edge some distance away not here he said not here he left the deputy on his knees by the water and turned toward the house weve got to find florence he said his face looked sickly and pale in the flashlight beam we gotta find her florence aguillard had been seen standing at the bridge to her house by the owner of a local bait shop she had been covered in blood and held a colt service revolver in her hand when the bait shop owner stopped florence raised the gun and fired a single shot through the drivers window missing the bait shop owner by a fraction of an inch he had called the st martin cops from a gas station and they in turn had called woolrich acting on his notice to the local police that any incident involving tante marie should be reported immediately to him woolrich took the steps up the porch at a run and was almost at the door when i reached him i put my hand on his shoulder and he spun toward me his eyes wide easy i said the wild look disappeared from his eyes and he nodded slowly i turned back to morphy and motioned him to follow us into the house morphy took the winchester pump from toussaint and indicated that he should hang back with the deputy now that his partner was indisposed a long central hallway led shotgun style to a large kitchen at the rear of the house six rooms radiated off the central artery three on either side i knew that tante maries was the last door on the right and i was tempted to make straight for it instead we progressed carefully taking a room at a time the flashlight beams cutting a swath through the darkness dust motes and moths bobbing in the beams the first room on the right a bedroom was empty there were two beds one made and the second a childs bed unmade the blanket lying half on the floor the living room opposite was also empty morphy and woolrich each took a room as we progressed to the second set of doors both were bedrooms both were empty where are all the children the adults i said to woolrich eighteenth birthday party at a house two miles away he replied only tee jean and the old lady supposed to be here and florence the door opposite tante maries room stood wide open and i could see a jumble of furniture boxes of clothes and piles of childrens toys a window was open and the curtains stirred slightly in the night air we turned to face the door of tante maries bedroom it was slightly ajar and i could see moonlight within disturbed and distorted by the shadows of the trees behind me morphy had the shotgun raised and woolrich had the sig held doublehanded close to his cheek i put my finger on the trigger of the smith amp wesson flicked open the door with the side of my foot and dived low into the room a bloody handprint lay on the wall by the door and i could hear the sound of night creatures in the darkness beyond the window the moonlight cast drifting shadows across a long sideboard a huge closet filled with almost identically patterned dresses and a long dark chest on the floor near the door but the room was dominated by the giant bed that stood against the far wall and by its occupant tante marie aguillard tante marie the old woman who had reached out to a dying girl as the blade began to cut her face the old woman who had called out to me in my wifes voice when i last stood in this room offering me some kind of comfort in my sorrow the old woman who had in turn reached out to me in her final torment she sat naked on the bed a huge woman undiminished by death her head and upper body rested against a mountain of pillows stained dark by her blood her face was a redandpurple mass her jaw hung open revealing long teeth stained yellow with tobacco the flashlight caught her thighs her thick arms and the hands that reached towards the center of her body god have mercy said morphy tante marie had been split from sternum to groin and the skin pulled back to be held in place by her own hands as with her son most of her internal organs had been removed and her stomach was a hollow cavern framed by ribs through which a section of her spine gleamed dully in the light woolrichs flashlight moved lower toward her groin i stopped it with my hand no i said no more then a shout came from outside startling in the silence and we were running together toward the front of the house florence aguillard stood swaying on the grass in front of her brothers body her mouth was curled down at either side the bottom lip turned in on itself in grief she held the longbarreled colt in her right hand the muzzle pointing toward the ground her white dress was patterned with blue flowers obscured in places by her mothers blood she made no noise although her body was racked by silent cries woolrich and i came down the steps slowly morphy and a deputy stayed on the porch the second pair of deputies had come from the back of the house and stood facing florence toussaint slightly to the right of them to florence s left i could see the figure of tee jean hanging on the tree and beside him brouchard with his unholstered sig florence said woolrich softly putting his gun back in his shoulder holster florence put the gun down her body shook and her left hand wrapped itself tightly around her waist she bent over slightly and shook her head slowly from side to side florence repeated woolrich its me she turned her head toward us there was misery in her eyes misery and hurt and guilt and rage all vying for supremacy in her troubled mind she raised the gun slowly and pointed it in our direction i saw the deputies bring their weapons up quickly toussaint had already assumed a sharpshooters stance his arms in front of his body his gun unwavering no shouted woolrich his right hand raised i saw the cops look toward him in doubt and then toward morphy he nodded and they relaxed slightly still keeping their weapons trained on florence the colt moved from woolrich to me and still florence aguillard shook her head slowly i could hear her voice soft in the night repeating woolrichs word like a mantrano no no no noand then she turned the gun toward herself placed the barrel in her mouth and pulled the trigger the explosion sounded like a cannons roar in the night air i could hear the sound of birds wings flapping and small animals hurtling through the undergrowth as florence s body crumpled to the ground woolrich stumbled to his knees beside her and reached out to touch her face with his left hand his right reaching instinctively futilely for the pulse in her neck then he lifted her and buried her face in his sweatstained shirt his mouth open in pain in the distance red lights shone farther away i could hear the sound of a helicopters blades scything at the darkness the day dawned heavy and humid in new orleans the smell of the mississippi strong in the morning air i left my guest house and skirted the quarter trying to clear the tiredness from my head and my bones i eventually ended up on loyola the traffic adding to the oppressive warmth the sky overhead was gray and overcast with the threat of rain and dark clouds hung over the city seeming to lock in the heat i bought a copy of the timespicayune from a vending machine and read it as i stood before city hall the newspaper was so heavy with corruption that it was a wonder the paper didnt rot two policemen arrested on drug trafficking charges a federal investigation into the conduct of the last senate elections suspicions about a former governor new orleans itself with its rundown buildings the grim shopping precinct of poydras the woolworth store with its closing down notices seemed to embody this corruption so it was impossible to tell whether the city had infected the populace or if some of its people were dragging down the city with them chep morrison had built the imposing city hall shortly after he returned from the second world war to dethrone the millionaire mayor maestri and drag new orleans into the twentieth century some of woolrichs cronies still remembered morrison with fondness albeit a fondness arising from the fact that police corruption had flourished under him along with numbers rackets prostitution and gambling more than three decades later the police department in new orleans was still trying to deal with his legacy for almost two decades the big sleazy had been top of the league table of complaints about police misconduct numbering over one thousand complaints per year the nopd had been founded on the principal of the cut like the police forces in other southern citiessavannah richmond mobileit had been formed in the eighteenth century to control and monitor the slave population with the police receiving a portion of the reward for capturing runaways in the nineteenth century members of the force were accused of rapes and murders lynchings and robberies of taking graft to allow gambling and prostitution to continue the fact that police had to stand for election annually meant that they were forced to sell their allegiance to the two main political parties the force manipulated government elections intimidated voters even participated in the massacre of moderates at the mechanics institute in new orleans s first black mayor dutch morial tried to clean up the department at the start of the nineteen eighties if the independent metropolitan crime commission which had a quarter of a centurys start on morial couldnt clean up the department what hope did a black mayor have the predominantly white police union went on strike and the mardi gras was cancelled the national guard had to be called out to maintain order i didnt know if the situation had improved since then i hoped that it had new orleans is also homicide central with about four hundred code snopd code for a homicideeach year maybe half get solved leaving a lot of people walking the streets of new orleans with blood on their hands thats something the city fathers prefer not to tell the tourists although maybe a lot of the tourists would still come anyway after all when a city is so hot that it offers riverboat gambling twentyfourhour bars strippers prostitution and a ready supply of drugs all within a few blocks of one another theres got to be some kind of downside to it all i walked on eventually stopping to sit on the edge of a potted tree outside the pink new orleans center the tower of the hyatt rising behind it while i waited for woolrich to show in the midst of the previous nights confusion we had arranged a meeting for breakfast i had considered staying in lafayette or baton rouge but woolrich indicated that the local cops might not like having me so close to the investigation and as he pointed out he himself was based in new orleans i gave him twenty minutes and when he didnt arrive i began to walk down poydras street its canyon of office buildings already thronged with businesspeople and tourists heading for the mississippi at jackson square la madeleine was packed with breakfasters the smell of baking bread from its ovens seemed to draw people in like cartoon characters pulled along by a visible snakelike scent i ordered a pastry and coffee and finished reading the timespicayune its next to impossible to get the new york times in new orleans i read somewhere that the new orleans citizenry bought fewer copies of the new york times than any other city in the united states although they made up for it by buying more formal wear than anywhere else if youre going out to formal dinners every evening you dont get much time to read the new york times amid the magnolia and banana trees of the square tourists watched tap dancers and mimes and a slim black man who maintained a steady sensual rhythm by hitting his knees with a pair of plastic bottles there was a light breeze blowing from the river but it was fighting a losing battle with the morning heat and contented itself with tossing the hair of the artists hanging their paintings on the squares black iron fence and threatening the cards of the fortunetellers outside the cathedral i felt strangely distant from what i had seen at tante maries house i had expected it to bring back memories of what i had seen in my own kitchen the sight of my own wife and child reduced to flesh sinew and bone instead i felt only a heaviness like a dark wet blanket over my consciousness i flicked through the newspaper once again the killings had made the bottom of the front page but the details of the mutilations had been kept from the press it was hard to tell how long that would last rumors would probably begin to circulate at the funerals inside there were pictures of two bodies those of florence and tee jean being taken across the bridge toward waiting ambulances the bridge had been weakened by the traffic and there were fears that it might collapse if the ambulances tried to cross mercifully there were no pictures of tante marie being transported on a special gurney to her ambulance her huge bulk seeming to mock mortality even as it lay shrouded in black i looked up to see woolrich approaching the table he had changed his tan suit for a light gray linen the tan had been covered in florence aguillards blood he was unshaven and there were black bags beneath his eyes i ordered him coffee and a plate of pastries and stayed quiet as he ate he had changed a great deal in the years i had known him i thought there was less fat on his face and when the light caught him a certain way his cheekbones were like blades beneath his skin it struck me for the first time that he might be ill but i didnt raise the topic when woolrich wanted to talk about it he would while he ate i recalled the first time that i had met him over the body of jenny ohrbach she had been pretty once a thirtyyearold woman who had kept her figure through regular exercise and a careful diet and who had it emerged lived a life of considerable luxury without any obvious means of support i had stood over her in an upper west side apartment on a cold january night two large bay windows opened out on to a small balcony overlooking seventyninth street and the river two blocks from zabars deli on broadway it wasnt our territory but walter cole and i were there because the initial mo looked like it might have matched two aggravated burglaries we were investigating one of which had led to the death of a young account executive deborah moran all of the cops in the apartment wore coats some with mufflers dangling around their necks the apartment was warm and nobody was in any great hurry to head back out into the cold least of all cole and i despite the fact that this seemed to be a deliberate homicide rather than an aggravated burglary nothing in the apartment appeared to have been touched and a purse containing three credit cards and over seven hundred dollars in cash was found undisturbed in a drawer under the television set someone had brought coffee from zabars and we sipped from the containers our hands cupped around them enjoying the unaccustomed feeling of warmth on our fingers the coroner had almost finished his work and an ambulance team was standing by to remove the body when an untidy figure shambled into the apartment he wore a long brown overcoat the color of beef gravy and the sole of one of his shoes had come adrift from the upper through the gap a red sock and an exposed big toe revealed themselves his tan pants were as wrinkled as a twodayold newspaper and his white shirt had given up the struggle to keep its natural tones settling instead for the unhealthy yellow pallor of a jaundice victim a fedora was jammed on his head i hadnt seen anyone wear a fedora at a crime scene since the last film noir revival at the angelika but it was the eyes that attracted the most attention they were bright and amused and cynical trailing lines like a jellyfish moving through water despite his ramshackle appearance he was clean shaven and his hands were spotless as he took a pair of plastic gloves from his pocket and pulled them on cold as a whores heart out there he remarked squatting down and placing a finger gently beneath jenny ohrbachs chin cold as death i felt a figure brush my arm and turned to see cole standing beside me who the hell are you he asked im one of the good guys responded the figure well im fbi so whatever that makes me in your eyes he flicked his id at us special agent woolrich he rose sighed and pulled the gloves from his hands then thrust both gloves and hands deep into the pockets of his coat what brings you out on a night like this agent woolrich i asked lose the keys to the federal building oh the witty nypd said woolrich with a half smile lucky theres an ambulance standing by in case my sides split he turned his head to one side as he took in the body again you know who she is he asked we know her name but thats it said a detective i didnt recognize i didnt even know her name at that point i knew only that she had been pretty once and now she was pretty no longer she had been beaten around the face and head with a piece of hollowcentered coaxial cable which had been dumped beside her body the cream carpet around her head was stained a deep dark red and blood had splashed on the walls and the expensive and probably uncomfortable white leather furniture shes tommy logans woman said woolrich the garbage collection guy i said the very same tommy logans company had clinched a number of valuable garbage collection contracts in the city over the previous two years tommy had also expanded into the window cleaning business tommys boys cleaned the windows in your building or you didnt have any windows left to clean and possibly no building either anyone with those kinds of contacts had to be connected racketeering interested in tommy it was cole lots of people interested in tommy lot more than usual if his girlfriend is lying dead on the carpet you think maybe someones sending him a message i asked woolrich shrugged maybe maybe someone should have sent him a message telling him to hire a decorator whose eyesight didnt give out the year elvis died he was right jenny ohrbachs apartment was so retro it should have been wearing flares and a goatee not that it mattered to jenny ohrbach any more no one ever found out who killed her tommy logan seemed genuinely shocked when he was told that his girlfriend was dead so shocked he even stopped worrying that his wife might find out about her maybe tommy decided to be more generous to his business partners as a result of jenny ohrbachs death but if he did their arrangement still didnt last much longer one year later tommy logan was dead his throat cut and his body dumped by the borden bridge in queens but woolrich i saw more of our paths crossed on occasion we went for a drink once or twice before i returned home and he went back to his empty apartment in tribeca he produced tickets to a knicks game he came to the house for dinner he gave jennifer an enormous stuffed elephant as a birthday present he watched but did not judge or interfere as i drank myself away shot by shot i have a memory of him at jennys third birthday party a cardboard clowns hat jammed on his head and a bowl of ben amp jerrys cherry garcia ice cream in his hand he looked embarrassed sitting there in his crumpled suit surrounded by threeand fouryearolds and their adoring parents but also strangely happy as he helped small children blow up balloons or drew quarters from behind their ears he did farmyard impressions and taught them how to balance spoons on their noses when he left there was a sadness in his eyes i think he was recalling other birthdays when his child was the center of attention before he lost his way when susan and jennifer died he followed me to the station and waited outside for four hours until they had finished questioning me i couldnt go back to the house and after that first night when i found myself crying in a hospital lobby i couldnt stay with walter cole not only because of his involvement in the investigation but because i did not want to be surrounded by a family not then instead i went to woolrichs small neat apartment the walls lined with books of poetry marvell vaughan richard crashaw herbert jonson and ralegh whose passionate mans pilgrimage he sometimes quoted he gave me his bed on the day of the funeral he had stood behind me in the rain and let the water wash over him the drops falling from the brim of his hat like tears how you doing i asked eventually he puffed his cheeks and breathed out his head moving slightly from side to side like a noddingdog figure on the backseat of a car gray was seeping through his hair from silver pools over his ears there were lines like the cracks in fine china spreading from his eyes and the corners of his mouth not so good he said i got three hours sleep if you can call waking up every twenty minutes to flashes of red sleep i keep thinking of florence and the gun and the way it looked as it slid into her mouth were you still seeing her not so much on and off we got together a coupla times and i was out at the house a few days back to see if everything was okay jesus what a mess he pulled the newspaper toward him and scanned its coverage of the killings his finger moving along the sides of each paragraph so that it became dark with print when he had finished reading he looked at his blackened fingertip rubbed his thumb lightly across it then wiped them both on a paper napkin we got a fingerprint a partial print he said as if the sight of his own lines and whorls had only just reminded him of it outside the tourists and the noise seemed to recede into the distance and there was only woolrich and his soft eyes he drained the last of his coffee then dabbed at his mouth with the napkin thats why i was delayed confirmed it just an hour ago weve compared it against florence s prints but its not her there are traces of the old womans blood in it where did you find it underside of the bed he may have tried to steady himself as he cut or maybe he slipped doesnt look like there was an attempt to erase it were comparing it against local files and our master fingerprint identification records if hes in the system well find him as well as criminals the files covered federal employees aliens military personnel and those individuals who had requested that their prints be retained for identification purposes over the next twentyfour hours the print found at the scene would be checked against about two hundred million others on record if it turned out to be the traveling mans print then it would be the first real break since the deaths of susan and jennifer but i wasnt holding my breath a man who took the time to clean my wifes fingernails after he killed her was unlikely to be so careless as to leave his own fingerprint at a crime scene i looked at woolrich and knew he thought the same thing he raised his hand for more coffee as he looked out at the crowds on jackson square and listened to the snorting of the ponies hitched to the touring carriages pulled up on decatur florenced been shopping in baton rouge earlier in the day then returned home to change for some birthday party one of her second cousins she called you from some juke joint in breaux bridge then went back to the house she stayed there until maybe eightthirty then went to a cousins birthday party at breaux bridge at about nine according to witness statements taken by the local cops she was distracted and didnt stay for longseems that her momma insisted that she go that tee jean could take care of her she stayed one hour maybe ninety minutes then came back brennan the bait shop owner spotted her maybe thirty minutes after that so were looking at a window of one to two hours no more for the killings whos dealing with the case morphys bunch in theory in practice a lot of it is likely to devolve mainly to us since it matches the mo on susan and jennifer and because i want it brillaud is going to hook up your phone in case our man calls itll mean hanging around your hotel room for a while but i dont see what else we can do he avoided my eyes youre cutting me out you cant be too involved in this bird you know that ive told you before and im telling you again well decide the extent of your involvement limited damn yes limited look bird youre the link to this guy hes called once he will call again we wait we see he spread his hands wide she was killed because of the girl are you going to look for the girl woolrich rolled his eyes in frustration look where bird the whole fucking bayou we dont even know that she existed we have a print well run with that and see where it takes us now pay the check and lets get out of here weve got things to do i was staying in a restored greek revival house the flaisance house on esplanade a white mansion filled with dead mens furniture i had opted for a room in the converted carriage house at the rear partly for the seclusion but also because it contained a natural alarm in the form of two large dogs who prowled the courtyard beneath and growled at anyone who wasnt a guest according to the guy manning the night desk in fact the dogs just seemed to sleep a lot in the shade of an old fountain my large room had a balcony a brass ceiling fan two heavy leather armchairs and a small refrigerator which i filled with bottled water when we reached the flaisance woolrich turned on an early morning game show and we waited unspeaking for brillaud to arrive he knocked on the door about twenty minutes later long enough for a woman from tulsa to win a trip to maui brillaud was a small neatly dressed man with receding hair through which he ran his fingers every few minutes as if to reassure himself that there was still some there behind him two men in shirtsleeves awkwardly carried an array of monitoring equipment on a metal trolley carefully negotiating the wooden external stairway that led up to the four carriage house rooms get cooking brillaud said woolrich i hope you brought something to read one of the men in shirtsleeves waved a sheaf of magazines and some battered paperbacks that he had removed from the base of the trolley where will you be if we need you asked brillaud the usual place said woolrich around and then he was gone i had once visited through woolrich an anonymous room in the fbis new york office this was the tech room where the squads engaged in longterm investigationsorganized crime foreign counterintelligencemonitored their wiretaps six agents sat before a row of reeltoreel voiceactivated tape recorders logging the calls whenever the recorders kicked in carefully noting the time the date the subject of the conversation the room was almost silent save for the click and whir of the machines and the sound of pens scratching on paper the feds do love their wiretaps back in when the fbi was called the bureau of investigation the supreme court allowed almost unrestricted access to wiretaps of targets in when the attorney general andrew jackson tried to end wiretapping roosevelt twisted his arm and extended taps to cover subversive activities under hoover s interpretation subversive activities covered anything from running a chinese laundry to screwing someone elses wife hoover was the god of wiretaps now the feds no longer have to squat by junction boxes in the rain trying to protect their notebooks from the elements judicial approval followed by a call to the telephone company in order to have the signal diverted is usually enough its even easier when the subject is willing to cooperate in my case brillaud and his men didnt even have to sit in a surveillance van smelling one anothers sweat i excused myself for five minutes while brillaud worked to hook up both my own cell phone and the room phone telling him that i was just heading for the kitchen of the main house i left the flaisance and strolled through the courtyard attracting a bored glance from one of the dogs huddled in the shadows i walked down to a telephone by a grocery store one block away from there i called angels number the machine was on i left a message telling him the situation and advising him not to call me on the cell phone technically the feds are supposed to engage in minimization on wiretapping or surveillance duties in theory this means that the agents hit the pause button on the recorder and tune out of the conversation apart from occasional checks if it becomes apparent that its a private call unconnected with the business at hand in practice only a moron would assume that his private business would remain private on a tapped line and it seemed unwise for me to have conversations with a burglar and an assassin while the fbi was listening when i had left the message i picked up four coffees in the grocery store reentered the flaisance and went up to my room where an anxiouslooking brillaud was waiting by the door we can order coffee up mr parker he said disapprovingly it never tastes the same i replied get used to it he concluded closing the door behind me the first call came at pm after hours of watching bad tv and reading the problem pages in back issues of cosmo brillaud rose quickly from the bed and clicked his fingers at the technicians one of whom was already tugging at his headphones he counted down from three with his fingers and then signaled me to pick up the cell phone charlie parker it was a womans voice yes its rachel wolfe i looked up at the fbi men and shook my head there was the sound of breath being released i put my hand over the mouthpiece hey minimization remember there was a click as the recorder was turned off brillaud went back to lying on my clean sheets his fingers laced behind his head and his eyes closed rachel seemed to sense that there was something happening at the other end of the line can you talk i have company can i call you back she gave me her home number and told me she planned to be out until pm i could call her then i thanked her and hung up lady friend asked brillaud my doctor i replied i have a low tolerance syndrome she hopes that within a few years ill be able to cope with idle curiosity brillaud sniffed noisily but his eyes stayed closed the second call came at six the humidity and the sound of the tourists had forced us to close the balcony window and the air was sour with male scent this time there was no doubt about the caller welcome to new orleans bird said the synthesized voice in deep tones that seemed to shift and shimmer like mist i paused for a moment and nodded at the fbi men brillaud was already paging woolrich on a computer screen by the balcony i could see maps shifting and i could hear the traveling mans voice coming thinly through the headphones of the fbi men no point in welcoming your fbi friends said the voice this time in the high lilting cadences of a young girls voice is agent woolrich with you i paused again before responding conscious of the seconds ticking by and the number withheld message on the cell phone display dont fuck with me bird still the childs voice but this time in the petulant tones of one who has been told that she cant go out and play with her friends the swearing rendering the effect even more obscene than it already was no hes not here thirty minutes then the connection ended brillaud shrugged he knows he wont stay on long enough to get a fix he lay back down on the bed to wait for woolrich woolrich looked exhausted his eyes were red rimmed from lack of sleep and his breath smelled foul he shifted his feet constantly as if they were too big for his shoes five minutes after he arrived the phone rang again brillaud counted down and i picked up the phone yes dont interrupt just listen it sounded like a womans voice the voice of someone who was about to tell her lover one of her secret fantasies but distorted inhuman im sorry about agent woolrichs lover but only because i missed her she was supposed to be there i had something special planned for her but i suppose she had ideas of her own woolrich blinked hard once but gave no other indication that he was disturbed by what he heard i hope you liked my presentation continued the voice maybe youre even beginning to understand if youre not dont worry theres plenty more to come poor bird poor woolrich united in grief ill try to find you some company then the voice changed again this time it was deep and menacing i wont be calling again its rude to listen in on private conversations the next message you get from me will have blood on it the call ended fuck said woolrich tell me you got something we got nothing said brillaud tossing his headphones on the bed number keeps changing he knows i left the fbi men to pack away their equipment in a white ford van and walked down through the quarter to the napoleon house to call rachel wolfe i didnt want to use the cellular for some reason it seemed soiled by its role as the means of contact with a killer i also wanted the exercise after being cooped up in my room for so long she picked up on the third ring its charlie parker hi she seemed to struggle for a time as she tried to decide what to call me you can call me bird well spotted there was an awkward pause then where are you it sounds incredibly noisy it is its new orleans and then i filled her in as best i could on what had taken place she listened in silence and once or twice i heard a pen tapping rhythmically against the phone at the other end of the line any of those details mean anything to you i asked when i had finished im not sure i seem to recall something from my time as a student but its buried so far back that im not sure that i can find it i think i may have something for you arising out of your previous conversation with this man its a little obscure though she was silent for a moment where are you staying i gave her the number of the flaisance she repeated the name and the number to herself as she wrote them down are you going to call me back no she said im going to make a reservation im coming down i looked around the napoleon after i hung up it was packed with locals and vaguely bohemian looking visitors some of them tourists staying in the rooms above the dimly lit bar a classical piece i couldnt identify was playing over the speakers and smoke hung thick in the air something about the traveling mans calls bothered me although i wasnt sure what he knew i was in new orleans when he made his calls he knew where i was staying too since he was aware of the presence of the feds and that awareness meant that he was familiar with police procedures and was monitoring the investigation which matched rachels profile he had to have been watching the crime scene as we arrived or shortly after his reluctance to stay on the line was understandable given the feds surveillance but that second calli played it back in my mind trying to discern the source of my unease but it yielded nothing i was tempted to stay in the napoleon house to breathe in the sense of life and gaiety in the old bar but instead i returned to the flaisance despite the heat i walked to the large windows opened them and stepped out onto the balcony i looked out at the faded buildings and wrought iron balconies of the upper quarter and breathed deeply of the smells of cooking coming from a restaurant nearby mingled with smoke and exhaust fumes i listened to the strains of jazz music coming from a bar on governor nicholls the shouts and laughter of those heading for the ripoff joints on bourbon street the singsong accents of the locals blending with the voices of the outoftowners the sound of human life passing beneath my window and i thought of rachel wolfe and the way her hair rested on her shoulders and the sprinkling of freckles across her white neck that night i dreamed of an amphitheater with rising aisles filled with old men its walls were hung with damask and two high torches illuminated its central rectangular table with its curved edges and legs carved like bones florence aguillard lay on the table the exterior of her womb exposed while a bearded man in dark robes tore at it with an ivoryhandled scalpel around her neck and behind her ears was the mark of a rope burn her head lay at an impossible angle on the tabletop when the surgeon cut her eels slithered from her uterus and tumbled to the floor and the dead woman opened her eyes and tried to cry out the surgeon stifled her mouth with a burlap sack then continued to cut until the light went from her eyes figures watched from a twilight corner of the amphitheater they came to me from the shadows my wife and child but now they were joined by a third one who stayed farther back in the dimness one who was barely a silhouette she came from a cold wet place and brought with her a dense loamy smell of rotting vegetation of flesh bloated and disfigured by gas and decay the place where she lay was small and cramped its sides unyielding and sometimes the fish bumped against it as she waited i seemed to smell her in my nostrils when i woke and could still hear her voice help me as the blood rushed in my ears im cold help me and i knew that i had to find her i was awakened by the sound of the telephone in my room dim light lanced through the curtains and my watch glowed the time at am i picked up the phone parker its morphy get your ass in gear ill see you at la marquise in an hour i showered dressed and walked down to jackson square following the early morning worshipers into st louis cathedral outside the cathedral a huckster tried to attract worshipers to his fireeating act while a group of black nuns crowded beneath a yellowandgreen parasol susan and i had attended mass here once beneath the cathedrals ornately decorated ceiling depicting christ among the shepherds and above the small sanctuary the figure of the crusader king louis ix roi de france announcing the seventh crusade the cathedral had effectively been rebuilt twice since the original wooden structure designed in burned down during the good friday fire of when over eight hundred buildings went up in flames the present cathedral was less than one hundred and fifty years old its stainedglass windows overlooking the place jeanpaul deux a gift from the spanish government it was strange that i should have remembered the details so clearly after so many years yet i remembered them less for their own intrinsic interest than for their connections to susan i remembered them because she had been with me when i learned them her hand clasped in mine her hair pulled back and tied with an aquamarine bow for a brief moment it seemed that by standing in the same place and remembering the same words spoken i could reach back to that time and feel her close beside me her hand in my hand her taste still on my lips her scent on my neck if i closed my eyes i could imagine her sauntering down the aisle her hand in mine breathing in the mingled smells of incense and flowers passing beneath the windows moving from darkness to light light to darkness i knelt at the back of the cathedral by the statue of a cherub with a font in its hands and its feet upon a vision of evil and i prayed for my wife and child morphy was already at la marquise a frenchstyle patisserie on chartres he was sitting in the rear courtyard his head freshly shaved he wore a pair of gray sweatpants nike sneakers and a timberland fleece top a plate of croissants and two cups of coffee stood on the table before him he was carefully applying grape jelly to one half of a croissant as i sat down across from him i ordered coffee for you take a croissant coffees fine thanks day off nah just avoided the dawn patrol he took the half croissant and stuffed it into his mouth using his finger to cram in the last part he smiled his cheeks bulging my wife wont let me do this at home says it reminds her of a kid hogging food at a birthday party he swallowed and set to work on the remaining half of the croissant st martin s been frozen out of the picture part from running around looking under rocks for bloody clothes he said woolrich and his boys have pretty much taken over the investigation we dont have a helluva lot to do with it anymore legwork excepted i knew what woolrich would be doing the killings of tante marie and tee jean now confirmed the existence of a serial killer the details would be passed on to the fbis investigative support unit the hardpressed section responsible for advising on interrogation techniques and hostage negotiation as well as dealing with vicap abisthe arson and bombing programand crucially for this case criminal profiling of the thirtysix agents in the unit only ten worked on profiling buried in a warren of offices sixty feet below ground in what used to be the fbi directors fallout shelter at quantico and while the feds sifted through the evidence trying to build up their picture of the traveling man the police on the ground continued to search for physical traces of the killer in the area around tante maries house i could picture them already the lines of cops moving through the undergrowth warm green light shedding down upon them from the trees above their feet would be catching in the mud their uniforms snagging on briars as they searched the ground before them others would be working through the green waters of atchafalaya swatting at noseeums and sweating heavily through their shirts there had been a lot of blood at the aguillard house the traveling man must have been awash with it by the time his work was done he must have worn overalls and it would be too risky for him to hold on to them they had either been dumped in the swamp or buried or destroyed my guess was that he had destroyed them but the search had to go on i dont have a helluva lot to do with it anymore either i said i hear that he ate some more croissant and finished off his coffee you finished well get going he left some money on the table and i followed him outside the same battered buick that had followed us to tante maries was parked half a block away a handlettered coponduty sign taped to the dashboard with duct tape a parking ticket flapped beneath the wiper shit said morphy tossing the ticket in a trash can nobody got respect for the law no more we drove to the desire projects a harsh urban landscape where young blacks lounged by rubbishstrewn lots or shot hoops desultorily in wirerimmed courts the twostory blocks were like barracks lining streets with badjoke names like piety abundance and humanity we pulled in near a liquor store which was barricaded like a fortress causing young men to skip away from us at the smell of cop even here morphys trademark bald head appeared to be instantly recognizable you know much about new orleans said morphy after a time nope i replied beneath his fleece top i could see the trademark bulge of his gun the palms of his hands were callused from gripping dumbbells and barbells and even his fingers were thickly muscled when he moved his head muscles and tendons stood out on his neck like snakes moving beneath his skin unlike most bodybuilders there was an air of suppressed danger about morphy a sense that the muscle wasnt just for show i knew that he had killed a man once in a bar in monroe a pimp who had shot up one of his girls and the john she was with in a hotel room in lafayette the pimp a twohundredandtwentypound creole who called himself le mort rouge had stabbed morphy in the chest with a broken bottle and then tried to choke him on the ground morphy after trying punches to the face and body had eventually settled for a grip on le morts neck and the two men had remained like that locked in each others grip until something burst in le morts head and he fell sideways against the bar he was dead by the time the ambulance arrived it had been a fair fight but sitting beside morphy in the car i wondered about luther bordelon he had been a thug that much was certain he had a string of assaults stretching back to his years as a juvenile and he was suspected of the rape of a young australian tourist the girl had failed to identify bordelon in a lineup and no physical evidence of the rapist had been left on the girls body because her assailant had used a condom and then made her wash her pubic region with a bottle of mineral water but the nopd cops knew it was bordelon sometimes thats just the way things are on the night he died bordelon had been drinking in an irish bar in the quarter he was wearing a white tshirt and white nike shorts and three customers in the bar with whom he had been playing pool later swore statements that bordelon had not been armed yet morphy and his partner ray garza reported that bordelon had fired on them when they attempted to routinely question him and that he had been killed in their return of fire a gun an old s ampw model that was at least twenty years old was found by his side with two shots fired the serial number of the gun had been filed away from the frame under the cylinder crane making the gun difficult to identify and ballistics reported that it was clean and had not been previously used in the commission of a crime in the city of new orleans the gun looked like a throwdown and the nopds police integrity division clearly felt that was the case but garza and morphy stuck by their story one year later garza was dead stabbed to death while trying to break up a brawl in the irish channel and morphy had transferred to st martin where he had bought a house that was it that was how it ended morphy gestured toward a group of young blacks the asses of their jeans around their knees and oversized trainers slapping the sidewalk as they walked they returned our gaze unflinchingly as if daring us to make a move on them from a boom box they carried came the sound of the wutang clan music to kick start the revolution i felt a kind of perverse pleasure from recognizing the music charlie parker honorary homeboy morphy grimaced that is the worst goddamn racket i ever heard shit these people invented the blues robert johnson heard that crap hed know for sure that hed sold his soul to the devil and gone straight to hell he turned on his car radio and flicked through the channels with an unhappy look resignedly he pushed in a tape and the warm sound of little willie john filled the car i grew up in metairie before the projects really took hold in this city he began i cant say any of my best friends were black or nothingmost of the blacks went to public schools i didntbut we got along together but when the projects went up that was the end desire iberville lafitte those were places you didnt want to end up less you were armed to the teeth then fucking reagan came along and the place got worse you know they say theres more syphilis now than there was fifty years ago most of these kids aint even been immunized against measles if ya have a house in the inner city might as well abandon it and let it rot it aint worth shit he shook his head and slapped the steering wheel when you got that kind of poverty a man can make a lot of money from it if he puts his mind to it lot of people fighting for a slice of the projects fighting for a slice of other things too land property booze gambling like who like joe bonanno his crews been running things down here for the past decade or so controlling the supply of crack smack whatever they been trying to expand into other areas too theres talk that they want to open a big leisure center between lafayette and baton rouge maybe build a hotel maybe they just want to dump some bricks and mortar there and write it off as a tax loss launder money through it he cast an appraising eye around the projects and this is where joe bones grew up he said this with a sigh as if he could not understand how a man would set out to undermine the place in which he had grown and matured he started the car again and as he drove he told me about joe bones salvatore bonanno joes father had owned a bar in the irish channel standing up against the local gangs who didnt believe that an italian had any place in an area where people named their children after irish saints and an oul sod mentality still prevailed there was nothing particularly honorable about sals stance it was simply born out of pragmatism there was a lot of money to be made in chep morrisons postwar new orleans if a man was prepared to take the knocks and grease the right palms sals bar was to be the first in a string of bars and clubs that he acquired he had loans to pay off and the income from a single bar in the irish channel wasnt going to satisfy his creditors he saved and bought a second bar this time in chartres and from there his little empire grew in some cases only a simple financial transaction was required to obtain the premises he wanted in others some more forceful encouragement had to be used when that didnt work the atchafalaya basin had enough water to hide a multitude of sins gradually he built up his own crew to take care of business to make sure the city authorities the police the mayors office were all kept happy and to deal with the consequences when those lower down the food chain tried to better themselves at sals expense sal bonanno married maria cuffaro a native of gretna east of new orleans whose brother was one of sals righthand men she bore him one daughter who died of tb at the age of seven and a son who died in vietnam she died herself in of breast cancer but sals real weakness was a woman named rochelle hines rochelle was what they called a high yellow woman a negress whose skin was almost white following generations of interbreeding she had as morphy put it a complexion like butter oil although her birth certificate bore the words black illegitimate she was tall with long dark hair framing almond eyes and lips that were soft and wide and welcoming she had a figure that would stop a clock and there were rumors that she might once have been a prostitute although if that was the case sal bonanno quickly put an end to those activities bonanno bought her a place in the garden district and began introducing her as his wife after maria died it probably wasnt a wise thing to do in the louisiana of the late s racial segregation was a daytoday reality even louis armstrong who grew up in the city could not perform with white musicians in new orleans because the state of louisiana prohibited racially integrated bands from playing in the city and so while white men could keep black mistresses and consort with black prostitutes a man who introduced a black woman no matter how pale her skin as his wife was just asking for trouble when she gave birth to a son sal insisted that he bear his name and he took the child and his mother to band recitals in jackson square pushing the huge white baby carriage across the grass and gurgling at his son maybe sal thought that his money would protect him maybe he just didnt care he made sure that rochelle was always protected that she didnt walk out alone so that no one could come at her but in the end they didnt come at rochelle one hot july night in when his son was five years old sal bonanno disappeared he was found three days later tied to a tree by the shore of lake cataouatche his head almost severed from his body it seems likely that someone decided to use his relationship with rochelle hines as an excuse to move in on his operation ownership of his clubs and bars was transferred to a business consortium with interests in reno and vegas as soon as her husband was found rochelle hines vanished with her son and a small quantity of jewelry and cash before anyone could come after them she resurfaced one year later in the area that would come to be called desire where a half sister rented a property the death of sal had destroyed her she was an alcoholic and had become addicted to morphine it was here among the rising projects that joe bones grew up paler yet than his mother and made his stand against both blacks and whites since neither group would accept him as its own there was a rage inside joe bones and he turned it on the world around him by ten years after his mothers death in a filthy cot in the projects joe bones owned more bars than his father had thirty years before and each month planeloads of cocaine flew in from mexico bound for the streets of new orleans and points north east and west now joe bones calls himself a white man and dont nobody differ with him said morphy anyway hows a man gonna talk with his balls in his mouth joe got no time for the brothers now he laughed quietly aint nothin worse than a man who cant get on with his inlaws we stopped at a gas station and morphy filled the tank then came back with two sodas we sipped them by the pumps watching the cars go by now theres another crew the fontenots and they got their eyes on the projects too two brothers david and lionel family was out of lafayette originally i thinkstill got ties therebut came to new orleans in the twenties the fontenots are ambitious violent and they think maybe bonannos time has come all of this has been coming to a head for about a year now and maybe the fontenots have a piece of work planned for joe bones the fontenots were not young menthey were both in their fortiesbut they had gradually established themselves in louisiana and now operated out of a compound in delacroix guarded by wire and dogs and armed men including a hardcore of cajuns from back in acadiana they were into gambling prostitution some drugs they owned bars in baton rouge one or two others in lafayette if they could take out joe bones it was likely that they would muscle in on the drugs market in a big way you know anything about the cajuns asked morphy no not beyond their music theyre a persecuted minority in this state and in texas during the oil boom they couldnt get any work because the texans refused to employ coon asses most of them did what we all do when times are tough they knuckled down and made the best of things there were clashes with the blacks because the blacks and the cajuns were competing for the same few jobs and some bad things went down but most people just did what they could to keep body and soul together without breaking too many laws roland fontenotthats the grandfatherhe left all that behind when he came to new orleans following some other obscure branch of the family but the boys they never forgot their roots when things were bad in the seventies they gathered a pretty disaffected bunch around thema lot of young cajuns some blacksand somehow kept the mixture from blowing up in their faces morphy drummed his fingers on the dashboard sometimes i think maybe were all responsible for the fontenots theyre a visitation on us because of the way their people were treated i think maybe joe bones is a visitation too a reminder of what happens when you grind a section of the population into the dirt joe bones had a vicious streak said morphy he once killed a man by slowly burning him with acid over the space of an afternoon and was thought by some to be missing part of his brain the part that controlled unreasonable actions in most men the fontenots were different they killed but they killed like businessmen closing down an unprofitable or unsatisfactory operation they killed joylessly but professionally in morphys view the fontenots and joe bones were all bad they just had different ways of expressing it i finished my soda and trashed the can morphy wasnt the type to spin a yarn for its own sake all of this was leading up to something whats the point morphy i asked the point is the fingerprint that was found at tante maries belongs to tony remarr hes one of joe boness men i thought about that as he started the car and pulled into the street trying to match the name to any incident that might have occurred back in new york anything that might connect me to remarr i found nothing you think he did it morphy asked do you no no way at first i thought yeah maybe you know the old woman she owned that land wouldnt have taken much drainage work to make something of it if a man was considering opening a big hotel and building a leisure center exactly or if he wanted to convince someone he was serious enough about it to dump some bricks there i mean swamps swamp assuming he could get permission to build who wants to share the warm evening air with critters even god regrets making anyway the old woman wouldnt sell she was shrewd her people have been buried out there for generations the original landowner an old southern type who traced his ancestry back to the bourbons died in sixtynine he stipulated in his will that the land should be offered for sale at a reasonable rate to the existing tenants now most of the tenants were aguillards and they bought that land with all the money they had the old woman she made all the decisions for them their ancestors are there and they have a history with that land going back to the time when they wore chains around their ankles and dug channels through the dirt with their bare hands so bonanno had been putting pressure on her to sell up but she wouldnt so he decided to take things a step further i said morphy nodded i figure maybe remarr was sent out to put more than pressure on hermaybe hes going to threaten the girl or some of the children maybe even kill one of thembut when he arrives shes already dead and maybe remarr gets careless from the shock thinks he hasnt left any traces and heads off into the night does woolrich know all this most of it yeah you bringing bonanno in brought him in last night and let him go an hour later accompanied by a fancy lawyer called rufus thibodeaux he aint movin says he aint seen remarr for three or four days says he wants to find remarr as much as anyone something about money from some deal out in west baton rouge its bullshit but hes sticking with the story i think woolrich is going to try to put some pressure on his operations through antiracketeering and narcotics put the squeeze on him to see if he can change his mind that could take time you got a better idea i shrugged maybe morphys eyes narrowed you dont be fuckin with joe bones now yhear joe aint like your boys back in new york sittin in social clubs in little italy with their fingers curled around the handles of espresso cups dreaming about the days when everyone respected them joe dont got no time for that joe dont want folks to respect him joe wants folks to be scared to death of him we turned onto esplanade morphy signaled and pulled in about two blocks from the flaisance he stared out the window tapping the index finger of his right hand against the steering wheel to some internal rhythm in his head i sensed he had something more to say i decided to let him say it in his own time youve spoken to this guy the guy who took your wife and kid right i nodded its the same guy the same guy who did tee jean and the old woman he called me yesterday its him he say anything the feds have it on tape he says hes going to do more morphy rubbed the back of his neck with his hand and squeezed his eyes shut tightly i knew he was seeing tante marie in his head again you going to stay here for a while yes could be the feds aint gonna like it i smiled i know morphy smiled back he reached beneath his seat and handed me a long brown envelope ill be in touch he said i slipped the envelope under my jacket and stepped from the car he gave a small wave as he drove away through the midday crowd i opened the envelope in my hotel room inside were a set of crime scene pictures and photocopied extracts of the police reports all stapled together stapled separately was a copy of the coroners report one section had been emphasized with a luminous yellow felt tip the coroner had found traces of ketamine hydrochloride in the bodies of tante marie and tee jean equivalent to a dosage of one milligram per two pounds of weight according to the report ketamine was an unusual drug a special type of anesthetic used for some minor surgical procedures no one was too clear on its precise mode of action apart from the fact that it was a pcp analogue and worked on sites in the brain affecting the central nervous system it was becoming the drug of choice in the clubs of new york and la while i was still on the force usually in capsules or tabs made by heating the liquid anesthetic to evaporate the water leaving ketamine crystals users described a ketamine trip as swimming in the k pool since it distorted the perception of the body creating a feeling that the user was floating in a soft yet supportive medium other side effects included hallucinations distortions in the perception of space and time and outofbody experiences what the coroner did note was that ketamine could be used as a chemical restrainer on animals since it induced paralysis and dulled pain while allowing the normal pharyngeallaryngeal reflexes to continue it was for this purpose he surmised that the killer had injected both tante marie and tee jean aguillard with the drug when they were flayed and anatomized the report concluded tante marie and her son had been fully conscious when i had finished reading the coroners report i put on my sweats and running shoes and did about four miles on riverfront park back and forth past the crowds lining up to take a trip on the natchez paddle steamer the sound of its wheezing calliope sending tunes like messengers across the mississippi i was thick with sweat when i was done and my knees ached even three years ago four miles wouldnt have troubled me to such a degree i was getting old soon id be looking at wheelchairs and feeling impending rain in my joints back at the flaisance rachel wolfe had left a message to say that she would be flying in later that evening the flight number and the arrival time were listed at the bottom of the message slip i thought about joe bones and decided then that rachel wolfe might like some company on the flight down to new orleans i called angel and louis the aguillard family collected the bodies of tante marie tee jean and florence later that day a firm of lafayette undertakers placed tante maries coffin into a wideback hearse tee jean and florence lay side by side in a second the aguillards led by the eldest son raymond and accompanied by a small group of family friends followed the hearses in a trio of pickup trucks darkskinned men and women seated on pieces of sackcloth amid machine parts and farm tools i stayed behind them as they slipped from the highway and made their way down the rutted track past tante maries where the police tape fluttered lightly in the breeze and on to the house of raymond aguillard he was a tall largeboned man in his late forties or early fifties running to fat now but still an imposing figure he wore a dark cotton suit a white shirt and a slim black tie his eyes were red rimmed from crying i had seen him briefly at tante maries the night the bodies were found a strong man trying to hold his family together in the face of violent loss he spotted me as the coffins were unloaded and carried toward the house a small group of men struggling with tante marie i stood out since i was the only white face in the crowd a woman probably one of tante maries daughters shot me a cold look as she passed by a pair of older women at each shoulder when the bodies had been carried into the house a raised slattedwood building not unlike the home of tante marie herself raymond kissed a small cross around his neck and walked slowly toward me i know who you are he said as i extended my hand he paused for a moment before taking it in a short firm grip im sorry i said sorry about it all he nodded i know that he walked on past the white fence at the boundary of the house and stood by the side of the road staring out at the empty stretch of track a pair of mallards flew overhead their wing beats slowing as they approached the water below raymond watched them with a kind of envy the envy that a man deeply grieving feels for anything untouched by his sorrow some of my sisters they think maybe you brought this man with you they think you got no right to be here is that what you think he didnt answer then she felt him comin maybe thats why she sent florence to the party to get her away from him and thats why she sent for you she felt him comin and i think she knowed who he was deep down i think she knowed his voice sounded thick in his throat he fingered the cross gently rubbing his thumb back and forth along its length i could see that it had originally been ornately carvedit was still possible to discern some details of spirals at its edgesbut for the most part it had been rubbed smooth by the action of this mans hand over many years i dont blame you for what happened to my momma and my brother and sister my momma she always done what she believed was right she wanted to find that girl and to stop the man that killed her and that tee jean he smiled sadly the policeman said that hed been hit three maybe four times from behind and there were still bruises on his knuckles where he tried to fight this man raymond coughed and then breathed deeply through his mouth his head tipped back slightly like a man who has run a great distance in pain he took your woman your child he said it was as much a statement as a question but i answered it anyway yes he took them like you said tante marie believed that he took another girl too he dug the thumb and forefinger of his right hand into the corners of his eyes and blinked out a tear i know i seen her the world around me seemed to grow silent as i shut out the noise of the birds the wind in the trees the distant sound of water splashing on the banks all i wanted to hear was raymond aguillards voice you saw the girl thats what i said down by a slough in honey island three nights ago night before my momma died seen her other times too my sisters husband he got hisself some traps down there he shrugged honey island was a nature reserve you a superstitious man mista parker im getting there i replied you think thats where she is down in honey island could be my mommad say she didnt know where she was just that she was she knew the girl was out there somewhere i just dont know how mista parker i never did understand my mommas gift but then i seen her a figure out by a cypress grove and a kinda darkness over her face like a hand was coverin it and i knowed it was her he looked down and with the toe of his shoe began picking at a stone embedded in the dirt when he eventually freed it sending it skidding into the grass tiny black ants scurried and crawled from the hole the entrance to their nest now fully exposed other people seen her too i hear folks out fishin or checking the hooch they got distillin in a shack somewheres he watched as the ants swarmed around his foot some of them climbing onto the rim of his sole gently he lifted his foot shook it and moved it away there were seventy thousand acres of honey island raymond explained it was the secondbiggest swamp in louisiana forty miles long and eight miles wide it was part of the floodplain of the pearl river which acts as a boundary line between louisiana and mississippi honey island was better preserved than the florida everglades there was no dredging allowed no draining or timber farming no development and no dams and parts of honey island werent even navigable half of it was state owned some was the responsibility of the nature conservancy if someone was trying to dump a body in a place where it was unlikely to be discovered then tourist boats apart honey island sounded like a good place to do it raymond gave me directions to the slough and drew a rough map on the back of an openedout marlboro pack mista parker i know youre a good man and that youre sorry for what happened but id be grateful to you if you didnt come out here no more he spoke softly but there was no mistaking the force in his voice and maybe youd be kind enough not to turn up at the burial my family its gonna take us a long time to get over this then he lit the last cigarette from the pack nodded a goodbye and walked back to his house trailing smoke behind him i watched him as he walked away a woman with steelgray hair came out to the porch and placed her arm around his waist when he reached her he put a big arm around her shoulders and held her to him as they walked into the house the screen door closing gently behind them and i thought of honey island and the secrets that it held beneath its green waters as i drove away from the aguillard house the dust rising behind me as i drove the swamp was already preparing to reveal its secrets honey island would yield a body within twentyfour hours but it would not be the body of a girl i arrived early at moisant field so i browsed around the bookstore for a while taking care to avoid tripping over the piles of anne rice novels i had been sitting in the arrivals terminal for about an hour when rachel wolfe walked through the gates she was wearing dark blue jeans white sneakers and a redandwhite polo sport top her red hair hung loose on her shoulders and her makeup had been so carefully applied that it was almost indiscernable the only luggage she carried herself was a brown leather shoulder bag the rest of what i took to be her belongings was being toted by angel and louis who walked slightly selfconsciously at either side of her louis in a cream doublebreasted suit with a snow white dress shirt open at the neck angel in jeans battered reebok hightops and a green check shirt that had not felt an iron since it left the factory many years before well well i said as they stood before me all human life is here angel raised his right hand from which dangled three thick piles of books tied together by string the ends of his fingers were turning purple we brought half the new york public library with us as well he groaned tied with string i aint seen books tied with string since little house on the prairie stopped reruns louis i noticed was carrying a ladys pink umbrella and a cosmetics case he had the look of a man who is trying to pretend that a dog isnt screwing his leg dont say a word man he warned not a word between them the two men also carried two suitcases two leather traveling bags and a suit carrier cars parked outside i said as i walked with rachel to the exit might be just enough room for the bags they paged me at the airport whispered rachel they were very helpful she giggled and glanced over her shoulder behind us i heard the unmistakable sound of angel tripping on a bag and swearing loudly we ditched the luggage at the flaisance despite louiss stated preference for the fairmont at university place the fairmont was where the republicans usually stayed when they hit new orleans which was part of its appeal for louis he was the only gay black republican criminal i knew gerald ford stayed at the fairmont he lamented as he surveyed the small suite he was to share with angel so i countered paul mccartney stayed at the richelieu and you dont hear me demanding to stay there i left the door open and headed back to my own room for a shower paul who said louis we ate in the grill room of the windsor court on gravier street in deference to louiss wishes its marbled floors and heavy austrian drapes strangely uncomfortable for me after the informal setting of the smaller eateries in the quarter rachel had changed into dark pants and a black jacket over a red top it looked fine but the hot night air had taken its toll on her and she was still pulling the damp cloth of her top away from her body as we waited for the main courses as we ate i explained to them about joe bones and the fontenots they would be a matter for angel louis and me rachel remained silent for much of our conversation interjecting occasionally to clarify things that had been said by woolrich or morphy she scribbled notes in a small wirebound notebook her handwriting neat and even at one point her hand brushed my bare arm lightly and she left it there for an instant her skin warm against mine i watched angel pulling at his lip as he considered what i had said this remarr must be pretty dumb dumber than our guy at least he said eventually because of the print i said he nodded careless very careless he wore the dissatisfied look of a respected theologian who has seen someone bring his calling into disrepute by identifying jesus as an alien rachel spotted the look it seems to bother you a lot she commented i glanced at her she had an amused expression on her face but her eyes were calculating and slightly distant she was playing over in her mind what i had told her even as she engaged angel in a conversation that he would usually have avoided i waited to see how he would respond he smiled at her and tilted his head i have a certain professional interest in these things he admitted he cleared a space in front of him and held up his hands before us anyone doing a b ampe jobthats breaking and entering for the benefit of our more respectable listenerneeds to take certain precautions began angel the first and most obvious is to make sure that heor she b ampe being an equal opportunity professiondoesnt leave any fingerprints so what do you do you wear gloves said rachel she leaned forward now enjoying the lesson and putting aside any other thoughts right nobody no matter how dumb enters a place he shouldnt be without wearing gloves otherwise you leave visuals you leave latents you pretty much sign your name and confess to the crime visuals are the visible marks left on surfaces by a dirty or bloody hand latents the invisible marks left by natural secretions of the skin visuals can be photographed or lifted using adhesive tape but latents need to be dusted typically with a chemical reagent like iodine vapor or ninhydrin solution electrostatic and fluorescence techniques are also useful and in the search for latents on human skin specialized xray photography can be used but if what angel had said was correct remarr was too much of a professional to risk a job without gloves and then to leave not merely a latent but a visual he must have been wearing gloves but something had gone wrong you working it through in your head bird smirked angel go on sherlock baffle us with your brilliance i responded his smirk widened to a grin and he continued its possible to get a fingerprint from inside a glove assuming you have the glove rubber or plastic gloves are best for obtaining prints your hands get sweaty under them but what most people dont know is that the exterior surface of a glove can act like a fingerprint as well say its a leather glove then you got wrinkles you got holes you got scars you got tears and no two leather gloves are gonna be the same now in the case of this guy remarr what we have is a print and no gloves unless remarr cant tie his shoelaces without falling over we know that he was probably wearing gloves but he still manages to leave a print its a mystery he made a small exploding gesture with his hands like a magician making a rabbit disappear in a puff of smoke then his face became serious my guess is that remarr was wearing only a single pair of gloves probably latex he imagined this was going to be an easy job either he was gonna off the old lady and her son or he was gonna put the frighteners on her maybe leave a calling card in the house since the son from what i hear wasnt the kind of guy to let anyone frighten his momma id say remarr went in there thinking that he might have to kill someone but when he arrives theyre either dead or theyre in the process of being killed again my guess is they were already dead if remarr stumbled in on the killer remarr would be dead as well so remarr is going in his one pair of gloves on and maybe he spots the kid and it throws him he probably starts to sweat he goes into the house and finds the old lady bam second shock but he goes to take a closer look steadying himself as he leans over her he touches blood and maybe considers wiping it away but he figures wiping it away will only attract more attention to it and anyway hes got his gloves but the problem with latex gloves is that one pair isnt enough you wear them for too long and your prints start coming through you get thrown you start to sweat the prints are gonna come through faster could be remarr has been eating before he came out maybe some fruit or some kind of pasta with vinegar that causes extra moisture on the skin so now remarr is in real trouble hes left a print he doesnt even know about and now the cops the feds and difficult people like our good selves want to ask him about it tada he gave a small bow from the waist rachel gave him a round of applause louis just raised an eyebrow in resignation fascinating said rachel you must read a lot of books her tone was heavily ironic he does then barnes and noble gonna be grateful that their stolen stock being put to good use remarked louis angel ignored him maybe i dabbled in these things in my younger days did you learn anything else in your younger days rachel smiled lot of things some of them hard lessons said angel with feeling best thing i ever learned dont hold on to nothin if you dont have it cant nobody prove you took it and i have been tempted there was this figure of a knight on a horse once french seventeenth century gold inlaid with diamonds and rubies about this tall he held the palm of his hand flat about six inches above the table it was the most beautiful thing i ever saw his eyes lit up at the memory he looked like a child he sat back in his chair but i let it go in the end you have to let things go the things you regret are the things you hold on to so is nothing worth holding on to asked rachel angel looked at louis for a while some things are yeah but they aint made of gold thats so romantic i said louis made choking noises as he tried to swallow his water before us the remains of our coffee lay cold in the cups do you have anything to add i asked rachel when angel had finished playing to the gallery she glanced back through her notes her brow furrowed slightly she held a glass of red wine in one hand and the light caught it reflecting a streak of red across her breast like a wound you said you had pictures crime scene pictures she asked i nodded then id like to hold off until ive had a chance to see them i have an idea based on what you told me over the phone but id prefer to keep it to myself until ive seen the pictures and done a little more research i do have one thing though she took a second notebook from her bag and flicked through the pages to where a yellow postit note stuck out i lusted for her but that has always been a weakness of my kind she read our sin was not pride but lust for humanity she turned to me but i already recognized the words they were the words this traveling man said to you when he called she said i was aware of angel and louis moving forward in their chairs it took a theologian in the archbishops residence to track down the reference its pretty obscure at least if youre not a theologian she paused then asked why was the devil banished from heaven pride said angel i remember sister agnes telling us that it was pride said louis he glanced at angel i remember milton telling us that anyway said rachel pointedly youre right or partially right from augustine onward the devils sin is pride but before augustine there was a different viewpoint up until the fourth century the book of enoch was considered to be part of the biblical canon its origins are a matter of disputeit may have been written in hebrew or aramaic or a combination of bothbut it does seem to have provided a basis for some concepts that are still found in the bible today the last judgment may have been based on the similitudes of enoch the fiery hell ruled by satan also appears for the first time in enoch what is interesting for us is that enoch takes a different view of the devils sin she turned a page of her notebook and began to read again and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose she looked up again now thats from genesis which derives from a similar source as enoch the sons of god were the angels who gave in to sexual lust against the will of god the leader of the sinning angels the devil was cast into a dark hole in the desert and his accomplices were thrown into the fire for their punishment their offspring evil spirits upon the earth went with them the martyr justin believed that the children of the union between angels and human women were responsible for all evil on the earth including murder in other words lust was the sin of the devil lust for humanity the weakness of our kind she closed the notebook and permitted herself a small smile of triumph so this guy believes hes a demon said angel eventually or the offspring of an angel added louis depends on how you look at it whatever he is or thinks he is the book of enoch is hardly likely to turn up on oprahs book choice i said any idea what his source might have been rachel reopened the notebook the most recent reference i could find is a nineteen eightythree new york edition the old testament pseudepigrapha enoch edited by a guy called isaac appropriately enough she said theres also an older translation from oxford published in nineteen thirteen by r h charles i noted the names maybe morphy or woolrich can check with the university of new orleans see if anyone local has been expressing an interest in the obscure end of biblical studies woolrich might be able to extend the search to the other universities its a start we paid the bill and left angel and louis headed off toward the lower quarter to check out the gay night life while rachel and i walked back to the flaisance we didnt speak for a time both of us conscious that we were on the verge of some intimacy i get the feeling that i shouldnt ask what those two currently do for a living said rachel as we paused at a crossing probably not its best to view them as independent operators and leave it at that she smiled they seem to have a certain loyalty to you its unusual im not sure that i understand it ive done things for them in the past but if there ever was a debt it was paid a long time ago i owe them a lot but theyre still here they still help when theyre asked i dont think thats entirely because of me they do what they do because they like it it appeals to their sense of adventure of danger in their own separate ways theyre both dangerous men i think thats why they came they sensed danger and they wanted to be part of it maybe they see something of that in you i dont know maybe they do we walked through the courtyard of the flaisance stopping only to pat the dogs her room was three doors down from mine between our rooms were the room shared by angel and louis and one unoccupied single room she opened the door and stood at the threshold from inside i could feel the coolness of the airconditioning and could hear it pumping at full power im still not sure why youre here i said my throat felt dry and part of me was not certain that it wanted to hear an answer im still not sure either she said she stood on her toes and kissed me gently softly on the lips and then she was gone i went to my room took a book of sir walter raleghs writings from my bag and headed back out to the napoleon house where i took a seat by the portrait of the little corporal i didnt want to lie on my bed conscious of the presence of rachel wolfe so near to me i was excited and troubled by her kiss and by the thought of what might follow almost until the very end susan and i had enjoyed an incredible intimacy together when my drinking truly began to take its toll on us that intimacy had disintegrated when we made love it was no longer totally giving instead we seemed to circle each other warily in our lovemaking always holding something back always expecting trouble to rear its head and cause us to spring back into the security of our own selves but i had loved her i had loved her until the end and i still loved her now when the traveling man had taken her he had severed the physical and emotional ties between us but i could still feel the remains of those ties raw and pulsing at the very extremity of my senses maybe this is common to all those who lose someone whom they have loved deeply making contact with another potential partner another lover becomes an act of reconstruction a building not only of a relationship but also of oneself but i felt myself haunted by my wife and child i felt them not only as an emptiness or a loss but as an actual presence in my life i seemed to catch glimpses of them at the edges of my existence as i drifted from consciousness to sleep from sleep to waking sometimes i tried to convince myself that they were simply phantoms of my guilt creations born of some psychological imbalance yet i had heard susan speak through tante marie and once like a memory from a delirium i had awakened in the darkness to feel her hand on my face and i had caught a trace of her scent beside me in the bed more than that i saw traces of susan and jennifer in every young wife in each female child in a young womans laughter i heard the voice of my wife in the footsteps of a little girl i heard the echo of my daughters shoes i felt something for rachel wolfe a mixture of attraction and gratitude and desire i wanted to be with her but only i thought when my wife and child were at peace david fontenot died that night his car a vintage jensen interceptor was found on the road that skirts honey island and leads down to the shores of the pearl the front tires of the car were flat and the doors were hanging open the windshield had been shattered and the interior was peppered with millimeter holes the two st tammany cops followed a trail of broken branches and flattened scrub to an old trappers shack made of bits of salvaged wood its tin roof almost obscured by overhanging spanish moss it overlooked a bayou lined with gum trees its waters thick with lime green duckweed and ringing with the sound of mallards and wood ducks the shack had been abandoned for a long time few people now trapped in honey island most had moved farther out into the bayous hunting beaver deer and in some cases alligators there were noises coming from the shack as the party approached sounds of scuffling and thudding and heavy snorting drifting through the open door hog said one of the deputies beside him the local bank official who had called them in flicked the safety on his ruger rifle shit that wont do no good against no hog said the second deputy the local a thickset balding man in a tulane green wave tshirt and an almost unused hunting jacket reddened he was carrying a v with a telescopic sight what they used to call in maine a varmint rifle it was good for small game and some police forces even used it as a sniper rifle but it wouldnt stop a feral hog first time unless the shot was perfect they were only a few feet away from the shack when the hog sensed them it erupted from the open door its tiny vicious eyes wild and blood dripping from its snout the man with the ruger dived into the bayou waters to avoid it as it came at him the hog spun cornered at the waters edge by the party of armed men then lowered its head and charged again there was an explosion in the bayou then a second and the hog went down most of the top of its head was gone and it twitched briefly on the ground pawing at the dirt until eventually it ceased to move the deputy blew smoke theatrically from the long barrel of a colt anaconda ejected the spent magnum cartridges with the ejector rod then reloaded jesus said the voice of his partner he was standing in the open doorway of the shack his gun by his side hog sure got at him but its dave fontenot all right the hog had ruined most of fontenots face and part of his right arm was gnawed away but even the damage caused by the hog couldnt disguise the fact that someone had forced david fontenot from his car hunted him through the trees and then cornered him in the shack where he was shot in the groin the knees the elbows and the head mon said the hog killer exhaling deeply when lionel hears about this theres gonna be hell to pay i learned most of what had taken place during a hurried telephone conversation with morphy and a little more from wdsu the local nbc affiliate afterward angel louis and i breakfasted at mothers on poydras street rachel had barely worked up the energy to answer the phone when we called her room and had decided to sleep on and eat later in the morning louis dressed in an ivorycolored linen suit and a white tshirt shared my bacon and homemade biscuits washed down with strong coffee angel opted for ham eggs and grits old folks eat grits angel said louis old folks and the insane angel wiped a white grit trail from his chin and gave louis the finger hes not so eloquent first thing in the morning said louis rest of the day he dont have no excuse angel gave louis the finger again scraped the last of the grits from the bowl and pushed it away so you figure joe bones took a preemptive strike against the fontenots he said looks that way i replied morphy figures he used remarr to do the jobpulled him out of hiding then squirreled him away again he wouldnt entrust a job like that to anyone else but i dont understand what david fontenot was doing out by honey island without any backup he must have known that joe bones would take a crack at him if the opportunity arose could be one of his own people set him up hauled him out there on some deadend pretext and let joe bones know he was coming said angel it sounded plausible if someone had drawn fontenot out to honey island then it must have been someone he trusted enough to make the trip more to the point that someone must have been offering something that fontenot wanted something to make him risk the drive to the reserve late at night i said nothing to angel or louis but i was troubled that both raymond aguillard and david fontenot had in their own different ways drawn my attention to honey island in a period of less than one day i thought that after i had spoken to joe bones i might have to disturb lionel fontenot in his time of grief my cell phone rang it was the desk clerk from the flaisance informing us that a delivery addressed to a mr louis had arrived and a courier was waiting for us to sign we took a taxi back to the hotel outside a black transit van was parked with two wheels on the curb courier said louis but there were no markings on the van nothing to identify it as a commercial vehicle in the lobby the desk clerk sat nervously watching a huge black man who was squeezed into an easy chair he was shavenheaded and wearing a black tshirt with klan killer written in jagged white writing across the chest his black combat trousers were tucked into ninehole army boots at his feet lay a long steel container locked and bolted brother louis he said rising louis took out his wallet and handed over three hundreddollar bills the man tucked the money into the thigh pocket of his combats removed a pair of rayban sunglasses from the same pocket and put them on before strolling out into the sunlight louis motioned to the container if you gentlemen would like to take that up to the room he said angel and i took an end each and followed him up to the suite the case was heavy and something inside rattled as we walked those ups couriers are sure getting bigger i said as i waited for him to open the door its a specialized service said louis there are some things the airlines just wouldnt understand when he had closed and locked the door behind us he took a set of keys from the pocket of his suit and opened the case it was separated into three layers which opened up like those in a tool kit on the first layer were the constituent parts of a mauser sp a threeround heavybarreled sniper rifle with a combined muzzle brake and flash hider the parts were packed in a removable case beside it a sig p pistol and a shoulder holster lay in a fitted compartment in the second compartment sat two calico ma minisubs made in the good old us of a each handheld sub fitted with a short barrel that extended less than an inch and a half beyond the fore end with the stock retracted each gun measured a little over two feet in length and empty weighed just under five pounds they were exceptionally lethal little guns with a rate of fire of seven hundred and fifty rounds per minute the third compartment contained an array of ammunition including four onehundredround magazines of millimeter parabellum for the subs christmas present i asked yup said louis loading a fifteenround magazine into the butt of the sig im hoping to get a rail gun for my birthday he handed angel the case containing the mauser slipped on the holster and inserted the sig he then relocked the case and went into the bathroom as we watched he removed the paneling from beneath the sink with a screwdriver and shoved the case into the gap before replacing the panel when he was satisfied that it was back in place we left you think joe bones will be pleased to see a bunch of strangers show up on his doorstep asked angel as we walked to my rental we aint strangers said louis were just friends he aint met yet joe bones owned three properties in louisiana including a weekend house at cypremort point where his presence must have made the more respectable weekenders with their expensive holiday houses bearing jokey names like eauxasis and end of the trail distinctly uneasy his city residence lay across from audubon park almost opposite the bus stop for the shuttle bus that took tourists to the new orleans zoo i had taken a trip on the st charles streetcar to inspect the house a brilliantly white confection adorned with black wrought iron balconies and a cupola topped with a gold weather vane finding joe bones inside a place like that was like finding a cockroach in a wedding cake in the carefully maintained garden a flower i couldnt identify bloomed lushly its scent was sickly and heavy its flower so large and red that it seemed more rotten than blooming as if the flowers themselves might suddenly burst and send thick fluid down the branches of the plant poisoning the aphids joe bones had deserted the house for the summer in favor of a restored plantation house out in west feliciana parish over one hundred miles north of new orleans as impending hostilities with the fontenots grew more and more likely the decision to remain in west feliciana allowed him to defend the country house with more force than he could in the city it was a white eightcolumned mansion set on about forty acres bordered at two sides by an expanse of river flowing south toward the mississippi four large windows looked out on a wide gallery and the house was topped by two dormer windows set into its roof an avenue of oaks led from a black iron gate through grounds set with camellias and azaleas until the trees stopped before a wide expanse of lawn on the lawn a small group of people stood around a barbecue or lounged on iron lawn furniture i spotted three security cameras within ten feet of the gate when we drew up sideon we had dropped angel about half a mile back after cruising by the house once and i knew he was already making for the stand of cypress that stood opposite the gate in the event of anything going down with joe bones i decided that i had a better chance of dealing with it with louis rather than angel by my side a fourth camera overlooked the gate itself there was no intercom and the gate remained resolutely closed even when louis and i leaned against the car and waved after two or three minutes a converted golf cart came from behind the house and hummed down the oaklined avenue toward us three men in chinos and sports shirts stepped from it they made no attempt to hide their steyr machine pistols hi i said were here to see joe bones there aint no joe bones here said one of the men he was tanned and short no more than fivesix his hair was braided tightly against his scalp giving him a reptilian appearance how about mr joseph bonanno is he there what are you cops were concerned citizens we were hoping mr bones would make a donation to the david fontenot funeral fund he already gave said the guy by the golf cart a fatter version of the lizard man his colleagues at the gate laughed fit to burst a gut i moved closer to the gate lizard mans gun came up quickly tell joe bones that charlie parker is here that i was in the aguillard house on sunday night and that im looking for remarr you think funny man back there can remember all that he stepped back from the gate and without taking his eyes off us relayed what i had said to the guy by the golf cart he took a walkietalkie from the rear seat spoke into it for a moment and then nodded at lizard man he says let em through ricky okay said ricky taking a remote signaler from his pocket step back from the gate turn around and put your hands against the car you packing then tell me now i find anything you havent told me about i put a bullet in your head and feed you to the gators we owned up to a smith amp wesson and a sig between us louis threw in an ankle knife for good measure we left the car at the gate and walked behind the golf cart toward the house one man sat in the back with his pistol pointing at us while ricky walked behind us as we neared the lawn i could smell shrimp and chicken cooking on the barbecue an iron table held an assortment of spirits and glasses abita and heineken lay in a steel cooler packed with ice from the side of the house came a low growl deep with viciousness and menace at the end of a strong chain which was anchored to a bolt set in concrete was a huge animal it had the thick coat of a wolf flecked with the coloring of an alsatian its eyes were bright and intelligent which rendered its obvious savagery all the more threatening it looked like it weighed at least one hundred and eighty pounds each time it tugged at its chain it threatened to wrench the bolt from the ground i noticed that it seemed to be directing most of its attention at louis its eyes focused on him intently and at one point it raised itself up on its hind legs in its efforts to strike at him louis looked at it with the detached interest of a scientist finding a curious new type of bacteria growing in his petri dish joe bones speared a piece of spiced chicken with a fork and placed it on a china plate he was only slightly taller than ricky with long dark hair swept back from his forehead his nose had been broken at least once and a small scar twisted his upper lip on the left side his white shirt was open to the waist and hung over a pair of lycra running shorts his stomach was hard and muscular his chest and arms slightly overdeveloped for a man of his height he looked mean and intelligent like the animal on the chain which probably explained how he had lasted for ten years at the top of the heap in new orleans he placed some tomatoes lettuce and cold rice mixed with peppers beside the chicken and handed the plate to a woman seated nearby she was older than joe i guessed probably in her early or midforties there was no darkness at her blond roots and she wore little or no makeup although her eyes were obscured by a pair of wayfarers she wore a shortsleeved silk robe over a white blouse and white shorts like joe bones she was barefoot to one side of them stood two more men in shirts and chinos each armed with a machine pistol i counted two more on the balcony and one sitting beside the main door to the house you want something to eat asked joe bones his voice was low with only a faint trace of louisiana in it he looked at me until i responded no thanks i said i noticed that he didnt offer any to louis i think louis noticed too joe bones helped himself to some shrimp and salad then motioned to the two guards to help themselves to what was left they took turns to do so each eating a breast of chicken with his fingers those aguillard murders a terrible thing said joe bones he waved me toward the only empty seat left after he sat down i exchanged a look with louis shrugged and sat excuse me for presuming on an intimacy with you he continued but i hear that the same man may have been responsible for the deaths of your family he smiled almost sympathetically a terrible thing he repeated a terrible thing i held his gaze youre well informed about my past when someone new comes to town and starts finding bodies in trees i like to make it my business to find out about them they might be good company he picked a piece of shrimp from his plate and examined it briefly before starting to eat i understand you had an interest in purchasing the aguillards land i said joe bones sucked at the shrimp and placed the tail carefully to one side of his plate before responding i have a lot of interests and that wasnt aguillard land just because some senile fuck decides to make up for a bad life by slipping land to the niggers doesnt make it nigger land he spat the word nigger each time his shell of courtesy had proved remarkably fragile and he seemed intent upon deliberately provoking louis it was an unwise course of action even with guns around him it seems that one of your men tony remarr may have been in the house the night that the aguillards died wed be interested in talking to him tony remarr is no longer part of my operation said joe bones returning to his formal mode of speech after the burst of profanity we agreed a mutual parting of the ways and i havent seen him in weeks i had no idea he was in the aguillard house until the police told me he smiled at me i smiled back did remarr have anything to do with david fontenots death joe boness jaw tensed but he kept smiling i have no idea i heard about david fontenot on the news this morning another terrible thing i suggested the loss of a young life is always terrible he responded look im sorry about your wife and kid i truly am but i cant help you and frankly now youre getting rude so id like you to take your nigger and get the fuck off my property the muscles in louiss neck rippled the only sign he gave that he had heard joe bones joe bones leered at him picked up a piece of chicken and tossed it toward the beast on the chain it ignored the tidbit until his owner snapped his fingers when it fell on the chicken and devoured it in a single bite you know what that is asked joe bones he spoke to me but his body language was directed at louis it expressed utter contempt when i didnt respond he continued its called a boerbul a man named peter geertschen a german developed it for the army and antiriot squads in south africa by crossing a russian wolf with an alsatian its a white mans watchdog it sniffs out niggers he turned his gaze on louis and smiled careful i said he might get confused and turn on you joe bones jerked in his chair as if he had been hit by a jolt of electricity his eyes narrowed and searched my face for any indication that i was aware of a double meaning in what i had said i stared right back at him you better leave now said joe bones with quiet obvious menace i shrugged and stood up louis moving close to me as i did so we exchanged a look man got us on the run said louis maybe but if we leave like this he wont respect us without respect a man got nothing agreed louis he picked a plate from the stack on the table and held it above his head it exploded in a shower of china fragments as the winchester cartridge impacted and buried itself in the wood of the house behind the woman in the chair dived to the grass the two goons moved to cover joe bones and three men appeared running from the side of the house as the shot echoed in the air ricky the lizard man was the first to reach us he raised the pistol and his finger tightened on the trigger but joe bones struck out at his gun arm pushing it upward no you dumb fuck you want to get me killed he scanned the treeline beyond his property then turned back to me you come in here you shoot at me you scare my woman the fuck do you think youre dealing with here you said the nword said louis quietly hes right i agreed you did say it i hear you got friends in new orleans said joe bones his voice threatening i got enough troubles without the feds crawling on me but i see you or yourhe paused swallowing the wordfriend anywhere near me again and ill take my chances you hear i hear you i said im going to find remarr joe if it turns out that youve been holding out on us and this man gets away because of it ill come back you make us come back joe and we gonna have to hurt your puppy said louis almost sorrowfully you come back and ill stake you out on the grass and let him feed on you snarled joe bones we backed away toward the oaklined avenue watching joe bones and his men carefully the woman moved toward him to comfort him her white clothes stained with grass she kneaded gently at his trapezius with her carefully manicured hands but he pushed her away with a hard shove to the chest there was spittle on his chin behind us i heard the gate open as we retreated beneath the oaks i hadnt expected much from joe bones and had got less but we had succeeded in rattling his cage my guess was that he would contact remarr and that might be enough to flush him from wherever he was holed up it seemed like a good idea the trouble with good ideas is that nine times out of ten someone has had the same idea before you i didnt know angel was such a good shot i said to louis as we reached the car you been giving him lessons uhhuh said louis he sounded genuinely shocked could he have hit joe bones uhuh im surprised he didnt hit me behind us i heard the door open as angel slid into the back seat the mauser already back in its case so we gonna start hangin out with joe bones maybe shoot some pool whistle at girls when did you ever whistle at girls asked louis bemused as we pulled away from the gate and headed toward st francisville its a guy thing said angel i can do guy things it was late afternoon when we got back to the flaisance where there was a message waiting from morphy i called him at the sheriffs office and got passed on to a cell phone where you been he asked visiting joe bones shit whyd you do a thing like that making trouble i guess i warned you man dont be screwing with joe bones you go alone i brought a friend joe didnt like him whatd your friend do he got born to black parents morphy laughed i guess joe is kind of sensitive about his heritage but its good to remind him of it now and then he threatened to feed my friend to his dog yeah said morphy joe sure does love that dog you got something maybe you like seafood no good then well head out to bucktown great seafood there best shrimp around ill pick you up in two hours any other reason for seeing bucktown other than seafood remarr one of his exes has a pad there might be worth a visit bucktown was pretty in a quaint sort of way as long as you liked the smell of fish i kept the window up to try to limit the damage but morphy had his rolled right down and was taking deep sinful breaths all in all bucktown seemed an unlikely place for a man like remarr to hole up but that in itself was probably reason enough for him to choose it carole stern lived in a small camelback house a singlestory at the front against a twostory rear set in a small garden a few blocks off bucktowns main street according to morphy stern worked in a bar on st charles but was currently serving time for possession of coke with intent to supply remarr was rumored to be keeping up the rental payments until she got out we parked around the corner from the house and we clicked off the safeties of our guns in unison as we stepped from the car youre a little out of your territory here arent you i asked morphy hey we just came out here for a bite to eat and decided to check on the off chance he said with an injured look i aint steppin on no toes he motioned me toward the front of the house while he took the back i walked to the front door which stood on a small raised porch and peered carefully through the glass it was caked with dirt in keeping with the slightly rundown feel of the house itself i counted five and then tried the door it opened with a gentle creak and i stepped carefully into the hall at the far end i heard the tinkle of glass breaking and saw morphys hand reach in to open the rear door the smell was faint but obvious like meat that has been left in the sunlight on a warm day the downstairs rooms were empty and consisted only of a kitchen a small room with a sofa and an old tv and a bedroom with a single bed and a closet the closet contained womens clothes and shoes the bed was covered only by a worn mattress morphy took the stairs first i stayed close behind both of us with our guns pointing toward the second floor the smell was stronger here now we passed a bathroom with a dripping showerhead which had stained the ceramic bath brown on a sink unit beneath a small mirror stood some shaving foam blades and a bottle of boss aftershave three other doors stood partially open on the right was a womans bedroom it had white sheets on the bed potted plants which had begun to wither and a series of monet prints on the walls there were cosmetics on a long dressing table and a white fitted closet ran the length of one wall a window opposite looked out on a small overgrown garden there were more womens clothes in the closet and more shoes carole stern was obviously funding some kind of shopping addiction by selling drugs the second door provided the source of the smell a large open pot sat on a camper stove by a window facing on to the street it contained scummy water in which a stew of some kind was cooking on a low heat from the stench the meat had been allowed to simmer for some time probably most of the day it smelled foul like offal two easy chairs stood in the room on a new red carpet a portable tv with a coathanger aerial sat blankly on a small table the third room was also at the front of the house facing onto the street but its door was almost closed morphy took one side of the door i took the other he counted three and then nudged the door open with his foot and went in fast to the righthand wall i moved in low to the left my gun level with my chest my finger resting on the trigger the setting sun cast a golden glow over the contents of the room an unmade bed a suitcase open on the floor a dressing table a poster on the wall advertising a concert by the neville brothers in tipitinas with the brothers signatures scrawled loosely across their images the carpeted floor felt damp beneath my feet most of the plaster had been removed from the ceiling and the roof beams lay exposed i guessed carole stern had been considering some sort of remodeling before her prison sentence put her plans temporarily on hold at the far end of the room a series of what looked like climbing ropes had been strung over the beams and used to hold tony remarr in position his remains glowed with a strange fire in the dying sunlight i could see the muscles and veins in his legs the tendons in his neck the yellow mounds of fatty deposits seeping at his waist the muscles in his stomach the shriveled husk of his penis huge masonry nails had been driven into the far wall of the room and he hung partially on them one beneath each arm while the ropes took the main weight of his body as i moved to the right i could see a third nail in the wall behind his neck holding his head in place the head faced to the right in profile supported by another nail beneath his chin in places his skull gleamed whitely through the blood his eye sockets were almost empty and his gritted teeth were white against his gums remarr had been totally flayed carefully posed and hung against the wall his left hand stretched diagonally outward and down from his body a longbladed knife like a butchers filleting tool but wider heavier hung from his hand it looked like it had been glued in place but the viewers gaze was drawn like tony remarrs own blind stare to the figures right hand it stood at a right angle to his body until it reached the elbow from there the forearm was raised vertically pulled upward by a rope around the wrist in the fingers of his right hand and draped over his right arm tony remarr held his own flayed skin i could see the shape of the arms the legs the hair of his scalp the nipples on his chest beneath the scalp which hung almost at his knees there were bloody edges where the face had been removed the bed the floor the wall all were shaded in red i looked to my left to see morphy cross himself and softly say a prayer for the soul of tony remarr we sat against morphys car drinking coffee from paper cups as the feds and the new orleans police milled around the stern house a crowd of people some local some on their way to eat in bucktowns seafood joints hung around the edges of the police cordon waiting to see the body being removed they were likely to be disappointed the crime scene was highly organized by the killer and both the police and the feds were anxious to document it fully before allowing the body to be taken away woolrich his tan suit now restored to its former tarnished glory came over to us and offered us the remains of a bag of donuts from his suit pocket behind the cordon i could see his own chevy a red model that shone like new here you must be hungry both morphy and i declined the offer i still had visions of remarr in my head and morphy looked pale and ill you speak to the locals asked woolrich we both nodded we had given lengthy statements to a pair of homicide detectives from orleans parish one of whom was morphys brotherinlaw then i guess you can go said woolrich ill want to talk to both of you again though morphy wandered around to the drivers side of his car i moved to open the passenger door but woolrich held my arm you okay he asked i think so it was a good hunch that morphy followed but he shouldnt have brought you along durands gonna be on my back when he finds out that you were first on another crime scene durand was the fbis special agent in charge in new orleans i had never met him but i knew what most sacs were like they ruled their field offices like kingdoms assigning agents to squads and giving the goahead to operations the competition for sac posts was intense if nothing else durand was a tough customer youre still at the flaisance still there ill drop by theres something i want to bounce off you he turned and walked back toward the stern house on his way through the gate he handed the bag of crushed donuts to a pair of patrolmen sitting in their car they took the bag reluctantly holding it like it was a bomb when woolrich had entered the house one of them climbed out of the car and threw the donuts in a trash can morphy dropped me at the flaisance before he left i gave him my cell phone number he wrote it in a small black notebook bound tightly with a rubber band if youre free tomorrow angies cooking dinner its worth the trip you taste her cooking and you wont regret it the tone of his voice changed besides theres some things i think we need to discuss i told him it sounded okay although part of me wanted never to see morphy woolrich or another cop again he was about to pull away when i patted the roof of the car with my palm morphy leaned over and rolled down the window why are you doing this i asked morphy had gone to considerable lengths to involve me to keep me posted on what was happening i needed to know why i think i also needed to know if i could trust him he shrugged the aguillards died on my beat i want to get the guy who killed them you know something about him hes come at you at your family the feds are conducting their own investigation and are telling us as little as they can youre all i got is that it i could see something more in his face something that was almost familiar no i got a wife im starting a family you know what im sayin i nodded and let it go but there was something else in his eyes something that resonated inside me i patted the roof of the car once again in farewell and watched as he drove away wondering how badly morphy wanted absolution for what he might have done as i returned to my room at the flaisance i felt an overpowering sense of decay which seemed to creep into my nostrils almost stopping my breathing it lodged itself beneath my nails and stained my skin i felt it in the sweat on my back and saw it in the weeds breaking through the cracks in the pavement beneath my feet it was as if the city were corroding around me i went to my room and showered under a hot jet until my skin was red and raw then changed into a sweater and chinos called angel and louis in their room and arranged to meet them in rachels room in five minutes she answered the door with an inkstained hand she had a pencil tucked behind her ear and a pair of pencils held her red hair back in a bun there were dark rims under her eyes which were red from reading her room had been transformed a macintosh powerbook stood open on the rooms only table surrounded by a mass of paper books and notes on the wall above it were diagrams yellow postit notes and a series of what appeared to be anatomy sketches a pile of faxes lay on the floor by her chair beside a tray of halfeaten sandwiches a pot of coffee and a stained cup i heard a knock on the door behind me i opened it to admit angel and louis angel looked at the wall in disbelief guy on the desk already thinks youre crazy with all the shit thats been comin in on his fax he sees this hes gonna call the cops rachel sat back in her chair and pulled the pencils from her bun releasing her hair she shook her tresses out with her left hand and then twisted her neck to ease her knotted muscles so she said who wants to start i told them about remarr and instantly the tiredness went from rachels face she made me detail the position of the body twice and then spent a couple of minutes shuffling papers on her desk there she said handing me a sheet of paper with a flourish is that it it was a blackandwhite illustration marked at the top of the page in old lettering tab primera del lib segvndo at the bottom of the page in rachels handwriting was written valverde the illustration depicted a flayed man his left foot on a stone his left hand holding a long knife with a hooked hilt his right holding his own flayed skin the outline of his face was visible on the skin and his eyes remained in his sockets but with those exceptions the illustration was profoundly similar to the position in which remarr had been found the various parts of the body were each marked with greek letters thats it i said quietly as angel and louis peered silently over my shoulder thats what we found the historia de la composición del cuerpo humano said rachel it was written by the spaniard juan de valverde de hamusco in as a medical textbook this drawingshe took the page and held it up so we could all see itis an illustration of the marsyas myth marsyas was a satyr a follower of the goddess cybele he was cursed when he picked up a bone flute discarded by athene the flute played itself because it was still inspired by athene and its music was so beautiful that the peasants said it was greater even than that of apollo himself apollo challenged marsyas to a competition to be judged by the muses and marsyas lost because he couldnt play the flute upside down and sing at the same time and so apollo took his revenge on marsyas he flayed him alive and nailed his skin to a pine according to the poet ovid at his moment of death marsyas cried out quid me mihi detrahiswhich can be roughly translated as who is it that tears me from myself the artist titian painted a version of the myth so did raphael my guess is that remarrs body will reveal traces of ketamine to fulfill the myth the flaying would have to be carried out while the victim was still aliveits hard to create a work of art if the subject keeps moving louis interrupted but in this picture he looks like he flayed himself hes holding the knife and the skin why did the killer choose this depiction this is just a guess but maybe its because in a sense remarr did flay himself i said he was at the aguillard house when he shouldnt have been i think the traveling man was concerned at what he might have seen remarr was somewhere he shouldnt have been so he was responsible for what happened to him rachel nodded its an interesting point but there may be something more to it given what happened to tee jean aguillard she handed me a pair of papers the first was a photocopy of the crime scene photo of tee jean the second was another illustration this time marked de dissect partivm at the bottom of the page the date had been handwritten by rachel the illustration depicted a man crucified against a tree with a stone wall behind it his head was cradled by the branches of the tree his arms spread by further branches the skin below his chest had been flayed revealing his lungs kidneys and heart some unidentified organ probably his stomach lay on a raised platform beside him his face was intact but once again the illustration matched the posture of tee jean aguillards body marsyas again said rachel or at least an adaptation of the myth thats from estiennes de dissectione partium corporis humani another early textbook are you saying that this guy is killing according to a greek myth asked angel rachel sighed its not that simple i think the myth has resonances for him for the basic reason that hes used it twice but the marsyas theory breaks down with tante marie and birds wife and child i found the marsyas illustrations almost by accident but i havent found a match yet for the other deaths im still looking the likelihood is that they are also based on early medical textbooks if thats the case then ill find them it raises the possibility that were looking for someone with a medical background i said or a knowledge of obscure texts said rachel we already know that he has read the book of enoch or some derivative of it it wouldnt take a great deal of medical knowledge to carry out the kind of mutilation weve found on the bodies so far but an assumption of some surgical skills or even some mild familiarity with medical procedures might not be totally amiss what about the blinding and the removal of the faces i asked i pushed a flashing image of susan and jennifer to the back of my mind any idea where they fit in rachel shook her head im still working on it the face appears to be some form of token for him jennifers was returned because she died before he could start working on her id guess but also because he wanted to shock you personally the removal could also indicate the killers disregard for them as individuals a sign of his disregard for their own status as people after all when you remove a persons face you take away the most immediate representation of their individuality their main physical distinguisher as for the eyes there is a myth that the image of the killer stays on the retina of the victim there were lots of myths like that attached to the body even at the start of the last century some scientists were still examining the theory that a murder victims body bled when it was in the same room as its killer i need to do more work on it then well see she stood up and stretched i dont mean to sound callous but now i want to take a shower then i want to go out and get something decent to eat after that i want to sleep for twelve hours angel louis and i started to leave but she held up her hand to stop us theres just one more thing i dont want to give the impression that this is just some freak copying violent images i dont know enough about this to make that kind of judgment and i want to consult some people who are more experienced in this area than i am but i cant help feeling that theres some underlying philosophy behind what hes doing some pattern that hes following until we find out what that is i dont think were going to catch him i had my hand on the door handle when there was a knock at the door i opened it slowly and blocked the view of the room with my body while rachel cleared away her papers woolrich stood before me in the light from the room i noticed a thin growth of beard was forming on his face clerk told me you might be here if you werent in your own room can i come in i paused for a moment then stepped aside i noticed that rachel was standing in front of the material on the wall obscuring it from view but woolrich wasnt interested in her his eyes had fixed on louis i know you he said i dont think so said louis his eyes were cold woolrich turned to me you bringing your hired killers to my town bird i didnt reply like i said man i think youre making a mistake said louis im a businessman really and what kind of business would you be in pest control said louis the air seemed to crackle with tension until woolrich turned around and walked from the room he stopped in the hall and gestured to me i need to talk to you ill wait for you in the café du monde i watched him go then looked at louis he raised an eyebrow guess im more famous than i thought guess you are i said and went after woolrich i caught up with him on the street but he said nothing until we were seated and he had a beignet in front of him he tore off a piece sprinkling powdered sugar on his suit then took a long gulp of coffee which half drained the cup and left a brown stain along its sides cmon bird he said what are you trying to do here he sounded weary and disappointed that guy i know his face i know what he is he chewed another piece of beignet i didnt reply we stared at each other until woolrich looked away he dusted sugar from his fingers and ordered another coffee i had hardly touched mine does the name edward byron mean anything to you he said eventually when he realized that louis was not going to be a topic of discussion it doesnt ring any bells why he was a janitor in park rise thats where susan had jennifer right right park rise was a private hospital on long island susans father had insisted that we use it arguing that its staff were among the best in the world they were certainly among the best paid the doctor who delivered jennifer earned more in a month than i made in a year wheres this leading i asked byron was let goquietlyfollowing the mutilation of a corpse earlier this year someone performed an unauthorized autopsy on a female body her abdomen was opened and her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed no charges were pressed the hospital authorities considered it then decided against it surgical gloves with traces of the dead womans blood and tissue on them were found in a bag in byrons locker he argued that someone was trying to frame him the evidence wasnt conclusivetheoretically someone could have planted that stuff in his lockerbut the hospital let him go anyway no court case no police investigation nothing the only reason we have any record of it is because the local cops were investigating the theft of drugs from the hospital around the same time and byrons name was noted on the report byron was dismissed after the thefts began and they pretty much ceased but he had an alibi each time there were found to be drugs missing that was the last anyone heard of byron we have his social security number but he hasnt claimed unemployment paid tax dealt with state government or visited a hospital since he was dismissed his credit cards havent been used since october nineteenth ninetysix what brings his name up now edward byron is a native of baton rouge his wifehis exwife staceystill lives there have you spoken to her we interviewed her yesterday she says she hasnt seen him since last april that he owes her six months alimony the last check was drawn on a bank in east texas but his old lady thinks he may be living in the baton rouge area or somewhere nearby she says he always wanted to come back here that he hated new york weve also put out photos of him taken from his employee record at park rise he handed me a blownup picture of byron he was a handsome man his features marred only by a slightly receding chin his mouth and nose were thin his eyes narrow and dark he had dark brown hair swept from left to right he looked younger than thirtyfive his age when the picture was taken its the best lead weve got said woolrich maybe im telling you because i figure you have a right to know but im telling you something else as well you keep away from mrs byron weve told her not to talk to anyone in case the press get wind of it secondly stay away from joe bones his guy ricky was caught on one of our taps swearing blue hell about some stunt you pulled today but you wont get away with it a second time he laid some money on the table your little team back there got anything that might help us not yet we figure a medical background maybe a sexual pathology if i get anything more ill let you know ive got a question for you though what drugs were taken from park rise he tilted his head to one side and twisted his mouth slightly as if debating with himself whether or not to tell me ketamine hydrochloride its related to pcp i gave no indication that i already knew about the drug the feds would tear morphy a new asshole if they knew he had been feeding me details like that although they must have already had their suspicions woolrich paused for a moment and then went on it was found in the bodies of tante marie aguillard and her son the killer used it as a form of anesthetic he spun his coffee cup on its saucer waiting until it came to rest with the handle pointing in my direction are you scared of this guy bird he asked quietly because i sure am you remember that conversation we had about serial killers when i brought you to meet tante marie i nodded back then i thought id seen it all these killers were abusers and rapists and dysfunctionals who had crossed some line but they were so pathetic that they were still recognizably human but this one he watched a family pass by in a carriage the driver urging the horse on with the reins while he gave them his own history of jackson square a child a small darkhaired boy was seated at the edge of the family group he watched us silently as they passed by his chin resting on his bare forearm we were always afraid that one would come who was different from the others who was motivated by something more than a twisted frustrated sexuality or wretched sadism we live in a culture of pain and death bird and most of us go through life without ever really understanding that maybe it was only a matter of time before we produced someone who understood that better than we did someone who saw the world as just one big altar on which to sacrifice humanity someone who believed he had to make an example of us all and do you believe that this is him i am become death the destroyer of worlds isnt that what the bhagavadgita says i am become death maybe thats what he is pure death he moved toward the street i followed him then remembered my slip of paper from the previous night woolrich there is one more thing he looked testy as i gave him the references for the book of enoch what the fuck is the book of enoch its part of the apocrypha i think he may have some knowledge of it woolrich folded the paper and put it in the pocket of his pants bird he said and he almost smiled sometimes im torn between keeping you in touch with whats happening and not telling you anything he grimaced then sighed as if to indicate that this was something that just wasnt worth arguing about stay out of trouble bird and tell your friends the same he walked away to be swallowed up by the evening crowds i knocked on rachels door but there was no reply i knocked a second time harder and i heard some noises from inside the room she answered the door with a towel wrapped around her body and her hair hidden by a second smaller towel her face was red from the heat of the shower and her skin glowed sorry i said i forgot that youd be showering she smiled and waved me in take a seat ill get dressed and let you buy me dinner she took a pair of gray pants and a white cotton shirt from the bed picked some matching white underwear from her case and stepped back into the bathroom she didnt close the door fully behind her so that we could talk while she dressed should i ask what that exchange was about she said i walked to her balcony window and looked out on the street below what woolrich said about louis is true its not as simple as that maybe but he has killed people in the past now im not so sure i dont ask and im not in a position to pass judgment on him but i trust both angel and louis i asked them to come because i know what theyre good at she came out of the bathroom buttoning her shirt her damp hair hanging she dried her hair with a travel dryer then applied a little makeup i had seen susan do the same things a thousand times but there was a strange intimacy in watching rachel perform them in front of me i felt something stir inside me a tiny yet significant shift in my feelings toward her she sat on the edge of the bed and slipped her bare feet into a pair of black slingbacks her finger moving inside each one to ease the progress of her heel as she leaned foward moisture glistened on the small of her back she caught me looking at her and smiled cautiously as if afraid of misinterpreting what she had seen shall we go she said i held the door open for her as we left her shirt brushing my hand with a sound like water sizzling on hot metal we ate in mr bs on royal street the big mahogany room cool and dark i had steak tender and luscious while rachel ate blackened redfish the spices causing her to gasp at the first bite we talked of little things of plays and films of music and reading it emerged that we had both attended the same performance of the magic flute at the met in both of us alone i watched her as she sipped her wine the reflected light playing on her face and dancing in the darkness of her pupils like moonlight seen from a lakeshore so you often follow strange men to distant lands she smiled i bet youve been waiting to use that line all your life maybe i use it all the time oh puhlease next thing youll be wielding a club and asking the waiter to step outside okay guilty as charged its been a while i felt myself redden and caught something playful but uncertain in her glancea kind of sadness a fear of hurting and being hurt inside me something twisted and stretched its claws and i felt a little tear in my heart im sorry i know almost nothing about you i said quietly she reached out gently and brushed along the length of my left hand from the wrist to the end of the little finger she followed the curves of my fingers delicately tracing the lines and whorls of my fingerprints her touch soft as a leaf at last she let her hand rest on the table the tips of her fingers resting on top of my own and began to speak she was born in chilson near the foothills of the adirondacks her father was a lawyer her mother taught kindergarten she liked basketball and running and her prom date got the mumps two days before the prom so her best friends brother went with her instead and tried to feel her breast during only the lonely she had one brother of her own curtis ten years her elder for five of his twentyeight years curtis had been a cop he was two weeks short of his twentyninth birthday when he died he was a detective with the state police newly promoted he wasnt even on duty the day he was killed she spoke without hesitation not too slowly not too quickly as if she had gone over the story a thousand times examining it for flaws tracing its beginning its resolution cutting all extraneous detail from it until she was left with the gleaming core of her brothers murder the hollow heart of his absence it was a quarter after two a tuesday afternoon curtis was visiting some girl in moriahhe always had two or three girls trailing him at any one time he just broke their hearts he was carrying a bunch of flowers pink lilies bought in a store five doors from the bank he heard some shouting and saw two people come running from the bank both armed both masked a man and a woman there was another man sitting in a car waiting for them to come out curtis was drawing his gun when they saw him they both had sawedoffs and they didnt hesitate the man emptied both barrels into him and then while he lay dying on the ground the woman finished him off she shot him in the face and he was so handsome so lovely she stopped talking and i knew that this was a story she had told only in her mind that it was something not to be shared but to be safeguarded sometimes we need our pain we need it to call our own when they caught them they had three thousand dollars that was all they got from the bank all that my brother was worth to them the woman had been released from an institution the week before someone decided that she no longer posed a threat to the community she lifted her glass and drained the last of her wine i signaled for more and she remained silent as the waiter refilled her glass and here i am she said at last now i try to understand and sometimes i get close and sometimes if im lucky i can stop things from happening to other people sometimes i found that her hand was now gripped tightly in mine and i could not recall how that had happened holding her hand i spoke for the first time in many years about leaving new york and the move to maine with my mother is she still alive i shook my head i got in trouble with a local big shot named daddy helms i said my grandfather and my mother agreed that i should go away to work for the summer until things quieted down a friend of his ran a store in philly so i worked there for a while stocking shelves cleaning up at night i slept in a room above the store my mother began taking physiotherapy for a trapped nerve in her shoulder except it turned out that she had been misdiagnosed she had cancer i think she knew but she chose not to say anything maybe she thought that if she didnt admit it to herself she could fool her system into giving her more time instead one of her lungs collapsed as she left the therapists office i came back two days later on a bus i hadnt seen her in two months and when i tried to find her in the hospital ward i couldnt i had to check the names on the ends of the beds because she had changed so much she lasted six weeks after that toward the end she became lucid even with the painkillers it happens a lot i believe it can fool you into thinking theyre getting better its like the cancers small joke she was trying to draw a picture of the hospital the night before she died so she would know where she was going when it was time to leave i sipped some water im sorry i said i dont know why all those things should have come back to me rachel smiled and i felt her hand tighten again on mine and your grandfather he died eight years ago he left me his house in maine the one im trying to fix up i noticed that she didnt ask me about my father i guessed that she knew all there was to know later we walked slowly back through the crowds the music from the bars blending together into one blast of sound in which familiar tunes could sometimes be identified when we came to the door of her room we held each other for a while then kissed softly her hand on my cheek before we said good night despite remarr and joe bones and my exchanges with woolrich i slept peacefully that night my hand still holding the specter of her own it was a cool clear morning and the sound of the st charles streetcar carried on the air as i ran a wedding limousine passed me on its way to the cathedral white ribbons rippling on its hood i jogged west along north rampart as far as perdido then back through the quarter along chartres the heat was intense like running with my face in a warm damp towel my lungs struggled to pull in the air and my system rebelled struggling to reject it but still i ran i was used to training three or four times each week alternating circuits for a month or so with a split bodybuilding workout after a few days outside my training regimen i felt bloated and out of condition as if my system was full of toxins given the choice between exercise and colon cleansers i opted for exercise as the less uncomfortable option back at the flaisance i showered and changed the dressing on my wounded shoulder it still ached a little but the wounds were closing finally i left a batch of clothes at the local laundry since i hadnt figured on staying quite so long in new orleans and my underwear selection was becoming pretty limited stacey byrons number was in the phone bookshe hadnt reverted to her maiden name at least not as far as the phone company was concernedso angel and louis volunteered to take a trip to baton rouge and see what they could find out from her or about her woolrich wouldnt be pleased but if he wanted her left in peace then he shouldnt have said anything at all rachel emailed details of the kind of illustrations she was seeking to two of her research students at columbia and father eric ward a retired professor in boston who had lectured at loyola in new orleans on renaissance culture instead of hanging around waiting for a response she decided to come with me to metairie where david fontenot was due to be buried that morning we were silent as we drove the subject of our growing intimacy and what it might imply had not come up between us but it seemed that we were both acutely aware of it i could see something of it in rachels eyes when she looked at me i thought that she could probably see the same in mine so what else do you want to know about me she asked i guess i dont know too much about your personal life apart from the fact that im beautiful and brilliant apart from that i admitted by personal do you mean sexual its a euphemism i dont want to seem pushy if it makes you happier you can start with your age since you didnt tell me last night the rest will seem easy by comparison she gave me a twisted grin and the finger i chose to ignore the finger im thirtythree but i admit to thirty if the lighting is right i have a cat and a twobedroom apartment on the upper west side but no one to share it with currently i do step aerobics three times a week and i like chinese food soul music and cream ale my last relationship ended six months ago and i think my hymen may be growing back i arched an eyebrow at her and she laughed you do look shocked she said you need to get out more sounds like you do too who was the guy a stockbroker wed been seeing each other for over a year and we agreed to live together on a test basis he had a onebed i had a twobed so he moved in with me and we used the second bedroom as a shared study sounds idyllic it was for about a week it turned out that he couldnt stand the cat he hated sharing a bed with me because he said i kept him awake by turning over all the time and all my clothes started to smell of his cigarettes that clinched it everything stank the furniture the bed the walls the food the toilet paper even the cat then he came home one evening told me he was in love with his secretary and moved to seattle with her three months later seattle s nice i hear fuck seattle i hope it falls into the sea at least youre not bitter very funny she looked out of her window for a while and i felt an urge to reach out and touch her an urge enhanced by what she said next i still feel reluctant to ask you too many questions she said gently after what happened i know slowly i extended my right hand and touched her lightly on the cheek her skin was smooth and slightly moist she leaned her head toward me increasing the pressure against my hand and then we were pulling up outside the entrance to the cemetery and the moment was gone branches of the fontenots had lived in new orleans since the late nineteenth century long before the family of lionel and david had moved to the city and the fontenots had a large vault in metairie cemetery the largest of the citys cemeteries at metairie road and pontchartrain boulevard the cemetery covered one hundred and fifty acres and was built on the old metairie racecourse if you were a gambling man it was an appropriate final resting place even though it proved that in the end the odds are always stacked in favor of the house new orleans cemeteries are strange places while most cemeteries in big cities are carefully manicured and encourage discreet headstones the dead citizens of new orleans rested in ornate tombs and spectacular mausoleums they reminded me of père lachaise in paris or the cities of the dead in cairo where people still lived among the bodies the resemblance was echoed by the brunswig tomb at metairie which was shaped like a pyramid and guarded by a sphinx it was not simply the funerary architecture of spain and france that had caused the cemeteries to develop the way they did most of the city was below sea level and until the development of modern drainage systems graves dug in the ground had rapidly filled with water aboveground tombs were the natural solution the fontenot funeral had already entered the cemetery when we arrived i parked away from the main body of vehicles and we walked past the two police cruisers at the gate their occupants eyes masked by shades we followed the stragglers past the four statues representing faith hope charity and memory at the base of the long moriarity tomb until we came to a greek revival tomb marked with a pair of doric columns fontenot was inscribed on the lintel above the door it was impossible to tell how many fontenots had come to rest in the family vault the tradition in new orleans was to leave the body for a year and a day after which the vault was reopened the remains moved to the back and the rotting casket removed to make way for the next occupant a lot of the vaults in metairie were pretty crowded by this point the wrought iron gate inlaid with the heads of angels stood open and the small party of mourners had surrounded the vault in a semicircle a man i guessed to be lionel fontenot towered above them he was wearing a black singlebreasted suit and a thick black tie his face had been weathered to a reddish brown and deep lines etched his forehead and snaked out from the corners of his eyes his hair was dark but streaked with gray at the temples he was a big man certainly sixthree at least and weighing close to two hundred and forty pounds maybe twofifty his suit seemed to struggle to contain him beyond the mourners ranged at intervals around the vaults and tombs or standing beneath trees scanning the cemetery were four hardfaced men in dark jackets and trousers their pistols caused the jackets to bulge slightly a fifth man a dark overcoat hanging loosely on his shoulders turned at an old cypress and i caught a glimpse of the telltale sights of an mbased submachine gun concealed beneath its folds two others stood at either side of lionel fontenot the big man wasnt taking any chances the mourners both black and white young white men in snappy black suits old black women wearing black dresses gilded with lace at the neckline grew silent as the priest began to read the rites of the dead from a tattered prayer book with goldedged pages there was no wind to carry away his words and they hung in the air around us reverberating from the surrounding tombs like the voices of the dead themselves our father who art in heaven the pallbearers moved forward struggling awkwardly to fit the casket through the narrow entrance to the vault as it was placed inside a pair of new orleans policemen appeared between two round vaults about eighty feet west of the funeral party two more emerged from the east and a third pair moved slowly down past a tree to the north rachel followed my glance an escort maybe thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth i felt uneasy they could have been sent to ensure that joe bones wasnt tempted to disturb the mourners but something was wrong i didnt like the way they moved they looked uncomfortable in the uniforms as if their shirt collars were too tight and their shoes pinched forgive us our trespasses fontenots men had spotted them too but they didnt look too concerned the policemens arms hung loosely by their sides and their guns remained in their holsters they were about thirty feet away from us when something warm splashed my face an elderly moonfaced woman in a tight black dress who had been sobbing quietly beside me spun sideways and tumbled to the ground a dark hole in her temple and a damp glistening in her hair a chip of marble flew from the vault the area around it stained a vivid red the sound of the shot came almost simultaneously a dull subdued noise like a fist hitting a punching bag but deliver us from evil it took the mourners a few seconds to realize what was happening they looked dumbly at the fallen woman a pool of blood already forming around her head as i pushed rachel into the space between two vaults shielding her with my body someone screamed and the crowd began to scatter as more bullets came whining off the marble and stone i could see lionel fontenots bodyguards rush to protect him pushing him to the ground as the bullets bounced from the tomb and rattled its iron gate rachel covered her head with her arms and crouched to try to make herself a smaller target over my shoulder i saw the two cops to the north separate and pick up machine pistols concealed in the bushes at either side of the avenue they were steyrs fitted with sound suppressors joe boness men i saw a woman try to run for the cover of the outspread wings of a stone angel her dark coat whipping around her bare legs the coat puffed twice at the shoulder and she sprawled face forward on the ground her hands outstretched she tried to drag herself forward but her coat puffed again and she was gone now there were pistol shots and the rattle of a semiautomatic as fontenots men returned fire i drew my own smith amp wesson and joined rachel as a uniformed figure appeared in the gap between the tombs the steyr held in a twohanded grip i shot him in the face and he crumpled to the ground but theyre cops said rachel her voice almost drowned by the exchange of fire around us i reached out and pushed her down further theyre joe boness men theyre here to take out lionel fontenot but it was more than that joe bones wanted to sow chaos and to reap blood and fear and death from the consequences he didnt simply want lionel fontenot dead he also wanted others to diewomen children lionels family his associatesand for those left alive to remember what had taken place and to fear joe bones more because of it he wanted to break the fontenots and he would do it here beside the vault where they had buried generations of their dead this was the action of a man who had moved beyond reason and passed into a dark flamelit place a place that blinded his vision with blood behind me there was a scuffling tumbling sound and one of fontenots men the overcoated man with the semiautomatic fell to his knees beside rachel blood bubbled from his mouth and i heard her scream as he fell forward his head coming to rest by her feet the m lay on the grass beside him i reached for it but rachel got to it first a deep unquenchable instinct for survival now guiding her actions her mouth and eyes were wide as she fired a burst over the prone frame of the bodyguard i flung myself to the end of the tomb and aimed in the same direction but joe boness man was already down he lay on his back his left leg spasming and a bloody pattern etched across his chest rachels hands were shaking as the adrenaline coursed through her system the m began to fall from her fingers its strap became entangled in her arm and she shook herself furiously to release it behind her i could see mourners running low through the avenues of tombs two white women dragged a young black man by his arms over the grass the belly of his white shirt was smeared with blood i figured that there must have been a fourth set of joe boness men who approached from the south and fired the first shots at least three were down the two killed by rachel and me and a third who lay sprawled by the old cypress fontenots man had taken one of them out before he was hit himself i helped rachel to her feet and moved her quickly to a grimy vault with a corroded gate i struck at the lock with the butt of the m and it gave instantly she slipped inside and i handed her my smith amp wesson and told her to stay there until i came back for her then gripping the m i ran east past the back of the fontenot tomb using the other vaults as cover i didnt know how many shots were left in the m the selector switch was set for threeround bursts depending on the magazine capacity i might have anything between ten and twenty rounds left i had almost reached a monument topped by the figure of a sleeping child when something hit me on the back of the head and i stumbled forward the m slipping from my grasp someone kicked me hard in the kidneys the pain lancing through my body as far as the shoulder i was kicked again in the stomach which forced me on to my back i looked up to see ricky standing above me the reptilian coils of his hair and his small stature at odds with the nopd uniform he had lost his hat and the side of his face was cut slightly where he had been hit by splinters of stone the muzzle of his steyr pointed at my chest i tried to swallow but my throat seemed to have constricted i was conscious of the feel of the grass beneath my hands and the glorious pain in my side sensations of life and existence and survival ricky raised the steyr to point it at my head joe bones says hello he said his finger tightened on the trigger in the same instant as his head jerked back his stomach thrusting forward and his back arching a burst of fire from the steyr raked the grass beside my head as ricky fell to his knees and then toppled sideways his body lying prone across my left leg there was a jagged red hole in the back of his shirt behind him lionel fontenot stood in a marksmans stance the pistol in his hand slowly coming down there was blood on his left hand and a bullet hole in the upper left arm of his suit the two bodyguards who had stood beside him at the cemetery walked quickly from the direction of the fontenot tomb they glanced at me then turned their attention back to fontenot i could hear the sound of sirens approaching from the west one got away lionel said one the rest are dead what about our people three dead at least more injured beside me ricky stirred slightly and his hand moved feebly i could feel his body move against my leg lionel fontenot walked over and stood above him for a moment before shooting him once in the back of the head he looked at me curiously once more then picked up the m and tossed it to one of his men now go help the wounded he said he cradled his injured left arm with his right hand and walked back toward the fontenot tomb my rib ached as i returned to where i had left rachel after kicking rickys corpse from my leg i approached carefully conscious of the smith amp wesson i had left with her when i reached the tomb rachel was gone i found her about fifty yards away crouching beside the body of a young girl who was barely beyond her teens as i approached rachel reached for the gun by her side and spun toward me hey its me you okay she nodded and returned the gun to its resting place i noticed that she had kept her hand pressed on the young girls stomach for the entire exchange how is she i asked but as i looked over her shoulder i knew the answer the blood oozing from the gunshot wound was almost black liver shot the girl shivering uncontrollably her teeth gritted in agony was not going to live around us mourners were emerging from hiding some sobbing some trembling with shock i saw two of lionel fontenots men running toward us both with pistols and i took hold of rachels arm we have to go we cant afford to wait for the cops to arrive im staying im not leaving her rachel she looked at me i held her gaze and we shared our knowledge of the girls impending death we cant stay the two fontenots were beside us now one of them younger than the other dropped to his knee beside the girl and took her hand she gripped it tightly and he whispered her name clara he said hold on clara hold on please rachel i repeated she took the younger mans hand and pressed it against claras stomach the girl cried out as the pressure was reapplied keep your hand there hissed rachel dont take it away until the medics get here she picked up the gun and handed it to me i took it from her slipped the safety and put it back in my holster we made our way from the focus of the mayhem until the shouting had diminished then i stopped and she reached out and held me tightly i cradled her in my arms and kissed the top of her head and breathed in the scent of her she squeezed me and i gasped as the pain in my ribs increased dramatically rachel pulled back quickly are you hurt i took a kick nothing else i held her face in my hands you did all that you could for her she nodded but her mouth trembled the girl had an importance to her that went beyond the simple duty to save her life i killed that man she said he would have killed us both you had no choice if you hadnt done it youd be dead maybe id be dead too it was true but it wasnt enough not yet i held her tightly as she cried the pain in my side inconsequential beside her own suffering i had not thought of daddy helms in many years not until i spoke of him to rachel the previous night and recalled the part he played in my absence during my mothers lingering death daddy helms was the ugliest man i had ever seen he ran most of portland from the late sixties to the early eighties building up a modest empire that had started with daddy helms boosting liquor warehouses and moved on to take in the sale of drugs over three states daddy helms weighed over three hundred pounds and suffered from a skin ailment that had left him with raised bumps all over his body but most visible on his face and hands they were a deep red color and formed a kind of scaly skin over his features blurring them so that the observer always seemed to be seeing daddy helms through a red mist he wore threepiece suits and panama hats and always smoked winston churchill cigars so you smelled daddy helms before you saw him if you were smart enough this usually gave you just enough time to be somewhere else before he arrived daddy helms was mean but he was also a freak if he had been less intelligent less bitter and less inclined toward violence he would probably have ended up living in a little house in the woods of maine and selling christmas trees doortodoor to sympathetic citizens instead his ugliness seemed to be an outward manifestation of some deeper spiritual and moral blight within himself a corruption that made you think that daddy helmss skin might not be the worst thing about him there was a rage inside him a fury at the world and its ways my grandfather who had known daddy helms since he was a young boy and was generally a man who empathized with those around him even the criminals he was forced to arrest when he served as a sheriffs deputy could see nothing but evil in daddy helms i used to think maybe it was his ugliness that made him what he is he said once that the way he behaves is because of the way he looks that hes finding a way to strike back at the world he sees around him he was sitting on the porch of the house that he shared with my grandmother my mother and me the house in which we had all lived since my fathers death my grandfathers basset hound docnamed after the country singer doc watson for no reason other than that my grandfather liked his rendition of the song alberta lay curled at his feet his ribs expanding in deep sleep and small yelps occasionally erupting from his jowls as he enjoyed dog dreams my grandfather took a sip of coffee from a blue tin mug and then laid it down by his feet doc stirred slightly opened one bleary eye to make sure he wasnt missing anything interesting and then went back to his dreams but daddy helms isnt like that he continued daddy helms just has something wrong with him something i cant figure only thing i wonder is what he might have made of himself if he werent so damn ugly i reckon he could have been the president of the united states if hed wanted to be and if people could have beared to look at him cept he wouldve been more like joe stalin than john kennedy you oughta have stayed outta his way boy you learned a hard lesson yesterday a hard lesson at the hands of a hard man i had come from new york with the idea that i was a tough guy that i was smarter and faster and if it came down to it harder than those i would come up against in the maine boondocks i was wrong daddy helms taught me that clarence johns a kid who lived with his drunk father near maine mall road learned that lesson too clarence was amiable but dumb a natural sidekick we had been hanging out together for about a year firing off his air rifle on lazy summer afternoons drinking beers stolen from his old mans stash we were bored and we let everybody know it even daddy helms he had bought an old rundown bar on congress street and was slowly working to transform it into what he imagined would be a pretty highclass establishment this was before the refurbishment of the port area before the arrival of the tshirt stores the craft shops the art house cinema and the bars that serve free nibbles to the tourist crowd between five and seven maybe daddy helms had a vision of what was to come for he replaced all of the old windows in the bar put a new roof on the place and bought up furnishings from some old belfast church that had been deconsecrated one sunday afternoon when clarence and i were feeling particularly at odds with the world we sat on the wall at the back of daddy helmss halffinished bar and broke just about every goddamned window in the place flinging stones with pinpoint accuracy at the new panes eventually we found an old abandoned septic tank and in a final act of vandalism we hoisted it through the large arched window at the back of the premises which daddy helms had intended would span the bar itself like a fan i didnt see clarence for a few days after that and thought nothing of the consequences until one night as we walked down st john with an illicitly bought sixpack of beer three of daddy helmss men caught us and dragged us toward a black cadillac eldorado they cuffed our hands and put duct tape over our mouths and tied dirty rags over our eyes then dumped us in the trunk and closed it clarence johns and i lay side by side as we were carried away and i was conscious of the sour unwashed smell from him until i realized that i probably smelled the same but there were other smells in that trunk beyond oil and rags and the sweat of two teenage boys it smelled of human excrement and urine of vomit and bile it smelled of the fear of impending death and i knew even then that a lot of people had been brought for rides in that cadillac time seemed to fade away in the blackness of the car so that i couldnt tell how far we had traveled until it ground to a halt the trunk was opened and i could hear waves crashing to my left and could taste the salt in the air we were hauled from the trunk and dragged through bushes and over stones i could feel sand beneath my feet and beside me i heard clarence johns start to whimper or maybe it was my own whimperings i heard then we were thrown facedown on the sand and there were hands at my clothes my shoes my shirt was ripped from me and i was stripped from the waist down kicking frantically at the unseen figures around me until someone punched me hard with his knuckles in the small of the back and i stopped kicking the rag was pulled away from my eyes and i looked up to see daddy helms standing above me behind him i could see the silhouette of a large building the black point inn we were on western beach at prouts neck part of scarborough itself if i had been able to turn i would have seen the lights of old orchard beach but i was not able to turn daddy helms held the butt of his cigar in his deformed hand and smiled at me it was a smile like light flashing on a blade he wore a white threepiece suit a gold watch chain snaking across his vest and a redandwhite spotted bow tie arranged neatly at the collar of his white cotton shirt beside me clarence johnss shoes scuffled in the sand as he tried to gain enough purchase to raise himself up but one of daddy helmss men a blondhaired savage called tiger martin placed the sole of his foot on clarences chest and forced him back on to the sand clarence i noticed was not naked you bob warrens grandson daddy helms asked after a while i nodded i thought i was going to choke my nostrils were filled with sand and i couldnt seem to get enough air into my lungs you know who i am asked daddy helms still looking at me i nodded again but you cant know who i am boy you knew me you wouldnta done what you did to my place less youre a fool that is and thats worse than not knowin he turned his attention briefly to clarence but he didnt say anything to him i thought i caught a flash of pity in his eyes as he looked at clarence clarence was dumb there was no doubt about that for a brief instant i seemed to be looking at clarence with new eyes as if he alone was not part of daddy helmss gang and all five of us were about to do something terrible to him but i was not with daddy helms and the thought of what was about to happen brought me back again i felt the sand beneath my skin and i watched as tiger martin came forward carrying a heavylooking black garbage bag in his arms he looked to daddy helms daddy helms nodded and then the bag was tipped upside down and the contents poured over my body it was earth but something else too i sensed thousands of small legs moving on me crawling through the hairs on my legs and groin exploring the crevasses of my body like tiny lovers i felt them on my tightly closed eyes and shook my head hard to clear them away then the biting started tiny pinpoints of pain on my arms my eyelids my legs even my penis as the fire ants began to attack i felt them crawling into my nostrils and then the biting started there as well i twisted and writhed rubbing myself on the sand in an effort to kill as many of them as i could but it was like trying to remove the sand itself grain by grain i kicked and spun and felt tears running down my cheeks and then just as it seemed that i couldnt take any more i felt a gloved hand on my ankle and i was dragged through the sand toward the surf my wrists were freed and i plunged into the water ripping the tape from my mouth ignoring the pain as it tore my lips in my desire to rub and scratch myself i submerged my head as the waves crashed above me and still it seemed that i felt threadlike legs moving on me and felt the final bites of the insects before they drowned i was shouting in pain and panic and then i was crying too crying in shame and hurt and anger and fear for days afterward i found the remains of ants in my hair some of them were longer than the nail on my middle finger with barbed pincers that curved forward to embrace the skin my body was covered in raised bumps almost an imitation of those of daddy helms himself and the inside of my nose felt tender and swollen i pulled myself from the water and staggered onto the sand daddy helmss men had gone back to the car leaving only clarence and me on the beach with daddy helms himself clarence was untouched daddy helms saw the realization in my face and he smiled as he puffed on his cigar we found your friend last night he said he placed a thick meltedwax hand on clarences shoulders clarence flinched but he didnt move he told us everything we didnt even have to hurt him the pain of betrayal superseded the bites and the itching the lingering sensation of movement on my skin i looked at clarence johns with new eyes adult eyes he stood on the sand his arms wrapped around his body shivering his eyes were filled with a pain that sang out from the depths of his being i wanted to hate him for what he had done and daddy helms wanted me to hate him but instead i felt only a deep emptiness and a kind of pity and i felt a kind of pity too for daddy helms with his ravaged skin and his mounds and folds of heavy flesh forced to visit this punishment on two young men because of some broken glass punishing them not only physically but by severing the bonds of their friendship you learned two lessons here tonight boy you learned not to fuck with me ever and you learned something about friendship in the end the only friend you got is yourself cause all the others theyll let you down in the end we all stand alone in the end then he turned and waddled through the marram and dunes back to his car they left us to walk back to route my clothes torn and soaked through from the seawater we said nothing to each other not even when we parted at the gate to my grandfathers property and clarence headed off into the night his cheap plastic shoes slapping on the road we didnt hang out together after that and i largely forgot clarence until he died in a failed robbery attempt at a computer warehouse on the outskirts of austin twelve years later clarence was working as a security guard he was shot by the raiders as he tried to defend a consignment of pcs when i entered my grandfathers house i took some antiseptic from the medicine cabinet then stripped and stood in the bath rubbing the liquid into the bites it stung when i had finished i sat in the empty bath and wept and that was where my grandfather found me he said nothing for a while then disappeared and came back with a red bowl containing a paste made from baking soda and water he rubbed it painstakingly across my shoulders and chest my legs and arms then poured a little into my hand so i could rub it into my groin he wrapped me in a white cotton sheet and sat me down in a chair in the kitchen before pouring us each a large glass of brandy it was remy martin i remember xo the good stuff it took me some time to finish it but neither of us spoke a word as i stood to go to bed he patted me lightly on the head a hard man repeated my grandfather draining the last of his coffee he stood and the dog rose with him you want to walk the dog with me i declined he shrugged his shoulders and i watched him as he walked down the porch steps the dog already running ahead of him barking and sniffing and looking back to make sure the old man was following then running on farther again daddy helms died two years later of stomach cancer when he died it was estimated that he had been involved directly or indirectly with over forty killings some of them as far south as florida there was no more than a handful of people at his funeral i thought of daddy helms again as rachel and i made our way from the killings in metairie i dont know why maybe i felt there was something of his rage in joe bonanno a hatred of the world that stemmed from something rotten inside him i remembered my grandfather i remembered daddy helms and i recalled the lessons they had tried to teach me lessons that i still had not yet fully learned outside the main cemetery gate the new orleans police were corralling witnesses and clearing the way for the injured to be carried to waiting ambulances tv crews from wwdl and wdsu were trying to talk with survivors i stayed close to one of lionel fontenots men the one who had been entrusted with the care of the m as we approached the gates at an angle we followed him until he arrived at a portion of ruptured fencing by the highway then made his way through it to a waiting lincoln as he drove away rachel and i climbed over the fence and walked back toward our car unspeaking approaching it from the west it was parked away from the main center of activity and we were able to slip off without attracting any attention how did that happen asked rachel in a quiet voice as we drove back into the city there should have been police there should have been someone to stop them her voice trailed away and she remained silent as we drove back to the quarter her hands clasped across her upper body i didnt disturb her one of a number of things had happened someone in charge could have screwed up by assigning insufficient police to metairie believing that joe bones would never try to take out lionel fontenot at his brothers funeral in front of witnesses the guns had been stashed either late the previous night or early that morning and the cemetery had not been searched it could also have been the case that lionel warned off the cops just as he had warned off the media anxious not to turn his brothers funeral into a circus the other possibility was that joe bones had paid off or threatened some or all of the cops at metairie and they had turned their backs while his men went about their business when we reached the hotel i took rachel to my roomi didnt want her surrounded by the images she had pinned to the walls of her own room she went straight to the bathroom and closed the door behind her i could hear the sound of the shower starting up she stayed there for a long time when she eventually emerged she had a big white bath towel draped around her from her breasts to her knees and was drying her hair with a smaller towel her eyes were red as she looked at me then her chin trembled and she began to cry again i held her kissing the top of her head then her forehead her cheeks her lips her mouth was warm as she responded to the kiss her tongue darting around my teeth and entwining with my own tongue i pressed hard against her pulling the towel from her as i did her fingers fumbled at my belt and my zipper then reached inside and held me tightly her other hand worked at the buttons on my shirt as she kissed my neck and ran her tongue across my chest and around my nipples i kicked off my shoes and leaned over awkwardly to try to take off my socks damn socks she smiled a little as i almost fell over while removing the left one and then i was on top of her as she pushed down my pants and shorts her breasts were small her hips slightly wide the small triangle of hair at their center a deep fiery red she tasted sweet when she came her back arched high and her legs wrapped around my thighs i felt like i had never been held so tightly or loved so hard afterward she slept i slipped from the bed put on a tshirt and jeans and took the key to her room from her bag i walked barefoot down the gallery to the room closed the door behind me and stood for a time before the pictures on the wall rachel had bought a large draftsmans pad on which to work out patterns and ideas i took two sheets from it taped them together and added them to the images on the wall then surrounded by pictures of the anatomized marsyas and photocopies of the crimescene photos of tante marie and tee jean i took a felttip and began to write in one corner i wrote the names of jennifer and susan a kind of pang of regret and guilt hitting me as i wrote susans name i tried to put it from my mind and continued writing in another corner i put the names of tante marie tee jean and slightly to one side florence in the third corner i wrote remarrs name and in the fourth i placed a question mark and the word girl beside it in the center i wrote trav man and then like a child drawing a star i added a series of lines emanating from the center and tried to write down all that i knew or thought i knew about the killer when i had finished the list included a voice synthesis program or unit the book of enoch a knowledge of greek myths early medical texts a knowledge of police procedures and activities based on what rachel had said following the deaths of jennifer and susan the fact that he had known that the feds were monitoring my cell phone and the killing of remarr initially i thought that if he had seen remarr at the aguillard house then remarr would have died there and then but i reconsidered on the basis that the traveling man would have been reluctant to remain at the scene or to engage an alert remarr and had decided to wait for another chance the other option was that the killer had found out about the fingerprint and somehow the killer had also later found remarr i added other elements based on standard assumptions white male killer probably somewhere between his twenties and forties a louisiana base from which to strike at remarr and the aguillards a change of clothing or coveralls worn over his own clothes to protect him from the blood and access to and knowledge of ketamine i drew another line from trav man to the aguillards since the killer knew that tante marie had been talking and a second line connecting him to remarr i added a dotted line to jennifer and susan and wrote edward byrons name with a question mark beside it then on impulse i added a third dotted line and wrote david fontenots name between those of the aguillards and remarr based only on the honey island connection and the possibility that if the traveling man had lured him to honey island and tipped off joe bones that david fontenot would be there then the killer was someone known to the fontenot family finally i wrote edward byrons name on a separate sheet and pinned it beside the main diagram i sat on the edge of rachels bed and breathed in the scent of her in the room as i looked at what i had written shifting the pieces around in my head to see if they would match up anywhere they didnt but i made one more addition before i returned to my own room to wait for angel and louis to return from baton rouge i drew a light line between david fontenots name and the question mark representing the girl in the swamp i didnt know it then but by drawing that line i had made the first significant leap into the world of the traveling man i returned to my own room and sat by the balcony watching rachel in her uneasy sleep her eyelids moved rapidly and once or twice she let out small groans and made pushing movements with her hands her feet scrambling beneath the blankets i heard angel and louis before i saw them angels voice raised in what seemed to be anger louis responding in measured tones with a hint of mockery beneath them before they could knock i opened the door and indicated that we should talk in their room they hadnt heard about the shootings at metairie since according to angel they hadnt been listening to the radio in the rental car his face was red as he spoke and his lips were pale i dont think that i had ever seen him so angry in their room the bickering started again stacey byron a bottle blonde in her early forties who had kept her figure remarkably well for a woman of her age had apparently come on to louis in the course of their interrogation of her louis had in a manner responded i was pumping her for information he explained his mouth twitching in amusement as he looked sideways at angel angel was unimpressed sure you wanted to pump her but the only information you were after was her bra size and the dimensions of her ass he spat louis rolled his eyes in exaggerated bafflement and i thought for a moment that angel was going to strike him his fists bunched and he moved forward slightly before he managed to restrain himself i felt sorry for angel while i didnt believe there was anything in louiss courting of edward byrons wife beyond the natural response of any individual to the favorable attentions of another and louiss belief that by leading her on she might give away something about her exhusband i knew how much louis mattered to angel angels history was murky louiss more so but i remembered things about angel things that i sometimes felt louis forgot when angel was sent down to rikers island he attracted the attentions of a man named william vance vance had killed a korean shopkeeper in the course of a botched robbery in brooklyn and that was how he ended up in rikers but there were other things suspected of him that he had raped and killed an elderly woman in utica mutilating her before she died that he may have been linked to a similar killing in delaware there was no proof other than rumor and conjecture but when the opportunity came to put vance away for the killing of the korean the da to his credit seized it and for some reason vance decided that he wanted angel dead i heard that angel had dissed him when vance had tried to get it on with him that he had knocked out one of vances teeth in the showers but there was no telling with a man like vance the workings of his mind were obscure and confused by hatred and strange bitter longing now vance didnt just want to rape angel he wanted to kill him and kill him slowly angel had pulled three to five after one week in rikers the odds of him surviving his first month had plummeted angel had no friends on the inside and fewer still outside so he called me i knew that it pained him to do so he was proud and i think that under ordinary circumstances he would have tried to work out his problems for himself but william vance with his tattoos of bloodied knives on his arms and a spiders web over his chest was far from ordinary i did what i could i pulled vances files and copied the transcripts of his interrogation over the utica killing and a number of similar incidents i copied details of the evidence assembled against him and the account of an eyewitness who later retracted after vance made a call and threatened to fuck her and her children to death if she gave evidence against him then i took a trip to rikers i spoke to vance through a transparent screen he had added an india ink tattoo of a tear below his left eye bringing the total number of tattooed tears to three each one representing a life taken a spiders silhouette was visible at the base of his neck i spoke to him softly for about ten minutes i warned him that if anything happened to angel anything at all i would make sure that every con in the place knew that he was only a hairs breadth away from sexual homicide charges involving old defenseless women vance had five years left to serve before he became eligible for parole if his fellow inmates found out what he was suspected of doing there were men who could ensure that he would have to spend those five years in solitary to avoid death even then he would have to check his food every day for powdered glass would have to pray that a guards attention didnt wander for an instant while he was being escorted to the yard for his hours recreation or while he was being brought to the prison doctor when the stress began to take its toll on his health vance knew all this and yet two days after we spoke he tried to castrate angel with a shank only the force of angels heel connecting with vances knee saved him although angel still needed twenty stitches across his stomach and thigh after vance slashed wildly at him as he fell to the ground vance was taken in the shower the next morning persons unknown held him down used a wrench to hold his mouth open and then pumped water mixed with detergent into his body the poison destroyed his insides tearing apart his stomach and almost costing him his life for the remainder of his life in prison he was a shell of a man racked by pains in his gut that made him howl in the night it had taken one telephone call i live with that too after he was released angel hooked up with louis im not even sure how these two solitary creatures met exactly but they had now been together for six years angel needed louis and in his way louis needed angel too but i sometimes thought that the balance of the relationship hinged on angel men and men men and women whatever the permutation in the end one partner always feels more than the other and that partner usually suffers for it it emerged that they hadnt learned much from stacey byron the cops had been watching the house from the front but louis and angel dressed in the only suit he owned had come in from the back louis had flashed his fitness club membership and his smile as he told mrs byron that they were just conducting a routine search of her garden and they spent the next hour talking to her about her exhusband about how often louis worked out and in the end whether or not hed ever had a white woman it was at that point that angel had really started to get annoyed she says she hasnt seen him in four months said louis says that last time she saw him he didnt say much just asked after her and the kids and took some old clothes from the attic seems he had a carrier bag from some drugstore in opelousas and the feds are concentrating their search there does she know why the feds are looking for him nope they told her that he might be able to assist them with information on some unsolved crimes she aint dumb though and i fed her a little more to see if shed bite she said that he always had an interest in medical affairs seems he might have had ambitions to be a doctor at one time although he didnt have the education to be a tree surgeon did you ask her if she thought he could kill i didnt have to seems he threatened to kill her once while they were arguing over the terms of the divorce did she remember what he said louis nodded deeply once uhhuh he said hed tear her fucking face off angel and louis parted on bad terms with angel retiring to rachels room while louis sat on the balcony of their room and took in the sounds and smells of new orleans not all of them pleasant i was thinking of getting a bite to eat he said you interested i was surprised i guessed that he wanted to talk but i had never spent time with louis without angel being present as well i checked on rachel the bed was empty and i could hear the shower running i knocked gently on the door its open she said when i entered she had the shower curtain wrapped around her suits you i said clear plastic is in this season the sleep hadnt done her any good there were dark rings under her eyes and she still looked shaky she made a halfhearted effort to smile but it was more like a grimace of pain than anything else you want to go out and eat im not hungry im going to do some work then take two sleeping pills and try to sleep without dreaming i told her that louis and i were heading out then went to tell angel i found him flicking through the notes rachel had made he motioned to my chart on the bedroom wall lot of blank spaces on that i still have one or two details to work out like who did it and why he gave me a twisted grin yeah but im trying not to get too hung up on minor problems you okay he nodded i think this whole thing is gettin to me all this he waved an arm at the illustrations on the wall louis and i are heading out to eat you wanna come nah id only be the lemon you can have him thanks ill break the bad news of my sexual awakening to the swimsuit illustrated models tomorrow theyll be heartbroken look after rachel will you this hasnt been one of her better days ill be right along the hall louis and i sat in felixs restaurant and oyster bar on the corner of bourbon and iberville there werent too many tourists there they tended to gravitate toward the acme oyster house across the street where they served red beans and savory rice in a hollowedout boat of french bread or a classier french quarter joint like nola felixs was plainer tourists dont care much for plain after all they can get plain at home louis ordered an oyster poboy and doused it in hot sauce sipping an abita beer between bites i had fries and a chicken poboy washed down with mineral water waiter thinks youre a sissy commented louis as i sipped my water the ballet was in town hed hit on you for tickets shows what he knows i replied youre confusing things by not conforming to the stereotype maybe you should mince more his mouth twitched and he raised his hand for another abita it came quickly the waiter performed the neat trick of making sure we werent left waiting for anything while trying to spend as little time as possible in the vicinity of our table other diners chose to take the scenic route to their tables rather than pass too close to us and those forced to sit near us seemed to eat at a slightly faster pace than the rest louis had that effect on people it was as if there was a shell of potential violence around him and something more the sense that if that violence erupted it would not be the first time that it had done so your friend woolrich he said as he drained the abita halfway with one mouthful you trust him i dont know he has his own agenda hes a fed they only got their own agendas he eyed me over the top of the bottle i think if you were climbing a rock with your friend and you slipped found yourself dangling on the end of the rope with him at the other end hed cut the rope youre a cynic his mouth twitched again if the dead could speak theyd call all cynics realists if the dead could speak theyd tell us to have more sex while we can i picked at my fries the feds have anything on you suspicions maybe nothing more thats not really what im getting at his eyes were unblinking and there was no warmth in them now i think that if he had believed woolrich was close to him he would have killed him and it would not have cost him another thought afterward why is woolrich helping us he asked eventually ive thought about that too i said im not sure part of it could be that he empathizes with the need to stay in touch with whats going on if he feeds me information then he can control the extent of my involvement but i knew that wasnt all louis was right woolrich had his own agenda he had depths to him that i only occasionally glimpsed as when the different shifting colors on the surface of the sea hint at the sharp declivities and deep spaces that lie beneath he was a hard man to be with in some ways he conducted his friendship with me on his own terms and in the time i had known him months had gone by without any contact from him he made up for this with a strange loyalty a sense that even when he was absent from their lives he never forgot those closest to him but as a fed woolrich played hardball he had progressed to assistant sac by making collars by attaching his name to highprofile operations and by fixing other agents wagons when they got in his way he was intensely ambitious and maybe he saw the traveling man as a way of reaching greater heights sac assistant director a deputy directorship maybe even to eventually becoming the first agent to be appointed directly to the post of director the pressure on him was intense but if woolrich were to be responsible for bringing an end to the traveling man he would be assured a bright powerful future within the bureau i had a part to play in this and woolrich knew it and felt it strongly enough that he would use whatever friendship existed between us to bring about an end to what was taking place i think hes using me as bait i said at last and hes holding the line how much you think hes holding back louis finished his beer and smacked his lips appreciatively hes like an iceberg i replied were only seeing the ten percent above the surface whatever the feds know theyre not sharing it with the local cops and woolrich sure isnt sharing it with us theres something more going on here and only woolrich and maybe a handful of feds are privy to it you play chess in my way he replied dryly somehow i couldnt see that way including a standard board this whole thing is like a chess game i continued except we only get to see the other players move when one of our pieces is taken the rest of the time its like playing in the dark louis raised a finger for the check the waiter looked relieved and our mr byron i shrugged i felt strangely distant from what was happening part of it was because we were players on the periphery of the investigation but part of it was also because i needed that distance to think in one way what had taken place with rachel that afternoon and what it meant to my feelings of grief and loss about susan had given me some of that distance i dont know we were only beginning to construct a picture of byron like a figure at the center of a jigsaw puzzle around which other pieces might interlock well work our way toward him first i want to find out what remarr saw the night tante marie and tee jean were killed and i want to know why david fontenot was out at honey island alone it was clear now that lionel fontenot would move against joe bones joe bones knew that too which was why he had risked an assault at metairie once lionel was back in his compound he would be out of the reach of joe boness men the next move was lionels the check arrived i paid and louis left a deliberately overgenerous twentydollar tip the waiter looked at the bill like andrew jackson was going to bite his finger when he tried to lift it i think were going to have to talk to lionel fontenot i said as we left and joe bones louis actually smiled joe aint gonna be too keen on talking to you seeing as how his boy tried to put you in the ground i kinda figured that i replied could be that lionel fontenot might help us out there we walked back to the flaisance the streets of new orleans arent the safest in the world but i didnt think that anyone would bother us i was right i slept late the next morning rachel had returned to her own room to sleep when i knocked her voice sounded harsh with tiredness she told me she wanted to stay in bed for a while and when she felt better she would go out to loyola again i asked angel and louis to watch out for her then drove from the flaisance the incident at metairie had left me shaken and the prospect of facing joe bones again was unappealing i also felt a crushing sense of guilt for what had happened to rachel for what i had drawn her into and for what i had forced her to do i needed to get out of new orleans at least for a short time i wanted to clear my head to try to see things from a different angle i ate a bowl of chicken soup in the gumbo shop on st peter and then headed out of the city morphy lived about four miles from cecilia a few miles northwest of lafayette he had bought and was refurbishing a raised plantation home by a small river a budget version of the classic old louisiana houses that had been built at the end of the nineteenth century a blend of french colonial west indian and european architectural influences the house presented a strange spectacle its main living quarters were on top of an aboveground basement area which had once been used for storage and as protection from flooding this section of the house was brick and morphy had reworked the arched openings with what looked like handcarved frames the living quarters above which would usually have been weatherboard or plastercovered had been replaced with timber slats a doublepitched roof which had been partially reslated extended over the gallery i had called ahead and told angie i was on my way morphy had just got home when i arrived i found him in the yard at the rear of the house benching two hundred in the evening air what do you think of the house he asked as i approached not even pausing in his reps as he spoke its great looks like you still have some way to go before its finished he grunted with the effort of the final rep as i acted as spotter slotting the bar back onto its rest he stood up and stretched then looked at the back of his house with barely concealed admiration it was built by a frenchman in eighteen eightyeight he said he knew what he was doing its built on an eastwest axis with principal exposure to the south he pointed out the lines of the building as he spoke he designed it the way the europeans designed their houses so that the low angle of the sun in winter would heat the building then in the summer the sun would only shine on it in the morning and evening most american houses arent built that way they just put em up whatever way suits em throw a stick in the air and see where it lands we were spoiled by cheap energy then the arabs came along and hiked up their prices and people had to start thinking again about the layout of their houses he smiled dont know how much good an eastwest house does around here though sun shines all the goddamn time anyway when he had showered we sat at a table in the kitchen with angie and talked as she cooked angie was almost a foot smaller than her husband a slim darkskinned woman with auburn hair that flowed down her back she was a junior school teacher but she did some painting in her spare time her canvases dark impressionistic pieces set around water and sky adorned the walls of the house morphy drank a bottle of breaux bridge and i had a soda angie sipped a glass of white wine as she cooked she cut four chicken breasts into about sixteen pieces and set them to one side as she set about preparing the roux cajun gumbo is made with roux a glutinous thickener as a base angie poured peanut oil into a cast iron skillet over a high flame added in an equal amount of flour and beat it with a whisk continuously so it wouldnt burn gradually turning the roux from blond to beige and through mahogany until it reached a dark chocolate color then she took it off the heat and allowed it to cool still stirring while morphy looked on i helped her chop the trinity of onion green pepper and celery and watched as she sweated them in oil she added a seasoning of thyme and oregano paprika and cayenne onion and garlic salt then dropped in thick pieces of chorizo she added the chicken and more spices until their scent filled the room after about half an hour she spooned white rice onto plates and poured the thick rich gumbo over it we ate in silence savoring the flavors in our mouths when we had washed and dried the dishes angie left us and went to bed morphy and i sat in the kitchen and i told him about raymond aguillard and his belief that he had seen the figure of a girl at honey island i told him of tante maries dreams and my feeling that somehow david fontenots death at honey island could be linked to the girl morphy didnt say anything for a long time he didnt sneer at visions of ghosts or at an old womans belief that the voices she heard were real instead all he said was you sure you know where this place is i nodded then well give it a try im free tomorrow so you better stay here tonight we got a spare room you can use i called rachel at the flaisance and told her what i intended to do the next day and where in honey island we were likely to be she said that she would tell angel and louis and that she felt a little better for her sleep it would take her a long time to get over the death of joe boness man it was early morning barely ten before seven when we prepared to leave morphy wore heavy steeltoed caterpillar work boots old jeans and a sleeveless sweatshirt over a longsleeved tshirt the sweat was dappled with paint and there were patches of tar on the jeans his head was freshly shaved and smelled of witch hazel while we drank coffee and ate toast on the gallery angie came out in a white robe and rubbed her husbands clean scalp smirking at him as she took a seat beside him morphy acted like it annoyed the hell out of him but he doted on her every touch when we rose to go he kissed her deeply with the fingers of his right hand entwined in her hair her body instinctively rose from the chair to meet him but he pulled away laughing and she reddened it was only then that i noticed the swelling at her belly she was no more than five months gone i guessed as we walked across the grass at the front of the house she stood on the gallery her weight on one hip and a light breeze tugging at her robe and watched her husband depart been married long i asked as we walked toward a cypress glade that obscured the view of the house from the road two years in january im a contented man never thought i would be but that girl changed my life there was no embarrassment as he spoke and he acknowledged it with a smile when is the baby due he smiled again late december guys held a party for me when they found out to celebrate the fact that i was shooting live ones an old ford truck was parked in the glade with a trailer attached on which a wide flatbottomed aluminum boat lay covered in tarpaulin its engine tilted forward so that it rested on the bed toussaints brother dropped it over late last night he explained does some hauling on the side wheres toussaint in bed with food poisoning he ate some bad shrimp least thats how he tells it personally i think hes just too damn lazy to give up his morning in bed in the back of the truck beneath some more tarpaulin were an axe a chain saw two lengths of chain some strong nylon rope and a cooler there was also a dry suit and mask a pair of waterproof flashlights and two air tanks morphy added a flask of coffee some water two sticks of french bread and four chicken breasts coated in kpauls cajun spices all contained in a waterproof bag then climbed into the drivers seat of the truck and started her up she belched smoke and rattled a bit but the engine sounded good and strong i climbed in beside him and we drove toward honey island a clifton chenier tape on the trucks battered stereo we entered the reserve at slidell a collection of shopping malls fast food joints and chinese buffets on the north shore of lake pontchartrain named for the democratic senator john slidell in the federal election slidell arranged for two steamboats to carry a bunch of irish and german voters from new orleans to plaquemines parish to vote there was nothing illegal about that what was illegal was letting them vote at all the other polling stations along the route a mist still hung over the water and the trees as we unloaded the boat at the pearl river ranger station beside a collection of rundown fishing shacks that floated near the bank we loaded the chains rope chain saw the diving gear and the food in a tree beside us the early morning sun caught the threads of a huge intricate web at the center of which lay unmoving a golden orb spider then with the sound of the motor blending with the noise of insects and birds we moved onto the pearl the banks of the river were lined with high tupelo gum water birch willows and some tall cypress with trumpet creeper vines their red flowers in bloom winding up their trunks here and there trees were marked with plastic bottles signs that catfish lines had been sunk we passed a village of riverside homes most of them downattheheel with flatbottomed pirogues tied up outside them a blue heron watched us calmly from the branches of a cypress on a log beneath him a yellowbellied turtle lay soaking up the sun i still had raymond aguillards map but it took us two attempts to find the trevasse the trappers channel that he had marked there was a stand of gum trees at its entrance their swollen buttresses like the bulbs of flowers with a sole green ash leaning almost across the gap further in branches weighed down with spanish moss hung almost to the surface of the water and the air was redolent with the mingled scents of growth and decay misshapen tree trunks surrounded by duckweed stood like monuments in the early morning sun east i could see the gray dome of a beaver lodge and as we watched a snake slithered into the water not five feet from us diamondback said morphy around us water dripped from cypress and tupelo and birdsong echoed in the trees any chance of gators here i asked he shrugged maybe dont bother people much though unless people bother them theres easier pickings in the swamps if you see any while im down there fire a shot to let me know whats happening the bayou started to narrow until it was barely wide enough to allow the boat passage i felt the bottom scrape on a tree trunk resting below us morphy killed the engine and we used our hands and a pair of wooden paddles to pull ourselves through it seemed then that we might somehow have made a mistake in our map reading because we were faced with a wall of wild rice the tall green stalks like blades in the water there was only one narrow gap visible big enough for a child to pass through morphy shrugged and restarted the engine aiming us for the gap i used the paddle to beat back the rice stalks as we moved forward something splashed close by us and a dark shape like a large rat sliced through the water nutria said morphy i could see the big rodents nose and whiskers now as it stopped beside a tree trunk and sniffed the air inquisitively taste worse than gators i hear were trying to sell their meat to the chinese since no one else wants to eat it the rice blended into sharpedged grass that cut at my hands as i worked the paddle and then the boat was free and we were in a kind of lagoon formed by a gradual accumulation of silt its banks surrounded mainly by gum and willows that dragged the fingers of their branches in the water there was some almost firm ground at the eastern edge near some arrowroot lilies with wild pig tracks in the dirt the animals attracted by the promise of the arrowroot at the lilies base further in i could see the rotting remains of a tcutter probably one of the craft that had originally cut the channel its big v engine was gone and there were holes in its hull we tied the boat up at a sole red swamp maple that was almost covered with resurrection fern waiting for the rains to bring it back to life morphy stripped down to a pair of nike cycling shorts rubbed himself down with grease and put the dry suit on he added the flippers then strapped on the tank and tested it most of the waters around here are no more than ten maybe fifteen feet deep but this place is different he said you can see it in the way the light reflects on the water its deeper twenty feet or more leaves sticks and logs floated on the water and insects flitted above the surface the water looked dark and green he washed the mask in the swamp water then turned to me never thought id be looking for swamp ghosts on my day off he said raymond aguillard says he saw the girl here i replied david fontenot died up the river theres something here you know what youre looking for he nodded probably a container of some sort heavy sealed morphy flicked on the flashlight slipped on his mask and began sucking bottled air i tied one end of the climbing rope to his belt and another to the trunk of the maple yanked it firm then patted him on the back he raised a thumb and waded into the water two or three yards out he began to dive and i started to feed the rope out through my hands i had had little experience of diving beyond a few basic lessons taken during a holiday with susan on the florida keys i didnt envy morphy swimming around in that swamp during my teens we went swimming in the saco river south of the portland city limits during the summer long lean pike dwelt in those waters vicious things that brought a hint of the primeval with them when they brushed your bare legs it made you think of stories you had heard about them biting small children or dragging swimming dogs down to the bottom of the river the waters of honey island swamp were like another world compared to the saco with its glittering snakes and its cowens the name the cajuns give to the swamps snapping turtles honey island seemed so much more feral than the backwaters of maine but there were alligator gar here too and scaled shortnoses as well as perch and bass and bowfins and gators i thought of these things as morphy disappeared below the surface of the bayou but i also thought of the young girl who might have been dumped in these waters where creatures she couldnt name bumped and clicked against the side of her tomb while others searched for rust holes through which to get at the rotting meat inside morphy surfaced after five minutes indicated the short northeastern bank and shook his head then he submerged again and the line on the ground snaked south as he swam after another five minutes the rope began to pull out quickly morphy broke the surface again but this time some distance from where the rope entered the water he swam back to the bank removed the mask and mouthpiece and breathed in short gasps as he gestured back toward the southern end of the bayou we got a couple of metal boxes maybe four feet long two feet wide and eighteen inches deep dumped down there he said ones empty the others locked and bolted maybe a hundred yards away theres a bunch of oil barrels marked with red fleursdelys they belong to the old brevis chemical company used to operate out of west baton rouge until a big fire in eightynine put it out of business thats it nothing else down there i looked out toward the edge of the bayou where thick roots lay obscured beneath the water could we pull in the box using the rope i asked could do but that box is heavy and if we bust it open while hauling it in well destroy whatevers inside well have to bring the boat out and try to haul it up it was getting very warm now although the trees on the bank provided some shade from the sun morphy took two bottles of still mineral water from the cooler and we drank them sitting on the bank then morphy and i got into the boat and took it out to his marker twice the box caught on some obstacle on the bottom as i tried to pull it up and i had to wait for morphy to signal before i could start hauling it in again eventually the gray metal box broke the surface of the water morphy pushing up from beneath before he went back down to tie the marker rope to one of the oil barrels in case we had to search them i brought the boat back to the landing and dragged the box up onto the shore the chain and lock securing it were old and rusted probably too old to yield anything of any use to us i took the axe and struck at the rusty lock that held the chain in place it broke as morphy walked onto the bank he knelt beside me the air tank still on his back and the mask pushed up on his forehead as i pulled at the lid of the box it was stuck fast i took the blunt head of the axe and struck upward along the edges until the lid lifted inside was a consignment of breechloading springfield caliber rifles and the bones of what seemed to be a small dog the butts of the rifles had almost rotted but i could still see the letters lng on the metal butt plates stolen rifles said morphy pulling one free and examining it maybe eighteen seventy or eighteen eighty the authorities probably issued a stolen arms proclamation after these were taken and the thief dumped them or left them there with the intention of coming back he prodded at the dogs skull with his fingers the bones are an indicator of some kind pity nobody been seein the hound of the baskervilles out here else wed have the whole mystery cleared up he looked at the rifles then back out toward the oil drums he sighed then began to swim out to the marker hauling in the drums was a laborious process the chain slipped off three times as we tried to pull in the first drum morphy came back for a second chain and wrapped it parcel style around the drum the boat almost overturned when i tried to open the barrel while i was still on the water so we were forced to bring it back to dry land when we eventually got it to the bank brown and rusting it contained only stale oil the drums had a hole for loading and pouring the oil but the entire lid could also be pried off when we opened the second drum it didnt even contain oil just some stones that had been used to weigh the barrel down by now morphy was exhausted we stopped for a time to eat some of the chicken and bread and drink some of the coffee it was now past midday and the heat in the bayou was heavy and draining after we had rested i offered to do some of the diving morphy didnt refuse so i handed him my shoulder holster then suited up and strapped on the spare tank the water was surprisingly cool as i slipped into it as it reached my chest it almost took my breath away the chains were heavy across my shoulder as i guided myself along the marker rope with one hand when i reached the spot where the rope entered the water i slipped the flashlight from my belt and dived the water was deeper than i expected and very dark the duckweed above me blocking out the sunlight in patches at the periphery of my vision fish twisted and spun the barrels of which five remained all piled in a heap were gathered around the submerged trunk of an ancient tree its roots buried deep in the bottom of the bayou any boat that might have been using the bayou bank to land on would have avoided the tree which meant that the barrels were in no danger of being disturbed the water at the base of the tree was darker than the rest so that without the flashlight the barrels would have been invisible i wrapped the top barrel in chains and yanked once to test its weight it tumbled from the top of the pile yanking the rope from my grasp as it headed for the bottom the water muddied and dirt and vegetation obscured my vision and then everything went black as oil began to leak from the drum i was kicking back to get into clearer water when i heard the dull echoing sound of a gunshot from above me for a moment i thought that morphy might be in trouble until i remembered what the gunshot was supposed to signal and realized that it was i not morphy who was in trouble i was breaking for the surface when i saw the gator it was small maybe only six feet long but the flashlight beam caught the wickedlooking teeth jutting out along its jaws and its lightcolored underbelly it was as disoriented by the oil and dirt as i was but it seemed to be angling toward my flashlight i clicked it off and instantly lost sight of the gator as i made a final kick for the surface when i broke the water the marker rope was fifteen feet in front of me morphy beside it come on he shouted theres no other landing around you i splashed hard as i swam to him all the time aware of the reptile cruising beneath me as i splashed i spotted it on the surface to my left about twenty feet away from me i could see the scales of its back its hungry eyes and the line of its jaw pointed in my direction i turned on my back so i could keep the gator in my sight and kicked out sometimes using the rope to pull myself along at other times using my hands i was still five feet from the boat when the gator moved working its way swiftly through the water in my direction i spat the mouthpiece out shoot it goddammit i shouted i heard the boom of a gun and a spume of water kicked up in front of the gator then a second the creature stopped short and then a sprinkling of pink and white fell to my right and it turned in that direction it reached the objects just as a second shower fell farther away to the right and i felt the boat against my back and morphys hands helping me to haul myself up we turned for the bank as morphy sent a third handful of marshmallows into the air when i looked at him he was grinning as he popped a last marshmallow into his mouth out on the bayou the gator was snapping at the last of the candy scared you huh morphy smiled as i shrugged off the air tank and lay flat on the bottom of the boat i nodded and kicked off a flipper i think youre going to have to get your dry suit cleaned i said we sat on a log and watched the gator for a while it cruised the bayou looking for more marshmallows eventually settling for a waitandsee policy which consisted of it lying partially submerged near the marker rope we sipped coffee from tin cups and finished off the last of the chicken you should have shot it i said this is a nature reserve and there are laws about killing gators responded morphy testily not much point in having a nature reserve if people can come in when they please and shoot all the wildlife we sipped the coffee some more until i heard the sound of a boat coming our way through the rice and grass shit said a familiar brooklyn drawl as the prow of the boat broke the grass its the donner party angel emerged first then louis behind him controlling the rudder they moved steadily toward us and tied up at the maple angel splashed into the water then followed our gaze out to the gator he caught one sight of the partially submerged reptile and ran awkwardly onto the bank his knees high and his elbows pumping man what is this jurassic park he said he turned to louis who jumped from his boat to ours and then onto the bank hey didnt you tell your sister not to be swimmin in no strange ponds angel was dressed in his usual jeans and battered sneakers with a denim jacket over a doonesbury tshirt that depicted duke and the motto death before unconsciousness louis was wearing crocodileskin boots black levis and a white collarless liz claiborne shirt we dropped by to see how you were said angel casting anxious glances out at the gator after i had introduced him to morphy he held a bag of donuts in his hand our friends gonna be real upset if he sees you wearing one of his relatives louis i said louis sniffed and approached the waters edge is there a problem he asked at last we were diving and then wally gator appeared and we werent diving anymore i explained louis sniffed again hmm he said then he drew his sig and blew the tip of the gators tail off the reptile thrashed in pain and the water around it turned bright red then it turned and headed off into the bayou trailing blood behind it you should have shot it he said lets not get into it i responded roll up your sleeves gentlemen were going to need some help i still had the dry suit on so i offered to keep diving trying to prove to me that you aint chicken grinned morphy nope i said as we untied the boat trying to prove it to myself we rowed out to the marker rope and then i dived down with the hook and chains leaving angel topside with morphy and his gun in case the gator showed up again louis joined us in the second boat a thick black film of oil had formed on the surface of the water and hung in the depths below the barrels had scattered when the topmost drum fell i checked the ruptured barrel with the flashlight but it appeared to contain nothing except the oil that remained it was laborious work tying the barrel and hauling it up each time but with two boats it meant that we could transport two barrels at a time to the bank there was probably an easier way to do it but we hadnt figured it out the sun was growing low and the waters were bathed in gold when we found her it seems to me now that when i touched the barrel for the first time to attach the chains something coursed through my system and tightened in my stomach like a fist i felt a jolt a blade flashed before my eyes and the depths were colored by a fountain of blood or perhaps it was simply the dying sun on the water above reflected on my mask i closed my eyes for a moment and felt movement around me not just the water of the bayou or the fish in its depths but another swimmer who twisted around my body and legs i thought i felt her hair brush my cheek but when i reached out i caught only swamp weed in my hand this barrel was heavier than the others weighed down as we would discover with masonry bricks that had been split neatly in half it would need the combined efforts of morphy and angel to pull it up its her i said to morphy weve found her and then i swam down to the barrel and maneuvered it slowly over the rocks and tree trunks at the bottom as we brought it up we all seemed to handle this barrel more gently than the rest as if the girl inside was merely sleeping and we didnt want to disturb her as if she was not long decayed but had been laid within it only yesterday on the bank angel took the crowbar and carefully applied it to the rim of the lid but it refused to move he examined it more closely its been sealed he said he scraped the crowbar over the surface of the barrel and checked the mark left the barrels been treated with something as well thats why its in better condition than the others it was true the barrel had hardly rusted and the fleurdelys on its side was as clear and bright as if it had been painted only days before i thought for a moment we could use the chain saw to cut it but if i was right and the girl was inside i didnt want to damage the remains we could also have called for assistance from the local cops or even the feds i suggested it more out of duty than desire but even morphy declined he might have been concerned at the embarrassment that would be caused if the barrel was empty but when i looked in his eyes i could see that wasnt the case he wanted us to take it as far as we could in the end we tested the barrel by gently tapping along its length with the axe from the difference in sound we judged as best we could where we could safely cut morphy carefully made an incision near the sealed end of the barrel and using a combination of chain saw and crowbar we cut an area that was roughly half the circumference then pushed it up with the crowbar and shined a flashlight inside the body was little more than bones and shreds of material the skin and flesh entirely rotted away she had been dumped in headfirst and her legs had been broken to fit her into the space when i shined the beam to the far end of the barrel i glimpsed bared teeth and strands of hair we stood silently beside her surrounded by the lapping water and the sounds of the swamp it was late that night when i got back to the flaisance while we waited for the slidell police and the rangers angel and louis departed with morphys agreement i stayed on to give my statement and back up morphys version of what had taken place on morphys advice the locals called the fbi i didnt wait around if woolrich wanted to talk he knew where to find me the light was still on in rachels room as i passed so i stopped and knocked she opened the door wearing a pink calvin klein nightshirt which stopped at midthigh level angel told me what happened she said opening the door wider to let me enter that poor girl she hugged me and then ran the shower in the bathroom i stayed in there for a long time my hands against the tiles letting the water roll over my head and back after i had dried myself i wrapped the towel around my waist and found rachel sitting on the bed leafing through her papers she cocked an eyebrow at me such modesty she said with a little smile i sat on the edge of the bed and she wrapped her arms around me from behind i felt her cheek and her warm breath against my back how are you feeling i asked her grip tightened a little okay i think she turned me around so that i was facing her she knelt on the bed before me her hands clasped between her legs and bit her lip then she reached out and gently almost tentatively ran her hand through my hair i thought you psychology types were supposed to be good at all this i said she shrugged i get just as confused as everybody else except i know all the terminology for my confusion she sighed listen what happened yesterdayi dont want to put pressure on you i know how hard all this is for you because of susan and i held my hand against her cheek and rubbed her lips gently with my thumb then i kissed her and felt her mouth open beneath mine i wanted to hold her to love her to drive away the vision of the dead girl thanks i said my mouth still against her but i know what im doing well she said as she eased back slowly on the bed at least one of us does the following morning the remains of the girl lay on a metal table curled fetally by the constriction of the barrel as if to protect herself for eternity on the instructions of the fbi she had been brought to new orleans weighed and measured xrayed and fingerprinted the body bag in which she had been removed from honey island had been examined for debris that might have fallen from her while she was being transported the clean tiles the shining metal tables the glinting medical instruments the white lights hanging above them all seemed too harsh too relentless in their mission to expose to examine to reveal it seemed a final indignity after the terrors of her final moments to display her here in the sterility of this room with these men looking upon her a part of me wanted to cover her with a shroud and carry her carefully gently to a dark hole beside flowing water where green trees would shade the ground under which she lay and where no one would disturb her again but another part of me the rational part knew that she deserved a name that she needed an identity to put an end to the anonymity of her sufferings and perhaps to close in on the man who had reduced her to this and so we stood back as the gowned coroner and his assistants moved in with their tapes and their blades and their whitegloved hands the pelvis is the most easily recognizable distinguishing feature between the male and female skeletons the greater sciatic notch situated behind the inominate bonewhich itself consists of the hip the ischium the ilium and the pubisis wider in the female with a subpubic angle roughly the size of that between the thumb and forefinger the pelvic outlet is also larger in the female but the thigh sockets are smaller the sacrum wider even the female skull is different from that of the male a reflection in miniature of the physical differences between the two sexes the female skull is as smooth and rounded as the female breast yet smaller than the male skull the forehead is higher and more rounded the eye sockets too are higher and the edges less sharply defined the female jaw palate and teeth are smaller the skeletal remains before us conformed to the general pelvic and skull rules governing the female body in estimating the age of the body at the time of death the ossification centers or areas of bone formation were examined as were the teeth the femur of the girls body was almost completely fused at the head although there was only partial joining of the collarbone to the top of the breastbone after an examination of the sutures on her skull the coroner estimated her age at twentyone or twentytwo there were marks on her forehead the base of her jaw and on her left cheekbone where the killer had cut through to the bone as he removed her face her dental features were recorded a process known as forensic odontology to be checked against missing persons files while samples of bone marrow and hair were removed for possible use in dna profiling then woolrich morphy and i watched as the remains were wheeled away covered in a plastic wrap we exchanged a few words before we each went our separate way but to be honest i dont recall what they were all i could see was the girl all i could hear was the sound of water in my ears if the dna profiling and the dental records failed to reveal her identity woolrich had decided that facial reconstruction might prove valuable using a laser reflected from the skull to establish the contours which could then be compared against a known skull of similar dimensions he decided to contact quantico to make the initial arrangements as soon as he had had time to wash and grab a cup of coffee but facial reconstruction proved unnecessary it took less than two hours to identify the body of the young woman in the swamp although she had been lying in the dark waters for almost seven months she had been reported missing only three months before her name was lutice fontenot she was lionel fontenots half sister the fontenot compound lay five miles east of delacroix it was approached via a raised private road newly built which wound through swamps and decaying trees until it reached an area that had been cleared of all vegetation and was now only dark earth high fencing topped with razor wire enclosed two or three acres at the center of which lay a low singlestory horseshoeshaped concrete building a black convertible and three black explorers were parked in a line in the concrete lot created by the arms of the building to the rear was an older house a standard singlestory wooden dwelling with a porch and what looked like a series of parallel linked rooms no one seemed to be around as i pulled the rented taurus up to the compound gate louis in the passenger seat beside me rachel had taken the other rental with her on a final visit to loyola university maybe we should have called ahead i said as i looked at the silent compound beside me louis raised his hands slowly above his head and gestured in front of him with his chin two men dressed in jeans and faded shirts stood before us pointing heckler amp koch hks with retracted stocks i caught two more in the rearview mirror and a fifth wearing an axe in his belt opposite the passenger window they were hard weatheredlooking men some of them with beards already tinged with gray their boots were muddy and their hands were the hands of manual laborers scarred in places i watched as a man of medium height dressed in a blue denim shirt jeans and work boots walked toward the gate from the main compound building when he reached the gate he didnt open it but stood watching us through the fencing he had been burned at some point the skin on the right of his face was heavily scarred the right eye useless and the hair hadnt grown back on that side of his scalp a fold of skin hung over his dead eye and when he spoke he did so out of the left side of his mouth what you want here the voice was heavily accented cajun stock my names charlie parker i replied through the open window im here to see lionel fontenot who this he motioned at louis with a finger count basie i said the rest of the band couldnt make it pretty boy didnt crack a smile or even a half smile lionel dont see no one get yo ass outta here fo you get hurt he turned and walked back toward the compound hey i said you accounted for all of joe boness goons at metairie yet he stopped and turned back to us what you say he looked like id just insulted his sister i figure you have two bodies at metairie that no one can account for if theres a prize id like to claim it he seemed to consider this for a moment then you a joker you are i dont think you funny you dont think im funny i said there was an edge to my voice now his left eyelid flickered and an h ampk ended up two inches from my nose it smelled like it had been used recently try this for funny im the guy who hauled lutice fontenot from the bottom of honey island swamp you want to tell lionel that see if he laughs he didnt reply but pointed an infrared signaler at the compound gate it opened almost noiselessly get outta the car he said two of the men kept our hands in view and their guns trained on us as we opened the car doors then two others came forward and frisked us against the car looking for wires and weapons they handed louiss sig and knife and my s ampw to the scarred guy then checked the interior of the car for concealed weapons they opened the hood and trunk and checked under the car man you like the peace corps whispered louis make friends wherever you go thanks i replied its a gift when they were satisfied that it was clean we were allowed to drive slowly up to the compound with one of fontenots men the axe man in the back two men walked alongside the car we parked beside the jeeps and were escorted up to the older house on the porch waiting for us with a china cup of coffee in his hand was lionel fontenot the burn victim went up to him and spoke a few words in his ear but lionel stopped him with a raised hand and turned the hard stare on us i felt a raindrop fall on my head and within seconds we were standing in a downpour lionel left us in the rain i was wearing my blue linen liz claiborne suit and a white shirt with a blue silkknit tie i wondered if the dye would run the rain was heavy and the dirt around the house was already turning to mud when lionel ordered his men to leave took a seat on the porch and indicated with a nod of his head that we should come up we sat on a pair of wooden chairs with woven seats while lionel took a wooden recliner the burn victim stood behind us louis and i moved our chairs slightly as we sat so that we could keep him in view an elderly black maid with a face that i recognized from the metairie funeral party emerged from the house with a silver coffeepot and sugar and cream in a matching set all on an ornate silver tray there were three china cups and saucers on the tray multicolored birds chased one anothers tails around the rim of the cups and a heavy silver spoon with a sailing ship at the end lay neatly positioned beneath the handle of each one the maid placed the tray on a small wicker table and then left us lionel fontenot was wearing a pair of black cotton pants and a white shirt with an open collar a matching black jacket lay over the back of his chair and his brogues were newly polished he leaned over the table and poured three cups of coffee added two sugars to one and then handed it wordlessly to the burn victim cream and sugar he asked looking to louis and me in turn blacks fine i said likewise said louis lionel handed us each a cup it was all very polite above us the rain hammered on the porch roof you want to tell me how you came to be looking for my sister lionel said at last he looked like someone who finds a strange guy cleaning the windshield of his car and cant decide whether to tip him a buck or hit him with a tire iron he held his cup with his little finger cocked while he sipped his coffee i noticed that the burn victim did the same i told lionel some of what i knew then i told him about tante maries visions and her death and about the stories of the ghost of a girl at a honey island slough i think the man who killed your sister killed tante marie aguillard and her son he also killed my wife and my little girl i said thats how i came to be looking for your sister i didnt say that i was sorry for his pain he probably knew that anyway if he didnt then it wasnt worth saying you take out two men at metairie one i answered someone else killed the other lionel turned to louis you louis didnt reply someone else i repeated lionel put his cup down and spread his hands so why are you here now you want my gratitude im going to new orleans now to take away my sisters body i dont know that i want to thank you for that he turned his face away there was pain in his eyes but no tears lionel fontenot didnt look like a man with welldeveloped tear ducts thats not why im here i said quietly i want to know why lutice was reported missing only in the last three months i want to know what your brother was doing out at honey island on the night he was killed my brother he said love and frustration and guilt chased one another in his voice like the birds on his pretty cups then he seemed to catch himself i think he was about to tell me to go to hell to keep out of his familys business if i wanted to stay alive but i held his gaze and for a while he said nothing i got no reason to trust you he said i can find the man who did this i said my voice was low and even lionel nodded more to himself than to me and appeared to make his decision my sister left at the end of january start of february he began she didnt likehe waved his left hand gently at the compoundall this there was trouble with joe bones some people got hurt he paused and chose his next words carefully one day she closed her bank account packed a bag and left a note she didnt tell us to our faces david wouldnt have let her leave anyways we tried to trace her we looked up friends in the city even people she knew in seattle and florida there was nothing not a trace david was real cut up about her she was our half sister when my momma died my father married again lutice came out of that marriage when my father and her momma diedthat was in nineteen eightythree in an automobile accidentwe took care of her david especially they were real close few months back david started having dreams about lutice he didnt say nothing at first but he got thinner and paler and his nerves started to play at him when he told me i thought he was going crazy and told him so but the dreams just kept comin he dreamed of her underwater he said heard her banging against metal in the night he was sure that something had happened to her but what could we do we had searched half of louisiana id even made approaches to some of joe boness men to see if there was something that maybe needed to be sorted out there was nothing she was gone next thing i knew he reported her missing and we had the cops crawling over the compound mon i nearly killed him that day but he insisted he said something had happened to lutice he was beyond reason by then and i had to take care of things on my own with joe bones hangin over me like a sword bout to fall he looked to the burn victim leon here was with him when the call came he wouldnt say nothin about where he was goin just took off in his damned yellow car when leon tried to stop him he pulled a gun on him i glanced at leon if he felt any guilt about what had happened to david fontenot he kept it well hidden any idea who made the call i asked lionel shook his head i put my cup on the tray the coffee was cold and untasted when are you going to hit joe bones i asked lionel blinked like he had just been slapped and out of the corner of my eye i saw leon step forward the hell you talkin about said lionel youve got a second funeral coming up at least as soon as the police release your sisters body either you wont have too many mourners or the funeral will be overrun with police and media whatever happens i figure youll try to take out joe bones before then probably at his place in west feliciana you owe him for david and anyway joe wont rest easy until youre dead one of you will try to finish it lionel looked at leon they clean leon nodded lionel leaned forward there was menace in his voice the fuck does any of this have to do with you i wasnt fazed by him the threat of violence was in his face but i needed lionel fontenot you heard about tony remarrs death lionel nodded remarr was killed because he was out at the aguillard place after tante marie and her son were murdered i explained his fingerprints were found in tante maries blood joe bones heard about it and told remarr to lie low but the killer found outi dont know how yetand i think he used your brother to lure remarr into making the hit so he could take him out i want to know what remarr told joe bones lionel considered what i had said and you cant get to joe bones without me beside me louiss mouth twitched lionel caught the movement thats not entirely true i said but if youre going to be calling on him anyway we might tag along i go calling on joe bones his fucking place is gonna be real fucking quiet by the time i leave said lionel softly you do what you have to do i replied but i need joe bones alive for a while lionel stood and buttoned the top of his shirt he took a wide black silk tie from the inside pocket of his jacket and began to put it on using his reflection in the window to check the knot where you staying he asked i told him and gave leon the number of my phone well be in touch said lionel maybe dont come out here again our discussions appeared to be at an end louis and i were almost at the car when lionel spoke again he pulled on his jacket and adjusted the collar then smoothed down the lapels one thing he said i know morphy out of st martin was there when lutice was found you got cop friends yeah i got federal friends too that a problem he turned away not as long as you dont make it one if you do the crabs gonna be feeding on you and your buddy louis fooled around with the car radio until he found a station that seemed to be playing backtoback dr john this is music right he said the music segued uneasily from makin whoopee to gris gris gumbo yaya and johns throaty rumble filled the car louis flicked the presets again until he found a country station playing three in a row from garth brooks this be the devils music mumbled louis he turned the radio off and tapped his fingers on the dash you know i said you dont have to hang around if you dont want to things could get difficult or woolrich and the feds could decide to make them difficult for you i knew that louis was what angel diplomatically referred to as semiretired money it appeared was no longer an issue the semi indicated that it might have been replaced by something else although i wasnt sure yet what that was he looked out the window not at me you know why were here not entirely i asked but i wasnt sure that youd come we came because we owe you because youd look out for us if we needed it and because someone has to look out for you after what happened to your woman and your little girl more than that angel thinks that youre a good man maybe i think so too and maybe i think that what you brought to an end with the modine bitch what youre trying to bring to an end here theyre things that should be brought to an end you understand me it was strange to hear him talk this way strange and affecting i think i understand i replied quietly thank you you are going to end this thing here he said i think so but were missing something a detail a pattern something i kept catching glimpses of it like a rat passing under streetlights i needed to find out more about edward byron i needed to talk to woolrich rachel met us in the main hall of the flaisance house i guessed that she had been watching for the car angel lounged beside her eating a lucky dog which looked like the business end of a baseball bat topped with onion chili and mustard the fbi came said rachel your friend woolrich was with them they had a warrant they took everything my notes the illustrations everything they could find she led the way to her room the walls had been stripped of their notes even the diagram i had drawn was gone they searched our room too remarked angel to louis and birds my head jerked up as i thought of the case of guns angel spotted the move we ditched them soon as your fbi friend put the stare on louis theyre in a storage depot on bayonne we both have keys i noticed that rachel seemed more irritated than upset as we followed her to her room am i missing something here she smiled i said they took everything they could find angel saw them coming i hid some of the notes in the waistband of my jeans under my shirt angel took care of most of the rest she took a small pile of papers from under her bed and waved them with a small flourish she kept one separate in her hand it was folded over once i think you might want to see this she said handing the paper to me i unfolded it and felt a pain in my chest it was an illustration of a woman seated naked on a chair she had been split from neck to groin and the skin on each side had been pulled back so that it hung over her arms like the folds of a gown across her lap lay a young man similarly opened but with a space where his stomach and other internal organs had been removed apart from the detail of the anatomization and the alteration in the sex of one of the victims it resembled in its essence what had been done to jennifer and susan its estiennes pietà said rachel its very obscure which is why it took so long to track down even in its day it was regarded as excessively explicit and more to the point blasphemous it bore too much of a resemblance to the figure of the dead christ and mary for the liking of the church authorities estienne nearly burned for it she took the illustration from me and looked at it sadly then placed it on her bed with the other papers i know what hes doing she said hes creating memento mori deathsheads she sat on the edge of the bed and put her hands together beneath her chin as if in prayer hes giving us lessons in mortality iv he had a mind to be acquainted with your inside crispin edward ravenscroft the anatomist in the medical school of the complutense university of madrid there is an anatomical museum founded by king carlos iii much of its collection derives from the efforts of dr julián de velasco in the early to midnineteenth century dr velasco was a man who took his work seriously he was reputed to have mummified the corpse of his own daughter just as william harvey was assisted in his discovery of circulation by his decision to autopsy the bodies of his own father and sister the long rectangular hall is arrayed with glass cases of exhibits two giant skeletons the wax model of a fetal head and at one point two figures labeled despellejados they are the flayed men who stand in dramatic poses displaying the movement of the muscles and the tendons without the white veil of the skin to hide it from the eye of the beholder vesalius valverde estienne their forebears their peers their successors worked in the knowledge of this tradition artists such as michelangelo and leonardo da vinci created their own écorchés as they termed their drawings of flayed figures basing their work on their own participation in dissections and the figures they created were more than merely anatomical specimens they served in their way as reminders of the flawed nature of our humanity a reminder of the bodys capacity for pain and eventually mortality they warned of the futility of the pursuits of the flesh the reality of disease and pain and death in this life and the promise of something better in the next in eighteenthcentury florence the practice of anatomical modeling reached its peak under the patronage of the abbot felice fontana anatomists and artists worked side by side to create natural sculptures from beeswax anatomists exposed the cadavers the artists poured the liquid plaster and molds were created layers of wax were placed into them with pig fat used to alter the temperature of the wax where necessary allowing a process of layering that reproduced the transparency of human tissue then with threads and brushes and fine point the lineaments and striations of the body were reproduced eyebrows and eyelashes were added one by one in the case of the bolognese artist lelli real skeletons were used as a frame for his wax creations the emperor of austria joseph ii was so impressed by the collection that he ordered models to promote medical teaching in his own country by contrast frederik ruysch professor of anatomy at the atheneum illustre in amsterdam used chemical fixatives and dyes to preserve his specimens his house contained an exhibition of the skeletons of infants and children in various poses reminders of the transience of life yet nothing could compare to the reality of the actual human body exposed to view public demonstrations of anatomization and dissection attracted huge crowds some of them in carnival disguise ostensibly they were there to learn in reality the dissection was little more than an extension of the public execution in england the murder act of provided a direct link between the two events by permitting the bodies of murderers to be anatomically dissected and postmortem penal dissection became a form of further punishment for the criminal who would now be denied a proper burial in the anatomy act extended the deprivation of the poor into the next life by allowing the confiscation of the bodies of dead paupers for dissection so death and dissection walked hand in hand with the extension of scientific knowledge but what of pain what of the renaissance disgust with the workings of the female body which led to a particularly morbid fascination with the uterus in the acts of flaying and anatomization the realities of suffering sex and death were not far away the interior of the body when revealed speaks to us of mortality but how many of us can ever bear witness to our own interiors we see our own mortality only through the prism of the mortality of others even then it is only in exceptional circumstances in cases of war or violent accidental death or murder when the viewer is a witness to the act itself or its immediate consequences that mortality in all its deep red reality is made clear to us in his violent painfilled way rachel believed the traveling man was trying to break down these barriers in killing his victims in this way he was making them aware of their own mortality exposing to them their own interiors introducing them to the meaning of true pain but they also served as a reminder to others of their own mortality and the final dreadful pain that would someday find them the traveling man crisscrossed the boundaries between torture and execution between intellectual and physical curiosity and sadism he was part of the secret history of mankind the history recorded in the thirteenthcentury anatomia magistri nicolai physici which observed that the ancients practiced dissection upon both the living and the dead binding condemned criminals hand and foot and gradually dissecting them beginning with their legs and arms and moving on to their internal organs celsus and augustine made similar allegations about live dissections still contested by medical historians and now the traveling man had come to write his own history to offer his own blending of science and art to make his own notes on mortality and to create a hell within the human heart all this rachel explained as we sat in her room outside it had grown dark and the strains of music floated on the air i think the blinding may be related to ignorance a physical representation of a failure to understand the reality of pain and death she said but it indicates just how far the killer himself is removed from ordinary humanity we all suffer we all experience death in various ways before we die ourselves he believes that only he can teach us this that or he believes weve lost sight of it and need to be reminded that its his role to tell us just how inconsequential we are i added rachel nodded her assent if what you say is true then why was lutice fontenot dumped in a barrel it was angel he sat by the balcony staring out on to the street below prentice work said rachel louis cocked an eyebrow but stayed silent this traveling man believes hes creating works of art the care he takes in displaying the bodies their relation to old medical texts the links with mythology and artistic representations of the body all point in that direction but even artists have to start somewhere poets painters sculptors all serve an apprenticeship of sorts formal or otherwise the work they create during their apprenticeships may go on to influence their later work but its usually not for public display its a chance to make mistakes without criticism to see what you can and cannot achieve maybe thats what lutice fontenot was to him prentice work but she died after susan and jennifer i added softly he took susan and jennifer because he wanted to but the results were unsatisfactory i think he used lutice to practice again before he returned to the public arena she answered not looking at me he took tante marie and her son for a combination of reasons out of both desire and necessity and this time he had the time he needed to achieve the effect for which he was searching he then had to kill remarr either because of what he actually saw or the mere possibility that he might have seen something but again he created a memento mori out of him hes practical in his way hes not afraid to make a virtue out of necessity angel looked unhappy with the thrust of rachels words but what about the way most of us react to death he began it makes us want to live it even makes us want to screw rachel glanced at me then returned to her notes i mean continued angel what does this guy want us to do stop eating stop loving because hes got a thing about death and he thinks the next world is going to be something better i picked up the illustration of the pietà again and examined the detail of the bodies the carefully labeled interiors and the placid expressions on the faces of the woman and the man the faces of the traveling mans victims had looked nothing like this they were contorted in their final agonies he doesnt give a damn about the next world i said hes only concerned with the damage he can do in this one i stood and joined angel at the window beneath us the dogs scampered and sniffed in the courtyard i could smell cooking and beer and imagined that beneath it all i could smell the mass of humanity itself passing us by why hasnt he come after us or you it was angel his words were directed at me but it was rachel who answered because he wants us to understand she said everything hes done is an attempt to lead us to something all of this is an effort to communicate and were the audience he doesnt want to kill us yet said louis softly rachel nodded once her eyes locked on mine yet she agreed quietly i arranged to meet rachel and the others later in vaughan s back in my room i called woolrich and left a message on his machine he returned the call within five minutes and told me hed meet me at the napoleon house within the hour he was as good as his word shortly before ten he appeared dressed in offwhite chinos and carrying a matching jacket over his arm which he put on as soon as he entered the bar is it chilly in here or is it just the reception there was sleep caked at the corners of his eyes and he smelled sour and unwashed he was no longer the assured figure i recalled from jenny orbachs apartment wresting control of the room from a group of vaguely hostile cops instead he looked older more uncertain taking rachels papers in the way he did was out of character for him the old woolrich would have taken them anyway but he would have asked for them first he ordered an abita for himself and another mineral water for me you want to tell me why you seized materials from the hotel dont look on it as a seizure bird consider it as borrowing he sipped at his beer and looked at himself in the mirror he didnt seem to like what he saw you could just have asked i said would you have given it to me no but id have discussed what was there i dont think that durand would have been too impressed with that frankly i wouldnt have been too impressed either durand called it why you have your own profilers your own agents on it why were you so sure that we could add something he spun around on his stool and leaned close to me close enough that i could smell his breath bird i know you want this guy i know you want him for what he did to susan and jennifer to the old woman and her son to florence to lutice fontenot maybe even to that fuck remarr ive tried to keep you in touch with whats been going down and youve walked all over this case like a fucking child in new boots youve got an assassin staying in the room next door god alone knows what his pal does and your lady friend is collecting graphic medical imagery like box tops you aint given me shit so i did what i had to do you think im holding back on you with the shit youre pulling youre lucky i dont put you back on a plane to noo yawk i need to know what you know i said what are you holding back about this guy we were almost head to head now then woolrich grimaced and leaned back holding back jesus bird youre unbelievable heres something byrons wife you want to know what she majored in when she was at college art her thesis was on renaissance art and depictions of the body you think that might have included medical representations that maybe that was where her ex got some of his ideas he took a deep breath and a long swig of beer youre bait bird you know it and i know it and i know something else too his voice was cold and hard i know you were at metairie theres a guy in the morgue with a bullet hole in his head and the cops have the remains of a ten millimeter smith amp wesson bullet that was dug out of the marble behind him you want to tell me about that bird you want to tell me if you were alone in metairie when the killing started i didnt reply then you screwing her bird i looked at him there was no mirth in his eyes and he wasnt smiling instead there was hostility and distrust whatever i needed to know about edward byron and his exwife i would have to find out myself if i had hit him then we would have hurt each other badly i didnt waste any more words on him and i didnt look back as i left the bar i took a cab to bywater and stopped off right outside vaughan s lounge on the corner of dauphine and lesseps i paid the fivedollar cover at the door inside kermit ruffins and the barbecue swingers were lost in a rhapsody of new orleans brass and there were plates of red beans scattered on the tables rachel and angel were dancing around chairs and tables while louis looked on with a longsuffering expression as i approached the tempo of the music slowed a little and rachel made a grab for me i moved with her for a while as she stroked my face and i closed my eyes and let her then i sipped a soda and thought my own thoughts until louis moved from his seat and sat beside me you didnt have much to say back in rachels room i said he nodded its bullshit all this stuff the religion the medical drawings theyre all just trappings and maybe he believes them and maybe he dont sometimes its nothing to do with mortality its to do with the beauty of the color of meat he took a sip of beer and this guy just likes red back at the flaisance i lay beside rachel and listened to her breathing in the dark ive been thinking she said about our killer and i think the killer may not be male i raised myself up on my elbows and looked at her i could see the whites of her eyes wide and bright why im not sure exactly there just seems to be something almost feminine about the sensibility of whoever is committing these crimes a sensitivity to the interconnectedness of things to their potential for symbolism i dont know i guess im thinking out loud but its not a sensibility typical of a modern male maybe female is wrongi mean the hallmarks the cruelty the capacity to overpower all point to a malebut its as close as i can get at least for now she shook her head and then was silent again are we becoming a couple she asked at last i dont know are we youre avoiding the question no not really its not one that im used to answering or that i ever thought that id have to answer again if youre asking if i want us to stay together then the answer is yes i do it worries me a little and im bringing in more baggage than the handlers at jfk but i want to be with you she kissed me softly why did you stop drinking she asked adding since were having this hearttoheart i started at the question because if i took one drink now id wake up in singapore with a beard a week later i replied it doesnt answer the question i hated myself and that made me hate others even the people closest to me i was drinking the night susan and jennifer were killed id been drinking a lot not just that night but other nights too i drank because of a lot of things because of the pressure of the job because of my failings as a husband as a father and maybe other things as well things from way back if i hadnt been a drunk susan and jennifer might not have died so i stopped too late but i stopped she didnt say anything else she didnt say it wasnt your fault or you cant blame yourself she knew better than that i think i wanted to say more to try to explain to her what it was like without alcohol about how i was afraid that without alcohol each day would now leave me with nothing to look forward to each day would simply be another day without a drink sometimes when i was at my lowest ebb i wondered if my search for the traveling man was just a way to fill my days a way to keep me from going off the rails later as she slept i lay on the bed on top of the sheets and thought about lutice fontenot and bodies turned into art before i too faded into sleep i slept badly that night wound up by my conversation with woolrich and troubled by dreams of dark water the next morning i had breakfast alone after tracking down what seemed to be the only copy of the new york times in orleans parish over at riverside news by the jax brewery later i met rachel at café du monde and we walked through the french market wandering between the stalls of tshirts and cds and cheap wallets and on to the fresh produce at the farmers market there were pecans like dark eyes pale shrunken heads of garlic melons with dark red flesh that held the gaze like a wound whiteeyed fish lay packed in ice beside crawfish tails headless shrimp rested by racks of gator on a stick and murky tanks in which baby alligators lay on display there were stalls loaded with eggplants and militones sweet onions and elephant toe garlic fresh roma tomatoes and ripe avocadoes over a century before this had been a twoblock stretch of gallatin street on the riverfront docks between barracks and ursuline outside of maybe shanghai and the bowery it was one of the toughest places in the world a strip of brothels and lowlife gin mills where hardfaced men mixed with harder women and anyone without a weapon had taken a wrong turning somewhere that he was bound to regret gallatin is gone now erased from the map and instead tourists mix with cajun fishermen from lafayette and beyond come to sell their wares surrounded by the thick heady smell of the mississippi the city was like that it seemed streets disappeared bars opened and a century later were gone buildings were torn down or burned to the ground and others rose to take their place there was change but the spirit of the city remained the same on this muggy summer morning it seemed to brood beneath the clouds feeling the people as a passing infection that it would cleanse from itself with rain the door of my room was slightly ajar when we returned through the courtyard i motioned rachel against the wall and drew my smith amp wesson keeping to the sides of the wooden stairway so that the steps wouldnt creak the noise of rickys steyr sending bullets raking past my ear had stayed with me joe bones says hello i figured that if joe bones tried to say hello again i could spare enough powder to blow him back to hell i listened at the door but no sounds came from inside if it had been the maid in my room shed have been whistling and bumping maybe listening to a blues station on her tinny portable radio if there was a maid in my room now she was either asleep or levitating i hit the door hard with my shoulder and entered fast my gun at arms length scanning the room with the sight it came to rest on the figure of leon sitting in a chair by the balcony flicking through a copy of gq that louis had passed on to me leon didnt look like the kind of guy who bought much on gqs recommendation unless the q had made a big play for the jcpenney contract leon glanced at me with even less interest than he gave to gq his damaged eye glistened beneath its fold of skin like a crab peering out of a shell when youre finished there are hairs in the shower and the closet door sticks i said room falls down around your ears i could give a fuck he replied that leon what a kidder he threw the magazine on the floor and looked past me to rachel who had followed me into the room his eyes didnt register any interest there either maybe leon was dead and no one had worked up the guts to tell him shes with me i said leon looked like he could have keeled over from apathy ten tonight at the ninesixtysix junction at starhill you et ton ami noir anyone else lionel cornhole you both with a shotgun he stood to leave as i moved aside to let him pass i made a pistol of my finger and thumb and fired it at him there was a flash of steel in each of his hands and two barbedged knives appeared inches from each of my eyes i could see the tops of the spring loaders in his sleeves that explained why leon didnt seem to feel the need to carry a gun impressive i said but its only funny until someone loses an eye leon s dead right eye seemed to gaze into my soul as if to rot it and turn it to dust then he left i couldnt hear his footsteps as he walked down the gallery a friend of yours asked rachel i walked out of the room and looked down at the already empty courtyard if he is im lonelier than i thought when louis and angel returned from a late breakfast i went to their door and knocked a couple of seconds went by before there was a response yeah shouted angel its bird you two decent jeez i hope not cmon in louis sat upright in bed reading the timespicayune angel sat beside him outside the sheets naked but for a towel across his lap the towel for my benefit im afraid you might become confused about your sexuality might take away what little i have very witty for a man screwing a psychologist why dont you just pay your eighty bucks an hour like everyone else louis gave us both bored looks over the top of his newspaper maybe leon and louis were related way back lionel fontenots boy just paid me a visit i said the beauty queen asked louis none other we on tonight at ten better get your stuff out of hock ill send my boy he kicked angel in the leg from beneath the sheets the ugly queen none other said louis angel continued to watch his game show its beneath my dignity to comment louis returned to his paper you got a lot of dignity for a guy with a towel on his dick its a big towel sniffed angel waste of a lot of good towel space you ask me i left them to it back in my room rachel was standing by the wall her arms folded and a fierce expression on her face what happens now she asked we go back to joe bones i said and lionel fontenot kills him she spat hes no better than joe bones youre only siding with him out of expediency what will happen when fontenot kills him will things be any better i didnt answer i knew what would happen there would be a brief disturbance in the drug trade as fontenot renegotiated existing deals or ended them entirely prices would go up and there would be some killing as those who felt strong enough to challenge him for joe boness turf made their play lionel fontenot would kill them of that i had no doubt rachel was right it was only expediency that made me side with lionel joe bones knew something about what had happened the night tante marie died something that could bring me a step closer to the man who had killed my wife and child if it took lionel fontenots guns to find out what that was then i would side with the fontenots and louis will stand beside you said rachel quietly my god what have you become later i drove to baton rouge rachel accompanying me at my insistence we were uneasy together and no words were exchanged rachel contented herself with looking out of the window her elbow resting against the door her right hand supporting her cheek the silence between us remained unbroken until we reached exit heading for lsu and the home of stacey byron then i spoke anxious that we should at least try to clear the air between us rachel ill do what i have to do to find whoever killed susan and jennifer i said i need this else im dead inside she did not reply immediately for a while i thought she was not going to reply at all youre already dying inside she said at last still staring out the window i could see her eyes reflected in the glass following the landscape the fact that youre prepared to do these things is an indication of that she looked at me for the first time im not your moral arbiter bird and im not the voice of your conscience but i am someone who cares about you and im not sure how to deal with these feelings right now part of me wants to walk away and never look back but another part of me wants needs to stay with you i want to stop this thing all of it i want it all to end for everybodys sake then she turned away again and left me to deal with what she had said stacey byron lived in a small white clapboard house with a red door and peeling paint close to a small mall with a big supermarket a photo shop and a twentyfourhour pizzeria this area by the lsu campus was populated mainly by students and some of the houses now had stores on their first floor selling used cds and books or long hippie dresses and overwide straw hats as we drove by stacey byrons house and pulled into a parking space in front of the photo shop i spotted a blue probe parked close by the two guys sitting in the front seats looked bored beyond belief the driver had a newspaper folded in four resting on the wheel and was sucking on a pencil as he tried to do the crossword his partner tapped a rhythm on the dashboard as he watched the front door of stacey byrons house feds asked rachel maybe could be locals this is donkey work we watched them for a while rachel turned on the radio and we listened to an aor station rush styx richard marx suddenly the middle of the road seemed to be running straight through the car musically speaking are you going in asked rachel may not have to i replied nodding at the house stacey byron her blond hair tied back in a ponytail and her body encased in a short white cotton dress emerged from the house and walked straight toward us a straw shopping basket over her left arm she nodded at the two guys in the car they tossed a coin and the one in the passenger seat a mediumsized man with a small belly protruding through his jacket got out of the car stretched his legs and followed her toward the mall she was a goodlooking woman although the short dress was a little too tight at the thighs and dug slightly into the fat below her buttocks her arms were strong and lean her skin tanned there was a grace to her as she walked when an elderly man almost collided with her as she entered the supermarket she spun lightly on her right foot to avoid him i felt something soft on my cheek and turned to find rachel blowing on it hey she said and for the first time since we left new orleans there was a tiny smile on her lips its rude to lech when youre with another woman its not leching i said as we climbed from the car its surveillance i wasnt sure why i had come here but woolrichs remarks about stacey byron and her interest in art made me want to see her for myself and i wanted rachel to see her as well i didnt know how we might get to talk to her but i figured that these things had a habit of working themselves out stacey took her time browsing in the aisles there was an aimlessness about her shopping as she picked up items glanced at the labels and then discarded them the cop followed about ten feet behind her then fifteen before his attention was distracted by some magazines he moved to the checkout and took up a position where he could see down two aisles at once limiting his care of stacey byron to the occasional glance in her direction i watched a young black man in a white coat and a white hat with a green band stacking prepackaged meat when he had emptied the tray and marked off its contents on a clipboard he left the shop floor through a door marked staff only i left rachel to watch byron and followed him i almost hit him with the door as i went through since he was squatting to pick up another plastic tray of meat he looked at me curiously hey man he said you cant come in here how much do you earn an hour i asked five twentyfive whats it to you ill give you fifty bucks if you lend me your coat and that clipboard for ten minutes he thought it over for a few seconds then said sixty and anyone asks ill say you stole it done i said and counted out three twenties as he took off the coat it fitted a bit tightly across the shoulders but no one would notice as long as i left it unbuttoned i was stepping back onto the shop floor when the young guy called me hey man nother twenty you can have the hat for twenty bucks i could go into the hat business myself i replied go hide in the mens room i found stacey byron by the toiletries rachel close by excuse me maam i said as i approached can i ask you some questions up close she looked older there was a network of broken veins beneath her cheekbones and a fine tracery of lines surrounded her eyes there were tight lines too around her mouth and her cheeks were sunken and stretched she looked tired and something else she looked threatened maybe even scared i dont think so she said with a false smile and started to step around me its about your exhusband she stopped then and turned back her eyes searching for her police escort who are you an investigator what do you know about renaissance art mrs byron what what do you mean you studied it in college didnt you does the name valverde mean anything to you did your husband ever use it did you i dont know what youre talking about please leave me alone she backed away knocking some cans of deodorant to the floor mrs byron have you ever heard of the traveling man something flashed in her eyes and behind me i heard a low whistle i turned to see the fat cop moving down the aisle in my direction he passed rachel without noticing her and she began moving toward the door and the safety of the car but by then i was already heading back to the staff area i dumped the coat and walked straight through and on to the back lot which was crowded with trucks making deliveries before slipping around the side of the mall where rachel already had the car started i stayed low as we drove off turning right instead of passing stacey byrons house again in the side mirror i could see the fat cop looking around and talking into his radio byron beside him and what did we achieve there asked rachel did you see her eyes when i mentioned the traveling man she knew the name she knows something agreed rachel but she could have heard it from the cops she looked scared bird maybe i said but scared of what that evening angel removed the door panels of the taurus and we strapped the calicos and the magazines into the space behind them then replaced the panels i cleaned and loaded my smith amp wesson in the hotel room while rachel watched i put the gun in my shoulder holster and wore a black alpha industries bomber jacket over my black tshirt and black jeans with my black timberlands i looked like the doorman at a nightclub joe bones is living on borrowed time i couldnt save him if i wanted to i told her he was dead from the moment the metairie hit went wrong rachel spoke ive decided im leaving in a day or two i dont think i can be part of this any longer the things youre doing the things ive done she wouldnt look at me and there was nothing that i could say she was right but she wasnt simply preaching i could see her own pain in her eyes i could feel it every time we made love louis was waiting by the car dressed in a black sweat top and black denim jacket over dark jeans and ecco boots angel checked the door panels one last time to make sure they slipped off without any trouble then stood beside louis you dont hear anything from us by three am you take rachel and clear out of the hotel book into the pontchartrain and get the first plane out in the morning i said i dont want joe bones trying to even up scores if this turns bad handle the cops whatever way you think is best he nodded exchanged a look with louis and went back into the flaisance louis put an isaac hayes tape into the stereo and we rolled out of new orleans to the strains of walk on by dramatic i said he nodded we the men leon lounged by a gnarled oak its trunk knotted and worn as we reached the starhill intersection louiss left hand was hanging loosely by his side the butt of the sig jutting from beneath the passenger seat i had slipped the smith amp wesson into the map compartment on the drivers door as we approached the meeting place seeing leon alone against the tree didnt make me feel any better we slowed and turned onto a small side road that ran past the oak tree leon didnt seem to register our presence i killed the engine and we sat in the car waiting for him to make a move louis had his hand on the sig now and drew it up so that it lay along his thigh we looked at each other i shrugged and got out of the car leaning against the open door with the smith amp wesson within reach louis climbed from the passenger side stretched slightly to show leon that his hands were empty and then rested against the side of the car the sig now on the seat beside him leon hauled himself from the tree and walked toward us other figures emerged from the trees around us five men h ampks hanging from their shoulders longbladed hunting knives at their belts surrounded the car up against the car said leon i didnt move from around us came the sound of safeties clicking dont move you die now he said i held his gaze then turned and put my hands on the roof of the car louis did the same as he stood behind me leon must have seen the sig on the passenger seat but he didnt seem concerned he patted my chest beneath my arms and checked my ankles and thighs when he was satisfied that i wasnt wearing a wire he did a similar check on louis then stepped back leave the car he instructed headlights shone as engines started up around us a brown dodge sedan and a green nissan patrol burst through from behind the treeline followed by a flatbed ford pickup with three pirogues lashed down on the bed if the fontenot compound was under surveillance then whoever was responsible needed his eyesight tested we got some stuff in the car i said to leon were gonna take it out he nodded and watched as i removed the minisubs from behind the door panels louis took two magazines and handed one to me the long cylinder stretched over the rear end of the receiver as i checked the safety at the front edge of the trigger guard louis placed a second magazine inside his jacket and tossed me a spare as we climbed into the back of the dodge two men drove our car out of sight and then jumped into the nissan leon sat in the passenger seat of the dodge beside the driver a man in his fifties with long gray hair tied back in a ponytail and indicated to him to move off the other vehicles followed at a distance so that we wouldnt look like a convoy to any passing cops we drove along the border of east and west feliciana thompson creek to our right until we came to a turnoff that led down to the riverbank two more cars an ancient plymouth and what looked like an even older volkswagen beetle were pulled up at the bank and two more pirogues lay beside them lionel fontenot dressed in blue jeans and a blue work shirt stood by the edsel he cast an eye over the calicos but didnt say anything there were fourteen of us in all most armed with h ampks two carrying m rifles and we split three to a pirogue with lionel and the driver of the dodge taking the lead in a smaller boat louis and i were separated and each handed a paddle then we moved off upriver we rowed for twenty minutes staying close to the western bank before a darker shape appeared against the night sky i could see lights flickering in windows and then through a stand of trees a small jetty against which a motorboat lay moored the grounds of joe boness house were dark there was a low whistle from in front of us and hands were raised in the pirogues to indicate that we should stop rowing sheltered by the trees which hung out over the water we waited in silence a light flashed on the jetty and briefly the face of a guard was illuminated as he lit a cigarette i heard a low splash somewhere in front of me and high on the bank an owl hooted i could see the guard moving against the moonhaunted water could hear the sound of his boots scuffing against the wooden jetty then a dark shape rose up beside him and the pattern of the moonlight on the water was disturbed a knife flashed and the red ember of the cigarette tumbled through the night air like a signal of distress as the guard crumpled to the ground he made hardly a sound as he was lowered into the water the ponytailed man stood waiting at the jetty as we paddled by moving as close as we could to the grass bank beyond before we climbed from the pirogues and dragged them onto dry land the bank rose up to join an expanse of green lawn undisturbed by flowers or trees it rolled uphill to the back of the house where steps led up to a patio overlooked by two french windows at ground level and a gallery on the second floor which mirrored the one on the front of the house i caught a movement on the gallery and heard voices from the patio three guards at least probably more at the front lionel raised two fingers and singled out two men to my left they moved forward cautiously keeping low against the ground as they moved toward the house they were about twenty yards in front of us when the house and grounds were suddenly illuminated with bright white light the two men were caught like rabbits in headlights as shouts came from the house and automatic fire burst from the gallery one of them spun like an ice skater who has missed his jump blood bursting forth from his shirt like red flowers opening he fell to the ground his legs twisting as his partner dived for the cover of a metal table part of a lawn set that stood semiobscured by the riverbank the french windows opened and dark figures spilled out onto the patio on the gallery the guard was joined by two or three others who raked the grass in front of us with heavy fire from the sides of the house muzzles flashed as more of joe boness men inched their way around close to where i lay lionel fontenot swore we were partly protected by the slope of the lawn as it curved down to meet the river but the guards on the gallery were angling for clear shots at us some of fontenots men returned fire but each time they did so they exposed themselves to the guards at the house one a sharpfaced man in his forties with a mouth like a paper cut grunted as a bullet hit him in the shoulder he kept firing even as the blood turned his shirt red its fifty yards from here to the house i said there are guards moving in from the sides to cut us off we dont move now were dead a spray of earth kicked up by fontenots left hand one of joe boness men had progressed almost to the bank by approaching from the front of the house two bursts of m fire came from behind the metal lawn table and he tumbled sideways rolling along the grass into the river tell your men to get ready i hissed well cover you the message was passed down the line louis i shouted you ready to try these things out a figure two men down from me responded with a wave and then the calicos burst into life one of the guards on the gallery bucked and danced as the millimeter bullets from louiss gun tore into him i pushed the selector on the trigger guard fully forward and sent a burst of automatic fire across the patio the french windows exploded in a shower of glass and a guard tumbled down the steps and lay unmoving on the lawn lionel fontenots men sprang from their cover and raced across the lawn firing as they did so i switched to single shot firing and concentrated on the eastern end of the house sending wood splinters shooting into the air as i forced the men there to take cover fontenots men were almost at the patio when two fell hit by fire from behind the ruined french windows louis sent a burst into the room beyond and fontenots men moved to the patio and entered the house exchanges of fire were coming from within as louis and i rose and ran across the lawn to my left the guy behind the lawn table abandoned his cover to join us as he did so something huge and dark appeared out of the shadows and launched itself from the grass with a deep ferocious growl the boerbul struck him on the chest knocking him to the ground with its enormous weight he shouted once his hands pounding at the creatures head and then the huge jaws closed on his neck and the boerbuls head shook as he tore the mans throat apart the animal lifted its head and its eyes gleamed in the darkness as it found louis he was turning the calico in its direction when it bounded from the dead body and sprang into the air its speed was astonishing as it moved toward us its dark form blotted out the stars in the sky above it was at the apex of its jump when louiss calico sang and bullets ripped into it causing it to spasm in midair and land with a crunch on the grass not two feet from us its paws scrambled for purchase and its mouth worked in biting motions even as blood and froth spilled from between its teeth louis pumped more rounds into it until it lay still my eye caught movement at the western corner of the house as we neared the steps a muzzle flashed and louis yelled in pain the calico dropped to the ground as he leaped for the steps cradling his injured hand i fired three shots and the guard dropped behind me one of fontenots men fired single shots from his m as he advanced toward the house then let the gun hang from its shoulder strap as he reached the corner i saw moonlight catch the blade of his knife as he stood waiting the short muzzle of a steyr appeared followed by the face of one of joe boness men i recognized him as the one who had driven the golf cart to the plantation gates on our first visit here but the flash of recognition became one with the flash of the knife as it struck across his neck a crimson jet flew into the air from his severed artery but even as he fell fontenots man raised the m once again and fired past him as he moved toward the front of the house louis was examining his right hand as i reached him the bullet had torn across the back of the hand leaving a bad gash and damaging the knuckle of his forefinger i tore a strip from the shirt of a dead guard who lay sprawled across the patio and wrapped it around louiss hand i handed him the calico and he worked the strap over his head then fitted his middle finger into the trigger guard with his left hand he freed his sig then nodded to me as he rose we better find joe bones through the patio doors lay a formal dining room the dining table which could seat at least eighteen people comfortably was splintered and pitted by shots on the wall a portrait of a southern gentleman standing by his horse had sustained a large hole through the horses belly and a selection of antique china plates lay shattered in the remains of their glassfronted display cabinet there were two bodies in the room one of them was the ponytailed man who had driven the dodge the dining room led out into a large carpeted hallway and a white chandeliered reception area from which a staircase wound up to the next floor the other doors at ground level stood open but there were no sounds coming from inside there was sustained firing on the upper levels as we made our way to the stairs at their base one of joe boness men lay in a pair of striped pajama bottoms blood pooling from an ugly head wound from the top of the stairs a series of doors stretched left and right fontenots men seemed to have cleared most of the rooms but they had been pinned down in the alcoves and doorways by gunfire from the rooms at the western end of the house one on the river side to the right its panels already pockmarked by bullets and the other facing out to the front of the house as we watched a man in blue overalls carrying a shorthandled axe in one hand and a captured steyr in the other moved quickly from his hiding place to within one doorway of the frontfacing room shots came through the door on the right and he fell to the ground clutching his leg i leaned into an alcove in which the remains of longstemmed roses lay in a pool of water and shattered pottery and fired a sustained burst at the door on the frontfacing side two of fontenots men moved forward at the same time keeping low on the ground as they did so across from me louis fired shots at the semiclosed riverside door i stopped firing as fontenots men reached the room and rushed the occupant there were two more shots then one of them emerged wiping his knife on his trousers it was lionel fontenot behind him was leon the two men took up positions at either side of the last room six more of his men moved forward to join him joe its over now said lionel we gon finish this thing two shots burst through the door leon raised his h ampk and appeared to be about to fire but lionel raised his hand looking past leon to where i stood i advanced forward and waited behind leons back as lionel pushed open the door with his foot then pressed himself flat against the wall as two more shots rang out followed by the click of a hammer on an empty chamber a sound as final as the closing of a tomb leon entered the room first the h ampk now replaced by his knives i followed him with lionel behind me the walls of joe boness bedroom were marked with holes and the night air entered through the shattered window and sent the white curtains swirling in the air like angry ghosts the blonde who had lunched with joe on his lawn earlier in the week lay dead against the far wall a red stain on the left breast of her silk nightgown joe bones stood before the window in a red silk dressing gown the colt in his hand hung uselessly at his side but his eyes glowed with anger and the scar on his lip seemed painfully pinched and white against his skin he dropped the gun do it you fuck he hissed at lionel kill me you got the fucking guts lionel closed the bedroom door behind us as joe bones turned to look at the woman ask him said lionel joe bones didnt seem to hear his face seemed consumed with a look of terrible grief as his eyes traced the contours of the dead womans face eight years he said softly eight years she was with me ask him repeated lionel fontenot i stepped forward and joe bones sneered as he turned that look of sadness now gone the fucking grieving widower you bring your trained nigger with you i slapped him hard and he took a step back i cant save you joe but if you help me maybe i can make it quicker for you tell me what remarr saw the night the aguillards died he wiped blood from the corner of his mouth smearing it across his cheek you have no idea what youre dealing with no fucking idea in the world youre so out of your fucking depth the fucking pressure should be making your nose bleed he kills women and children joe hes going to kill again joe bones twisted his mouth into the semblance of a grin the scar distorting his full lips like a crack in a mirror you killed my woman and now youre gonna kill me no matter what i say you got nothing to bargain with he said i glanced at lionel fontenot he shook his head almost imperceptibly but joe bones caught it see nothing all you can offer is a little less pain and pain dont hold no surprises for me he killed one of your own men he killed tony remarr tony left a print at the niggers house he was careless and he paid the price your guy he saved me the trouble of killing the old bitch and her brood myself i meet him ill shake his hand joe bones smiled a broad smile like a flash of sunshine through dark acrid smoke haunted by visions of tainted blood flowing through his veins he had moved beyond ordinary notions of humanity and empathy love and grief in his shimmering red robe he looked like a wound in the fabric of space and time youll meet him in hell i said i see your bitch there ill fuck her for you his eyes were bland and cold now the smell of death hung around him like old cigar fumes behind me lionel fontenot opened the door and the rest of his men walked quietly into the room it was only now seeing them all together in the ruined bedroom that the resemblance between them became clear lionel held the door open for me its a family thing he said as i left behind me the door closed with a soft click like the knocking of bones after joe bones died we gathered the bodies of the fontenot dead on the lawn in front of the house the five men lay side by side crumpled and torn as only the dead can be the gates to the plantation were opened and the dodge the vw and the pickup sped in the bodies were loaded gently but quickly into the trunks of the cars the injured helped into the rear seats the pirogues were doused in gasoline set on fire and left to float down the river we drove from the plantation and kept driving until we reached the rendezvous point at starhill the three black explorers i had seen at the delacroix compound stood waiting their motors idling their lights dimmed as leon sprayed gasoline into the cars and the pickup the bodies of the dead were removed wrapped in tarps and placed in the backs of two of the jeeps louis and i watched it all in silence as the jeeps roared into life and leon threw lighted rags into the discarded vehicles lionel fontenot walked over to us and stood with us as they burned he took a small green notebook from his pocket scribbled a number on a sheet and tore it out this guy will look after your friends hand hes discreet he knew who killed lutice lionel i said he nodded maybe he wouldnt tell not even at the end he rubbed his index finger along a raw cut on the palm of his right hand picking dirt from the wound i hear the feds are looking for someone around baton rouge used to work in a hospital in new york i stayed silent and he smiled we know his name man could hide out in the bayou for a long time he knew his way around feds might not find him but we will he gestured with his hand like a king displaying his finest troops to his worried subjects were looking we find him itll end there then he turned and climbed into the drivers seat of the lead jeep leon beside him and they disappeared into the night the red taillights like falling cigarettes in the darkness like burning boats floating on black water i called angel as we drove back to new orleans at an allnight drugstore i picked up antiseptic and a firstaid kit so we could work on louiss hand there was a sheen of sweat on his face as i drove and the white rags binding his fingers were stained a deep red when we arrived back at the flaisance angel cleansed the wound with the antiseptic and tried to stitch it with some surgical thread the knuckle looked bad and louiss mouth was stretched tight with pain despite his protests i called the number we had been given the bleary voice that answered the phone on the fourth ring shook the sleep from its tones when i mentioned lionels name angel drove louis to the doctors office when they had gone i stood outside rachels door and debated whether or not to knock i knew she wasnt asleep angel had spoken to her after i called and i could sense her wakefulness still i didnt knock but as i walked back toward my own room her door opened she stood in the gap a white tshirt reaching almost to her knees and waited for me she stood carefully aside to let me enter youre still in one piece i see she said she didnt sound particularly pleased i felt tired and sick from the sight of blood i wanted to plunge my face into a sink of icecold water i wanted a drink so badly my tongue felt swollen inside my mouth and only a bottle of abita ice frosting on its rim and a shot of redbreast whiskey could restore it to its normal size my voice sounded like the croak of an old man on his deathbed when i spoke im in one piece i said a lot of others arent louis took a bullet across the hand and too many people died out at the house joe bones most of his crew his woman rachel turned her back and walked to the balcony window only the bedside lamp lit the room casting shadows over the illustrations that she had kept from woolrich and that were now restored to their places on the walls flayed arms and the face of a woman and a young man emerged from the semidarkness what did you find out for all that killing it was a good question as usual with good questions the answer didnt live up to it nothing except that joe bones was happier to die painfully than to tell us what he knew she turned then what are you going to do now i was getting tired of questions especially questions as difficult as these i knew she was right and i felt disgusted at myself it felt as if rachel had become tainted through her contact with me maybe i should have told her all of those things then but i was too tired and too sick and i could smell blood in my nostrils and anyway i think she already knew most of it im going to bed i said after that im winging it then i left her the next morning i awoke with an ache in my arms from toting the calico exacerbated by the lingering pain of the gunshot wound inflicted in haven i could smell powder on my fingers in my hair and on my discarded clothes the room stank like the scene of a gunfight so i opened the window and let the hot new orleans air slip heavily into the room like a clumsy burglar i checked on louis and angel louiss hand had been expertly bound after the doctor picked the shards of bone from the wound and padded the knuckle louis barely opened his eyes as i exchanged a few quiet words with angel at the door i felt guilty for what had happened although i knew that neither of them blamed me i sensed too that angel was anxious now to return to new york joe bones was dead and the police and the feds were probably closing in on edward byron despite lionel fontenots doubts besides i didnt believe that it would take long for woolrich to connect us to what had happened to joe bones especially if louis was walking around with a bullet crease on his hand i told angel all of this and he agreed that they would leave as soon as i returned so that rachel would not be left alone the whole case seemed to have ground to a kind of halt for me elsewhere the feds and the fontenots were hunting edward byron a man who still seemed as distant from me as the last emperor of china i left a message for morphy i wanted to see what his people had on byron i wanted to add flesh to the figure as things stood he was as shorn of identity as the faceless figures of the slain that the feds believed he had left behind the feds might well have been right with the local police they could conduct a better search than a bunch of visitors from new york with delusions of adequacy i had hoped to work my way toward him from a different direction but with the death of joe bones that path seemed to have come to an end in a tangle of dark undergrowth i took my phone and my book of raleghs writings and headed for mothers on poydras street where i drank too many cups of coffee and picked at some bacon and brown toast when you reach one of lifes dead ends ralegh is good company go soulsince i needs must die and give the world the lie ralegh knew enough to take a stoical attitude to adversity although he didnt know enough to avoid getting his head cut off beside me a man ate ham and eggs with the concentrated effort of a bad lover yellow egg yolk tingeing his chin like sunlight reflected from a buttercup someone whistled a snatch of whats new then lost his thread in the complicated chord changes of the song the air was filled with the buzz of late morning conversation a radio station easing into neutral with a bland rock song and the low aggravated hum of distant slowmoving traffic outside it was another humid new orleans day the kind of day that leads lovers to fight and makes children sullen and grim an hour passed i rang the detective squad in st martin and was told that morphy had taken a days leave to work on his house i had nothing better to do now so i paid my bill put some gas in the car and started out once again toward baton rouge i found a lafayette station playing some scratchy cheese read followed by buckwheat zydeco and clifton chenier an hour of classic cajun and zydeco as the dj put it i let it play until the city fell away and the sound and the landscape became one a sheet of plastic slapped dryly in the early afternoon wind as i pulled up outside morphys place he was replacing part of the exterior wall on the west side of the house and the lines holding the plastic in place over the exposed joints sang as the wind tried to yank them from their moorings it tugged at one of the windows which had not been fastened properly and made the screen door knock at its frame like a tired visitor i called his name but there was no reply i walked to the rear of the house where the back door stood open held in place by a piece of brick i called again but my voice seemed to echo emptily through the central hallway the rooms on the ground level were all unoccupied and no sounds came from upstairs i drew my gun and climbed the stairs newly planed in preparation for treating the bedrooms were empty and the bathroom door stood wide open toiletries neatly arranged by the sink i checked the gallery and then went back downstairs as i turned back toward the rear door cold metal touched the base of my neck drop it said a voice i let the gun slip from my fingers turn around slowly the pressure was removed from my neck and i turned to find morphy standing before me a nail gun held inches from my face he let out a deep breath of relief and lowered the gun shit you scared the hell out of me he said i could feel my heart thumping wildly in my chest thanks i said i really needed that kind of adrenaline rush on top of five cups of coffee i sat down heavily on the bottom step you look terrible mon you up late last night i looked up to see if there was an edge to what he had said but he had turned his back kind of you hear the news joe bones and his crew were taken out last night someone cut joe up pretty bad before he died too police werent even sure it was him until they checked the prints he walked down to the kitchen and came back with a beer for himself and a soda for me i noticed it was caffeinefree cola under his arm he held a copy of the timespicayune you see this today i took the paper from him it was folded into quarter size the bottom of the front page facing up the headline read police hunt serial killer in ritual murders the story below contained details of the deaths of tante marie aguillard and tee jean that could only have come from the investigation team itself the display of the bodies the manner of their discovery the nature of some of the wounds it went on to speculate on a possible link between the discovery of lutice fontenots body and the death of a man in bucktown known to have links with a leading crime figure worst of all it said that police were also investigating a connection to a similar pair of murders in new york earlier this year susan and jennifer were not named but it was clear that the writeranonymous beneath a timespicayune journalists bylineknew enough about the murders to be able to put a name on the victims i put the paper down wearily did the leak come from your guys i asked could have done but i dont think so the feds are blaming us theyre all over us accusing us of sabotaging the investigation he sipped his beer before saying what was on his mind one or two people maybe felt that it could have been you who leaked the stuff he was obviously uncomfortable saying it but he didnt look away i didnt do it if theyve got as far as jennifer and susan it wont be too long before they connect me to whats happening the last thing i need is the press crawling all over me he considered what i said then nodded i guess youre right you speak to the editor he was contacted at home when the first edition came out we got freedom of the press and the protection of sources coming out our ass we cant force him to tell but he rubbed at the tendons on the back of his neckits unusual for something like this to happen the papers are real careful about jeopardizing investigations i think it had to come from someone close to all this i thought about it if they felt okay about using this stuff then it must be cast iron and the source impeccable i said it could be that the feds are playing their own game on this it seemed to reaffirm our belief that woolrich and his team were holding back not only from me but probably from the police investigating team as well it wouldnt be anything new said morphy feds wouldnt tell us what day it is they thought they could get away with it you think they might have planted the story somebody did morphy finished his beer and crushed the can beneath his foot a small stain of beer spread itself on the bare wood he picked up a tool belt from where it hung on a hat stand near the door and strapped it on you need any help he looked at me can you carry planks without falling over no then youre perfect for the job theres a spare pair of work gloves in the kitchen for the rest of the afternoon i worked with my hands hoisting and carrying hammering and sawing we replaced most of the wood on the west side a gentle breeze spraying sawdust and shavings around us as we worked later angie returned from a shopping trip to baton rouge carrying groceries and boutique bags while morphy and i cleaned up she grilled steaks with sweet potatoes carrots and creole rice and we ate them in the kitchen as the evening drew in and the wind wrapped the house in its arms morphy walked me out to my car as i put the key in the ignition he leaned in the window and said softly someone tried to get to stacey byron yesterday know anything about it maybe you were there werent you you were there when they took joe bones you dont want to know the answer to that i replied just like i dont want to know about luther bordelon as i drove away i could see him standing before his uncompleted house then he turned away and returned to his wife when i arrived back at the flaisance angel and louis were packed and ready to go they wished me luck and told me that rachel had gone to bed early she had booked a flight for the next day i decided not to disturb her and went to my own room i dont even remember falling asleep the luminous dial on my watch read am when the pounding came at my door i had been in deep sleep and i pulled myself slowly into wakefulness like a diver struggling for the surface i had got as far as the edge of the bed when the door exploded inward and there were lights shining in my face and strong arms hauled me to my feet and pushed me hard against the wall a gun was held to my head as the main light came on in the room i could see nopd uniforms a couple of plainclothesmen and directly to my right morphys partner toussaint around me men were tearing the room apart and i knew then that something had gone terribly terribly wrong they allowed me to pull on a tracksuit and a pair of sneakers before cuffing me i was marched through the hotel past guests peering anxiously from their rooms to a waiting police car in a second car her face pale and her hair matted from sleep sat rachel i shrugged helplessly at her before we were driven in convoy from the quarter i was questioned for three hours then given a cup of coffee and grilled again for another hour the room was small and brightly lit it smelled of cigarette smoke and stale sweat in one corner where the plaster was broken and worn i could see what looked like a bloodstain two detectives dale and klein did most of the questioning dale assuming the role of aggressive interrogator threatening to dump me in the swamp with a bullet in the head for killing a louisiana cop klein taking the part of the reasonable sensitive man trying to protect me while ensuring that the truth was told even with other cops as the object of their attentions the good copbad cop thing never went out of fashion i told them all i could again and again and again i told them of my visit to morphy the work on the house the dinner the departure all of the reasons why my prints were all over the house no morphy hadnt given me the police files found in my room no i couldnt say who did no only the night porter saw me reenter the hotel i didnt speak to anyone else no i didnt leave my room again that night no there was no one to confirm that fact no no no no no then woolrich arrived and the merrygoround started all over again more questions this time with the feds in attendance and still no one told me why i was there or what had happened to morphy and his wife in the end klein returned and told me i could go behind a slattedrail divider which separated the detective squadroom from the main corridor rachel sat with a mug of tea while the detectives around her studiously ignored her in a cage ten feet behind her a skinny white man with tattooed arms whispered obscenely to her toussaint appeared he was an overweight balding man in his early fifties with straggly white curls around his pate like the top of a hill erupting from out of a mist he looked red eyed and nauseous and was as out of place here as i was a patrolman motioned to rachel well take you back to your hotel now maam she stood behind her the guy in the cage made sucking noises and grabbed his crotch in his hand you okay i asked as she passed by she nodded dumbly then are you coming with me toussaint was at my left hand hell follow later he said rachel looked over her shoulder at me as the patrolman led her away i gave her a smile and tried to make it look reassuring but my heart wasnt in it come on ill drive you back and buy you a coffee on the way said toussaint and i followed him from the building we ended up in mothers where less than twentyfour hours before i had sat waiting for morphys call and where toussaint would tell me how john charles morphy and his wife angela had died morphy had been due to work a special early duty that morning and toussaint had dropped by to pick him up they alternated pickup duties as it suited that day it happened to be toussaints turn the screen door was closed but the front door behind stood open toussaint called morphys name just as i had the afternoon before he followed in my footsteps through the central hallway checking the kitchen and the rooms to the right and left he thought morphy might have slept in although he had never been late before so he called up the stairs to the bedroom there was no reply he recalled that his stomach was already tightening as he worked his way up the stairs calling morphys name then angies as he advanced the door of their bedroom was partially open but the angle obscured their bed he knocked once then slowly opened the door for a moment the merest flashing splinter of a second he thought he had disturbed their lovemaking until the blood registered and he knew that this was a parody of all that love stood for of all that it meant and he wept then for his friend and his wife even now i seem to recall only snatches of what he said but i can picture the bodies in my head they were naked facing each other on what had once been white sheets their bodies locked together at the hips their legs intertwined from the waist they leaned backward at arms length from each other both had been cut from neck to stomach their rib cages had been split and pulled back and each had a hand buried in the breast of the other as he neared toussaint saw that each was holding the others heart in the palm of a hand their heads hung back so that their hair almost touched their backs their eyes were gone their faces removed their mouths open in their final agony their moment of death like an ecstasy in them love was reduced to an example to other lovers of the futility of love itself as toussaint spoke a wave of guilt swept over me and broke across my heart i had brought this thing to their house by helping me morphy and his wife had been marked for a terrible death just as the aguillards too seemed to have been tainted by their contact with me i stank of mortality and in the midst of it all some lines of verse seemed to float into my head and i could not recall how i had resurrected them or who had given them to me in the first place and it seemed to me that their source was important although i could not tell why except that in the lines there seemed to be echoes of what toussaint had seen but as i tried to remember a voice speaking them to me it slipped away and try as i might i could not bring it back only the lines remained some metaphysical poet i thought donne perhaps yes almost certainly donne if thunborne must learne by my being cut up and torne kill and dissect me love for this torture against thine owne end is rackt carcasses make ill anatomies remedium amoris wasnt that the term the torture and death of lovers as a remedy for love he helped me i said i involved him in this he involved himself toussaint said he wanted to do it he wanted to bring this guy to an end i held his gaze for luther bordelon toussaint looked away what does it matter now but i couldnt explain that in morphy i saw something of myself that i had felt for his pain that i wanted to believe he was better than me i wanted to know garza called the bordelon thing said toussaint at last garza killed him and then morphy supplied the throwdown thats what he said morphy was young garza shouldnt have put him in that situation but he did and morphys been paying for it ever since and then he caught himself using the present tense and went silent outside people were living another day working touring eating flirting still continued despite all that had taken place all that was happening it seemed somehow that it should all have come to a halt that the clocks should have been stopped and the mirrors covered the doorbells silenced and the voices reduced to a respectful hushed volume maybe if they had seen the pictures of susan and jennifer of tante marie and tee jean of morphy and angie then they would have stopped and considered and that was what the traveling man wanted to provide in the deaths of others a reminder of the deaths of us all and the worthlessness of love and loyalty of parenthood and friendship of sex and need and joy in the face of the emptiness to come as i stood to leave something else came to me something awful that i had almost forgotten and i felt a deep violent ache in my gut which spread through my body until i was forced to lean against the wall my hand scrabbling for purchase ah god she was pregnant i looked at toussaint and his eyes briefly fluttered closed he knew didnt he toussaint said nothing but there was despair in his eyes i didnt ask what the traveling man had done to the unborn child but in that instant i saw a terrible progression over the last months of my life it seemed that i had moved from the death of my own child my jennifer to the deaths of many children the victims of adelaide modine and her partner hyams and now finally to the deaths of all children everything this traveling man did signified something beyond itself in the death of morphys unborn child i saw all hope for the future reduced to tattered flesh im supposed to bring you back to your hotel said toussaint at last the new orleans pd will make sure you get on the evening flight back to new york but i hardly heard him all i could think was that the traveling man had been watching us all along and that his game was still going on around us we were all participants whether we wanted to be or not and i recalled something that a con man named saul mann had once told me back in portland something that seemed important to me yet i couldnt recall why you cant bluff someone who isnt paying attention toussaint dropped me at the flaisance rachels door was half open when i reached the carriage house i knocked gently and entered her clothes had been thrown across the bedroom floor and the sheets from her bed were tossed in an untidy pile in the corner all of her papers were gone her suitcase sat open on the bare mattress i heard movement from the bathroom and she emerged carrying her cosmetics case it was stained with powder and foundation and i guessed that the cops had broken some of its contents during their search she was wearing a faded blue knicks sweat top which hung down over her dark blue denims she had washed and showered and her damp hair clung to her face her feet were bare i had not noticed before how small they were im sorry i said i know she didnt look at me instead she started to pick up her clothes and fold them as neatly as she could into her suitcase i bent down to pick up a pair of socks which lay in a ball by my feet leave it she said i can do it there was another knock at the door and a patrolman appeared he was polite but he made it clear that we were to stay in the hotel until someone arrived to take us to the airport i went back to my room and showered a maid came and made up the room and i sat on my clean sheets and listened to the sounds from the street i thought about how badly i had screwed up and how many people had been killed because of it i felt like the angel of death if i stood on a lawn the grass would die i must have dozed for a while because the light in the room had changed when i awoke it seemed that it was dusk yet that could not have been the case there was a smell in the room an odor of rotting vegetation and water filled with algae and dead fish when i tried to take a breath the air felt warm and humid in my mouth i was conscious of movement around me shapes shifting in the shadows at the corners of the room i heard whispered voices and a sound like silk brushing against wood and faintly a childs footsteps running through leaves trees rustled and there came a flapping of wings from above me beating unevenly as if the bird was in distress or pain the room grew darker turning the wall facing me to black the light through the window frame was tinged with blue and green and shimmered as seen through a heat haze or through water they came from out of the dark wall black shapes against green light they brought with them the coppery scent of blood so strong that i could taste it on my tongue i opened my mouth to call out somethingeven now i am not sure what i could have called or who would have heardbut the dank humidity stilled my tongue like a sponge soaked in warm filthy water it seemed that a weight was on my chest preventing me from rising and i had trouble taking air into my lungs my hands clasped and unclasped until they too were still and i knew then how it felt to have ketamine coursing through ones veins stilling the body in preparation for the anatomists knife the figures stopped at the edge of the darkness just beyond the reach of the windows dim light they were indistinct their edges forming and reforming like figures seen through frosted glass or a projection losing and then regaining its focus and then the voices came birdman soft and insistent birdman fading and then strong again birdman voices that i had never heard and others that had called out to me in passion bird in anger in fear in love daddy she was the smallest of them all linked hand in hand with another who stood beside her around them the others fanned out i counted eight in all and behind them other figures more indistinct women men young girls as the pressure built on my chest and i struggled to draw the shallowest of breaths it came to me that the figure that had haunted tante marie aguillard that raymond believed he had seen at honey island the girl who seemed to call out to me through dark waters might not have been lutice fontenot chile each breath felt like my last none getting farther than the back of my throat before it was choked in a gasp chile the voice was old and dark as the ebony keys on an ancient piano singing out from a distant room wake up chile his world is unraveling and then my last breath sounded in my ears and all was stillness and quiet i woke to the sound of a tapping on my door outside daylight had passed its height and was ebbing toward evening when i opened the door toussaint stood before me behind him i could see rachel waiting its time to go he said i thought the new orleans cops were taking care of that i volunteered he replied he followed me into the room as i threw my shaving gear loosely into my suit carrier folded it over and attached the clasps it was london fog a present from susan toussaint nodded to the nopd patrolman you sure this is okay said the cop he looked distracted and uncertain look new orleans cops got better things to be doing than babysitting replied toussaint ill get these people to their plane you go out and catch some bad guys okay we drove in silence to moisant field i sat in the passenger seat rachel sat in the back i waited for toussaint to take the turn to the airport but he continued straight on you missed your turn i said no said toussaint no i didnt when things start to unravel they unravel fast we got lucky that day everybody gets lucky some time on a junction of the upper grand river southeast of on the road to lafayette a dredging operation to remove silt and junk from the bottom of the river got some of its machinery caught up on a batch of discarded barbed wire that was rusting away on the riverbed they eventually freed it and tried to haul it up but there were other things caught in the wire as well an old iron bedstead a set of slave irons more than a century and a half old and holding the wire to the bottom an oil drum marked with a fleurdelys it was almost a joke to the dredging crew as they worked to free the drum the report of the discovery of a girls body in a fleurdelys drum had been all over the news bulletins and it had taken up ninety lines below the fold on the timespicayune on the day of its discovery maybe the crew joshed one another morbidly as they worked the barrel out of the water in order to get at the wire perhaps they went a little quieter barring the odd nervous laugh as one of them worked at the lid the drum had rusted in places and the lid had not been welded shut when it came off dirty water dead fish and weeds flowed out the legs of the girl partially decayed but surrounded by a strange waxy membrane emerged from the open lid as well although her body remained jammed half in half out of the drum the river life had fed on her but when one man shined his flashlight to the end of the drum he could see the tattered remains of skin at the forehead and her teeth seemed to be smiling at him in the darkness only two cars were at the scene when we arrived the body had been out of the water for less than three hours two uniformed cops stood by with the dredging crew around the body stood three men in plain clothes one of them wearing a slightly more expensive suit than the rest his silver hair cut short and neat i recognized him from the aftermath of morphys death sheriff james dupree of st martin parish toussaints superior dupree motioned us forward as we stepped from the car rachel hung back slightly but still moved toward the body in the drum it was the quietest crime scene at which i had ever been present even when the coroner appeared later it remained restrained dupree pulled a pair of plastic gloves from his hands making sure that he didnt touch their exterior with his exposed fingers his nails were very short and very clean i noticed although not manicured you want to take a closer look he asked no i said ive pretty much seen all i want to see there was a rotten pungent odor coming from the mud and silt dredged up by the crew stronger even than the smell from the girls body birds hovered over the detritus trying to target dead or dying fish one of the crew lodged his cigarette in his mouth bent to pick up a stone and hurled it at a huge gray rat that scuttled in the dirt the stone hit the mud with a wet thudding sound like a piece of meat dropped on a butchers slab the rat scurried away around it other gray objects burst into activity the whole area was alive with rodents disturbed from their nests by the actions of the dredging crew they bumped and snapped at one another their tails leaving snaking lines in the mud the rest of the crew now joined in casting stones in a skimming motion close to the ground most of them had better aims than their friend dupree lit a cigarette with a gold ronson lighter he smoked gitanes the only cop i had ever seen do so the smoke was acrid and strong and the breeze blew it directly into my face dupree apologized and turned so that his body partially shielded me from the smoke it was a peculiarly sensitive gesture and it made me wonder once again why i was not sitting at moisant field they tell me you tracked down that child killer in new york the modine woman said dupree eventually after thirty years thats no mean feat she made a mistake i said in the end they all do its just a matter of being in the right place at the right time to take advantage of the situation he tilted his head slightly to one side as if he didnt entirely agree with what i had said but was prepared to give it a little thought in case hed missed something he took another long drag on his cigarette it was an upmarket brand but he smoked it the way i had seen longshoremen on the new york docks smoke the butt held between the thumb and the first two fingers of the hand the ember shielded by the palm it was the sort of hold you learned as a kid when smoking was still a furtive pleasure and being caught with a cigarette was enough to earn you a smack across the back of the head from your old man i guess we all get lucky sometimes said dupree he looked at me closely im wondering if maybe weve got lucky here i waited for him to continue there seemed to be something fortuitous in the discovery of the girls body or perhaps i was still remembering a dream in which shapes came out of my bedroom wall and told me that a thread in the tapestry being woven by the traveling man had suddenly come loose when morphy and his wife died my first instinct was to take you outside and beat you to within an inch of your life he said he was a good man a good detective despite everything he was also my friend but he trusted you and toussaint here seems to trust you too he thinks maybe you provide a linking factor in all this if thats true then putting you on a plane back to new york isnt going to achieve anything your fbi friend woolrich seemed to feel the same way but there were louder voices than his shouting for you to be sent home he took another drag on his cigarette i reckon youre like gum caught in someones hair he continued the more they try to pry you out the more you get stuck in and maybe we can use that im risking a storm of shit by keeping you here but morphy told me what you felt about this guy how you believed he was observing us manipulating us you want to tell me what you make of this or do you want to spend the night at moisant sleeping on a chair i looked at the bare feet and exposed legs of the girl in the drum the strange yellow accretion like a chrysalis lying in a pool of filth and water on a ratinfested stretch of a river in western louisiana the coroner and his men had arrived with a body bag and a stretcher they positioned a length of plastic on the ground and carefully maneuvered the drum onto it one of them supporting the girls legs with a gloved hand then slowly gently the coroners hands working inside the drum they began to free her everything weve done so far has been dogged and predicted by this man i began the aguillards learned something and they died remarr saw something and he was killed morphy tried to help me and now hes dead as well hes closing off the options forcing us to follow a pattern that hes already set now someones been leaking details of the investigation to the press maybe that person has been leaking things to this man as well possibly unintentionally possibly not dupree and toussaint exchanged a look weve been considering that possibility as well said dupree there are too many damn people crawling over this for anything to stay quiet for long on top of all that i continued the feds are keeping something back you think woolrich has told you everything he knows dupree almost laughed i know as much about this guy byron as i know about the poet and thats sweet fa from inside the drum came a scraping sound the sound of bone rubbing on metal gloved hands supported the girls naked discolored body as it was freed from the confines of the drum how long can we keep the details quiet i asked dupree not long the feds will have to be informed the press will find out he spread his hands in a gesture of helplessness if youre suggesting that i dont tell the feds but i could see in his face that he was already moving in that direction that the reason why the coroner was examining the body so soon after its discovery the reason why there were so few police at the scene was to keep the details limited to the minimum number of people i decided to push him im suggesting you dont tell anyone about this if you do the man who did this will be alerted and hell cut us off again if youre put in a position where you have to say something then fudge it dont mention the barrel obscure the location say you dont believe the discovery is connected to any other investigation say nothing until the girl is identified assuming that we can identify her said toussaint mournfully hey you want to rain someplace else snapped dupree sorry said toussaint hes right i said we may not be able to identify her thats a chance well have to take once we exhaust our own records well have to use the feds said dupree well burn that bridge when we come to it i responded can we do this dupree shuffled his feet and finished his cigarette he leaned through the open window of his car and put the butt into the ashtray twentyfour hours max he said after that well be accused of incompetence or deliberately impeding the progress of an investigation im not even sure how far well get in that time althoughhe looked at toussaint then back to meit may not come to that you want to tell me i said or do i have to guess it was toussaint who answered the feds think theyve found byron theyre going to move on him by morning in which case this is just a backup said dupree the joker in our pack but i was no longer listening they were moving on byron but i would not be there if i tried to participate then a sizable portion of the louisiana law enforcement community would be used to put me on a plane to new york or to lock me in a cell the crew were likely to be the weakest link they were taken aside and given cups of coffee then dupree and i were as honest with them as we felt we could be we told them that if they didnt keep quiet about what they had seen for at least one day then the man who had killed the girl would probably get away and that he would kill again it was at least partly true cut off from the hunt for byron we were continuing the investigation as best we could the crew was made up of hardworking local men most of them married with children of their own they agreed to say nothing until we contacted them and told them that it was okay to do so they meant what they said but i knew that some of them would tell their wives and their girlfriends as soon as they got home and word of what had happened would spread from there a man who says he tells his wife everything is either a liar or a fool my first sergeant used to say unfortunately he was divorced dupree had been in his office when the call came through and had picked pairs of deputies and detectives whom he trusted implicitly with the addition of toussaint rachel and me along with the coroners team and the dredging crew maybe twenty people knew of the discovery of the body it was nineteen people too many to keep a secret for long but that couldnt be helped after the initial examination and photography it was decided to bring the body to a private clinic outside lafayette where the coroner sometimes consulted and he agreed to commence his work almost immediately dupree prepared a statement detailing the discovery of a woman of unspecified age cause of death unknown some five miles from the actual location of the discovery he dated it timed it then left it under a sheaf of files on his desk by the time we both arrived at the autopsy room the remains had been xrayed and measured the mobile cart that had brought the body in had been pushed into a corner away from the autopsy table on its cylindrical tank which delivered water to the table and collected the fluids that drained through the holes on the table itself a scale for the weighing of organs hung from a metal frame and beside it a smallparts dissection table on its own base stood ready for use only three people apart from the coroner and his assistant attended the autopsy dupree and toussaint were two i was the third the smell was strong and only partly masked by the antiseptic dark hair hung from her skull and the skin that was left was shrunken and torn the girls remains were almost completely covered by the yellowwhite substance it was dupree who asked the question doc what is that stuff on the body the examiners name was dr emile huckstetter a tall stocky man in his early sixties with a ruddy complexion he ran a gloved finger over the substance before he responded its a condition called adipocere he said its rareive seen maybe two or three cases at most but the combination of silt and water in that canal seems to have resulted in its development here his eyes narrowed as he leaned toward the body her body fats broke down in the water and theyve hardened to create this substance the adipocere shes been in the water for a while this stuff takes at least six months to form on the trunk less on the face im taking a stab here but i figure shes been in the water for less than seven months certainly no more than that huckstetter detailed the examination into a small microphone attached to his green surgical scrubs the girl was seventeen or eighteen he said she had not been tied or bound there was evidence of a blades slash at her neck indicating a deep cut across her carotid artery as the probable cause of death there were marks on her skull where her face had been removed and similar marks in her eye sockets as the examination drew to a close dupree was paged and minutes later he arrived back with rachel she had checked into a lafayette motel storing both her own baggage and mine then returned she recoiled initially at the sight of the body then stood beside me and without speaking took my hand when the coroner was done he removed his gloves and commenced scrubbing dupree took the x rays from the case envelope and held them up to the light each in turn whats this he said after a time huckstetter took the x ray from his hand and examined it himself compound fracture right tibia he said pointing with his finger probably two years old its in the report or it will be as soon as i can compile it i felt a falling sensation and an ache spreading across my stomach i reached out to steady myself and the scales jangled as i glanced against their frame then my hand was on the autopsy table and my fingers were touching the girls remains i pulled my hand back quickly but i could still smell her on my fingers parker said dupree he reached out and gripped my arm to steady me i could still feel the girl on my fingers my god i said i think i know who she is in the early morning light near the northern tip of bayou courtableau south of krotz springs and maybe twenty miles from lafayette a team of federal agents backed up by st landry parish sheriffs deputies closed in on a shotgun house that stood with its back to the bayou its front sheltered by overgrown bushes and trees some of the agents wore dark rain gear with fbi in large yellow letters on the back others helmets and body armor they advanced slowly and quietly their safeties off when they spoke they did so quickly and with the fewest possible words radio contact was kept to a minimum they knew what they were doing around them deputies armed with pistols and shotguns listened to the sound of their breathing and the pumping of their hearts as they prepared to move on the house of edward byron the man they believed to be directly responsible for the deaths of their colleague john charles morphy his young wife and at least five other people the house was run down the slates on the roof damaged and cracked in places the roof beams already rotting two of the windows at the front of the house were broken and had been covered with cardboard held in place by duct tape the wood on the gallery was warped and in places missing altogether on a metal hook to the right of the house hung the carcass of a wild pig newly skinned blood dripped from its snout and pooled on the ground below on a signal from woolrich shortly after am agents in kevlar body armor approached the house from the front and the rear they checked the windows at either side of the front door and adjoining the rear entrance then simultaneously they hit the doors moving into the central hallway with maximum noise their flashlights burning through the darkness of the interior the two teams had almost reached each other when a shotgun roared from the back of the house and blood erupted in the dim light an agent named thomas seltz plunged forward as the shot ripped through the unprotected area of his armpit the vulnerable point in upperbody armor his finger tightening in a last reflex on the trigger of his machine pistol as he died bullets raked across the wall ceiling and floor as he fell sending dust and splinters through the air and injuring two agents one in the leg and one in the mouth the firing masked the sound of another shell being pumped into the shotgun the second shot blasted wood from the frame of an interior door as agents hit the ground and began firing through the now empty rear door a third shot took out an agent moving fast around the side of the house a mass of logs and old furniture destined for firewood lay scattered on the ground dispersed when the shooter broke from his hiding place beneath it the sound of smallarms fire directed into the bayou reached the agents as they knelt to tend to their injured colleagues or ran to join the chase a figure in worn blue jeans and a whiteandred check shirt had disappeared into the bayou the agents followed warily their legs sinking almost to the knee at times in the muddy swamp water dead tree trunks forcing them to deviate from a straight advance before they reached firm ground using the trees as cover they moved slowly their guns at their shoulders sighting as they went there was the roar of a shotgun from ahead birds scattered from the trees and splinters shot out at head height from a huge cypress an agent screamed in pain and stumbled into view impaled in the cheek by the shards of wood a second blast rang out and shattered the femur in his left leg he collapsed on the dirt and leaves his back arched in agony automatic fire raked the trees shattering branches and blasting foliage after four or five seconds of concentrated firing the order went out to cease fire and the swamp was quiet once again the agents and police advanced once more moving quickly from tree to tree a shout went up as blood was found by a willow its broken branches white as bone from behind came the sounds of dogs barking as the tracker who had been kept in reserve three miles away was brought in to assist the dogs were allowed to sniff around byrons clothing and the area of the woodpile their handler a thin bearded man with his jeans tucked into muddy boots let them smell the blood by the willow as soon as he caught up with the main party then the dogs straining at their leashes they moved on cautiously but no more shots came at them from edward byron because the lawmen were not the only ones hunting him in the swamp while the hunt continued for byron toussaint two young deputies and i were in the sheriffs office in st martinville where we continued our trawl through miami s dentists using emergency numbers from answering machines where necessary rachel provided the only interruption when she arrived with coffee and hot danishes she stood behind me and gently laid a hand on the back of my neck i reached around and clasped her fingers then pulled them forward and lightly kissed their tips i didnt expect you to stay i said i couldnt see her face its almost at an end isnt it she asked quietly i think so i feel it coming then i want to see it out i want to be there at the end she stayed for a little longer until her exhaustion became almost contagious then she returned to the motel to sleep it took thirtyeight calls before the dental assistant at erwin holdmans dental surgery at brickell avenue found the name of lisa stott on her records but she declined even to confirm if lisa stott had attended during the last six months holdman was on the golf course and didnt like being disturbed the assistant said toussaint told her that he didnt give a good goddamn what holdman liked or didnt like and she gave him a cell phone number she was right holdman didnt like being disturbed on the golf course especially when he was about to make a birdie on the fifteenth after some shouting toussaint requested lisa stotts dental records the dentist wanted to seek the permission of her mother and stepfather toussaint handed the phone to dupree and dupree told him that for the present that wasnt possible that they only wanted the records in order to eliminate the girl from their inquiries and it would be unwise to disturb the parents unnecessarily when holdman continued to refuse to cooperate dupree warned him that he would ensure that all his records were seized and his tax affairs subjected to microscopic examination holdman cooperated the records were kept on computer he said along with copies of x rays and dental charts that had been scanned in he would send them on as soon as he returned to his office his dental assistant was new he explained and wouldnt be able to send on the records electronically without his password he would just finish his round there was some more shouting and holdman decided to suspend his golfing activities for that day it would take him one hour traffic permitting to get back to his surgery we sat back to wait byron had made it about a mile into the swamp the cops were closing and his arm was bleeding badly the bullet had shattered the elbow of his left arm and a steady current of pain was coursing through his body he paused in a small clearing and reloaded the shotgun by tensing the stock against the ground and pumping awkwardly with his good hand the barking was closer now he would take the dogs as soon as they came in sight once they were gone he would lose the lawmen in the swamp it was probably only when he rose that he first became aware of the movement in front of him the pack couldnt have got around him already he reasoned the waters were deeper to the west without boats they would not have been able to make it into the swamp from the road even if they had he would have heard them coming his senses had become attuned to the sounds of the swamp only the hallucinations threatened to undo him but they came and went byron crooked the shotgun awkwardly beneath his right arm and moved forward his eyes moving constantly he advanced slowly toward the treeline but the movement seemed to have stopped maybe he shook his head then to clear his sight fearing the onset of the visions but they didnt come instead death came for edward byron as the woods came alive around him and he was surrounded by dark figures he loosed off one shot before the gun was wrenched from his grip and he felt a pain shoot across his chest as the blade opened his skin from shoulder to shoulder the figures surrounded himhardfaced men one with an m slung over his shoulder the others armed with knives and axes all led by a huge man with reddish brown skin and dark hair streaked with gray byron fell to his knees as blows rained down on his back and arms and shoulders dazed with pain and exhaustion he looked up in time to see the big mans axe scything through the air above him then all was darkness we were using duprees office where a new pc sat ready to receive the dental records holdman was sending i sat in a red vinyl chair that had been repaired so often with tape that it was like sitting on cracking ice the chair squeaked as i shifted in it my feet on the windowsill across from me was the couch on which i had earlier caught three hours of uncomfortable sleep toussaint had gone off to get coffee thirty minutes before he still hadnt come back i was starting to get restless when i heard the sound of voices raised from the squad room beyond i passed through the open door of duprees office and into the squad room with its rows of gray metal desks its swivel chairs and hat stands its bulletin boards and coffee cups its halfeaten bagels and donuts toussaint appeared talking excitedly to a black detective in a blue suit and opencollar shirt behind him dupree was talking to a uniformed patrolman toussaint saw me patted the black detective on the shoulder and walked over to me byrons dead he said it was messy the feds lost two men couple more injured byron broke for the swamp when they found him someone had cut him up and split his skull with an axe theyve got the axe and a lot of boot prints he fingered his chin they think maybe lionel fontenot decided to finish things his way dupree ushered us into his office but didnt close the door he stood close to me and touched my arm gently its him things are still confused but theyve got sample jars matching the one in which your daughtershe paused then rephrased itthe jar that you received theyve got a laptop computer the remains of some kind of homemade speaker attachment and scalpels with tissue remains most of it found in a shed at the back of the property i talked to woolrich briefly he mentioned something about old medical texts said to tell you that you were right theyre still searching for the faces of the victims but that could take some time theyre going to start digging around the house later today i wasnt sure what i felt there was relief a sense of a weight being lifted and taken away a sense that it had all come to a close but there was also something more i felt disappointment that i had not been there at the end after all that i had done after all the people who had died both at my hands and the hands of others the traveling man had eluded me right until the end dupree left and i sat down heavily in the chair the sunlight filtering through the shades on the window toussaint sat on the edge of duprees desk and watched me i thought of susan and jennifer and of days spent in the park together and i remembered the voice of tante marie aguillard and i hoped that she was now at peace a low twonote signal beeped from duprees pc at regular intervals toussaint hauled himself from the desk and walked around to where he could see the screen of the pc he tapped some keys and read what was onscreen its holdmans stuff coming through he said i joined him at the screen and watched as lisa stotts dental records appeared detailed in words then as a kind of twodimensional map of her mouth with fillings and extractions marked and then in the form of a mouth x ray toussaint called up the coroners x ray from a separate file and set the two images side by side they look the same he said i nodded i didnt want to think of the implications if they were toussaint called up huckstetter told him what we had and asked him to come over thirty minutes later dr emile huckstetter was running through holdmans file comparing it with his own notes and the xray images he had taken from the dead girl at last he pushed his glasses up on his forehead and pinched the corners of his eyes its her he said toussaint let out a long jagged breath and shook his head in sorrow it was the traveling mans last jest it seemed the old jest the dead girl was lisa stott or as she once was known lisa woolrich a young girl who had become an emotional casualty of her parents bitter divorce who had been abandoned by a mother anxious to start a new life without the complication of an angry hurt teenage daughter and whose father was unable to provide her with the stability and support she needed she was woolrichs daughter the voice on the telephone was heavy with tiredness and tension woolrich its bird i spoke as i drove a st martin s deputy had retrieved the rented car from the flaisance hey there was no life to the word what have you heard that byrons dead some of your men too im sorry yeah it was a mess they call you in new york no i debated whether or not to tell him the truth and decided not to i missed the flight im heading toward lafayette lafayette shit what you doin in lafayette hanging around with toussaint and dupree it had been decided that i should talk to woolrich someone had to tell him that his daughter had been found can you meet me shit bird im on my last legs here then resignedly sure ill meet you we can talk about what happened today give me an hour ill meet you in the jazzy cajun off the highway anyone will tell you where it is i could hear him coughing at the other end of the phone your lady friend go home no shes still here thats good he said its good to have someone with you at times like this then he hung up the jazzy cajun was a small dark bar annexed to a motel with pool tables and a country music jukebox behind the bar a woman restocked the beer while willie nelson played over the speakers woolrich arrived shortly after i began drinking my second coffee he was carrying a canary yellow jacket and the armpits of his shirt were stained with sweat the shirt itself was marked with dirt on the back and sleeves and one elbow was torn his tan trousers were dark with mud at the cuffs and hung over mudencrusted anklehigh boots he ordered a bourbon and a coffee then took a seat beside me near the door we didnt say anything for a time until woolrich drained half of his bourbon and began sipping at his coffee listen bird he began im sorry for what went down between us this last week or so we were both trying to bring this to an end our own way now that its done well he shrugged and tipped his glass at me before draining it and signaling for another there were black stains beneath his eyes and i could see the beginnings of a painful boil at the base of his neck his lips were dry and cracked and he winced as the bourbon hit the inside of his mouth he noticed my look mouth ulcers he explained theyre a bitch he took another sip of coffee i guess you want to hear what happened i shook my head i wanted to put off the moment but not like that what are you going to do now i asked sleep he said then maybe take some time off go down to mexico and see if i cant rescue lisa from these goddamn religious freaks i felt a pain in my heart and stood suddenly i wanted a drink as badly as i had ever wanted anything before in my life woolrich didnt seem to notice my lack of composure or even register that i was walking toward the mens room i could feel sweat on my forehead and my skin felt hypersensitive as if i was about to come down with a fever shes been asking after you birdman i heard him say and i stopped dead what did you say i didnt turn around she asks after you he repeated i turned then when did you hear from her last he waved the glass couple of months back i suppose two or three you sure he stopped and stared at me i hung by a thread over a dark place and watched as something small and bright separated from the whole and disappeared into the blackness never to be found again the surroundings of the bar fell away and there was only woolrich and me alone with nothing to distract either of us from the others words there was no ground beneath my feet no air above me i heard a howling in my head as images and memories coursed through my mind woolrich standing on the porch his finger on the cheek of florence aguillard i call this my metaphysical tie my george herbert tie a couplet from ralegh from the passionate mans pilgrimage the poem from which woolrich so loved to quote blood must be my bodies balmerno other balme will there be given the second phone call i had received in the flaisance the one during which the traveling man had allowed no questions the one during which woolrich was in attendance they have no vision they have no larger view of what theyre doing theres no purpose to it woolrich and his men seizing rachels notes im torn between keeping you in touch and telling you nothing cops throwing a bag of donuts he had touched into a trash can are you fucking her bird you cant bluff someone who isnt paying attention adelaide modine they can sniff each other out and a figure in a new york bar fingering a penguin volume of metaphysical verse and quoting verses from donne rackt carcasses make ill anatomies a metaphysical sensibility that was what the traveling man had what rachel had tried to pinpoint only days before what united the poets whose works had lined the shelves of woolrichs east village apartment on the night he took me back there to sleep on the night after he killed my wife and child bird you okay his pupils were tiny like little black holes sucking the light from the room i turned away yeah just a moment of weakness thats all ill be back where are you going birdman there was doubt in his voice and something else a note of warning of violence and i wondered if my wife had heard it as she tried to escape as he came after her as he broke her nose against the wall i have to go to the john i said i am still not certain why i turned away bile was rising in my throat threatening to make me gag and vomit on the floor a fierce burning pain dug at my stomach and clawed at my heart it was as if a veil had been pulled aside at the moment of my death revealing only a cold black emptiness beyond i wanted to turn away i wanted to turn away from it all and when i returned everything would be normal again i would have a wife and a child who looked like her mother i would have a small peaceful home and a patch of lawn to tend and someone who would stand by me even to the end the toilet was dark and smelled of stale urine from the unflushed bowl but the tap worked i splashed cold water on my face then reached into my jacket pocket for my phone it wasnt there i had left it on the table with woolrich i wrenched the door open and moved around the bar my right hand drawing my pistol but woolrich was already gone i called toussaint but he had left the office dupree had gone home i convinced the switchboard operator to ring duprees home number and to ask him to call me back five minutes later he did his voice was bleary this had better be good he said byron isnt the killer i said what he was wide awake instantly he didnt kill them i repeated i was outside the bar gun in hand but there was no sign of woolrich i stopped two black women passing with a child between them but they backed off as soon as they saw the gun byron wasnt the traveling man woolrich was hes running i caught him out with a lie about his daughter he said he had spoken to her two or three months back you and i both know thats not possible you could have made a mistake dupree listen to me woolrich set byron up he killed my wife and daughter he killed morphy and his wife tante marie tee jean lutice fontenot tony remarr and he killed his own daughter too hes running do you hear me hes running i hear you said dupree his voice was dry with the realization of how wrong we had been one hour later they hit woolrichs apartment in algiers on the south bank of the mississippi it lay on the upper floor of a restored house on opelousas avenue above an old grocery store approached by a flight of cast iron stairs girded with gardenias that led up to a gallery woolrichs apartment was the only one in the building with two arched windows and a solid oak door the new orleans police were backed up by six fbi men the cops led the feds taking up positions at either side of the door there was no movement visible in the apartment through the windows they had not expected any two cops swung an iron battering ram with hi yall painted in white on its flat head it took one swing to knock the door open the fbi men poured into the house the police securing the street and the surrounding yards they checked the tiny kitchen the unmade bed the lounge with the new television the empty pizza cartons and beer cans the penguin poetry editions which sat in a milk crate the picture of woolrich and his daughter smiling from on top of a nest of tables in the bedroom was a closet open and containing an array of wrinkled clothes and two pairs of tan shoes and a metal cabinet sealed with a large steel lock break it instructed the agent in charge of the operation assistant sac cameron tate oneill brouchard the young fbi man who had driven me to tante maries house centuries before struck at the lock with the butt of his machine pistol it broke on the third attempt and he pulled the doors open the explosion blew oneill brouchard backward through the window almost tearing his head off in the process and sent a hailstorm of glass shards into the narrow confines of the bedroom tate was blinded instantly glass embedding itself in his face neck and his kevlar vest two other fbi men sustained serious injuries to the face and hands as part of woolrichs store of empty glass jars his laptop computer a modified h voice synthesizer a smaller portable voice changer with the capacity to alter pitch and tone and a fleshcolored mask used to obscure his mouth and nose were blown to pieces and amid the flames and the smoke and the shards of glass burning pages fluttered to the ground like black moths a mass of biblical apocrypha disintegrating into ash as oneill brouchard was dying i sat in the detective squad room in st martinville as men were pulled in from holidays and days off to assist in the search woolrich had switched off his cell phone but the phone company had been alerted if he used it they would try to pinpoint a location someone handed me a cup of coffee in an alligator cup and while i drank it i tried rachels room at the motel again on the tenth ring the desk clerk interrupted are youdo they call you the birdman he said he sounded young and uncertain yes some people do im sorry sir did you call before i told him that this was my third call i was aware of an edge in my voice i was grabbing lunch i have a message for you from the fbi he said the three letters with a sort of wonder in his voice nausea bubbled in my throat its from agent woolrich mr birdman he said to tell you that he and ms wolfe were taking a trip and that youd know where to find them he said he wanted you to keep it to just the three of you he doesnt want anyone else to spoil the occasion he told me to tell you that especially sir i closed my eyes and his voice grew further away thats the message sir did i do okay toussaint dupree and i lay the map across duprees desk dupree took out a red felttip and drew a circle around the crowleyramah area with the two towns acting as the diameters of the circle and lafayette as its center i figure hes got a place in there somewhere said dupree if youre right and he needed to be close to byron if not to the aguillards as well then were looking at an area as far as krotz springs to the north and damn maybe as far as bayou sorrel to the south if he took your friend that probably delayed him a little he needed time to check motel reservationsnot much but enough if he was unlucky with the places he calledand he needed time to get her out he wont want to stay on the roads so hell hole up maybe in a motel or if its close enough his own place he tapped the pen in the center of the circle weve alerted the locals the feds and the state troopers that leaves usand you i had been thinking of what woolrich had said that i would know where to find them but so far nothing had come to me i cant pin anything down the obvious ones like the aguillard house and his own place in algiers are already being checked but i dont think hes going to be at either of those places i put my head in my hands my fears for rachel were obscuring my reasoning i needed to pull back i took my jacket and walked to the door i need space to think ill stay in touch dupree seemed about to object but he said nothing outside my car was parked in a police space i sat in it rolled down the windows and took my louisiana map from the glove compartment i ran my fingers over the names arnaudville grand coteau carencro broussard milton catahoula coteau holmes st martinville itself the last name seemed familiar from somewhere but by that point all the towns seemed to resonate with some form of meaning which left them all meaningless it was like repeating your name over and over and over again in your head until the name itself lost its familiarity and you began to doubt your own identity i started to drive out of town toward lafayette still st martinville came back to me again something about new iberia and a hospital a nurse nurse judy neubolt judy the nut as i drove i recalled the conversation that i had had with woolrich when id arrived in new orleans for the first time after the deaths of susan and jennifer judy the nut she said i murdered her in a past life was the story true or did it mean something else had woolrich been toying with me even then the more i thought about it the more certain i became he had told me that judy neubolt had moved to la jolla on a oneyear contract after their relationship broke up i doubted that judy had ever got as far as la jolla judy neubolt wasnt in the current directory or the previous years directory either i found her in an old directory in a gas stationher phone had since been disconnected and figured i could get more directions in st martinville then i called huckstetter at home gave him judy neubolts address and asked him to contact dupree in an hour if he hadnt heard from me he agreed reluctantly as i drove i thought of david fontenot and the call from woolrich that had almost certainly brought him to honey island a promise of an end to the search for his sister he couldnt have known how close he was to her resting place when he died i thought of the deaths i had brought on morphy and angie the echo of tante maries voice in my head as he came for her and remarr gilded in fading sunlight i think i realized too why the details had appeared in the newspaper it was woolrichs way of bringing his work to a larger audience a modernday equivalent of the public anatomization and i thought of lisa a small heavy darkeyed girl who had reacted badly to her parents separation who had sought refuge in a strange christianity in mexico and who had returned at last to her father what had she seen to force him to kill her her father washing blood from his hands in a sink the remains of lutice fontenot or some other unfortunate floating in a jar or had he simply killed her because the pleasure he took in disposing of her in mutilating his own flesh and blood was as close as he could come to turning the knife on his own body to enduring his own anatomization and finding at last the deep red darkness within himself neat lawns mixed with thick growths of cypress as i drove back along the blacktop of to st martinville past a god is prolife sign and the warehouselike structure of podnuhs nightclub at thibodeauxs café on the neat town square i asked for directions to judy neubolts address they knew the house even knew that the nurse had moved to la jolla for a year maybe longer and that her boyfriend was maintaining the house perkins street started almost opposite the entrance to evangeline state park at the end of the street was a tjunction which disappeared on the right into a rural setting with houses scattered at distant intervals judy neubolts house was on this street a small twostory dwelling strangely low despite the two floors with two windows on either side of a screen door and three much smaller windows on the upper level at the eastern side the roof sloped down reducing it to a single story the wood of the house had been newly painted a pristine white and damaged slates on the roof had been replaced but the yard was overgrown with weeds and the woods beyond had begun to make inroads on the boundaries of the property i parked some way from the house and approached it through the woods stopping at their verge the sun was already falling from its apex and it cast a red glow across the roof and walls the rear door was bolted and locked there seemed to be no option but to enter from the front as i moved forward my senses jangled with a tension i had not felt before sounds smells and colors were too sharp too overpowering i felt as if i could pick out the component parts of every noise that came to me from the surrounding trees my gun moved jerkily my hand responding too rapidly to the signals from my brain i was conscious of the firmness of the trigger against the ball of my finger and every crevice and rise of the grip against the palm of my hand the sound of the blood pumping in my ears was like an immense hand banging on a heavy oak door my feet on the leaves and twigs like the crackling of some huge fire the drapes were pulled on the windows top and bottom and across the inner door through a gap in the drapes on the door i could see black material hung to prevent anyone from peering through the cracks the screen door opened with a squeak of rusty hinges as i eased it ajar with my right foot my body shielded by the wall of the house i could see a thick spiders web at the upper part of the door frame the brown drained husks of trapped insects shivering in the vibrations from the opening door i reached in and turned the handle on the main door it opened easily i let it swing to its fullest expanse revealing the dimly lit interior of the house i could see the edge of a sofa one half of a window at the other side of the house and to my right the beginning of a hallway i took a deep breath which echoed in my head like the low pained gasp of a sick animal then moved quickly to my right the screen door closing behind me i now had a full uninterrupted view of the main room of the house the exterior had been deceptive judy neubolt or whoever had decided on the design of the houses interior had removed one floor entirely so that the room reached right to the roof where two skylights now encrusted with filth and partly obscured by black drapes stretched beneath them allowed thin shafts of sunlight to penetrate to the bare boards below the only illumination came from a pair of dim floor lamps one at each end of the room the room was furnished with a long sofa decorated with a redandorange zigzag pattern which stood facing the front of the house at either side of it were matching chairs with a low coffee table in the center and a tv cabinet beneath one of the windows facing the seating area behind the sofa was a dining table and six chairs with a fireplace to their rear the walls were decorated with samples of indian art and one or two vaguely mystical paintings of women with flowing white dresses standing on a mountain or beside the sea it was hard to make out details in the dimness at the eastern end was a raised wooden gallery reached by a flight of steps to my left which led up to a sleeping area with a pine bed and a matching closet rachel hung upside down from the gallery a rope attached from her ankles to the rail above she was naked and her hair stretched to within two feet of the floor her arms were free and her hands hung beyond the ends of her hair her eyes and mouth were wide open but she gave no indication that she saw me a needle attached to the plastic pipe of a drip was taped to her left arm the drip bag hung from a metal frame allowing the ketamine to seep slowly and continuously into her system on the floor beneath her was stretched an expanse of clear plastic sheeting beneath the gallery was a dark kitchen area with pine cupboards a tall refrigerator and a microwave oven beside the sink three stools stood empty by a breakfast nook to my right on the wall facing the gallery hung an embroidered tapestry with a pattern similar to the sofa and chairs a thin patina of dust lay over everything i checked the hallway behind me it led into a second bedroom this one empty but for a bare mattress on which lay a military green sleeping bag a green knapsack lay open beside the bed and i could see some jeans a pair of cream trousers and some mens shirts inside the room with its low sloping roof took up about half the width of the house which meant that there was a room of similar size on the other side of the wall i moved back toward the main room all the time keeping rachel in sight there was no sign of woolrich although he could have been standing hidden in the hallway at the other side of the house rachel could give me no indication of where he might be i began moving slowly along the tapestried wall to the far wall of the house i was about halfway across when a movement behind rachel caught my attention and i spun my gun raised to shoulder level as i instinctively assumed a marksmans stance put it down birdman or she dies now he had been waiting in the darkness behind her shielded by her body he stood close to her now most of his body still hidden by her own i could see the edge of his tan pants the sleeve of his white shirt and a sliver of his head nothing more if i tried to shoot i would almost certainly hit rachel i have a gun pointing at the small of her back bird i dont want to ruin such a beautiful body with a bullet hole so put the gun down i bent down and placed the gun gently on the ground now kick it away from you i kicked it with the side of my foot and watched it slide across the floor and spin to rest by the foot of the nearest chair he emerged from the shadows then but he was no longer the man that i had known it was as if with the revelation of his true nature a metamorphosis had occurred his face was more gaunt than ever and the dark shadows beneath his eyes gave him a skeletal look but those eyes they shone in the semidarkness like black jewels as my eyes grew more accustomed to the light i saw that his irises had almost disappeared his pupils were large and dark and fed greedily on the light in the room why did it have to be you i said as much to myself as to him you were my friend he smiled then a bleak empty smile that drifted across his face like snow how did you find her bird he asked his voice low how did you find lisa i gave you lutice fontenot but how did you find lisa maybe she found me i replied he shook his head in slow disappointment it doesnt matter he said softly i dont have time for those things now i got a whole new song to sing he was fully in view now in one hand he held what looked like a modified widebarreled air pistol in the other a scalpel a sig was tucked into the waistband of his pants i noticed that they still had mud on the cuffs why did you kill her woolrich twisted the scalpel in his hand because i could around us the light in the room changed darkening as a cloud obscured the slivers of sunlight filtering through the skylights above us i moved slightly shifting my weight my eye on my gun where it lay on the floor my movement seemed exaggerated as if faced with the potential of the ketamine everything shifted too quickly by comparison woolrichs gun came up in a single fluid moment dont bird you wont have long to wait dont rush the end the room brightened again but only marginally the sun was setting fast soon there would only be darkness it was always going to end this way bird you and me in a room like this i planned it right from the start you were always going to die this way maybe here or maybe later in some other place he smiled again after all they were going to promote me it would have been time to move on again but in the end it was always going to come down to this he moved forward one step the gun never wavering youre a little man bird do you have any idea how many little people ive killed trailer park trash in pennyass towns from here to detroit cracker bitches who spent their lives watching oprah and fucking like dogs addicts drunks havent you ever hated those people bird the ones you know are worthless the ones who will never amount to anything will never do anything will never contribute anything have you ever thought that you might be one of them i showed them how worthless they were bird i showed them how little they mattered i showed your wife and your daughter how little they mattered and byron i asked was he one of the little people or did you turn him into one of them i wanted to keep him talking maybe work my way toward my gun as soon as he stopped he would try to kill both rachel and me but more than that i wanted to know why as if there could ever be a why that would explain all of this byron said woolrich he smiled slightly i needed to buy myself some time when i cut up the girl at park rise everyone believed the worst of him and he ran all the way back to baton rouge i visited him bird i tested the ketamine on him and then i just kept giving it to him he tried to run once but i found him in the end i find them all you warned him that the feds were coming didnt you you sacrificed your own men to ensure that he would lash out at them to ensure that he died before he could start raving to them did you warn adelaide modine too after you sniffed her out did you tell her i was coming after her did you make her run woolrich didnt answer instead he ran the blunt edge of the scalpel down rachels arm have you ever wondered how skin so thincan hold so much blood in he turned the scalpel and ran the blade across her scapula from the right shoulder to the space between her breasts rachel did not move her eyes remained open but something glittered and a tear trickled from the corner of her left eye and lost itself in the roots of her hair blood flowed from the wound running along the nape of her neck and pooling at her chin before it fell on her face drawing red lines along her features look bird he said i think the blood is going to her head his head tilted and then i drew you in theres a circularity to this which you should appreciate bird after you die everybody is going to know about me then ill be gonethey wont find me bird i know every trick in the bookand ill start again he smiled slightly you dont look very appreciative he said after all bird i gave you a gift when i killed your family if they had lived theyd have left you and you would have become just another drunk in a sense i kept the family together i chose them because of you bird you befriended me in new york you paraded them in front of me and i took them marsyas i said quietly woolrich glanced at rachel shes a smart lady bird just your type just like susan and soon shell be just another of your dead lovers except this time you wont have long to grieve over her his hand flicked the scalpel back and forth tearing fine lines across rachels arm i dont think he even realized what he was doing or the manner in which he was anticipating the acts to come i dont believe in the next world bird its just a void this is hell bird and we are in it all the pain all the hurt all the misery you could ever imagine you can find it here its a culture of death the only religion worth following the world is my altar bird but i dont think youll ever understand in the end the only time a man really understands the reality of death of the final pain is at the moment of his own its the flaw in my work but somehow it makes it more human look upon it as my conceit he turned the scalpel in his hand dying sunlight and blood mingling on the blade she was right all along bird now its time for you to learn youre about to receive and become a lesson in mortality im going to recreate the pietà again bird but this time with you and your lady friend cant you see it the most famous representation of grief and death in the history of the world a potent symbol of selfsacrifice for the greater good of humanity of hope of resurrection and youre going to be a part of it except this is the antiresurrection were creating darkness made flesh he moved forward again his eyes terrifyingly bright youre not going to come back from the dead bird and the only sins youre dying for are your own i was already moving to the right when the gun fired i felt a sharp stinging pain in my left side as the aluminumbodied syringe struck and i heard the sound of woolrichs footsteps approaching across the wooden floor i lashed out at it with my left hand dislodging the needle painfully from my flesh it was a huge dose i could already feel it taking effect as i reached for my gun i gripped the butt hard and tried to draw a bead on woolrich he killed the lights caught in the center of the floor away from rachels body he moved to the right i found a shape moving past the window and i loosed off two shots there was a grunt of pain and the sound of glass breaking a finger of sunlight lanced into the room i worked my way backward until i reached the second hallway i tried to catch a glimpse of woolrich but he seemed to have disappeared into the shadows a second syringe whacked into the wall beside me and i was forced to dive to my left my limbs were heavy now my arms and legs propelling me with difficulty i felt as if there was a pressure on my chest and i knew i would not be able to support my own weight if i tried to rise i kept moving backward every movement a huge effort but i felt certain that if i stopped i would never be able to move again the creaking of boards came from the main room and i heard woolrich breathing harshly he barked out a short laugh and i could hear the pain in it fuck you bird he said shit that hurts he laughed again im going to make you pay for that bird you and the woman im going to tear your fucking souls apart his voice came to me as if through a heavy fog that distorted the sound and made it difficult to tell distances or direction the walls of the hallway rippled and fragmented and black gore oozed from the cracks a hand reached out to me a slim female hand with a narrow gold loop on its wedding finger i saw myself reach out to touch it although i could still feel my hands on the floor beneath me a second female hand appeared flailing blindly bird i backed away shaking my head to try to clear the vision then two smaller hands emerged from the darkness delicate and childlike and i closed my eyes tightly and gritted my teeth daddy no i hissed i dug my nails into the floor until i heard one crack and pain coursed through the index finger of my left hand i needed the pain i needed it to fight off the effects of the ketamine i pressed down hard on the injured finger and the pain made me gasp there were still shadows moving along the wall but the figures of my wife and child had gone i was conscious now of a reddish glow bathing the hallway my back struck something cold and heavy which moved slowly as i pressed against it i was leaning against a halfopen reinforced steel door with three bolts on its left side the central bolt was a monster easily an inch in diameter with a huge open brass lock hanging from it red light seeped out from the crack in the door birdman its almost over now said woolrich his voice sounded very close now although i still could not see him i guessed he was standing at the very edge of the corner waiting for me to finally stop moving the drug is going to stop you soon throw the gun away bird and we can get started the sooner we start the sooner we finish i leaned back harder on the door and felt it give fully i pushed back with my heels once twice a third time until i came to rest against a set of shelving that reached from ceiling to floor the room was lit by a single red bulb which hung unshaded from the center of the ceiling the windows had been bricked up the brickwork left uncovered there was no natural light to illuminate the contents of the room opposite me to the left of the door was a row of metal shelving perforated bars holding the shelves in place with screws on each shelf sat a number of glass jars and in each jar glowing in the dim red light lay the remains of a human face most were beyond recognition lying in the formaldehyde some had sunken in on themselves eyelashes were still visible on some lips bleached almost white on others the skin at their edges tattered and torn on the lowest shelf two dark faces lay almost upright against the glass and even though they had been violated in this way i recognized the faces of tante marie aguillard and her son i counted maybe fifteen bottles in front of me behind me the shelving moved slightly and i heard the sound of glass knocking against glass and the slick movement of liquid i raised my head row upon row of bottles reached up to the ceiling each bearing its faint white human remains beside my left eye a face leaned against the front of a jar its empty eyes gaping as if trying to peer into eternity and i knew that somewhere among these faces susan lay preserved what do you think of my collection bird the dark bulk of woolrich moved slowly down the hallway in one hand i could see the outline of the pistol in the other he rubbed his thumb along the clean line of the scalpel wondering where your wife is shes on the middle shelf third from the left shit bird youre probably sitting beside her right now i didnt move i didnt blink my body lay slumped against the shelves surrounded by the faces of the dead my face would be there soon i thought my face and rachels and susans side by side forever woolrich came forward until he stood in the doorway he raised the air pistol nobody ever lasted this long before bird even tee jean and he was a strong kid his eyes glowed redly i gotta tell you bird in the end this is going to hurt he tightened his finger on the pistol and i heard the sharp crack as the hypo shot from the barrel i was already raising my gun as the sharp pain struck my chest my arm achingly heavy my vision blurred by the shadows moving across my eyes i tightened my finger on the trigger willing it to increase the pressure woolrich sprang forward alive to the danger the scalpel raised to slash at my arm the trigger moved back slowly infinitesimally slowly and the world slowed down with it woolrich seemed to hang in space the blade curving down in his hand as if through water his mouth wide and a sound like a wind howling in a tunnel coming from his throat the trigger moved back another tiny measure and my finger froze as the gun boomed loudly in the enclosed space woolrich barely three feet from me now bucked as the first shot took him in the chest the next eight shots seemed to come together the sound of their firing joining together as the bullets tore into him the millimeter rounds ripping through cloth and flesh before the gun locked empty glass shattered as the bullets exited and the floor became awash with formaldehyde woolrich fell backward and lay on the floor his body shaking and spasming he rose once his shoulders and head lifting from the ground the light already dying in his eyes then he lay back and moved no more my arm gave in under the weight of the gun and it fell to the floor i could hear liquid dripping could feel the presence of the dead as they crowded around me from a distance there came the sound of approaching sirens and i knew that whatever happened to me rachel at least would be safe something brushed my cheek with a touch light as gossamer like the last caress of a lover before the time to sleep and a kind of peace came over me with a final act of will i closed my eyes and waited for the stillness to come epilogue i turn left at the scarborough intersection down the steep hill past the maximillian kolbe catholic church and the old cemetery the fire department on my right the late evening sun shining bleakly on the expanse of marshland to the east and west of the road soon it will be dark and lights will appear in the houses of the locals but the summer houses on prouts neck road will not be lit the sea rolls in gently at prouts neck washing slowly over sand and stone the season is over now and behind me the bulk of the black point inn looms darkly its dining room deserted its bar quiet the screen doors of the staff dormitories locked down in the summer the old and wealthy from boston and upstate new york will come to stay eating buffet lunches by the pool and dressing for dinner the candlelight reflecting on their heavy jewelry and dancing around the table like golden moths across the water i can see the lights of old orchard beach a chill wind is coming in over the sea tossing and buffeting the last of the gulls i pull my coat tightly around me and stand on the sand watching the grains swirl and twist before me they make a sound like a mother hushing her child as the wind raises them from the dunes and lifts them like the shapes of old ghosts before laying them to rest again i am standing near the spot where clarence johns stood all those years ago as he watched daddy helmss man pour dirt and ants over my body it was a hard lesson to learn harder still to learn it twice i recall the look on his face as he stood shivering before me the desolation the realization of what he had done of what he had lost and i want to put my arm around the shoulders of clarence johns and tell him that its all right that i understand that i bear him no malice for what he did i want to hear the soles of his cheap shoes slapping on the road i want to watch him skim a stone over the water and know that he is still my friend i want to walk the long walk home beside him and hear him whistling the only three bars he knows of some tune that he cant get out of his head a tune that returns again and again to haunt him as he makes his way along the road but instead i will climb back in my car and return to portland in the waning autumn light i have a room at the inn at st john with big bay windows and clean white sheets and a separate bathroom two doors down the hall i will lie on my bed as the traffic passes beneath my window as the greyhound buses arrive and depart from the terminal across the street as the street people push their shopping carts filled with bottles and cans down the sidewalk and the taxi drivers wait silently in their cabs and in the gathering darkness i will call rachels number in manhattan the phone will ringonce twiceand then her machine will kick in hi no one can come to the phone right now but i have heard the same message again and again since she left the hospital her receptionist says that she cannot tell me where rachel is she has canceled her college lectures and from my hotel room i will talk to the machine i could find her if i chose i found the others but they were dead when i found them i do not want to chase her down it is not supposed to end this way she should be beside me now her skin perfect and white not scarred by woolrichs knife her eyes bright and inviting not wary and haunted by the visions that torment her in the night her hands reaching for me in the darkness not raised to ward me off as if even my touch might cause her pain we will both reach an accommodation with the past with all that has taken place but for now we will each do so alone in the morning edgar will have the radio playing and there will be orange juice and coffee on the table in the lobby and muffins wrapped in plastic from there i will drive out to my grandfathers house and start working a local man has agreed to help me fix my roof and mend my walls so that the house can be made habitable for the winter and i will sit on my porch as the wind takes the evergreens in hand pressing and molding their branches into new shapes creating a song from their leaves and i will listen for the sound of a dog barking its paws scraping on the worn boards its tail moving lazily in the cool evening air or the taptaptap on the rail as my grandfather prepares to tamp the tobacco into his pipe a glass of whiskey beside him warm and tender as a familiar kiss or the rustle of my mothers dress against the kitchen table as she lays out plates for the evening meal blue on white older than she is old as the house or the sound of plasticsoled shoes fading into the distance disappearing into the darkness embracing the peace that comes at last to every dead thing acknowledgments a number of books proved particularly valuable in the course of
