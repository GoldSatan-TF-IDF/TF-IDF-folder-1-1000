jack higgins dark justice book in the sean dillon series to neil nyren editor extraordinaire with grateful thanks one sword is worth ten thousand words the koran new york manhattan on a dark november evening around eight oclock was bleak and uninviting an east wind driving heavy rain before it as henry morgan turned the corner of a side street into park avenue he was a small man wearing a dark blue uniform and cap with the legend icon security emblazoned on each shoulder in one hand was a black leather bag and the other held an umbrella over his head park avenue was hardly deserted at that hour cars swishing by although there were few pedestrians because of the rain he turned into a convenient doorway for a moment and looked each way it was a mixture of offices and residences mostly impressive town houses lights at the windows hed always loved cities by night and felt a sudden nostalgia emotional of course and he took a deep breath after all hed come a long way for this a long way and here he was at the final end of things time to get on with it he picked up the bag and stepped out a hundred yards farther on he came to an office building no more than four stories high a building of some distinction to it older than the adjacent buildings there was discreet lighting on the ground floor obviously for security a sign in gold leaf on one of the windows said gould amp company bank depository and indicated business hours from nine until four in the afternoon he stepped into the arched entrance peering through the armored plateglass door into the lighted foyer and pressed the buzzer for chesney only chesney didnt come instead a large black man wearing the same dark blue uniform appeared and opened the door hey youre late morgan isnt it the english guy chesney told me about you morgan stepped inside the door closed noiselessly behind him a bad start but hed have to make the best of it im sorry i always get chesney coffee and sandwiches from a place round the corner he followed the other man through to the reception area where is he the way i heard it his gallbladders playing up again so they rushed me over from south street what do i call you smith will do he sat behind the desk took out a pack of marlboros and lit one a busy night out there but at least there are a couple of good movies on tv so youre from london they tell me thats right so what are you doing over here oh pastures new you know how it is lucky you got a green card well id been doing this kind of thing over there it helped smith nodded anyway lets see what youve got in that bag morgans stomach turned hollow and he hesitated smith reached for the bag im starving and what with them rushing me over here at the last minute i had no chance to get anything morgan hurriedly pulled the bag up put it on the desk opened it produced coffee and sandwiches and passed them over what about you smith asked ill have mine later ill do the rounds first suit yourself smith started to unwrap a sandwich ill get started then ill just drop my bag in the rest room he moved to the other end of the foyer and did just that then called to smith see you later take your time smith switched on the television and morgan entered the elevator and pressed the buttons that took him down to the vault he checked it thoroughly giving what hed put in the coffee time to work although the effect was almost instantaneous and good for five hours or so theyd told him he trawled the vault hundreds of steel boxes behind bars went back to the elevator and ascended to the fourth floor it was all office accommodation everything in good order and it was the same when he went down to the third and then the second floor boring really to have to spend your working life doing this but it would soon be over he returned to the elevator and went down smith was slumped across the desk out completely the partly drunk coffee cup beside him the sandwich had a couple of bites out of it but that was all morgan shook him to make sure then turned to the general security box and switched it off for the entire building he went along to the rest room retrieved his bag got into the elevator and went to the second floor when he went out he dimmed the lights walked across to the window looking out over park avenue to the splendid town house on the other side its many windows ablaze with lights parking had been banned for the whole block and not just because it was owned by senator harvey black having switched off the entire alarm system morgan was able to open the control panel by the window without any unseemly fuss he started to whistle softly put the bag on the table opened it and produced an ak unfolded the stock cocked it and laid it across the windowsill checking his watch it was twenty to nine and the fundraiser at the pierre would just be finishing senator black would be bringing his honored guest back to the house for dinner at nine oclock morgan took a pack of cigarettes from his pocket lit one and sat there at the open window cradling the ak with every intention of shooting the president of the united states dead the moment he stepped out on the pavement suddenly he heard the sound of the elevator in operation below for a moment he froze in a kind of panic then jumped to his feet and turned to face the elevator it stopped and smith stepped out followed by a tall handsome man of fifty or so black hair graying why henry smith said whats all this i didnt see anything about it in the job description morgan backed away thinking hard there was a pause and the other man said mr morgan my name is blake johnson i work for the president of the united states this gentleman is clancy smith of the secret service i regret to tell you that the president isnt coming tonight seems he canceled the dinner at the last moment and flew back to washington so sorry he stepped forward and in a single motion morgan raised the ak and fired at pointblank range but only the rattle of the bolt sounded smith said forgot to mention i emptied it when you went down to the vault and by the way i never accept coffee from strangers morgan dropped the ak to the floor with a look of despair on his face johnson almost felt sorry for him hell man we got saddam hussein did you really think you could pull this off anything to say yes morgan said beware the wrath of allah he seemed to bite hard his jaw tightening then he staggered back tripped and fell to the floor moaning terribly his face contorted there was a strange pungent smell as smith dropped to one knee and peered closely at him he glanced up i dont know what in the hell that smell is but this guy is dead by special arrangement blake had the body removed by army paramedics and conveyed to an exclusive private hospital used mainly for rehab patients it did however offer stateoftheart morgue facilities and hed called in one of new york s finest chief medical examiners dr george romano to do the necessary he and clancy had stopped off at their hotel so that clancy could change from the security uniform and arrived at their destination a good hour after the corpse and found romano in the superintendents office already garbed for action he and blake were old friends romano had done a lot of work for the basement the white house security organization that johnson ran romano was drinking coffee and smoking i thought that was against the law these days especially for doctors around here i make my own rules blake whos your friend clancy smith secret service hes taken a bullet for the president in the past fortunately nothing like that was needed tonight ive started on our friend mr morgan just taking a break john doe if you dont mind blake said and what if i do blake turned to clancy who opened the briefcase he carried took out a document and passed it across to the doctor youll notice thats addressed to one george romano and signed by president jake cazalet its whats called a presidential warrant it says you belong to the president it transcends all our laws and you cant even say no you also never discuss what happened tonight because it never happened for once romano wasnt smiling that bad he shook his head i should have known when i realized youd given me a heinrich himmler what in the hell is that supposed to mean clancy demanded ill go back in and show you if you can stand to watch i was in vietnam and clancy was in the gulf i think we can stand it blake said excuse me i was in nam too said romano and with all due respect the gulf war was pussy yeah well clancy here has got two navy crosses to prove otherwise blake said but lets get on with it in the postmortem room two technicians waited while romano scrubbed up again he was helped into surgical gloves and moved to the naked body of henry morgan who lay on the slanting steel table his head raised high on a wooden block the mouth gaping close at hand were a video recorder and an instrument cart romano said wednesday november third resuming postmortem henry morgan address unknown he turned to blake and clancy come closer because of the unusual circumstances i decided to investigate the mouth first and if you look closely youll find a molar missing at the left side he pulled the mouth open with a finger and disclosed the bloodied gap and here it is gents he picked up a small stainlesssteel pan and rattled the crushed remains of a tooth in it that was part gold heinrich himmler for the benefit of those too young to remember was reichsf√ºhrer of the ss during the immortal days of the third reich however he was smart enough to know that all good things come to an end and didnt fancy the hangmans noose so he had a false tooth fitted that contained a cyanide capsule a number of nazis did faced with capture you crunch down as hard as you can death is virtually instantaneous so our friend here had no intention of being taken alive id say so now in spite of the fact that i suspect it will prove useless i intend to complete my usual thorough examination what by the way do you know about the guy the only thing i can tell you is that hes thirty years old when can i have the body id say an hour should do it good ill arrange transportation while were waiting in the office and george he pulled him away and murmured softly i dont mind the technicians having heard the himmler bit but nothing more no comment and bring the videotape when youre finished yes o great one romano turned back to the task at hand and blake and clancy went out they sat in the superintendents office and blake made a call on his codex mobile it was answered almost instantly highgrove its blake johnson i phoned earlier about a disposal of course sir were ready and waiting you know where we are the package will be ready in one hour well be there and ill expect the disposal to be immediate naturally blake switched off lets have some coffee there was a pot standing ready in the machine clancy went and poured two cups not a thing on him swept clean no id no passport and yet he had to have one to get into the country probably stashed it before he came here tonight everything else was likely forged came into the country posing as a tourist a forged green card was supplied a room booked for him in some modest hotel and the ak could have been left for him in a locker anywhere the job at the security agency could have been arranged for him in advance ill bet he didnt even meet anyone from his organization here in new york but some outfit sent him from london of course otherwise why would he be here theyve probably got friends in new york who kept an anonymous eye on him but preferred not to get involved i wouldnt blame them it was a suicide mission clancy said even if we hadnt gotten him now hed have been run down like a dog if the worst had happened very probably now i must speak to the president he found cazalet at his desk in the oval office mr president we got him the whole thing was for real hes dead unfortunately that is unfortunate gunshot wound cyanide dear me where are you now the mortuary waiting for the disposal team fine take care of it blake this never happened i dont want it on the front page of the new york times ill order a plane to pick up you and clancy i want you back here as soon as possible so we can sort things out yes mr president and since it was our british cousins who alerted us to the existence of morgan youd better telephone general ferguson and let him know in london it was four oclock in the morning when the security phone rang at general charles fergusons flat in cavendish place he switched on the bedside light and answered at such an appalling hour i can only assume this is of supreme importance it always is when it concerns the empire charles it was the code word used to indicate the president in danger ferguson was fully alert now and sat up blake my good friend what happened your information on henry morgan was deadon he tried to hit the president tonight but clancy and i stopped him unfortunately he had a cyanide tooth so hes no longer with us is the president all right absolutely as for morgan whats left of him will soon be six pounds of gray ash ill probably flush it down the toilet youre a hard man blake harder than i believed possible its the nature of the job charles and the bastard did intend to assassinate the president anyway thanks to you and the rest of the prime ministers private army its all come out fine thank them all for me hannah bernstein sean dillon and major roper especially roper on this one the mans a genius on the computer got to run charles ill be in touch blake put the phone down and romano entered carrying a videotape and several documents good man blake said not really romano lit a cigarette im smart enough to know my place thats all clancy had gone out to check the corridor and found two men in black coats pushing a gurney with a body bag on it one of them a quietly cadaverous man said mr johnson blake leaned out of the office door hes all ready and waiting for you load him on and well see you at highgrove tell mr coffin to wait until we arrive as you say sir they moved away clancy said coffin is that for real if its the man i know it certainly is romano smiled bleakly fergus coffin i believe its called life imitating art at that moment the gurney returned with what was obviously henry morgan in the body bag on your way now gentlemen i think ive had enough for one night in the mortuary at highgrove blake and clancy waited by the ovens fergus coffin and an attendant pushed the gurney forward the body still enclosed in the black body bag blake said open it coffin nodded and his associate unzipped it exposing the head henry morgan it was he looks at peace blake said he would be mr johnson coffin told him death is a serious business ive devoted my life to it no questions none ive seen the presidential warrant but its more than that youre a good man mr johnson every instinct tells me that youve known great sorrow blake remembering a murdered wife stiffened for a moment and then said how long with the new technology thirty minutes then get on with it put him in but i need to see he held out the documents and video and these the other man opened one of the oven doors coffin pushed the gurney forward henry morgan slid inside coffin pulled the gurney away the glass door closed a button was pressed the oven flared at once the gas jets peaking and the body bag flared instantly also the video and documents blake turned to clancy well wait and led the way outside in the office they smoked cigarettes clancy said you want coffee not in a million years a good stiff drink is what i need but well have to wait until were on the plane rain hammered against the window clancy said does it ever bother you this kind of thing clancy i went to war for my country in vietnam when i was very young and full of ideals i never really regretted it someone had to do it now all these years later were at war with the world a world where global terrorism is the name of the game he stubbed out his cigarette in an ashtray and clancy ill do anything it takes i took an oath to my president and i take that to be an oath to my country he smiled slightly does that give you a problem and clancy smith once the youngest sergeant major in the marine corps smiled not in the slightest at that moment the door opened and coffin entered holding a plastic urn henry morgan six pounds of gray ash excellent blake said and clancy took the urn many thanks blake told coffin believe me youve never done anything more important i accept your word for that mr johnson and coffin went out lets go blake said and added bring the urn with you he led the way out to the parking lot where the rain poured down relentlessly they walked to their limousine which was parked by what in season would obviously be a flower bed blake said i was going to put those ashes down the toilet but lets be more civilized and do something for next years flowers good idea clancy unscrewed the top of the urn and poured the ashes over the flower bed i believe its called strewing i dont care what its called washington next so lets catch that plane washington but a cold front moving in from the atlantic had done unmentionable things to the weather and in spite of the rain or because of it low clouds produced heavy fog and closed things down at kennedy blake and clancy made the best of things in one of the vip lounges dozing fitfully but were still there at six the following morning when they got word that their gulfstream had managed to get in as they walked out through the terminal bags in hand clancy said theres no romance in this work anymore i must have seen every james bond movie on tv at one time or another and he never got held up by bad weather at any airport not once here weve got a gulfstream one of the classiest aircraft in the world and it still couldnt get to us nature rules blake said face up to it and shut up well be on our way in fifteen minutes they rose up very quickly to thirty thousand feet the crew was air force and their stewardess a young sergeant who introduced herself as mary now what can i get you gentlemen well i know its only sixthirty in the morning blake told her but for very special reasons i think a bottle of champagne is in order could you manage that i think that could be arranged she gave them a dazzling smile and moved down to the galley we didnt do too badly did we clancy said considering that the president could have been facedown on the pavement that he isnt is due to major roper warning us that there was something fishy about morgan in the first place but i anticipated taking him alive clancy squeezing the juice out of him its not your fault blake we did everything right the tooth thing was just unfortunate sergeant mary appeared with two glasses of champagne which they took gratefully blake toasted clancy lets hope the president agrees with you in washington the rain was even heavier when they arrived but a limousine was waiting and they were taken through at once and on their way moving along constitution avenue toward the white house in spite of the weather there was a sizable crowd of demonstrators a kind of moonscape of umbrellas against the rain shepherded by police which war are they protesting against clancy asked who knows theres some sort of war going on in nearly every country in the world these days dont ask me clancy all i know is some people seem to make a profession out of protest the chauffeur lowered the glass screen that separated him from them too difficult from the front mr johnson may i try the east entrance thats fine by me they turned up east executive avenue and stopped at the gate blake leaned out and the guard recognizing him at once waved them through the east entrance was much used by white house staff especially when wishing to avoid the media the limousine pulled up blake and clancy got out and went up the steps a young marine lieutenant was on duty and a secret service agent named huntley greeted them warmly mr johnson clancy youre looking stretched if i may say so dont ask blake said we spent most of the night stranded by fog at kennedy and the presidents expecting us you know where he is sir but ill lead the way itll give my legs some exercise the presidents secretary a pleasant woman in her midforties admitted them to the oval office where they found jake cazalet in shirtsleeves at the desk working his way through a raft of documents reading glasses perched on the end of his nose he glanced up smiled the return of the heroes have you eaten early breakfast at kennedy congealed scrambled eggs and fries at fivethirty and that was the vip lounge blake said cazalet laughed and turned to the secretary we can manage our own coffee millie but speak to the chef and find them something exotic like bacon sandwiches of course mr president she withdrew and the president said okay gentlemen lets hear the worst the worst didnt happen mr president the worst would have been morgan shooting you from the firstfloor window of gould amp co when you got out of your car outside senator harvey blacks town house to join him for dinner which invitation i canceled on your advice a week ago you said then you wished to handle this business yourself no one from the fbi no police no military even the head of the secret service was excluded which makes it puzzling that you got away with using clancy in this affair clancy intruded i was served a presidential warrant mr president so i had to do as i was told i have a stack of them in my safe blake said all signed by you really and you just fill in a name correct mr president you know how the basement works during the cold war when it appeared the communists were infiltrating at every level of government the thenpresident had invented the basement as a small operation answerable only to him since then it had been handed from one president to another it was one of his most valuable assets all other agencies were tied up in rules and regulations the legal system this was not the presidential warrant cut through the crap people thought johnson was a deskman in fact he had a file of names of exfbi and secret service men he could pull in on an ad hoc basis he could connect at any time with general charles ferguson in london who ran a similar organization for the british prime minister i can in effect kill for you blake went on i can have for example someone like morgan disposed of without a trace but only if im left alone to do things my way the war on terrorism cant be won unless were willing to fight back on our own terms fight fire with fire and where does that leave the rule of law im not sure people at al qaeda would have their own answer to that all i know is that we wont beat them by playing pattycake okay i take your point tell me about this morgan business you said you didnt want me to know too many details before tell me now it was major roper who came up with it yes i know about him the bombdisposal hero who ended up in a wheelchair and made a new career for himself in computers anything you want in cyberspace roper can find for you but his great gift is developing new programs in which millions of facts can be overviewed in seconds take your evening out with senator black the computer imaged that town house on park avenue the surrounding properties he then tapped in to every detail about the buildings what was going on there the personnel involved and so on at that moment millie came in with a tray and the bacon sandwiches they smell good enough to eat millie i might have one myself eat up gentlemen but carry on blake whats so special about what ropers up to surely our people can do that frankly not as brilliantly as he can his programs can show given nationalities religious backgrounds family anything you want and all at lightning speed it also indicates anomalies things that shouldnt be it means his computer is thinking for itself and making deductions but doing it at a speed beyond human comprehension conceptual thought by a machine quite something cazalet said anyway to cut it short the computer threw up the nationalities of the people working in the area of blacks town house which were many some of them were english and roper interested crossreferenced the identities passports birthplaces and religions and in no time at all one henry morgan whod been working as a security guard at gould amp co opposite blacks house popped up he was english but with a muslim mother really is that unusual just enough so that what roper saw next rang bells morgan was a highly qualified pharmacist with a masters degree who also taught at london university and he entered our country on a tourist visa it was clancy who put in so why does a guy like that take a job as a security guard mr president and on a forged green card something else roper discovered everything about us is on some sort of record these days the president said so general ferguson tipped you off no there was more to it than that ferguson found ropers discovery interesting enough to check it out a little on his side he sent his assistant detective superintendent hannah bernstein of special branch at scotland yard to visit morgans home address in london she discovered that the mother was in a wheelchair after a bad automobile accident that had killed the father five years ago bernstein posed as a welfare officer to gain her confidence discovered many interesting things such as the mother had been disowned by her family for marrying out of the muslim faith her son had been raised a christian after the accident however she rediscovered her faith and her son would take her to the local mosque where she was received well and the truly interesting thing was that she said her son had discovered islam himself and embraced it cazalet was looking grim so it all begins to fit especially when she said hed gone to new york on vacation has ferguson taken it any further no hes waiting to hear from us cazalet nodded so morgan obviously arrived on somebodys orders exactly an organization in the uk with some sort of contacts in new york why didnt you arrest him the minute you got the story from london i wanted to see where it would lead and charles ferguson agreed it was highly unlikely he was just a deranged loner so there was a chance he could lead us to his new york contacts only he didnt the few days he was here he didnt meet a soul i had two old fbi hands follow him when we found that the address hed given icon security was false he was staying in a small hotel they discreetly gained access to his room and found nothing no id on him no passport at his death id say theyd all been destroyed probably on orders from his handlers in london they obviously were hanging him out to dry exactly and the cyanide tooth indicates the equivalent of a suicide bombing he wasnt meant to survive cazalet said okay i know theres a lot of supposition here but i admit it makes a hell of a lot of sense it still leaves the question of the ak where did that come from it certainly wasnt in his hotel room clancy said we figure it was probably left in some locker maybe a train or bus station by his unknown contacts in new york blake put in by prearrangement hed have been given the location supplied with a key again its supposition but id say he didnt pick that bag up until he was on his way to work yes it makes sense all of it cazalet said he would have made an interesting prisoner but now hes dead which leaves us with a dead end he frowned except for ferguson and his people exactly what i was thinking mr president maybe we can find out more from the english end the mother cazalet said maybe she knows something i dont know a handicapped aging lady in a wheelchair is hardly the sort of person that al qaeda would be recruiting blake said but she and her son were welcomed warmly at the local mosque which is where we should look cazalet nodded ferguson s the man to handle it he smiled its london next stop for you blake ill speak to ferguson myself and promise him every assistance what about me mr president clancy said no way i need you to watch my back you took a bullet for me once clancy youre my goodluck charm as you wish mr president blake said id like to keep a low profile on this one ill fly over in one of our private planes with your permission and use farley field outside london ferguson s base for special operations by all means as soon as you can he hesitated when you asked me to cancel dinner with senator black you didnt tell me much and i hesitated thank god i had enough faith in you just doing my job mr president blake went and opened the door and cazalet called and blake mr president take them down whoever they are take them down you can count on it mr president and blake went out london the gulfstream came in to farley field right on time and blake thanked the crew alighted and walked across the tarmac pausing to look around him a lot of water under the bridge at this place and not just the struggles with the rashid empire a voice called hey blake over here blake turned and saw a daimler by the control tower parked close to the entrance of the operations room the man standing beside it was no more than five feet five with hair so fair it was almost white he wore an old black leather bomber jacket and jeans and a cigarette dangled from the corner of his mouth the man was sean dillon once a feared enforcer for the ira and now ferguson s right hand blake shook hands how are you my fine irish friend all the better for seeing you the right royal treatment youre getting ferguson sending the daimler they climbed in the back and the chauffeur drove away blake said so how are things pretty warm since ferguson heard from the president jesus mary and joseph blake but that was a close call you know how it is sean youve been there i remember how you saved president clinton and prime minister major on that thames riverboat years back and took a knife in the back for your trouble from norah bell the original bitch and worse than any man and it took a decent woman like hannah bernstein to shoot her dead how is hannah wonderful as usual if she didnt work for ferguson i think shed have been chief superintendent by now or even commander at scotland yard but she loves you all too much to move on blake shes still trying to reform the lot of us you know her grandfather is a rabbi its that moral perception of hers shes been shot to bits had her life shortened in any number of ways and still hangs in there trying to keep ferguson and me in check and fails in that respect it was a statement not a question dillon said blake the worlds gone to hell in a handbasket terrorism al qaeda all that stuff since nineeleven has changed everything it cant be combated by the oldfashioned rules of war it isnt like that i agree blake shrugged a few years ago id never have said that in spite of what i had to do during my time in vietnam i believed in the decencies the rule of law justice all that stuff but the people we have to deal with these days there are no rules as far as theyre concerned so there are no rules as far as im concerned ill take them down any way i can good man yourself i couldnt agree more dillon lit another cigarette i speak arabic you know that and ive spent my share of time in the middle east even worked for the plo in the old days when i was a naughty boy and i think i know the arab mind a bit most muslims in the states or the uk are decent people interested only in making a living and raising their families but theres a few of them who have a different political agenda and its dealing with them thats the problem take morgan english father muslim mother raised a christian blake said i know what happened to his parents his mother returning to the islamic faith and morgan finding that same faith himself but what turned him into the assassin who tried to take out the president well thats what youre here to find out dillon told him and ferguson hannah and roper are waiting at cavendish place to discuss it with you the embassy of the russian federation is situated in kensington palace gardens and it was typical november weather rain falling when greta novikova emerged through the main gates and paused at the edge of the pavement waiting for the traffic to pass she was a small girl unmistakably slavic with black hair to her shoulders dark intense eyes and high cheekbones and she wore an anklelength coat in soft black leather over a black armani suit she would have made heads turn anywhere she was a commercial attach√© at the embassy and had the degree to prove it but in fact at thirtyfive years old she was a major in the gru russian military intelligence she crossed the road during a break in the traffic and entered the pub opposite early lunchtime it wasnt very busy but the man she was seeking was at the far end of the bar in the window seat reading the london times he was a couple of inches short of six feet and wore a fawn raincoat over a dark wool suit his hair was closecropped and a scar ran from the bottom of his left eye to the corner of his mouth the eyes were cold and watchful and the face powerful the face of a soldier which in a way he had been a man of fortyfive who had joined the kgb at twenty and had made major when he had moved on to other things afghanistan chechnya iraq in the old days hed seen it all his name was yuri ashimov he stood up and kissed her on both cheeks and spoke to her in russian greta more lovely than usual a drink ill have a vodka with you he went to the bar ordered two brought them back sat down took out a pack of russian cigarettes and lit one so as nothing incredibly shocking has happened in new york you must have a story for me not a thing she said come on greta gru handles all things arabic and muslim there has to be something thats the point there isnt the president didnt keep his damned appointment with senator black after the function at the pierre he went straight to washington and morgan certainly went to gould amp co as usual one of our new york associates confirmed this the only unusual activity was some sort of paramedic ambulance going down into the underground parking lot it left half an hour later did our associate follow he deemed it unwise i should bloody well think so it stinks do you think they got him sounds likely but if they have they wont let on and it wont affect us anyway there were no direct contacts greta nodded i think theyd want him alive to see what he had to say on the other hand our american friends are a lot lighter on the trigger these days and he did have the cyanide tooth alive or dead they wont advertise the fact what about the mother i called yesterday as you suggested brought flowers and a basket of fruit supposedly from friends at the mosque how was she faded slightly confused as usual she told me everyone at the mosque was so kind dr selim was fantastic and she mentioned that someone from the council welfare department had visited her a woman apparently ashimov frowned why would the welfare department visit her because shes handicapped rubbish her sons well enough off why would welfare visit he shook his head i dont like it did she say if they would visit again i dont know be there greta just in case if somebody turns up i want a photo i get an instinct for things which is why youre still here my love true but something here isnt right lets try and find out what it is at cavendish place dillon and blake were admitted by kim the generals ghurka manservant and found ferguson hannah bernstein and roper in the drawing room ferguson was in his sixties a large untidy man in a crumpled suit and a guards tie hannah bernstein was in her early thirties with closecropped red hair and hornrimmed spectacles her armani trouser suit was certainly more expensive than most people could afford on police pay major roper sat in a stateoftheart electric wheelchair wearing a reefer coat hair down to his shoulders his face a taut mask of the kind of scar tissue that comes from burns the explosion that had ended his career here he is the man of the moment dillon said im sure hell give it to us in graphic detail which blake did everything that had happened in manhattan afterward blake said so there it is for the disposal system im indebted to you general were fighting a new kind of war these days although i can understand hannahs moral principles being bruised a bit bruised or not the superintendent works for this department under the official secrets act isnt that right ferguson glanced at her hannah didnt look easy but said of course sir good tell us about mrs morgan then shes sixtyfive and looks much older i managed to get hold of her hospital records and its bad the automobile accident that killed her husband almost finished her off she narrowly avoided being a paraplegic but she has money her husband owned a pharmacy which was sold after his death and there was insurance so shes wellfixed go on her family disowned her when she married a christian but now shes returned to islam as you know her son started taking her to the queen street mosque in her wheelchair it used to be a methodist chapel and he turned too apparently blake said that really interests me the idea of a highly educated man ostensibly english for thirty years of his life a university academic turning to a faith hed never accepted before in his life and then ending up in manhattan with the intention of killing the president dillon said which makes me wonder what goes on at the queen street mosque blake said some of these places are hotbeds of intrigue pump out the wrong ideas sure we finally captured saddam in iraq but how long ago was that and how many terrorist attacks have there been since ferguson said in his last message bin laden spoke of his young extremists as being soldiers of god and what concerns us is that young men from this country could be among them it makes places like the queen street mosque of special interest hannah said if youre looking for suicide bombers though it doesnt seem like the place she opened a file and passed it across dr ali selim the imam fortyfive born in london father a doctor from iraq who sent the boy to st paul s school one of our better establishments selim went to cambridge studied arabic and later took a doctorate in comparative theology blake looked at the file particularly the photo impressive i like the beard he passed the file to the others hannah said hes a member of the muslim council the mayor of londons interfaith committee and any number of government boards everyone i speak to tells me hes a wonderful man maybe hes too wonderful dillon said ive checked with the local police not a hint of trouble at the queen street mosque there was a pause and ferguson turned to roper have you any thoughts major i can only process facts opinions suppositions unless i have something to go on i cant help well ill give you something blake said and its been intriguing the hell out of me does the wrath of allah mean anything to you should it when clancy and i faced morgan in the moment before he bit on the cyanide tooth morgan said beware the wrath of allah roper frowned and shook his head it doesnt strike a chord but ill run it by my computer so the way ahead on this one appears plain ferguson said i think you superintendent should have another word with mrs morgan in your guise as a welfare worker hannah wasnt comfortable and showed it thats a difficult one sir i mean her son is dead and she doesnt even know it which cant be helped superintendent its an unusual situation i agree but when one considers the gravity of the deed morgan was trying to commit i feel that any means that will help us to reach an explanation would be justified see to it and use dillon as backup his knowledge of arabic may prove useful he turned to blake well drop roper off at his house and you and i can continue to the ministry of defence where ill show you everything we have on muslim activity in the uk suits me fine blake said ferguson turned to the others all right people theres work to be done lets get to it after leaving the pub on kensington high street greta and ashimov crossed the road to the embassy and got into a dark blue opel sedan she checked the glove compartment and found a digital camera excellent he told her you can drop me at my apartment in monk street and keep in touch on your mobile anything of significance i want to know of course she drove out into the traffic wheres belov at the moment the good josef is in geneva all those billions my love it keeps him so busy there was an edge of bitterness there come off it she said money is power and you love it andworking for josef belov is the ultimate power and you love that too to a point only to a point she turned into monk street and stopped he said sometimes i think it was better in the old days greta afghanistan chechnya iraq to smell powder again he shook his head that would be wonderful you must be raving mad she told him very probably he patted her silken knee youre a lovely girl so go and do what belov is paying you to do extract a few more facts from mrs morgan but keep your masters at the gru happy he got out of the opel and walked away heavy traffic on wapping high street held her back a little but she finally found what she was looking for chandler street backing down to the thames many cars were parked there which gave her good cover and she pulled in switched off and settled down her camera at the ready number thirteen that had amused her when shed looked at the file an old victorian terrace house she sat there looking along the street to the grocery shop on the corner opposite the river there was no one about not a soul it started to rain and then a red mini car drew up opposite and hannah bernstein and sean dillon got out hannah pressed the bell push and they waited finally they heard the sounds of movement the door was opened on a chain and mrs morgan peered out she was old faded much older than her years as hannah had indicated she had a long scarf wrapped around her head the chador worn by most muslim women the voice was almost a whisper what do you want its me mrs morgan miss bernstein from the welfare department i thought id call again oh yes this is mr dillon my supervisor may we come in just a moment the door closed while she disengaged the chain then opened again when they entered she had turned to precede them in the wheelchair all this greta novikova had captured on her camera in the small sitting room the air was heavy and close and smelled of musk a strange disturbing aroma that was somehow alien and not quite right hannah said i just thought id check on you mrs morgan as we happened to be passing dillon more direct said your son is in new york i understand mrs morgan have you heard from him her voice was muted and she coughed oh hell be too busy im sure hell phone when hes got time hannah was angry and glared at dillon he nodded and she carried on reluctantly have you seen dr selim lately oh yes at the mosque when my sons away dr selim sends a young man to wheel me along to queen street its not far hes been very good dr selim helping us so much helping me and my henry to discover our faith hannah felt wretched im sure thats been very nice for you yes hes called round two or three times since henrys been away with his friend there was a pause her breathing heavy dillon said and who was that oh i cant remember his name very strange russian i think he had a terrible scar right down from his eye to the corner of his mouth dillon said sternly in arabic have you told me everything old woman do you swear to this as allah commands she looked fearful and replied in arabic there is no more i dont know his name my son said he was a russian friend thats all i know hannah said i dont know what youre saying dillon but leave it shes frightened dillon smiled suddenly looking devastatingly charming and kissed mrs morgan on the forehead there you are my love he turned to hannah and led the way out outside she said what a bastard you are what were you saying just checking if she was telling the truth right lets go im not ready yet hannah he nodded to the corner shop at the end of the street lets have a word down there the russian gentleman with the scar interests me maybe hes been in they walked down the pavement toward the shop and behind them greta novikova turned her opel into the street and drove away the sign on the shop window said m patel dillon nodded indian thats good why particularly hannah asked because theyre smart and they dont screw around theyve got a head for business and they want to fit in so lets see what mr patel has to say and lets use your warrant card the shop was neat and orderly and obviously sold a bit of everything the indian behind the counter reading the evening standard was in shirtsleeves and looked about fifty he glanced up smiling looked them over and stopped smiling can i help hannah produced her warrant card detective superintendent bernstein special branch mr dillon is a colleague were pursuing inquiries which involve a mrs morgan who lives up the street you know her of course i do her sons away dillon said new york i understand yes she did tell me that look what is this dont fret mr patel everythings fine mrs morgan is friendly with a dr ali selim you know who he is patels face slipped yes i do and dont like him dillon smiled a hindumuslim thing well never mind sometimes when he sees mrs morgan he has a friend with him bad scar from his eye to his mouth she thinks hes russian thats right he is hes called in to buy cigarettes sometimes with the arab selim calls him yuri they were in yesterday hannah glanced up at the security camera was that working he nodded i was busy so when the tape stopped i didnt run it back i took it out and put a fresh tape in good dillon said im sure you have a television in the back room get us the tape and well run it back patel proved accommodating he closed the shop for a while and ran the tape through for them finally he stopped there they are hannah and dillon had a look so thats him dillon said the russian yes and ive remembered something else patel said one day he was on his own and his mobile rang and he said ashimov here youre sure about that hannah asked well thats how it sounded good man yourself dillon said youve helped enormously patel hesitated look is mrs morgan in trouble i mean shes not fit to be out but shes nice enough no problem hannah said were just pursuing some inquiries and i know exactly what that means with you people dillon patted him on the shoulder dont worry old son were the good guys they went out and walked toward the mini yuri ashimov hannah said interesting lets go and see what roper makes of it dillon told her at monk street greta linked her digital camera to ashimovs television and ran the photos of dillon and hannah there you are the welfare officer i assume ive no idea who the man is ashimov swore softly but i do my god greta youre onto something here what on earth do you mean last year when baron von berger of berger international was killed in that plane crash and belov took over his oil concessions and put me in charge of general security i started going over all of berger internationals previous security records did you know that berger was in a state of open warfare against a man named general charles ferguson have you heard of him of course i have greta said he runs that special intelligence outfit for the prime minister gold star for you greta ashimov pointed to the last picture on the screen thats detective superintendent hannah bernstein ferguson s assistant good god greta said ashimov flicked to dillon and this gentleman this one really is special sean dillon ferguson s strong right hand and once the provisional iras top enforcer for twenty years or more the british army and the ruc couldnt lay a hand on him and now he works for the prime minister thats unbelievable well its typically british theyll turn their hands to anything if it suits so where does this leave us with ferguson s outfit checking mrs morgan whose son was supposed to have a go at president jake cazalet in new york and has now disappeared or so it would seem would you say the appearance of dillon and bernstein at her front door was a coincidence not for a moment what do you intend to do ill alert dr ali selim naturally well take it from there ill show them the photos and belov he left this sort of thing in my hands but i keep him informed he smiled hes not involved greta my love you must understand hes too important as regards operations at what you might call the coal face im in charge he smiled and kissed her on the cheek trust me soon after he was standing by an old jetty around the corner from the queen street mosque overlooking the river he leaned on a rail smoking a cigarette enjoying the landscape the views the boats passing selim appeared after a while a handsome bearded man wearing a burberry raincoat an umbrella guarding him from the rain yuri my friend he smiled you said it was urgent why not call at my office at the mosque not again ashimov told him ive got news for you our friend morgans trip to new york would seem to have disappeared into a black hole how unfortunate selim said calmly listen ashimov went through everything afterward selim said we cant be certain he met a bad end thats supposition surely ali my friend if ferguson s lot are involved particularly this dillon then the end is as certain as the coffin lid closing you consider the man exceptional it would seem and for good reason hes a man of many skills an experienced pilot for instance and linguist russian and arabic for example ill remember that besides his years with the ira he worked for the plo as a mercenary and for the israelis in lebanon in the old days ashimov lit a cigarette he kills at the drop of a hat this one oh in a dark street on a rainy night im sure hes as susceptible to a knife under the ribs as anyone my dear ali ashimov smiled if you believe that youll be making the worst mistake of your life selim said so what about mrs morgan if theyre sniffing around there she could be saying the wrong things i dont know shes an aging cripple in a wheelchair she cant speak in much more than a whisper and what could she tell him that shes a woman who returned to islam after her husbands death whose son also discovered the faith and lightened her grief wouldnt you as her imam agree with all this of course exactly and you are a man of impeccable background and highly respected whatever has happened to the son has no connection with you youre too important ali thats why we keep you out of it you even sat on a committee at the house of commons last week nothing could be more respectable no my friend youre a real asset and too valuable to lose selim said and loose ends are loose ends if mrs morgan should happen to mention you and me in the same breath theyll discover who you are the man who is belovs security ashimov sighed all right leave it to me now we better split up ill be in touch selim hesitated morgan was a soldier of god if worse has come to the worst he is also a true martyr save that tripe for the young fools at the mosque your wrath of allah fanatics go on get going selim went and ashimov stayed there thinking about it perhaps selim had a point after all why would bernstein and dillon be calling on the old lady at all better to be safe than sorry he looked over at the incoming tide then pulled up his collar against the rain walked around to chandler street and rang the bell at number thirteen she answered it after a while and peered out over the chain its me mr ashimov he said dr selims friend he asked me to call and see if you wanted to go to the mosque that is kind she said i was going to go a little later since im here why dont you go now its much easier if i push you he said bring an umbrella its raining she closed the door undid the chain and opened it again and ashimov stepped in let me help you he reached for a raincoat and a beret hanging on a hall stand and helped her there you are and heres an umbrella he took one down and gave it to her so kind she said not at all have you got your key yes you had a visit this afternoon i believe a lady from the welfare department did i she frowned i cant remember yes with a gentleman what did they ask you about your son in new york she was confused and bewildered few things seemed real to her anymore and her memory was fading fast these days i cant remember i cant remember anyone calling which was true for she was in the early stages of alzheimers it was obvious to ashimov that he was wasting his time never mind lets be on our way then the rain was driving down no one around as they went along the street the fog drifting up from the river they went past the shop which now showed a closed sign inside the door its going to be a dirty night later he said i think youre right but still a nice view of the thames he turned in at the old wooden jetty the wheels of her chair trembling over the warped wooden boarding there you are he paused at the top of the steps going down to the river i like it at night with the lights on the boats her voice was like a small wind through the trees on a dark evening as he looked at the river high with water lapping at the bottom of the steps then he shoved the chair forward strangely enough she didnt call out but gripped the arms of her chair tightly and when she hit the water she went under instantly as the chair emptied her out it was only four or five feet deep a mud bank when the tide was out someone would find her soon enough hed done her a favor really he lit a cigarette and walked away a few minutes later standing in a doorway he phoned ali selim you can relax mrs morgan has met with an unfortunate accident what are you talking about ashimov told him selim sounded horrified was that necessary come on selim you were the one talking about loose ends now dont forget if the police inquire you were unhappy about her habit of going to the mosque alone in her wheelchair which is why you often sent young men to fetch her selim took a deep breath of course she was prematurely aging confused a great deal of the time she had alzheimers well there you are ill leave it with you and ashimov hung up it was at ten the following morning that patel exercising his small terrier found the body and the wheelchair on the beach he called the wapping police and since hannah had put a tracer on mrs morgan she was notified at once at the ministry of defence ferguson was in a defence committee meeting but dillon was in the office and she quickly filled him in so what do we do he demanded get down to chandler street fast and ill put a red flag on the case and take command you come with me you might be useful they used a department limousine with a civilian driver retired police hannah said its one hell of a coincidence and you know how much i believe in those just then dillons mobile rang sean its roper ive got something interesting for you on ashimov and also on the wrath of allah thing hold on to it for just a bit mrs morgans turned up on a mudflat at the end of her street and hannah and i are on our way were just about there ill call you later they took a turn and then there they were there was a police paramedics ambulance the usual team and a sergeant in charge who jumped to attention when hannah showed him her warrant card and assumed command not much of a scene of crime maam he said plenty of mud she and dillon looked over the rail its obvious what happened the gent who found her said she was always pushing herself in her wheelchair up and down the street to the queen street mosque come off the pavement twice before in the past and ended up in the gutter hannah said right get her up out of there and deliver her to peel street morgue im going to call in professor george langley hell handle it she walked away with her mobile and stood in a doorway dillon saw patel lurking outside his shop and went over this must have been a shock for you a terrible shock it was a higher tide than usual last night its amazing she wasnt swept away are you surprised by what happened not really shed had a few close calls in that wheelchair and she was worse these days what do you mean worse couldnt handle herself confused no memory worth speaking of she didnt know which way she was pointing she was very upset when henry went off to the states patel hesitated what was it all about before you and the superintendent and those inquiries dillon lied glibly her son was only on a special tourist visa but seems to have gone missing and we had a request to check it out a lot of people do that go as tourists and fade into the landscape a lot of people do that here too patel said the way of the world dillon went over to hannah as she finished her call what next ive spoken to langley and hes going straight to the morgue a couple of paramedics carried mrs morgan past them in a body bag poor old lady hannah said and nothing we can do but speaking of doing things roper seems to have come up with some stuff about ashimov and the wrath of allah thing good ill speak to the general which she did briefly and turned to dillon he suggests we all meet up at ropers apartment get filled in together sounds good to me he shook his head i accept everything patel says about mrs morgan and her wheelchair about her incompetence and so on her minor accidents but it doesnt explain what she was doing on the jetty in the first place exactly what i was thinking ropers apartment was on the ground floor with a ramp entrance to facilitate his wheelchair the entire place was designed for not only a handicapped person but one determined to look after himself his equipment was stateoftheart some of it top secret and supplied by ferguson dillon and hannah had been with him for perhaps ten minutes when ferguson arrived and joined them so where are we he asked hannah with mrs morgan i mean ive pulled in professor langley sir hes working on her now he wont find much not in my opinion dillon told ferguson all patel had said so there you are its highly suspicious but i doubt we can prove its any more than an accident ferguson looked gloomy one things certain we cant throw the fact that henry morgan is dead into the pot because were not supposed to know so where does that leave us with yuri ashimov for one thing roper said formerly the pride of the kgb he punched his computer keys and ashimovs photo emerged one or two in uniform others in a more social situation whats he up to now head of security for josef belov and his outfit the oil billionaire dillon asked thats the man roper said man of mystery thats his front a billionaire many times over and friend of putin so what on earth would ashimov be doing around mrs morgan it must have been something to do with the son hannah said has to be and the interesting question is who sent henry morgan to new york with the intention of shooting the president dillon turned to hannah you said dr ali selim was clean as a whistle it was roper who broke in he is as far as my researches show then why is he involved with a man like ashimov whats the purpose dillon shook his head there has to be a reason he turned to roper what did you find out about the wrath of allah it was an arab militant group some years ago during the civil war in lebanon with the end of that war it seemed to disappear from view last year the israeli mossad tried to establish if it was an offshoot of al qaeda but got nowhere well it meant something to henry morgan ferguson said it may have disappeared but that doesnt mean it doesnt exist one of our greatest security problems is the way a few terrorists can hide themselves in the mass of an ordinary decent muslim population how can you tell the difference mao tsetung invented that strategy years ago and it eventually won him china dillon pointed out ive got something else for you recently pulled out of my printer roper handed three photos across greta novikova supposed to be a secretary at the russian embassy but in reality a major in the gru used to be ashimovs girlfriend neat coincidence her being assigned to london isnt it quite a lady dillon said admiringly he slipped a copy into his breast pocket maybe ill run into her hannahs mobile went she answered and listened fine well be there she turned to ferguson professor langley sir he can give us a preliminary excellent ferguson said you hang in there major ill keep you informed they filed into ferguson s daimler and as it moved away greta novikova eased out in her opel and went after them george langley was a small grayhaired energetic man whom they had all met in the pursuance of previous cases many people considered him the greatest forensic pathologist in london and not much escaped him the peel street morgue was an old building some of it victorian but the interior was modern enough a receptionist led them into a whitetiled room with fluorescent lighting and modern steel operating tables mrs morgan lay on one of them the wounds from her examination had been stitched up my god i never get used to this part hannah said softly langley came in from the preparation room in shirtsleeves drying his hands on a towel ah there you are charles good of you to be so quick off the mark george what have you got for me death by drowning no suggestion of foul play strangely enough no bruising on the other hand she was as light as a feather very undernourished her previous medical history isnt good the car accident which reduced her to the wheelchair was very grave ive checked the records ive also checked with her gp and she was being treated for alzheimers so thats it id say so its interesting that the man who found her patel speaks of these minor accidents she suffered in the wheelchair i notice a report by the sceneofcrime sergeant who went to see the imam at queen street sounded most distressed said hed implored her many times not to venture out alone and usually sent someone to escort her which still leaves us wondering what she was doing at the end of the jetty dillon said ive had a quick look nothing out of the ordinary the alzheimers would make her subject to confusion memory loss considerable general stress if she turned right shed turn the corner for the queen street mosque if she turned left shed find herself on the jetty and only a few yards to the steps he didnt even frown when he said are you looking for suspicious circumstances here charles you usually are no no its an unrelated matter unrelated huh which brings you hotfoot plus the superintendent and dillon highly unlikely id have thought however i cant help you with this one and ive other things to do ill be on my way they left and walked to the daimler ferguson paused frowning and said to dillon whats that you usually say about making it a weknowthattheyknowandtheyknowthatweknow situation id say you mean you want dr ali selim pushed a little exactly ill leave it to you blakes at the american embassy at the moment well all catch up later dont you think i should provide a police presence for selim sir hannah asked no some things require the dillon touch superintendent they got in and drove away dillon said youve noticed the opel sedan trailing us absolutely dont forget to find out who it is ferguson dropped him off hannah was not pleased and dillon leaned down to her through the open window keep the faith love well you keep your fists in your pockets the rain increased and dillon glanced at the opel and decided to leave it alone he went inside the mosque and followed a sign that said office in the opel greta novikova called ashimov on his mobile they were all at this major ropers place in regency square ferguson bernstein and dillon theyve now dropped dillon at queen street why i should imagine because mrs morgan has met an untimely accident and mr dillon is about to speak to selim about it what do you mean accident her wheelchair appears to have deposited her in the thames these things happen stay there and follow dillon when he comes out dillon found the office knocked and walked in there was no one at reception so he tried the next door and found his quarry working at a desk dr ali selim selim recognized him at once from a computer photo ashimov had left him he managed a smile can i help dillon decided to let it all hang out oh i think so me ould son he lit a cigarette not in here it is an affront selim told him i know a terrible vice but we all have them i can see you know who i am your face twitched but then a guy like ashimov would be right on the ball about me and my friends we have a video of the two of you by the way that would go down big at the house of commons dont you think and i notice his girlfriend greta novikova is outside i dont know what youre talking about well in broad terms you do and i could fill in the rest for you henry morgan walks up a manhattan street in the rain and disappears into oblivion his mother goes off the jetty in chandler street and into the thames a very unfortunate family selims face turned pale get out of here ill call the police oh i dont think you will not with ashimov on your back dillon dropped his cigarette in a halffilled cup of coffee by selims right hand say your prayers son youre going to need them oh and good luck with the wrath of allah it was a long shot but the shock on selims face was obvious dillon went out and paused on the pavement looking across greta novikova was taking a photo and she was badly caught out when he crossed the street quickly opened the passenger door and got in now look here she started to say oh cut it out girl dear i know who you are and you know who i am he produced a packet of marlboros and took two out i bet you smoke too most russians do bastard she said but she almost looked amused he lit the cigarettes and passed her one lets go go where to exactly my place in stable mews dont pretend you dont know where that is she drove away half smiling i bet selim was messing himself in there something like that i told him we know about ashimov and you and who knows perhaps ashimovs boss the mysterious josef belov youre playing with fire dillon she said id be very careful oh i always am she paused at the end of stable mews can i go now of course unless youd like to have dinner with me the great sean dillon with a romantic side i doubt it besides youve chosen a bad night i have a function at the dorchester ballroom this evening on behalf of the russian embassy dillon got out and leaned in oh im sure i could gain admission she drove back to the embassy turning over this strange man in her mind and phoned ashimov to tell him what had happened ive got a crazy idea he could turn up tonight so hes challenging us is he well well challenge back ill go with you pick me up at seven after she hung up she went into her computer into her secret gru files accessed dillon and was breathless at what she discovered this was the man whod been responsible for the mortar bomb attack on downing street in ninetyone a feared enforcer for the ira for years a killer many times over once an actor at the national theatre she read fascinated i put the fear of god into selim dillon told ferguson on the phone i thought you would whats your verdict well the obvious thing is that he didnt deny any of it morgan ashimov the novikova woman the lot well he wouldnt would he by the way blakes been in touch hes taken all that stuff i gave him on the muslim situation in the uk and gone straight back to washington what a shame id hoped to take him to the dorchester tonight the russian embassys got a function on in the ballroom get me a security pass charles novikovas going to be there perhaps ashimov will be with her id like to run with it only if you run with me you rogue well go together cocktails at seven charles not black tie the embassys trying to make friends and influence people and i understand that there might be a surprise guest or two are you referring to the fact that when president putin finished at the european unions paris conference this morning he decided to divert his plane to raf northolt for a chat with the prime minister this afternoon and that hes not due to depart until late tonight and how would you be knowing that because ive been notified of his flight plan out of northolt to moscow its what they pay me for dear boy so ill meet you there and the superintendent too i think dress things up a little and do me a favor yours to command wear one of your better suits we mustnt let the side down this should be interesting i knew putin rather well in the bad old days you know when he was a colonel in the kgb i bet you exchanged shots across the berlin wall something like that meet us at the dorchester as you say at seven wouldnt miss it in the ballroom at the dorchester the great and the good mingled with politicians and civil servants and waiters passed through the crowd with trays loaded with vodka and the finest champagne as the russian embassy did its best to impress yuri ashimov and greta stood by a pillar drinking iced vodka itll be a hell of a shock for these people when putin appears with the prime minister greta said itll be an even bigger one for you when belov appears belov she was bewildered but why because putin wanted him out of all the oil magnates josef my love is the one the president trusts they go back a long way he reached for another vodka as a waiter passed i spoke to him a couple of hours ago brought him up to speed on the henry morgan affair does putin know about that of course not there are limits josef was philosophical about it but he wasnt happy about ferguson and his friends what do we do if dillon turns up i hope he does i have a friend named harker charlie harker a crook of the first water dabbles in everything from protection to drugs to women such people have their uses whats he going to do i mentioned dillon and gave him a photo harker has arranged for two or three of his men to shall we say pay special attention to him if he does show up greta said ive checked on dillon yuri hes hell on wheels well so am i my love but it isnt you wholl be doing it thats what worries me well well just have to see what happens because there he is at the same moment a voice echoed over a microphone as the russian ambassador called for attention my lords ladies and gentlemen i had intended a few words at this moment but someone far more important has arrived and with a very special guest he gestured and through the side door president putin appeared the british prime minister at his side the crowd broke into spontaneous applause the two men stopped for a moment acknowledging the crowd then moved on pausing to shake hands here and there they were followed by several men obviously security but not all the man on the left ferguson said black suit steelrimmed glasses cropped hair josef belov now whats he up to belov looked to be around sixty his face very calm giving nothing away putin paused for a moment and listened as belov whispered the man standing over there with the woman and the small man with very fair hair his name is ferguson he runs the prime ministers private intelligence outfit i know very well who he is were old adversaries from the cold war what is he to you no friend josef putin said i dont know what you get up to these days and i dont want to know you are useful to the state your billions and your importance to the oil industry from iraq to southern arabia speaks for itself however no one is indispensable so id advise you to be discreet of course mr president belov faded away and putin moved on the crowd parting he reached ferguson and smiled its good to meet old friends general ferguson now i like that you at last outrank me i believe so colonel putin smiled and held out his hand which ferguson took im glad you remembered that we swapped shots putin shrugged a long time ago yes sir putin turned to walk away then paused and turned back his face enigmatic and charles sir id take care if i were you great care oh i will sir you may depend on it putin moved on hannah said what was all that about sir it was as if he was warning you yes superintendent i do believe he was now wheres belov gone over by the bar with ashimov and greta novikova dillon pointed out well lets join them ferguson smiled could be interesting theyre coming ashimov said perhaps youd better go why on earth should i belov said this champagne is so good id like another glass dont lets pretend with them i doubt if they will he turned and smiled general ferguson a longoverdue pleasure oh i doubt that ferguson said i think you know who my friends are i certainly know yours he nodded to greta a pleasure major took her hand and kissed it mind you the gru always had style he turned to ashimov unlike the kgb ashimov didnt react and it was belov who said which would include me general there is an english phrase about people in glass houses throwing stones isnt there especially when you have a man like mr dillon at your side although you superintendent are a credit to scotland yard he emptied his glass toasting her shall we all have another an excellent idea ferguson said i see we have no secrets especially about you dillon said and especially about henry morgan in manhattan and his mothers unfortunate accident a waiter passed and they all took glasses of champagne from his tray the only thing that confuses me is what one of the richest men in the world would be doing with a bruiser like ashimov here and a loser like ali selim ah you dont understand the bigger picture dillon ferguson said money isnt everything youre a good case in point youre rich but but he likes to play the game belov said exactly being wealthy is like having everything and nothing at the same time and a man needs more i remember interrogating a man named luhzkov years ago he lectured in economics at london university a deepcover agent for the kgb he often spoke with sincere admiration of a colonel belov who headed department three of the kgb belovs main task was to create chaos in the western world chaos fear and uncertainty until the cracks showed and governments toppled belov seemed to stay very calm though his lips tightened as did his grip on the champagne glass and it was dillon who said just as in iraq he shook his head all those wonderful oil fields up for grabs and since saddam ended up in a cell who knows where theyll end up belov put his glass on the bar ive heard enough stupidity for one evening well be moving on he nodded to ashimov and greta and walked away moving out through the entrance and pausing ashimov waved for the limousine im sorry josef then do something about it i have hugely important matters in hand our future in iraq and southern arabia are on the line where ferguson and his people are concerned i give you a free hand ive something special lined up for dillon tonight good just get on with it ashimov held the door open for him belov got in and put the window down ill be at the rashid house on south audley street for the next three days then im flying to the castle and then iraq no moscow ive got to keep the president on our side the limousine drove away and greta said the castle drumore place its in county louth in the irish republic his latest acquisition a couple of hundred acres and whatever you want a castle to be thats what it is one advantage for him is that the area is a hotbed of irish nationalism in that area the ira has no idea that the war is over especially the local commander one dermot kelly isnt that a problem for josef with all his wealth for a man with no love of the british the locals have embraced him like one of their own he goes back a long way with kelly and you do they embrace you as well of course my natural charm she smiled now what ill give you a nice dinner and dillon oh hell be well taken care of he waved for a passing taxi at the bar at the dorchester ballroom they were finishing the champagne hannah said you were a bit heavy sir oh i intended to be luhzkov hung himself now we all know where we are which is how i prefer it you ould devil what youre looking for is a reaction dillon said something like that i spoke to roper earlier told him to compute a report on belov everything there is i expect you two to read it thoroughly of course sir hannah said good on our way then they paused at the cloakroom to get coats and it had started to rain slightly when they went out on the pavement and the daimler coasted in ill drop you off ferguson said not me if you dont mind dillon told him i feel like the walk in the rain dear boy ferguson opened the door for hannah youll have to excuse him superintendent its an irish thing the rain sure and your sainted mother being a cork woman would have agreed with you take care you rogue and stay out of trouble always do general dillon watched the daimler drive off then walked away his collar up against the rain he went across the entrance of the hotel and made his way down through mayfair in the general direction of shepherds market that he was being followed had been obvious since leaving the ballroom two men one in a reefer coat and knitted cap the other in an anorak and baseball cap stupid really and theyd stuck out like a sore thumb among the kind of people leaving the dorchester just before reaching shepherds market he paused on a corner to light a cigarette then turned into a narrow side street of old town houses fronted by victorian spiked railings with steps leading down to basement areas he quickened his pace then dashed down a flight of steps and waited in the darkness there was a sound of running steps a voice said wheres he gone for christs sake dillon came up the steps and stood behind them hands in the pockets of his raincoat so there you are lads he said i was beginning to give up on you why you little squirt the man in the reefer coat turned to his friend leave this to me he took a length of lead pipe from one pocket dillon said very oldfashioned is that so the man made a sudden rush arm raised to strike down dillon swayed to one side stamped against the side of one of the mans knees so that he lurched past him head down and dillon put a foot to his backside and sent him headfirst down the steps to the basement the man in the baseball cap took a knife from his pocket and sprang the blade you little bastard ill show you well lets be having you then the knife swung dillon caught hold of the wrist turned it and the arm like a steel bar then ran him headfirst into the railings the man slumped to the pavement his nose broken blood on his mouth dillon crouched beside him now then who sent you get stuffed the man moaned youve got balls ill give you that dillon was carrying a walther ppk in his waistband at the rear under his jacket and now he produced it but ive got this and where i come from we find a bullet through the kneecap cures most ills a crippling experience mind you okay the man put a hand up it was charlie harker put us on your case gave us a grand to cripple you harker and who would he be he runs everything on the river from here down to the isle of dogs really dillon reached inside the mans anorak found a wad of notes and took them out a thousand quid from this charlie harker he shook his head it gives me more pleasure to leave it with you than to take it screw you the man said i said you have balls not many brains though now if i were you id call an ambulance he walked away and stood on the corner thinking about it charlie harker who ran everything on the river down to the isle of dogs the name didnt mean a thing to dillon on the other hand he knew someone to whom it very probably did he flagged down a passing cab told the driver to take him to wapping high street and got in he was thinking of harry salter once one of the most feared men in london a very oldfashioned gangster now a multimillionaire from the warehouse developments hed built on the side of the thames the relationship between harry his nephew billy and dillon and ferguson had become close tested in the fire on a number of occasions if anyone knew about harker it would be harry salter at the same moment charlie harker was in a pub called the red lion in kilburn in london sitting reading the evening standard and enjoying a pint most people stayed well clear of him well aware that it was best for their health a large heavily built man in a dark suit leaned against the wall behind him his name was mosby and he was harkers minder harkers mobile went he answered it and found ali selim on the other end mr harker i must see you what for the latest consignment to iraq ill have to delay it for a while you cant do that its all arranged leaving tomorrow night its not convenient i dont care the deal is five grand a head so five heads makes it twentyfive like we agreed old son and twentyfive is what i expect whether its on or its off does ashimov know about this look be reasonable ill come and see you if you like where are you the red lion but dont come without the cash im beginning to worry about you and that would never do selim put the phone down and sat thinking about it it was the thing he hated most having to deal with people like harker but what could he do it was essential to keep the traffic on the move to iraq on a regular basis now more than ever at least there was the money from ashimov to keep it going he found a canvas bag and opened the safe in the corner of the office there was money in there a great deal of money stacked neatly in bundles of fiftypound notes he counted out the required amount put it in the bag and got his hat and a raincoat he was worried running scared he believed in what he was doing his cause was just and he believed in allah above everything but all of a sudden things seemed to have gotten out of hand the morgan thing had looked so promising so absurdly simple with ashimovs support and not only had it failed it had brought ferguson and his people into the equation and this dillon he shuddered a truly frightening man and then this business of mrs morgans socalled accident it was a terrible business and yet his own motives in all this had been so pure there was a knock on the door and the caretaker abdul looked in can i get you anything doctor no ive got to go out for a while ill see you later he went out to the yard outside found his peugeot and drove away dillons cab turned from wapping high street and moved along a narrow lane between warehouse developments finally stopping outside salters pub the dark man its painted sign showing a sinister individual in a black coat the bar was reasonably busy without being crowded a fine old london pub bright and cheerful with victorian gilt mirrors behind the mahogany bar bottles ranged against them dora the chief barmaid sat on a stool behind the bar smoking a cigarette why mr dillon havent seen you for a while theyre in the corner booth which they were harry his nephew billy at twentynine a hard and ruthless young man who had killed a number of times although usually on the side of right and joe baxter and sam hall salters minders they were playing cards and salter glanced up and smiled genuine pleasure on his face why dillon its good to see you its been too long you and ferguson been up to your usual shenanigans i assume something like that dillon called to dora a large bushmills over here love billy had stopped smiling and there was a slight frown on his face trouble dillon how did you guess because it follows you around and ive come to recognize the signs dora arrived with the whiskey and dillon tossed it back does charlie harker mean anything to you harry salters face turned to stone that scumbag i dont mind cigarette runs or illegal immigrants from amsterdam but young girls on the game porn drugs thats filth billy said what is he to you dillon told them afterward harry shook his head we cant have that charlie getting ideas above his station its not so much harker as who put him up to it that im interested in dillon said harry turned to billy what do you think friday night that means the red lion in kilburn he uses the snug like an office the punters turn up to pay him protection money well lets pay him a call it could enliven the evening ali selim managed to park quite close to the red lion but on the other side of the road he was about to get out when a large mercedes pulled up and the salters got out he was aware of dillon first and he recognized harry and billy salter from photos hed been shown he stayed head down until theyd gone up the alley at the side of the pub only then did he get out of the peugeot and cross to the other side he darted into the shadows of an entrance at the end of the alley and watched as the salters and dillon went into the side entrance of the pub leaving baxter and hall to guard the door this was bad very bad he knew that and waited his mouth dry inside the red lion a man was at the door of the snug and he turned his mouth gaping when he saw salter who smiled genially why jacko you look even uglier than usual he grabbed him by the tie swung him around and billy punched him very hard under the breastbone and headbutted him jacko went down and billy opened the door for his uncle harker was sitting at a table counting wads of cash mosby leaning over beside him they both looked up startled why harry whats going on harker demanded you may well ask particularly since a couple of arseholes claiming to be working for you just had a go at dillon here down by shepherds market and i cant be having that because hes a friend of mine i dont know what youre talking about oh dear so were going to have to do it the hard way are we mosby slipped a hand inside his coat and dillon produced the walther dont be stupid salter said put whatever youve got in there on the table and get out unless youd like dillon to leave your brains on the wall mosby didnt even hesitate he took a smith amp wesson from his pocket laid it down and cleared off now look harker said i dont know whats going on here but salter slapped him across the face bring him along billy and mind the garbage on the way out he stood outside as billy shoved harker out and baxter and hall grabbed him well go down to my place at wapping ive got a nice old riverboat there the lynda jones but then you know that nice night to go on the river look harry what do you want to know what you were playing at with my friend mr dillon who put you up to it no way harker didnt sound afraid leave it harry youve no idea what youre getting into the people im involved with could swallow you whole thatd be a new sensation for me salter was completely unconcerned if i were you id think about it charlie now lets go standing in the doorway in the alley ali selim had heard everything and it was enough he made for the peugeot and drove away quickly reaching the mosque twenty minutes later the first thing he did was call heathrow airport and book a firstclass ticket on a plane to kuwait that was leaving in two hours he tossed a few things into a suitcase together with the cash hed taken for harker plus his passport and was ready to go he hesitated then picked up the telephone and called ashimov who was sitting in an italian restaurant with greta its me ali weve got problems tell me selim did ferguson and his people are getting too close and if harker spills the beans about what hes been doing for us it would seriously compromise wrath of allah dont panic ill handle it just keep cool all right greta novikova said trouble ashimov called for his bill and told her quickly she was worried can you handle this you shouldnt need to ask well take a taxi to my place where well get my car and suitable weaponry you can chauffeur me he smiled a terrible smile theyre only gangsters my love i handled them in moscow ill handle them now ali selim of course would not have agreed with him he rang the bell for abdul the caretaker and met him on his way out to the car somethings come up im needed in iraq im not sure for how long but ill be in touch as you say doctor abdul never questioned the imams comings and goings selim got into the peugeot and drove away the baghdad airport as happened so frequently was closed to aviation traffic which was why he was headed to kuwait hed drive the rest of the way it was surprising how cheerful he felt the closer he got to heathrow and away from queen street the lynda jones was moored at the other end of the wharf from the dark man more than fifty years old it had been lovingly restored and it was the joy of harrys life it took him back to his childhood days as a river rat he sat there now with billy at a table under an awning and baxter and hall held harker between them dillon stood by the stern railing light spilling out into the darkness the occasional boat passing all lit up the whole place had a rather melancholy air to it although for the life of him he couldnt think why he shivered slightly and lit a cigarette harry said okay charlie dont waste my time who told you to stick those two hoods on dillon harker tried to struggle and baxter and hall held him firmly billy leaned forward and slapped his face harker said wildly ive told you harry you dont know what youre getting into this is bigtime stuff believe me and who are we the little people fuck this for a game of soldiers salter nodded to billy try the hoist and put him over baxter and hall put the struggling harker down and billy pulled on the stern hoist took the hemp rope suspended from it and looped it around harkers ankles baxter and hall heaved until harker was clear of the side then swung him over and dropped him headfirst into the river he hung there for a while struggling weakened then stopped have him up harry told them baxter and hall pulled harker out then swung him over the rail he lay on the deck retching up river water had enough billy demanded youve signed your own death warrants harker said weakly were wasting our bleeding time here salter said over with him again no for gods sake ill tell you they untied him and sat him on a chair give him a fag salter said which billy did dillon cut in so who told you to put those guys onto me a russian called ashimov he runs security for that oil billionaire belov ashimov has links with dr ali selim at the queen street mosque they recruit englishborn muslims for some outfit called the wrath of allah to arrange an underground route for them to iraq or syria they use one of my boats to amsterdam then go on to kuwait on false passports you bloody bastard salter said what do you do when they come back and set bombs off in london before harker could reply there came a single shot it took harker over the rail into the water ashimov grabbed gretas sleeve come on move it and they hurried away through the shadows leaving the volvo close to the dark man he and greta had watched from the shadows and heard something of what was being said without hesitating ashimov had pulled out a beretta taken careful aim and fired he seldom missed on the lynda jones the four of them crouched waiting and billy reached to flick off the light switch a moment later they heard a car start up and move away well thats it whoever it was salter said a pound to a penny it was ashimov dillon said billy switched on the deck lights again and they peered over no sign of harker dillon said billy shrugged there wont be the tides going out well at least we know where we stand dillon said so if you gents will excuse me ill go and have words with ali selim ill keep you posted no you wont billy said ill take you in the range rover in his quarters at the mosque abdul was cooking a late supper when the doorbell sounded he went to open it and found dillon standing there who pushed him back and stepped in get me selim but he isnt here he left a couple of hours ago left wheres he gone abdul was sensible enough to be frightened iraq he said something had come up that he was needed is that so and when is he due back he wasnt sure he he said hed be in touch dillon snorted i wouldnt count on it dillon returned to the range rover and when billy asked everything okay told him what had happened id say hes done a runner billy said once you started sniffing around that would be enough whats next ill call ferguson when he did ferguson said the waters really are getting muddied arent they ill speak to roper meet me at his place dillon turned to billy regency square the majors place things are starting to get interesting quite like old times and he drove away it was shortly afterward that abdul again answered the doorbell at the mosque and found ashimov who pushed past him greta following abdul was by now extremely agitated hes not here doctor selim has gone away what in the hell do you mean gone away to iraq ashimov was thunderstruck when did this happen two hours or so ago tell me exactly what he said abdul did and added there was someone else looking for him a small man with very fair hair he was very frightening i bet he was ashimov said grimly and turned to greta lets get moving they got into his volvo where to now she said back to my place well check it out he cant be going to baghdad there are no commercial flights at the moment so it has to be kuwait then what well go after him i cant go myself belov wants me at his place in northern ireland but you can use our gru contacts theyll get you into the baghdad airport use belovs name if you need to ill arrange some muscle for you she took a deep breath are you sure smell powder again greta youll enjoy it all right ill do it just be careful if i were ferguson i wouldnt let it go this thing hell send somebody dillon seems the most likely he speaks good arabic and russian has lots of middle east experience ill confirm it for you to hell with him ill still do it good girl he was smiling as they passed buckingham palace but dont stay at the embassy the al bustan is much more fun ferguson dillon and billy stood beside ropers bank of computers the majors fingers danced over the keys for a while and he sat back definite confirmation there was a slight delay but the jumbo took off an hour ago selim has seat threea in the firstclass cabin nice i can also tell you thats his fourth time to kuwait in the last ten months what else ferguson demanded i can give you the name of the rentalcar firm he uses its always the same one and he stays at the al bustan hotel in baghdad a good hotel though somewhat damaged by the war a favorite with correspondents family dillon added yes there are still relatives in a village called ramalla about forty clicks north of baghdad his greatuncle lives there on a small farm by the tigris ive pulled a map of the location from the computer nicely detailed any more information on wrath of allah im still trawling we can always try sharif of course and who would he be dillon asked a major in the republican guard during saddams day intelligence hes worked for me for a while now very expensive but worth it ill give you his photo and details why not the americans hes not keen on them lost his wife and daughter in the bombing during the war hell be of considerable value to you when you get there so im going its essential dear boy that you find selim and haul him back said ferguson we know a great deal about him but theres a lot more we need to know particularly about his dealings with ashimov and belov so you dont want me to kill him youre always so basic no not if it can be helped our russian friends will have a different point of view but never mind that the superintendent is arranging your papers now youll be pleased to know youre a correspondent for the belfast telegraph you do analysis think pieces not instant news your northern irish accent will suit the role admirably the superintendent has alerted lacey and parry well use the citation xl as its raf it can land at baghdad even though commercial planes are grounded at that moment the door buzzer sounded and roper pressed the release hannah bernstein came in everything pushing ahead ferguson asked i think so sir theyre working on dillons papers now the plane will be ready for morning departure and ive spoken to sharif hes arranging for you to stay at the al bustan which should be perfectly satisfactory i dont think so billy said ferguson frowned and why not because you shouldnt be the one going if dillon is to pass without suspicion as a newspaper reporter he needs a photographer with him i mean what he really needs is someone to watch his back but it would be convenient in this case if that someone could also pass himself off as a photographer and you could after kate rashid and company shot the hell out of me in hazar i had to forget my favorite hobby diving and so i took up photography did a course at the london college of printing and you think you know your stuff first of all id need two cameras if not three im sure you saw the photographers during the war draped in the damn things as for lenses a wideangle zoom and a long zoom nikon i think though i wouldnt bother with digital because that would mean id need a laptop now as far spare me for gods sake ferguson turned to hannah process his papers superintendent he nodded to dillon is that all right with you absolutely good since youre going in with the raf there wont be any problem over weapons he said to roper have you got the belov report ready right here roper pushed five copies over excellent ferguson picked one up and gave it to dillon gives you something to read on the plane i look forward to it you take one too superintendent and you young salter youd better get home and break the good news to harry now we all have a great deal to do i suggest we get a move on raf northolt on the edge of london catered not only to the royal family and the prime minister and other politicians but was a great favorite with executive jets so it was there the following morning that ashimov delivered greta novikova to a waiting falcon the two pilots were british named kelso and brown but the stewardess was russian and introduced herself as tania ashimov kissed greta on both cheeks safe journey ill have someone introduce himself at the hotel you can take it from there just one question yuri do i kill him whatever you think best my dear though it does rather seem like hes served his purpose doesnt it he smiled now off you go later watching the falcon rise he smiled slightly to himself what a woman what a marvelous bloody woman and then he turned and walked to his waiting limousine at farley field the small raf installation used by ferguson s people for covert operations dillon hannah and ferguson arrived in the daimler and were met by squadron leader lacey and flight lieutenant parry standing beside a citation xl both men wore flying overalls with rank tabs and the plane had raf roundels good to see you sean lacey said will it be messy well you know me it usually is he gave parry his traveling bag to take on board and lacey said the quartermasters left a bag for you inside he said youd find everything you need excellent ferguson said i do admire efficiency at that moment an aston martin came around the corner of the terminal building and harry and billy got out and approached harry carrying his nephews bag youve done it again you little irish sod said harry to dillon i mean weve had bad times before but going to baghdad thats a bit rich even for you he gave the bags to parry and dillon said im under orders harry from your man here and billys a volunteer well more fool him hannah took two envelopes from her briefcase and gave them one each new passports still in your real identities they document that youve been to every war zone possible in the past few years your press credentials are all in order hopefully sharif will have important information for you when you arrive at that moment ferguson s mobile went and he answered it yes he frowned i see thanks he put it away roper a falcon owned by belov international took off from northolt an hour ago with greta novikova on board destination baghdad surprise surprise dillon said harry embraced billy and turned to dillon bring him back in one piece or else as billy went up the steps hannah hesitated then kissed dillon on the cheek my god i finally made it he smiled keep the faith she walked away and ferguson said do be careful dillon it would seriously inconvenience me if you didnt make it back you and billy both as for selim if the russians get to him i think hes a dead man im sure thats what novikova is all about do what seems appropriate do i make myself clear you always do dillon went up the steps and joined billy they settled down and parry pulled up the door then joined lacey in the cockpit where the squadron leader already had the engines rumbling into life here we go billy said into the bleeding war zone again come off it billy you love it dillon opened his bag and produced ropers notes he started to read while billy worked his way through the daily mail it didnt take long perhaps twenty minutes before dillon was finished any good billy asked roper does a good job he should write thrillers he tossed it across read it and learn what were up against the full and active life of josef belov in the beginning josef belov once during the early days of the chechen war perhaps although he could never remember exactly josef belov a colonel in the kgb and more used to intelligence work killed five russian soldiers personally it happened in this way belov was head of the kgbs department concerned with intelligence gathering about the western world but chechnya was something else again a case of all hands to the pumps which was why he found himself being driven through the charnel house that was once the chechen capital he sat in the front seat of an american jeep of all things being protected by special forces paratroopers who had procured a large number of the american vehicles because of their proven worth in combat belov had a corporal driving and a sergeant standing in the back behind a heavy machine gun mounted on a swivel he himself had an unusual weapon to hand an israeli uzi machine pistol with one magazine taped to another to allow instant reloading there were refugees everywhere lots of women and children some pushing prams loaded with a few pitiful possessions all screaming in terror at the sounds of battle artillery shells landing with a crash buildings collapsing in clouds of dust helicopters passing overhead firing rockets into chechen defensive positions none of this bothered belov the old afghan hand what did was the sight of a number of soldiers crowded around an army truck at the side of the road who were obviously waiting their turn as a young girl lying back on the drivers seat was in the process of being raped belov waved a hand and the jeep stopped he saw an older woman nearby her face stained with blood she struggled free of the man who held her saw belov and lurched toward him sir i beg you my daughter is only thirteen two soldiers grabbed her again and pulled her back belov said let her go they looked crazed faces filthy and sweat stained one of them cried who in the hell do you think you are and took a pistol from his holster belov produced his uzi shot him through the head swung as the other one pulled the woman in front of him and sprayed a short burst which unfortunately killed the woman as well as the soldier the others turned in alarm and belov fired again and again some of the soldiers started to fire back and the sergeant returned their fire with the heavy machine gun scattering men across the sidewalk the girl was still there belov saw her clearly and then the fuel tank on the truck exploded and the whole thing fireballed belovs driver immediately reversed away the sergeant said you were right to do that colonel ive got two daughters back there in moscow but i havent i did it because it was right in the eyes of god a great man named oliver cromwell said that once a general who turned england into the first republic in europe he took out his cigarette tin and extracted one passing the tin to the others lets get moving they usually say things get better in this case i rather doubt that born in the ukraine in josef belov had never known his father a peasant farmer who like several million other soviets had gone away to fight the war against the nazi invader he never came back his strong extended family was held together by his mother and they farmed the family properties until a number of fellow countrymen who had elected to join the germans turned up and put the torch to their crops and the buildings killed the old men and had their way with the women belovs mother survived and made her way to moscow where she had relatives what saved belov in the years after he finished state schooling was conscription whatever else one could say about communism in the soviet days it did not waste people and their potential it was the red army that discovered that belov had a brain nurtured him tested him in various ways and sent him to officer cadet school then a special department at moscow university where he particularly found his niche in social psychology the science of people interacting in groups combined with moral philosophy it made for an interesting mixture that together with a flair for languages inevitably led him into the kgb after when the soviets invaded afghanistan he found himself heavily involved in that theater of war and for many years he encountered an enemy spurred on by the taliban who were experts in skinning alive the young conscripts who fell into their hands emasculation was simply a side product at least it gave him the chance to add arabic to his languages but the brutality the cruelty the sheer barbarism had an effect on his very soul that would not go away there was no time for marriage the decencies he was always busy working on behalf of department in northern ireland for example feeding the irish conflict with arms for the ira there were useful contacts there especially in the drumore area of county louth where the local ira commander a particularly hard article named dermot kelly became more than useful to him over the years and then in at the age of fortyfive and a major he met ruth she was twenty years younger than he and the very opposite in nature deeply religious as befit her biblical name a schoolteacher and social worker concerned only with the good of others belov the hard man the soldier who had killed when necessary adored her for her sweetness her simplicity her kindness when she had found she was pregnant he had been over the moon and then it had happened she had attended a school meeting for parents one night hed arranged to pick her up but then something serious had come up kgb business and that came first shed started for home on foot in the driving rain and sleet and somewhere on the way had been abducted her halfnaked body found in an alley close to red square the following morning standing in the mortuary looking down at her bruised and beaten face belov knew a horror and an anger that would never go away it froze the soul in him took away all humanity he used no police no militia he pulled in all the terrible power of the kgb found the two men responsible and had them brought before him looked on their drunken drugravaged faces and knew what he must do they could have been charged with several offences including her murder could have been sent to the lubianka but that would have meant trials paperwork courts instead he sent for a young lieutenant who had been allocated to him after severe wounds in afghanistan yuri ashimov had been born in siberia like belov conscription had been the making of him and hed followed a similar route which had in the same way taken him to afghanistan a terrible war but one in which a man like ashimov could make his mark he couldnt believe his luck when he was allocated to belov at department for belovs exploits in kabul had made him a legend standing before belovs desk he could feel the pain felt it as personally as if this man were a brother major what would you like me to do i will sign an order releasing these two animals from the lubianka there will be no guards just handcuffs then i will wait for them at an appropriate place by the river i will kill them personally yuri what happens afterward doesnt matter to me if i have to meet the consequences i will well it bothers me major with due respect ive no intention of seeing anything bad happen to one of our greatest heroes leave it to me ill get them released and your name wont be on it how will you do that i have contacts major and then you said by the river ill bring them to the gorsky bridge take the cuffs off and you can finish them you would do that for me of course major it would be an honor and so it became a relationship that grew and flourished over the years and when the government forces collapsed in afghanistan in belov by then a colonel and ashimov a captain were among the last to leave accompanied by another kgb colonel named putin it all seemed to blur around that time the chechen republic declaring independence the carnage of the civil war gorbachev the ussr ceasing to exist the wall down in berlin and then the mad boom years of the russian federation and yeltsin years that for the strangest of reasons were the making of josef belov into one of the greatest oil barons in the world and the creator of belov international as the man responsible for subversive activities in the western world for the creation of chaos and uncertainty and fear the events of and the first gulf war had provided belov with a whole new field of enterprise belov had been active in northern ireland for some years supplying the provisional ira with weaponry linking various dissident elements with muslim terrorist groups in the middle east and so on an interesting thing about the ira was that as the momentum of its own struggle had died down it had left seething discontent among many of its members who as had been the habit of the irish over the centuries then sought service as mercenaries overseas where their skills could be put to good use money on the counter and where better than the middle east particularly iraq after the war so belovs contacts on both sides grew and flourished then after the rollercoaster years of boris yeltsin everything changed privatization of a great deal of the russian economy became the order of the day and belov didnt like it he preferred order discipline a strong hand perhaps all the books hed read about oliver cromwell had affected him more than hed realized so he pulled strings and moved to baghdad taking ashimov with him it was a turbulent time saddam gassing the kurds and putting down the shiite rebellion with an iron hand the country of course was suffering economically and not only from the oil embargo and belov could see the results in fact it got him interested in oil in a way he had never been before sitting on the terrace at the russian embassy by the river tigris having a vodka one evening he said to ashimov now a major yuri have you any concept of the wealth of the oil business in western siberia of the natural gas and coal and some of the richest mineral deposits in the world yet little of it is being developed right too much government interference its a waste just like whats happening here in iraq i dont know about siberia but theres little you can do about it here im afraid if saddam lives up to form hes going to end up goading the yanks and the brits into another invasion you really think he could be that insane absolutely ashimov stood up now if youll excuse me i have a date dinner and possibly dancing at al bustan ah the new gru girl the lieutenant greta novikova quite special why not join us the telephone on the desk rang and belov answered then switched into arabic he paused listening then put the phone down frowning now what in the hell does that mean well i cant comment unless you tell me that was the man himself saddam he wants to see me at the presidential palace which one ashimov asked dryly belov ignored him you can forget dinner better phone this greta and cancel ill need you with me ashimov was all attention now of course colonel at your orders and he reached for the phone they drove through the city in a range rover found a small crowd of people at the presidential palace and a few cars they paused at the gates where belov presented his identity card and they were passed through with an efficiency that indicated they were expected they stopped at the bottom of the huge steps leading up to the palace belov said to ashimov youre carrying he took a walther from the shoulder holster under his left arm and ashimov produced a beretta of course belov opened the glove compartment and put the walther in and you if we take the hardware inside well set every alarm bell in the palace ringing they went up the steps to the entrance and found an army colonel waiting impatiently colonel belov he keeps asking for you this way im colonel farouk the lighting was subdued the statues in the marbled corridors only half visible in the dusk they halted at a beaten copper doorway a sentry on each side the colonel went in a moment later he came out hell see you now gentlemen he said and leaned forward and murmured in belovs ear for the sake of all of us take care colonel hes in one of his manic phases anything is possible he opened the door and ushered them in saddam sat behind a huge desk with a shaded light as he looked up from some papers he wasnt in uniform and he stood up and came around the desk and spoke in arabic extending his hand colonel belov good to see you and who is this my aide major yuri ashimov also of the kgb or the federal service of counterespionage or whatever youre calling it now does department three no longer exist i rely on moscow excellency you may be sure it still exists for the specific purpose for which it was created however much our masters juggle around with changes saddams eyes glittered it was as if he was on something and he paced around the desk restlessly sit down he gestured to two chairs its good to know you are still operating belov i have always looked on you as a friend but these days times are uncertain the americans waiting for any excuse to pounce ive done everything theyve asked for in the treaty and what happens the oil stays in the ground no way of getting it out which was not strictly true but he carried on and the exclusion zone im constantly harried by their air force at that moment a siren sounded in the distance and the palace was plunged into darkness he hurried to the great windows and watched as lights turned out in patches curse them ive never felt so impotent and what can i do he turned hands wide tell me what can i do he was smiling madly sweat on his face turned picked up a vacant chair and hurled it across the room in a rage and then seemed to pull himself together but no im a poor host now what about that women or wine boring action passion thats the thing tell me colonel did you come in an embassy limousine no excellency major ashimov drove us here in a range rover a range rover the lights came on again extending across the city its been a long time since i drove one of those im sure youll lend it to me of course excellency then lets go and saddam led the way out it was a fact known only to intimates that he frequently roamed the city late at night driving himself often with no guards of any kind even though belov had heard that guards did usually attempt to follow him farouk was half running to keep up with him as saddam plowed ahead belov tugged on ashimovs sleeve and they held back hes in one of his mad moods so we just go with the flow anything can happen well arm ourselves the moment we get in the range rover as you say colonel they passed outside the main door at the top of the steps while farouk pleaded allow me to bring an escort excellency that at least its a shameful thing if i cant drive through my own city without an armed guard you will wait here he started down the steps to the range rover and belov paused by farouk give me your pistol farouk took a browning from his holster and handed it over good now my advice is to follow us at a discreet distance in later years he often wondered whether saddam had seen himself as the great caliph haroun al rashid in the baghdad of old mingling with the common people in disguise by night but that couldnt be true for he drove the range rover like a madman scattering the crowd outside the palace and bouncing three cars out of the way he laughed harshly i am an excellent driver is it not so colonel of course excellency belov had the browning in his pocket and now opened the glove compartment passed ashimov his beretta and slipped the walther into his shoulder holster they carved their way down into the city swerving from one street to another colliding with a number of vehicles people jumping for their lives and saddam in high good humor drove even faster ashimov murmured to belov were being followed i know i suggested it to farouk theyre not military vehicles saddam oblivious to all this crossed an intersection that led him onto a fourlane highway now for some real speed saddam cried but at the same moment a red ferrari accelerated beside them a man leaning out of the rear window with a machine pistol as he started to fire ashimov shot him in the head another man in the front passenger seat beside the driver sprayed the range rover again bursting one of the front tires saddam cursed working the wheel furiously and the range rover rammed into the metal road barrier and came to a halt a number of passing vehicles accelerated out of the way but the ferrari swerved braking ahead of the range rover and three men got out all armed at the same moment an old white van pulled in the rear doors opened and three more men joined the others belov got out of the range rover and pulled saddam with him stay down excellency ashimov joined him his face sliced open from one eye to the corner of his mouth are you all right belov asked not really ashimov fired twice at the ones who crouched behind the van and the ferrari traffic seems to have ground to a halt back there who can blame them saddam also had blood on his face and seemed dazed in my own city he said in baghdad belov weighed the browning in one hand the walther in the other he smiled slightly at ashimov shall we get it done why not you take the left ill see to the right a burst of machinepistol fire thudded into the range rover and he called in arabic no more saddam is dead ill come out with my friend there was a pause excited conversation a voice called throw out your weapons we only have one gun belov shouted stood up with the walther in his left hand and threw it toward the other vehicles ashimov rising beside him now belov said as the six men moved into the open and he fired very rapidly knocking down the three on the right while ashimov took out the three on the left there was a movement in the van its driver peered out and ashimov shot him it was then they heard vehicles approaching fast farouk and his boys belov said the cavalry arriving rather late he took out a pocket handkerchief and gave it to ashimov best i can do ill treasure it colonel and ashimov held it to his face in the ambassadors office the following morning at the russian embassy by the tigris belov and ashimov faced an angry man you had no right to become involved the ambassador said this has gone all the way to the president in moscow it may not have occurred to you colonel but our governments position in the iraq situation is a very delicate one i see belov said youve been informed of the circumstances should i have refused saddams invitation to the palace i think that would have been difficult should i have refused to accompany him on his drive i think not good god man no one appointed you to be his guardian angels eight men you killed eight i believe so i would like to bring to your attention major ashimovs gallant conduct in this affair as you can see his face will never be the same again hes lucky not to have lost an eye i suggest he be recommended for a decoration denied the ambassador said and for the excellent reason that it never happened that will suit saddam and it certainly suits our government he paused and then carried on a sense of selfimportance can be considered a sin in some quarters you go too far colonel and this could seriously affect your career the threat was implicit but at that moment the phone on his desk rang he answered listened and the change on his face was plain of course excellency he said in arabic and put down the phone that was saddam he wishes to see you both at once and do we go belov asked curiously gentle i dont seem to have any choice im sure moscow will agree when you inform them you will excuse us then he nodded to ashimov and led the way out at the presidential palace they were met by farouk who was ecstatic what you did was heroic incredible colonel you know who they were oh yes two of them were still alive and soon talked shiite rebels naturally they never stop trying hes waiting for you eagerly when farouk ushered them in saddam was behind his desk in full uniform he got to his feet came around and embraced belov then turned to ashimov examined the scar covered by gauze that ran from his eye to his mouth how bad sixteen stitches an interesting memento excellency i like that saddam laughed every morning you look in the mirror to have a shave youll be reminded of me now sit down the both of you i have things to say i felt anger last night but mainly impotence im hedged in by the americans and the british even the united nations are hardly my friends the shiites rebel also the kurds i deal with them and people compare me to hitler excellency what can i say i have only one great weapon money many billions deposited in safe havens around the world and money on that level is power there was a heavy pause belov for want of anything better said i wouldnt argue with that which brings me to the point i owe you two my life in my religion this leaves me with a debt that must be repaid in some way a sacred duty he turned to ashimov you were obeying the colonels instructions last night am i right absolutely excellency a fine soldier doing his duty you have my eternal gratitude as to your future i leave that to your colonel here in safe hands i think when you hear what i have to say he went back behind his desk and sat speaking directly to belov these are strange times in russia so many stateowned enterprises going on offer to the open market and at such reasonable prices true excellency all my billions languish all over the world from geneva to singapore and i cant invest because of the attitude of the americans and the united nations it would amuse me to outfox them in what way belov said carefully by discharging my debt to you colonel for saving my life i understand that at the moment there are a number of oil fields up for grabs in siberia for sale by a government very short of the almighty dollar thats true excellency how far would one billion dollars take you belov glanced at ashimov who looked awestruck took a deep breath and turned back to saddam a very long way excellency there could be difficulties but difficulties are meant to be overcome if i can serve you in any way it would be an honor saddam shook his head impatiently not for me my friend for yourself dont you think my life is worth a billion dollars for a moment belov was speechless as the enormity of it sank in but finally managed to say im overwhelmed saddam roared with laughter one billion a drop in the ocean but think what you could do give the damned americans a run for their money now that i would like to see that would please me but excellency what can i do for you who knows be my friend in bad times a man in the shadows when needed there was a briefcase on the desk and he pushed it across ive had my people prepare these documents in here carefully there are code words and passwords in here that will give you access to one billion dollars he stood up and belov and ashimov got up hurriedly saddam gestured at the briefcase take it colonel and he laughed harshly my debt is paid in the month that followed that extraordinary meeting belov found an excuse to visit geneva a certain caution in him a refusal to believe it could be true he took ashimov with him and it certainly was true for the bankers jumped to attention so he returned to moscow and resigned from the service together with ashimov whom he took on as his personal aide with all the expertise gained from so many years in intelligence he compiled a list of the sort of people he needed to know not only businessmen but also crooked politicians on the take and if any such people wouldnt play ball or tried to cause trouble there was always yuri ashimov of the scarred face to take care of them in siberia government contracts were readily available especially for someone with an apparently unlimited supply of dollars after those early deals he never really looked back and in the russia of those days no one queried them within five years the original billion had become six and when his old kgb friend putin became president it was just the icing on the cake people didnt want democracy they wanted strength and power and got exactly that from putin which suited belov perfectly and on his end his economic miracle suited the government perfectly so everyone was happy the emergence of al qaeda and the growth of the terror movement were unfortunate for one way or another it led to the second gulf war and the demise of saddam but the prospect of the iraqi oil fields becoming available danced enticingly in front of him and so he was content the postwar turmoil in iraq was understandable although the capture of saddam by american troops seemed to herald the prospect of a more stable future at least for iraq belov had never bought the idea that the fall of saddam would have much effect on the arab world anyway muslim militants such as al qaeda would still pursue what they saw as a holy war with america and the western world pursue that war by what they saw as the only means available to them terror so belov was proarab but only because it suited him there was no doubt he was antiamerican but for obvious business reasons the brits were all right because the brits were the brits and he had a weakness for london but his old philosophy held true and was like a devil in him to create chaos fear and uncertainty in the western world and in pursuit of those aims it made sense to aid the cause of muslim militants but that side of things he left to yuri ashimov it was not that he didnt want to know it was just that he didnt want to know too much the money of course made all the difference there were charitable trusts educational trusts for young people in reality fronts for those like wrath of allah the party of god and others who were particularly dedicated to such enterprises as for example recruiting young britishborn muslims to take them to training camps in the middle east he had been informed of the morgan affair in manhattan the intended attempt on the american presidents life an enterprise so simple it might well have succeeded if it hadnt been for the activities of charles ferguson and his people but he was separate from all that when the berger empire crashed he had taken over its oil interests in southern arabia there was nothing america could do about that it made him one of the most powerful businessmen in the world highly approved of by the russian federation he had the old rashid house in south audley street in london hed bought drumore place his castle on the cliffs of drumore in the irish republic and put dermot kelly in charge ostensibly as estate manager and the money continued to roll in he was josef belov man of mystery unbelievably wealthy and always at his side was yuri ashimov northern irelandnantucket ashimov arrived at belfast airport in a company jet and could have taken a helicopter onward to drumore on the louth coast but instead hed had a car organized by his people in belfast or belovs people to be strictly accurate it was raining but no surprise in that it seemed to rain five days a week in belfast but he liked that and he liked northern ireland and the accent in which people spoke so different from that in the republic it was a wonderfully beautiful place which was why he preferred to spend a couple of hours drivng through the mountains and then crossing the border into the irish republic and following the coast road to drumore there was a beretta his preferred weapon in the glove compartment no border checks in these days of peace he checked it put it under his raincoat for easy access and drove away the rain beat down he turned on some music on bbc radio sat back and enjoyed the whole experience there he was born in the ukraine and yet he loved these crazy people an hour and a half later and the irish sea stretched away to his left on the coast road wind and rain driving in and he was whistling along with the bbc when he saw drumore village in the distance and the castle drumore place standing tall on the edge of the cliffs outside it was an imposing sight with towers and battlements and everything you would want a castle to have there was only one problem it wasnt particularly ancient it had been built by angloirish lord drumore wealthy from the sugar trade in the west indies in the early nineteenth century his homage to the romantic tradition and none the worse for that ashimov drove down through the small port turned into the parking lot of the local pub the royal george which sounded as orange loyalist as you would have liked and dated from loyalist times but the people locally liked their traditions and in spite of being staunchly republican refused to have the name altered as ashimov got out of his car a van drew up alongside there were two young men in it the one opening the passenger door bumped into ashimov as he was getting out the youth longhaired and unshaven and wearing an old combat jacket got out full of aggression you want to watch it im sorry ashimov said stupid prick ashimov reached in the car found the beretta and put it in his pocket if you say so he walked to the pub entrance and the young man and his driver burst into laughter i said he was a prick inside the bar was totally traditional a beamed ceiling dark oak booths logs burning on the great stone hearth an old marbletopped counter the barman reading a newspaper any bottle a man could fancy ranged behind him by one of the bow windows a man of around fifty sat eating a meatandpotato pie he had red hair a reckless look to him and a slight smile this was dermot kelly a veteran since the age of seventeen of the irish troubles the man who sat in the window seat close to him smoking and reading a book was one tod murphy who looked like some sort of intellectual with his black hair flecked with gray and steel spectacles once a student of theology intent on the priesthood he had followed the same path as kelly although in his case it had included fifteen years in the maze prison for murdering five people it was only the peace process that had released him he looked up saw ashimov at the bar and smiled the barman without being told had taken a bottle of cold vodka from the bar fridge and poured a large one before ashimov could touch it the two youths who had followed him in ranged alongside him the youth in the combat jacket picked up the glass what in the hell would this be he drank some and made a face what kind of shite is that my kind and as youve touched it you can buy me another you what the youth grabbed for the front of ashimovs coat and the russian headbutted him the youth went down and his friend cried out in anger and reached for the bottle of vodka on the bar dermot said tod murphy stood up still holding his book not in here not without dermot kellys sayso i dont know where youre from but this is an ira pub and this gentleman is a friend of ours fuck you the youth said and smashed the bottle on the edge of the marble bar murphy kicked him under one knee and ashimov grabbed him by the collar screwed a short punch into his kidneys and ran him headfirst through the front door better clear the mess michael murphy said to the barman the terrible times we live in major kids down over the border from belfast always high on something if its not the drugs its the booze but not in drumore we like a bit of law and order here ira law and order children can walk to school safe here old people rest easy in their homes young women walk home from the village dance and with mr belov the squire now most people are in work and grateful farms around here are prosperous thanks to mr belov if you were hoping to see him he left yesterday in the helicopter for belfast and onwards to moscow i knew hes a close one mr belov because hes what you might call preoccupied with business on a worldwide scale anything else he leaves to me now what have you got for me tod murphy who as well as learning irish in the maze prison had managed reasonable russian held up the book and said in that language the city of god by st augustine serious reading for a serious man so you still believe in god in spite of having walked over corpses all these years oh yes tod murphy said gravely hell and damnation exist redemption is possible christ is risen as to walking over corpses major weve all done that as i understand it kelly told him especially josef belov ashimov said i think youll find his body count exceeds the two of you put together very possibly and i say the same of yours but lets go up to the castle and well show you the ceiling theyve refurbished in the great hall belov was pleased lets see what you think as they drove through the grounds the vista was more than pleasing the avenue of beech trees the moat the great entrance the turrets the towers there was even a drawbridge that worked on an electronic system the great hall was everything it ought to be a huge staircase sweeping down carpets scattered over the flagged floor two enormous chandeliers hanging from the gilded ceiling a log fire smoldering on the wide hearth an oak table twelve chairs around it a couch on each side of the fire youll have a drink kelly asked the kitchens working on the lunch now why not and you can tell us why youve come murphy said what do you know about a man named sean dillon ashimov asked tod murphy simply stopped smiling and looked astonished sean what in the hell is he to you dermot kelly laughed out loud and ashimov said what is this it sounds as if hes some kind of friend ah major youll never understand the irish sean was more than a friend he was the best a true comrade kelly said we were on the run from brit paratroopers in the sewers of derry on one famous occasion i took a bullet in the shoulder but i could keep going tod here got one in the leg and fell by the wayside when sean found out he went back for him ill drink to him any day murphy said ashimov was bewildered this man works for charles ferguson who heads the prime ministers secret security service so secret its known in the trade kelly cut in as the prime ministers private army and theyd need the best so they got sean i dont understand you youd need to be irish to understand us major and its got nothing to do with religion sean dillon is the best they couldnt touch his collar for years not the ruc not the british army dyou know how he ended up working for ferguson during the serb war he was flying medical supplies in for children the serbs caught him its whats called a good deed in a naughty world tod murphy said he was faced with a firing squad and ferguson blackmailed him he saved his skin wiped his slate clean and in return sean became his enforcer we all know the story and ashimov in spite of his wealth of experience was astonished and you dont mind kelly said i told you he was a comrade the best but if he got you in his sights you were dead still would be so why do you want to know about him kelly asked and ashimov told them when he had finished murphy said so this ali selim bowser is on the run in iraq and youve got whatshername greta novikova on his tail ferguson will have sean on that one like a dose of salts kelly put in he turned to tod murphy put your priests intellect on this whats your conclusion quite simple ferguson doesnt want a trial at the old bailey the muslims wouldnt like that hes sent sean to bring selim back a nice quiet inquisition in some safe house in london and you and mr belov wouldnt like that well lets hope it doesnt come to that but how would you two feel if i had trouble in london with ferguson and his people what would you say if i said i needed you it would include taking on dillon they looked at each other and smiled ah now said murphy he was a comrade to be sure but that doesnt mean there might not be a score or two to settle things run well here as you know kelly said we do things our way and belovs money for the farmers keeps things sweet tod cut in but with the peace process it gets awfully boring what you suggest could be interesting but just so you realize kelly added if theres something sean dillon could give master classes in its bloody mayhem so where would that leave you oh wed give him a run for his money and tod murphy smiled it was later that day that president jake cazalet walked on the shore at nantucket he loved the old beach house with its seafront of beach and sand dunes and came down whenever he could certainly most weekends the helicopter delivered him from washington late on a friday picked him up again sunday evening he had a cook and housekeeper in from the local town no fuss and good plain cooking he would say hed always insisted that only two secret service men accompany him and one always had to be clancy smith the other usually handled communications even with only two minders however the security around him was electronically stateoftheart especially since the assassination attempt on him three years before while running through the nearby marsh he was walking on the beach now with his beloved flatcoated retriever murchison and with clancy smith the surf boiled the sky was slate gray rain showering in so hard that the two men each carried an umbrella they paused for clancy to light the presidents cigarette it feels good to get away from everything mr president my god but it does the smell of that salt in the air is really something it sure is in the distance came the unmistakable sound of a helicopter approaching clancy said that will be blake coming in sir and our english cousins cazalet said it always gives me a strange feeling when i hear those things he looked along to where the helicopter was dropping in on the beach takes me right back to vietnam he flicked his cigarette away okay lets go and greet our guests ferguson and hannah bernstein sat together on the other side of the coffee table by the fire cazalet facing them clancy leaning against the wall by the french windows behind murchison lay on the rug watching cazalet said i read major ropers report on josef belov with interest if thats the right word ive spoken to the prime minister only briefly for obvious reasons which is why he thought it a good idea that we talk mr president thank god we do otherwise i could have been dead on that sidewalk in manhattan it could have succeeded so easily ill never understand it the drive to assassinate actually the superintendent knows a bit about it said ferguson she has a masters degree in psychology cazalet said superintendent motive sir is the basic requirement and hate cazalet said deep conviction not always she replied for one kind of assassin professional the motive is usually money and a target like you would be a big payday but the money is no good if he doesnt survive its often a day of the jackal kind of thing for them meticulous planning and a guaranteed exit cazalet nodded and the other kind usually the most successful youll remember president reagan shot at close quarters by a man in the crowd who knew he would stand no chance of getting away so were back with what i said in the first place the motive is hate deep conviction and often a genuine religious belief its interesting that the word assassin is derived from the arabic during the middle ages members of various cults under the influence of hashish attempted to kill many leaders of the crusades jewish zealots in biblical times used the same tactics on the romans ferguson put in hannah said it can derive from a feeling of deep frustration mr president it was lenin who said the purpose of terrorism is to terrorize its the only way a small country can fight against an empire that was one of michael collinss favorite sayings when he led the ira back in against the british ferguson said cazalet nodded all very interesting but how does it explain morgan i dont know any religion on earth that doesnt have its extremists hannah said right through history and usually those extremists are the kind of people who are extremely good at brainwashing others particularly young people into becoming assassins suicide bombers cazalet shook his head of course the religious leaders who spread the word are usually reluctant to put themselves on the line understandably cazalet got up i arranged a light lunch with cook and gave her the afternoon off i wanted us to have privacy its waiting for us in the kitchen lead the way clancy youll join us of course the conversation over lunch was much more social and pleasant ranging from what was worth seeing on the west end stage to cazalet and hannah comparing student days at harvard and cambridge cazalet turned to ferguson did you go to university general too busy i always intended to but we had conscription then after two years in the army i got a taste for it i suppose i was eighteen and communist arabs were shooting at me so when they offered me a commission he shrugged it seemed the natural thing to do all those rotten little wars hannah couldnt help saying you couldnt get enough ah there speaks the psychologist ferguson said cheerfully but not my rotten little wars my dear all the way through and that includes northern ireland bosnia kosovo and the two gulf wars i was a member of that happy band of brothers called soldiers who take care of those things from which the general public turns its face ive always liked to think it an honorable profession he smiled at cazalet and clancy of course i do not include the marines in that sentiment we thank the general clancy said and they all laughed but hannah was uncomfortable and it showed the trouble was that she was changing inside herself and her head and she didnt know what to do about it cazalet sensing something wasnt right smiled at her reassuringly and stood up okay folks to work and he led them back to the sitting room so if im getting this right he said a while later this dr ali selim sensing personal disaster has fled to iraq were aware that he has been controlled by this major yuri ashimov who is head of security for the belov organization which i assume means a plentiful source of financial support for muslim extremist groups theres no possibility of proving that in a court of law mr president hannah said its just about impossible to touch josef belov ferguson said hes far too powerful one of the richest men in the world and a friend of putin even if it was revealed that hed donated money to some of these muslim organizations hannah said it would be impossible to prove that hed acted except in good faith so where does that leave us cazalet asked the most worrying aspect is the recruitment of young british muslims to join militant groups in the middle east ferguson said to be trained in camps in syria or iraq even in southern arabia and then returned to britain and america often as sleepers to lead apparently normal lives until their special abilities are required cannon fodder for al qaeda you think wrath of allah is part of that it wouldnt surprise me we know a great deal about them and a great deal about belov as youve read dont forget that when he was with the kgb he was totally dedicated to helping the downfall of all western values a kind of oldfashioned bolshevik hes got all the money in the world so money is only a means to an end but whats the point cazalet demanded why behave as he does the game mr president hannah said the game is the thing the ultimate power of being able to move his way around the chessboard and laugh at us all be untouchable so what do we do about it cazalet asked ferguson said sending that gru major novikova on selims trail to baghdad probably means the worst that selims served his purpose and knows too much i imagine theyll finish him off if they can though im not completely sure of that which is why youve sent dillon to save him dillon will do what seems appropriate in the circumstances if that means saving him fine and if that means making sure selim meets a bad end so be it if selim can be retrieved theres always the possibility of squeezing more information out of him about the belov connection he shrugged if not hes dispensable cazalet said whichever way it goes its going to get very nasty exactly mr president but thats what my organization was set up for all those years ago were responsible only to the prime minister nobody else can touch us the security services the ministry of defence even parliament a license to kill cazalet said if thats what it takes were dealing with global terrorism its a whole new threat and we cant cope with it by playing according to the rule book i totally agree mr president blake said the prime ministers made it plain that im in charge and that im to take any steps that seem appropriate that in effect is why im here he wanted to make it clear to you that such an attitude will reflect our policy in the future so youll forget the legal system the courts and everything that goes with it desperate times call for desperate remedies cazalet turned to hannah from what ive come to know about you superintendent id say such an attitude might give you a moral problem it does sir in a troubled world it seems to me that if we dont have the law a justice system we have nothing which is exactly what our enemies count on ferguson replied its a question of survival we either fight back or go under anyway that will be our plan of action from now on the prime minister wanted you to know cazalet turned to blake you agree with all this im afraid so sir everything we stand for all our values are on the line these days as the general says we fight back or go under i thought youd say that cazalet sighed okay general anything we can do were together on this mr president we always have been and belov blake put in hes pretty untouchable nobody is untouchable cazalet wasnt smiling now take him down gentlemen whatever it takes three hours later rising up from andrews air force base in the citation and leveling at fifty thousand feet ferguson unfastened his seat belt and smiled at the pretty young raf sergeant standing over him ill have a large scotch my dear he turned to hannah on the other side of the aisle what about you superintendent i dont think so sir im having difficulty enough keeping my head straight right now superintendent even as we speak dillon and young billy salter are out there in harms way dealing with some very nasty people i know that sir then youll have to decide which side youre on its up to you superintendent and he drank his whiskey iraq an hour out of baghdad the citation down to thirty thousand feet billy was reading ropers report for the fourth time dillon had found a half bottle of irish whiskey in the bar box and poured a large one billy closed the report this guy belov his bleeding lifes been a saga and ashimov hed kill the pope wouldnt he id agree with you id say he was the one who pushed mrs morgan off that jetty and this novikova woman a looker billy but dont be fooled you dont make major in the gru by being soft thats why ashimovs rushed her to baghdad to take care of selim hes a walking dead man and wheres that leave us theyll be expecting us billy lets put it that way the telephone rang at his side he answered and found roper i thought youd like to know that greta novikova landed safely four hours ago roper said she didnt go to the embassy shes at the al bustan well thats nice what about selim dropped in at kuwait twelve hours ago collected his car and set off north its a long hard drive to baghdad these days sean sharif is meeting you at the hotel early evening thanks have fun dillon replaced the phone billy said what was that dillon told him billy was highly amused what are we going to do about novikova have a drink in the bar who knows stranger things have happened another thing those two ira geezers at this drumore castle did you know them in the old days you could say that friends or enemies i mean if ashimov asked them to try and blow your head off would they do it yes for a price that and the game billy dillon poured another whiskey especially if they couldnt think of anything better to do crazy billy said all you micks are crazy parry appeared landing in fifteen minutes itll be a very fast descent so strap up well he smiled its the missiles the ones some peasant fires from his shoulder wed just as soon avoid them if we could that really makes my day billy said thanks very much and did as he was told but the landing went perfectly baghdad looked like most large airports except for the guards the gun pits the hardware heavily on display everywhere and lots of military aircraft they taxied to the main raf area parked under instructions and lacey switched off parry left the cockpit and opened the door good flight huge tailwind were over an hour early an raf land rover drove up to meet them and a sergeant got out in camouflage battle dress and saluted lacey if you gentlemen will get in ill see to the luggage and take you to the mess parkers my name what about transport down to town dillon asked taken care of sir what we call a safe taxi youll be fine its been quiet lately they were drinking very english tea in the raf mess eating biscuits with lacey and parry when a flight lieutenant turned up im robson police he shook hands with lacey havent seen you since kosovo heard about your air force cross good show he turned to parry weve never met but good show too ive seen your priority rating higher even than the prime minister turning up ive been in the raf long enough to know it doesnt pay to ask questions you chaps are obviously moving in very exalted circumstances mr dillon thats me robson handed him an envelope a red security one tag it covers everything everything oh yes immediate response if youre in trouble and i presume you gentlemen could be he handed a similar envelope to billy mr salter i feel a whole lot better billy said robson turned back to dillon theres a safe taxi parked outside with sergeant parker at the wheel in civvies hell be on line mobile number in your envelopes twentyfourhour watch he turned to lacey and parry ive had special instructions informed general ferguson at the mod that youd landed and was told you two were to stay and wait here the citation refueled for instant takeoff when required so they cant go to downtown baghdad and have a drink with us dillon asked too dangerous old boy robson said of course billy told him this just gets better all the time your bags are in the taxi gentlemen no inspection at the gate he smiled but why would there be youre just a journalist and a photographer he got up all i can say is enjoy the run to baghdad itself was calm enough with plenty of traffic a lot of it local cars trucks and vans plus lots of donkeys loaded with produce peasants walking beside them it was late afternoon but they were headed for tomorrows markets in baghdad rounding it all off were military vehicles of every kind everywhere dillon said to parker so tell us the worst sergeant well im an old hand served in both gulf wars bosnia and kosovo in between if you think things are better because the yanks grabbed saddam youd be wrong plenty of iraqis were pleased about that but lots werent and they still hate each other sunni muslims shiites stir in a few kurds mix it with socalled muslim freedom fighters from all over the world and thats not even counting al qaeda you shouldnt have joined billy said well i did parker laughed and you know what i love every bloody awful minute of it he hesitated im not supposed to ask but well i spent fifteen years in the raf police ive been around the houses which means dillon said well you sound northern ireland i should know because i did four tours there but belfasttelegraph i doubt it as for mr salter with the greatest respect hes been around the block as well im surprised you havent made warrant officer dillon said i once had a fallingout with a warrant officer and punched him robson opened the glove compartment in the car and produced a browning should i keep this handy very sensible thank god things have been getting boring lately baghdad was baghdad the streets all seemed to be some kind of a market the traders voices high as they shouted to passersby music blaring out from scores of shops and traffic everywhere so much of it that they were reduced to a crawl is the al bustan far dillon asked which one there are several its a very common name still dont worry i know the right one the evening dusk was setting in as they finally moved off a road not far from al rashid street in the old quarter and turned up a narrow lane and halted at a gate that stood open but had a bar across it an iraqi peered out of a small hut and took his time coming get it up for christs sake parker told him the man said something pretty basic in arabic and dillon reached out through the open window grabbed him by the throat and told him exactly what to do in reasonably fluent street arabic himself the startled man staggered back got the bar up and parker drove on the hotel was very oldfashioned the grounds quite large with a swimming pool and a number of cottage apartments dotted around surrounded by palm trees they coasted up to the main entrance braked to a halt and a couple of porters came down the steps to meet them and take the luggage parker didnt get out he said to dillon belfasttelegraph i never heard arabic like that on the shankill we spoke it on the falls road all the time im sure you did parker smiled i look forward to hearing from you and drove away the reception area was very oldfashioned as well with three great fans hanging from the ceiling and swirling around in the taxi billy had extracted two cameras from his bag and had slung them around his neck he took a couple of pictures of the foyer and moved to an archway opening into a huge bar and caf√© area he took more pictures and turned to dillon brilliant just like casablanca all we need is rick youve made your point billy the man behind reception interrupted gentlemen my name is hamid i am the manager may i help you dillon and salter dillon told him ah mr dillon we werent expecting you yet hell of a tailwind billy put in dillon lit a cigarette is there a problem not at all cottage five i was hoping to meet miss novikova dillon said it in arabic and hamid was startled shes arrived i know that yes she arrived a few hours ago cottage seven he snapped his fingers to the two porters who picked up the bags and led the way out billy and dillon following down a narrow path leading through the palm trees they saw tables beside the pool sheltered by umbrellas people sitting around having drinks as the porters forged ahead dillon pulled billy close to him the end table with the greenandwhite umbrella the woman in a light blue dress sitting with what looks like an iraqi black hair bushy mustache yes thats greta novikova and the guy sharif ive seen his photo keep moving they passed on following the porters to the cottage one of the porters unlocked the door and they led the way in it was all very acceptable a sitting room two bedrooms and a shower room there was even a small kitchen and a terrace dillon paid the porters off unlocked the french windows and moved out onto the terrace billy joined him what do you think about novikova i dont know billy except that she shouldnt be so cozy with sharif so what do we do unpack have a shower you can go second and speak to sharif when he turns up after that venture out into the bar and who knows we might just bump into novikova billy smiled harrys right you are a sod toward the end of her flight greta had received a call from ashimov ah the wonders of cyberspace its just as i thought dillons on his way to baghdad too ive even got his estimated time of arrival im impressed to the great ashimov anything is possible ive arranged for two mercenary friends of mine in baghdad igor zorin and boris makeev to handle the dirty work are they good exparatroopers good chechen experience theyll do like you dillon is staying at the al bustan hes got a backup with him that young gangster billy salter theyre posing as press isnt that going to be awkward them staying here too not really hed have run you down soon enough the beauty of it is that the manager at the al bustan a guy called hamid has worked for me many times before hes already informed me that a major sharif a former republican guard was making inquiries about dillons arrival i gave hamid instructions to speak to this man on my behalf to seduce him with money you like it poor dillon youll have plenty of time to speak to sharif before dillon and salter get there stay in touch at the al bustan hamid couldnt do enough for her the magic name of belov pervading the air he took her to her cottage personally then called major sharif on his mobile greta didnt bother to unpack instead she simply went and sat at the table by the pool and ordered a large vodka cocktail from a passing waiter she was sipping it thinking when sharif approached and introduced himself he was a large man in his forties with black hair and mustache and sad eyes he wore a creased linen suit and the bulge in the righthand pocket indicated a weapon he half bowed major novikova major sharif please sit would you like a drink when he had sat she said i dont like to waste time so listen carefully she filled him in with a few terse sentences do you know zorin and makeev ive seen them around theyre the kind who turn their hand to anything what about selim in ramalla ive already made inquiries i have contacts in the area his greatuncle is expecting him tonight tell dillon hes arriving tomorrow well meet here later with makeev and zorin and decide on our next move and lets be clear ferguson may pay you well but if you want top dollar josef belov pays more she smiled in case you were wondering i am very content major he took out a card my mobile number give me yours she did good call me as soon as you hear hes arrived of course he half bowed and walked away showered and changed into a fresh shirt and a tan linen suit dillon went through the hardware bag from the quartermaster at farley field found a walther checked it out and slipped it into his right jacket pocket he went out on the terrace lit a cigarette and billy joined him im hungry when do we eat at that moment sharif came along the path through the palm trees mr dillon thats right im major sharif you arrived early sorry i wasnt here dillon put a hand on billys shoulder thats okay no big deal was it billy billy responded well hell no he held out his hand good to meet you dillon said theres one thing straightaway ive heard from london that greta novikova is staying here ive only just heard that myself ive just checked in for the night and the manager told me we have an arrangement he does me favors but you wouldnt know her no i dont think shes worked in baghdad before i see so what about selim is he turning up here he would have booked ahead and he hasnt i expect hes still driving up from kuwait and i think hell go straight to his uncles place in ramalla hell probably arrive tomorrow but ill have better information later dillon smiled and patted him on the shoulder no me ould son and he nodded to billy who took out a walther and stood with his back to the door i think youve got better information now sharif knew a real pro when he saw one and sighed heavily not even angry there was a kind of resignation to him could i have a drink mr dillon im that kind of muslim dillon found a bottle of scotch in the bar box and two glasses and poured sharif drank it down he held the glass out and dillon poured another sharif said i was a republican guard and military intelligence under saddam because we all have to get by in life which means i was a bad boy but then i lost my wife and my daughter in the bombing and that was the war so fuck saddam and fuck all of you the americans the brits and now the russians for ruining my country i appreciate the point dillon toasted him as it happens im irish ira irish so i can be your worst nightmare with the credentials ive got i could turn you in to the yanks and im sure theyd like to have you and the alternative work with us and ill guarantee that ferguson will pay you as agreed and give you a clean slate mind you hell expect you to continue working for him sharif was astounded can this be true he turned to billy who shrugged dont look at me i just kill people when he tells me to the worlds gone crazy so they tell me dillon said are you in or out im in good man now tell me what happened between you and her sharif did and billy said zorin and makeev sound like trouble thats why i have you billy dillon went to the quartermasters hardware bag took out a file opened it and selected a computer printout does this look familiar sharif looked surprised why thats ramalla and thats the selim farm just outside in the orange grove by the river it was damaged in the war but the old man still lives there on his own women relatives call in to see to his needs so my contact informs me dillon went back to the bag and opened a false bottom that contained ten thousand american dollars operating money he took out two thousand in fifties and handed it over thats to be going on with sharif looked astonished but stashed the money away what can i say how long to ramalla its forty kilometers an hour could be less you want me to take you no i have a driver who knows his way around what i want you to do is check with your contact and call me on my mobile the moment you hear selims arrived well be ready and waiting to go and novikova call her half an hour later billy and i will be a nice surprise for her and her friends when they turn up couldnt we just grab selim and scarper billy demanded not if we want to rub ashimovs nose in it hell have a lot of explaining to do to belov he turned to sharif off you go then sharif said once again slightly bewildered you trust me mr dillon lets say you strike me as an honorable man but dont forget to tell her youve told me theres no chance of selim before tomorrow in the meantime billy and i will sample the delights of the al bustan restaurant and bar its been a long day sharif went out shaking his head and dillon called sergeant parker on his mobile its dillon do you know a place called ramalla i certainly do youre taking us there tonight dress in civilian clothes and dont forget the browning like that is it if i leave now i could be with you in an hour dress smartly old son remember its the al bustan youve got to be joking parker laughed and switched off dillon then tried lacey and tracked him down in the mess dillon here hows everything with you there are some interesting people around but otherwise its boring since were on standby we cant have a drink whatever youre up to do get on with it old lad i cant promise but somewhere around midnight could be a possibility would that give you a problem red priority one sean they all jump to that theres a possible passenger but that would imply perfection in an imperfect world were entirely in your hands take care dillon snapped his codex four shut and turned to billy thats it for now lets try that bar sharif the old intelligence hand decided to brave greta novikova facetoface and knocked on the door of cottage seven she opened it dressed in a bathrobe a towel around her head ive seen them he said youd better come in and tell me everything which he did or his version of everything hes a hard one this dillon more than youll ever know but the important thing is youve made it clear that selim wont be there until tomorrow absolutely hed no reason not to believe me and any news from ramalla as i said definitely later tonight im going to check my sources now i have police contacts in the area a matter of some delicacy then get on with it i have zorin and makeev turning up soon she opened the door for him what is dillon doing now he told me they were going to the bar im sure he would she let him out stood there frowning for a moment then went into the bedroom and started to dress the bar and restaurant area was hardly busy with no more than a couple of dozen people scattered around the tables three or four on bar stools the fans stirred on the flaking ceiling the ornate mirrors at the back of the bar were cracked in places and here and there the wall was pockmarked with bullet holes but the two barmen wore white jackets the headwaiter a tuxedo they were all trying the war after all was over billy had two cameras slung around his neck and snapped away with genuine enthusiasm going out through the open french windows to the terrace and the floodlit pool area he returned great dillon just great we could make a movie dillon had discovered an acceptable bar champagne and toasted him just your thing billy youd look great in a white tuxedo well get harry to put up the money and then greta novikova walked into the bar elegant in a very simple black silk dress that was short but not too short set off by gold highheel shoes with her hair tied back i was wondering where youd got to dillon said but it was worth the wait girl you look grand youre a cheeky bastard dillon ill say that for you ill have champagne on the terrace she walked out heads turning and selected a table and dillon ordered a bottle of dom perignon from the headwaiter ferguson is obviously extremely generous when he allows you to order stuff like that greta said billy was seated on the balustrade snapping away oh dillons the man for you hes got plenty stacked away as the headwaiter uncorked the bottle and a waiter brought three glasses dillon said thats a great lie or part of a one billy here and his uncle harry have millions in property development by the thames but hes a boy of simple tastes prefers being a photographer photographer my ass she said to dillon in russian and what was that all about billy asked i couldnt bear to tell you dillon said but it was rude he turned to the headwaiter only two glasses the boy doesnt drink no he just shoots people when the mood takes him greta said and sipped some of her champagne i know very well who you are your uncle is one of the most notorious gangsters in london and youre not far behind ill have to run faster then dillon produced a pack of marlboros and gave her a light so where do we go from here you know what the game is or think you do but my game could be different from yours we russians can be very devious she emptied her glass in a quick swallow not vodka now theres a real drink buy a bottle and ill trade glass for glass with you billy was laughing youre one of a kind lady go on dillon give it a go and dillon liked her liked her more than any woman in a long time as she leaned across the table so close that he could smell her perfume her chin on one hand come on dillon she was challenging him now would you like to give it a go there was a pause then dillon said i capitulate he ordered a bottle of vodka which was provided almost instantly she insisted on having the first one i am the taster she took it straight back russian style and made a face now this one theyve made in some backyard in baghdad try it dillon he did and it burned like fire he coughed tears in his eyes well its not irish whiskey but itll do to take along lets save some for your friends theyll be joining you im sure she poured him another with a steady hand makeev and zorin sounds like a variety act billy said ah mr salter there you would be making a mistake they come highly recommended two men came out through the french windows strangely similar in black shirts and tan suits around forty hard and fit with militarystyle haircuts the nearest one said in russian major novikova igor zorin this is boris makeev make it english mr dillon here speaks russian almost as well as you do a man of taste which doesnt extend to his choice of vodkas makeev said but when youre irish anythings better than nothing i suppose makeev drank from the bottle made a face and spat it out onto the table spotting gretas dress control yourself she said angrily thats an order were not in the army now makeev told her were working for wages and i can tell you we dont take kindly to women who try to give orders billy took a step toward him and dillon said leave it sergeant parker appeared through the french windows wearing a dark blue blazer and flannel slacks he put his right hand inside the blazer and stood silent and watchful nothing to say makeev asked your hair fascinates me dillon said shaved off like that the two of you look like a couple of convicts on the run now the sas at hereford england grow their hair long because they dont know from one day to the next when they might have to go undercover but then theyre the best you cant be expected to compare why you little shit makeev said in russian leaned down to grab dillon by the shirtfront and was promptly headbutted he staggered back and billy put out a foot and tripped him following it up with a kick in the ribs nice one billy said as zorin picked his friend up greta jumped to her feet furious go to my cottage and wait for me now she added fiercely billy you just cant get good help these days dillon said i dont know what the worlds coming to billy was smiling but greta wasnt damn you to hell dillon and she turned and followed the other two down to the cottage area people had settled again unfazed by a minor affray in a city where bombs and violence were part of their daily lives parker said what in the hell was all that supposed to be about that ould son is the opposition but ill fill you in down at our cottage time to move out billy not that we actually unpacked its all go with you as they went down the steps from the terrace dillons codex four went it was sharif mr dillon selim arrived a short while ago at the farm were on our way dont forget half an hour and then call her as we arranged sharif switched off his mobile and stood there in the orange grove aware of the smell the lights of ramalla village over to his left the farm beside the tigris below and felt strangely sad had he done the right thing who knew it was in the hands of allah now in their cottage dillon brought parker up to speed and opened the hardware bag he produced two colt semiautomatics in ankle holsters and gave one to billy a womans gun parker said not with hollowpoint cartridges put a walther in your waistband behind your back billy he smiled at parker if anybody searching finds it they think thats it my god what is this the third gulf war so dillon told him afterward parker said i knew it was big when robson briefed me but this is something else a totally black operation thats the way we work you can sign the official secrets act later unless youd prefer not to billy said get stuffed like i said its got a bit boring lately dillon took an uzi machine pistol from the bag there are two of these in here so with your browning id say were ready to rock and roll just one thing parker said does all this mean you dont trust sharif no what it means is i dont trust anybody so we take the hardware bag leave anything else leave the lights on and the radio and leave the bill at reception billy said naturally i parked round the back ford station wagon then as they say in the movies lets get the show on the road dillon told him and some ten minutes later greta novikova was in the middle of telling zorin and makeev exactly what she thought of them when her mobile went it was sharif hes at ramalla arrived a short while ago excellent zorin and makeev are with me now do you want me to join you no meet us there do you still intend to dispose of them of course thats the whole point of the exercise does it give you a problem not at all ill see you later sharif switched off his mobile looked over at the farm beside the river for a moment then walked down through the orange trees toward it zorin drove makeev beside him in a jeep cherokee greta sitting in the back makeev was checking out an ak with a folding stock this should do the job he said laughing and punched zorin on the shoulder an easy one this not like hunting that iraqi general in basra youve worked for the americans greta asked good god no it was an honor killing hed raped somebodys wife in the saddam days the family wanted revenge we hunted him down in a sewer zorin said the family wanted his manhood but this fool got him with a stick grenade so there wasnt much left of his manhood makeev laughed uproariously not that youd know much of that kind of thing sitting behind a gru desk it occurred to her then that they were both on something and it wasnt drink she was wearing a black crepe trouser suit a purse in her lap she put a hand inside and found what she sought a makarov she fingered it not nervous just ready she had killed on occasion but these fools didnt know that oh i dont know there were sewers in kabul i was twentytwo years of age when the mujahidin finally chased us out in ninetytwo they had stopped laughing you were in afghanistan makeev sounded incredulous chechnya was worse now they really were sewers zorin swerved to avoid a line of donkeys with produce for tomorrows market his headlights picking them out careful she said severely we want to get there in one piece she took out a cigarette lit it and sat back the run to ramalla was smooth and took no more than fifty minutes dillon examined the map in the light of a flashlight as they got closer id say pull in on the edge of the orange grove on the hill thats not much more than a hundred yards away youll stay with the station wagon he told parker and miss all the fun no ride shotgun i never take anything for granted and there are night glasses in the bag he lit a cigarette ive never trusted anyone or anything in my life thats why im here later moving off the main road parker switched off the engine and coasted some distance down through the orange grove and halted the farm lay below a light in the windows there were two or three boats passing down the tigris toward baghdad it was extraordinarily peaceful they came to ramalla dillon said very biblical im not much on the bible billy said well i have the irish attitude theres nothing can happen in life that hasnt already happened in the bible he took two pairs of night glasses from the bag and gave one to parker take a look when he did himself the house was plainly visible with what looked like a barn on each side one of them damaged part of the roof gone there was a parked land rover thats the war for you dillon said and passed the glasses to billy notice the license plate on the land rover its kuwaiti billy passed them back so how do we do this well go down on foot you take the uzi and leave the other for the sergeant he turned to parker youve got the glasses monitor us what for exactly who knows just do it come on billy and he got out of the station wagon and started down the hill billy following they reached the damaged end of the farmhouse half the roof was gone what had been double barn doors missing it was dark inside but dillon took a chance and flicked on a small flashlight revealing some rusting farm machinery he switched off not much here there was a sudden rattling on the part of the roof left intact and rain fell in an absolute downpour christ billy said i thought this was iraq it rains in iraq billy sometimes it rains like hell in iraq he led the way along the front of the farmhouse and past the land rover there were shutters at the windows half closed and dillon peered in billy at his shoulder they saw a living room with a large table on which stood an oil lamp there were chairs a wooden sideboard a fire of logs on a stone hearth a radio was playing music softly but there was no sign of anyone well try the other barn dillon whispered and moved on there was a narrow window on each side of the barn door and dillon peered inside well theres your man billy take a look inside there were stalls for animals and a large loft with bales of hay and reeds there was also selim in a shirt and jeans clearing out a stall with a rake dillon said in we go he reached for the door handle and a donkey brayed at the back of the barn and several more answered and that was strange because at that time of night and in all that rain why would they not be in the barn but before he could react the tailgate of the land rover swung open behind him and sharif got out holding an ak two men in redandblackchecked kaffiyehs over their faces got out behind him also holding aks dillon had started to turn but the muzzle of sharifs gun touched his back i wouldnt i really wouldnt i have no desire to kill you or you mr salter please pass the uzi over fuck you billy said but did as he was told you should beware the wrath of allah mr salter jesus youre one of them dillon said sharif was searching them found the two walthers and passed them to his friends actually im not i dont care about al qaeda or wrath of allah or any of them im not even a good muslim but i love my country thats whats important to me and i want you all to go away including the russians especially the russians you think i want to see people like belov getting their hands on our oil running our country i think not now lets go inside and wait for major novikova and her friends itll be a nice surprise i think he pulled open the door and selim stopped raking and turned startled and then relieved major youve got him so it would seem me ould son dillon told him if youre interested ashimov and belov want you dead i on the other hand can cut you a deal with ferguson that could ensure your return to the delights of london they heard the sound of a car in the distance and sharif said get ready to close the door a little two more men stood up behind hay bales above in the loft on the other hand dillon said to selim as one of the men pulled on the door maybe you want to stay down on the farm all this had been seen by parker through the night glasses as he stood by the station wagon he reached for the uzi and at the same moment heard the approach of the cherokee and raised the night glasses again tracking the jeep as it descended from the main road to the farm it slowed on the final run and makeev clutching an ak rolled out headfirst and darted through long grass to the rear of the barn the jeep came to a halt behind the land rover zorin and greta novikova got out and at that moment the door of the barn swung open and sharif appeared with his friends it was enough and parker started down the hill at a run greta novikova said to sharif so youve betrayed us ive betrayed both sides ive thought it over carefully and decided to become a patriot which is what my four friends are i spoke to them and they were happy to oblige i think it would pay you to think again josef belov has a long arm never mind that what happened to makeev and dillon speculating stuck his oar in that would be me the bastard was rude to the lady on the terrace of the hotel and i broke his nose for him he smiled amiably or something like that in fact makeev at that moment having gained access to the barn through a rear door was mounting wooden steps to the entrance to the left but his progress was awkward the steps breaking away with some noise one of the men in the loft appeared cried out an alarm and fired hitting makeev in the chest and makeev shot him in return then fell backward down the stairs down below dillon nodded to billy and they both pulled the colts from their ankle holsters and confronted sharif and his men nobody fired there was a kind of tableau a frozen moment the door swinging all the way back in the wind rain driving in sharif raised his ak im sorry mr dillon and parker appeared in the doorway and shot him twice what happened then was very fast very quick dillon swung threw himself at greta flinging her out of the way get in one of the stalls he cried as bullets shredded the floor beside him from the loft he turned firing twice and the man up there came down headfirst billy had dodged into the shelter of a stall and picked off one man carefully a bullet to the head and shot the other in the back as he turned to run away there was silence and then parker walked in soaked jesus was all he could say selim cowered on hands and knees in one of the stalls and zorin had produced a pistol greta moved out into the open for gods sake put it away weve lost sharif groaned and moved a little and dillon dropped to one knee not that there was much to be done sharif couldnt even manage a smile as dillon stood up zorin moved in behind him and put his pistol to his back ive had enough for one night so im leaving and taking this bastard with me he glanced at greta you want to come get over here as you say i like that maybe i could teach you how to do as youre told she was very close to him but i always do she took out the makarov rammed it into his back and shot him twice he went down like a stone now what billy asked dillon another bad night in iraq billy we get the hell out of here he nodded to parker you did well he turned to selim i could shoot you but youll do better with ferguson stay here and youre a dead man one way or another when ashimov hears youre on the loose he turned to greta isnt that so major id have to agree but you didnt shoot me you shot your own man selim argued it makes no sense well shes a woman dillon pushed him over to parker get him in the station wagon parker took selim away a hand on his arm and dillon and greta paused in the doorway billy watching his uzi back in his hands dillon gave her a cigarette took one himself and lit them with his old zippo give you a lift lady i dont think so ill take the cherokee get back to the al bustan and pack next step for you is the airport i imagine why did you do it does it really matter lets say i liked you and i didnt like them and sharif as it happened screwed things up bigtime yeah but wheres that leave you with ashimov and belov billy demanded oh ill give a satisfactory version of events im good at that and theres no one to contradict me dillon opened the door of the cherokee and said in you go girl which she did and put down the window he leaned in i owe you one i owe you a life that means a lot to an arab dillon but youre irish and a bastard a charming one but thats what you are she switched on the engine buy me a drink at the dorchester sometime and well call it quits its a deal one more thing she smiled out at him im still on the other side i never doubted it she drove away and billy said thats a hell of a woman a oneoff billy now lets get moving they started up to the orange grove and he took out his codex four and called lacey were on our way plus the passenger i mentioned no problem sean ive spoken to robson so it was all in the security pipeline ill confirm it now well be waiting was it rough you wouldnt want to know that bad ah well see you soon dillon took out his cigarettes and said to selim who sat between him and billy do you use these selim was trembling a little not for years then have one now itll help settle your nerves stay here and belovs people will get you one way or another but youre too valuable to waste which is why im taking you back to ferguson as ive told you play ball and youll be fine but my roots are here bollocks billy said look out there at the romance of iraq bleeding peasants at this time of night in the pouring rain leading donkeys for the morning market in baghdad to make a few bob its a shithole and youre british anyway dillon said born in london went to st pauls cambridge you went to st pauls billy said i didnt know that i was there for two years my uncle harry wanted to make a gentleman of me selim was interested in spite of himself what happened they expelled me when i was sixteen for beating up two prefects ive never told anyone that before not even you dillon well there you go dillon smiled a great man once said england was a splendid tolerant and noble country and even though im irish id have to agree lets put it this way there are mosques all over london the first thing greta did at the cottage when she got back was to call and arrange an earlymorning departure for the falcon then she phoned ashimov finding him in bed because in london it was three in the morning he was all attention sat up and reached for a cigarette hows it going im on my way back thats how its going sharif sold us out ill have his balls for that i promise no need they ambushed us at ramalla dillon slater and sharif there was a firefight zorin and makeev were killed i managed to shoot sharif and got away in the darkness i saw dillon salter and some other men take selim away to a station wagon i was close enough to hear dillon say something like lets get out of here next stop the airport i waited until theyd gone and came back to the house in the jeep its like a black comedy he said a total farce im sure theyre going to squeeze selim dry in some london safe house she said yes ill have to find out where that is but at least youre safe my love ill expect you tomorrow she put the phone down quite pleased with herself and went to bed at baghdad airport they gained access through a discreet security entrance where robson and lacey waited in a land rover follow us sergeant straight to the plane robson called they did and found the citation waiting ready to go the two vehicles stopped at the bottom of the steps and they all got out robson said please board now gentlemen youve sort of never been here if you follow me much better all round youve got a good man here dillon turned and shook hands with parker well do it again sometime once around the houses with you is enough for any man but good luck billy pushed selim up the steps dillon followed and then lacey who closed the door selim sank into a seat lacey joined parry in the cockpit dillon took out his codex four and called ferguson as greta had done with ashimov finding him in bed who in the hell is it at this time in the morning dillon just leaving baghdad airport have you got him that we have was it bad oh the usual billy did well two more notches and novikova still in one piece quite a girl but ill tell you later good man sean well be waiting at farley the citation started along the runway lifted and rose very quickly billy tilted his seat im for a nap he said and closed his eyes selim was shaking slightly and dillon opened one of the lockers produced a blanket there you go wrap yourself in that selim said in a small voice thank you mr dillon dillon opened the bar box found half a bottle of bushmills whiskey and a glass into which he poured a large one that committee for racial harmony youve been sitting on at the house of commons play your cards right and you could be back there before you know it sitting on the terrace by the thames with tea cakes and cucumber sandwiches think about it he sat back and poured himself another whiskey london the citation landed at farley field at ten in the morning under gray skies and heavy rain remarkably like iraq ferguson waited in the daimler hannah bernstein standing beside it in a raincoat an umbrella over her head behind them was a land rover containing two men in civilian clothes they were in fact staff sergeants in the royal military police named miller and dalton and they worked for ferguson at the holland park safe house as the citation rocked to a halt they got out of the car the door of the plane opened the steps came down lacey came first followed by dillon selim behind him huddled in his blanket billy was next and then parry ferguson went to greet them he said formally you are dr ali selim thats right selim seemed quite calm now ferguson turned and said to hannah superintendent there was a reluctance to her but she said under the antiterrorism act you may be held indefinitely under the official secrets act you may not speak of it or why you are here am i not entitled to a lawyer selim asked no ferguson turned to the staff sergeants deliver him to the safe house treat him well give him a change of clothes and whatever food he wants remember that hes a muslim hannah said id like to go with him sir the military police were putting selim in the rear of the land rover and ferguson took hannah to one side i know you dont approve my dear but desperate situations require desperate remedies however were not the gestapo we wont mistreat him now off you go ill see you later she turned to dillon obviously unhappy good to see you back sean dillon felt sorry for her but it was billy who said dont waste your sympathy superintendent theyd have killed us and they tried hard enough even wanted to kill selim people like you your conscience your morality nothings ever enough is it dillon said leave it son and she turned and got in the land rover and was driven away the rain suddenly increased billy said to hell with it its me for the dark man and a full english breakfast an excellent idea ferguson turned to lacey and parry my thanks gentlemen well be seeing each other soon im sure he got in the daimler with dillon and billy and was driven away the dark man like most london pubs these days offered breakfast dora was on duty greeted them with enthusiasm and vanished into the kitchen the place was quiet and they settled in a booth and five minutes later harry burst in with joe baxter and sam hall he embraced billy in a bear hug jesus that was quick the way it happened harry dillon said salter turned to his nephew what was it like baghdad well it wasnt like a sinbad movie it was pissing with rain most of the time to be honest harry i feel sorry for them so you got selim dillon glanced at ferguson who nodded you might as well tell him which dillon did as dora arrived with the breakfasts afterward harry put an arm around billy you young bastard youve done it again we were lucky this time billy told him or at least dillon was if it hadnt been for novikova hed have been a dead man that makeev creep was a bad sod so what happens now harry demanded well put selim into a safe house ferguson said well see what hes got to say so you wont be standing him up at the old bailey harry said for conspiracy in mrs morgans death its pointless we wouldnt get anywhere whats far more important is information about what selims been up to with the wrath of allah and how are you going to get that this isnt the algerian war and the french foreign legion youre not going to wire up his bits and pieces to a car battery there are more subtle ways the superintendent wasnt very happy billy said with all that antiterrorism act stuff and the fact that he doesnt get a lawyer it cant be helped as i said earlier we live in difficult times it is war to the knife things have changed speaking of which you know about the omega program dillon harry said and what would that be its an implant containing a computer chip that tracks a persons whereabouts the prime minister and cabinet ministers each have one he insisted i had it done last year at the time he didnt want it spread any further but hes changed his mind since the attempt on cazalet he wants us to use every tool at our disposal and hes authorized me to include anyone i think appropriate so im insisting that you dillon and the superintendent get it also major ropers already got one he gave dillon a card professor henry merriman harley street nine oclock tomorrow morning christ billy said bionic man harry burst into laughter ferguson said not so fast billy youve gotten yourself up to your neck in my affairs for some time now and this particular situation is bad and getting worse so under the circumstances i think youd better have one implanted too it was dillons turn to laugh there goes your love life billy billy did not look amused ashimov was still at drumore place and arranged for a company car to pick novikova up at belfast airport then he phoned belov in moscow and broke the bad news belov took it badly here i am up to my neck in difficult negotiations and this kind of thing happens it wont do yuri i put you in charge gave you unlimited discretion total resources unlimited money im sorry josef makeev and zorin came highly recommended they did good work in the past and now theyre dead along with this sharif and his four friends the only one who comes out of it with any credit is novikova dillon and this salter boy are serious business i agree then deal with them seriously enough messing about you tell me kelly and murphy knew him in the ira fine that means theyll know how he works tell them to get a crew together and to sort fergusons people out once and for all just get it done im coming to belfast myself i had planned to return to london but under the circumstances i think its best i stay away let them do their work dont fail me yuri greta arrived soon afterward and yuri greeted her warmly did you manage to get any sleep i had a couple of vodkas and crashed out for most of the trip good were driving down to the royal george for lunch i want you to meet dermot kelly and tod murphy they went out to the car what about belov ive spoken to him and he wants us to go to war ill explain as we go at the royal george they sat in a corner booth with kelly and murphy enjoyed a shepherds pie with guinness and greta gave her version of the events at ramalla they found the whole thing very amusing and it occurred to her and not for the first time that the irish were not like other people they never seemed to take anything seriously it made her think of dillon and in a way that didnt sit comfortably with her jesus but seans the one kelly said youve got to give it to the bastard mind you this billy salters close behind him tod murphy said maybe his mother was a cork woman no that was ferguson kelly said she was a cork woman its a known fact it was greta exasperated who said well if youve finished exploring the niceties of irish family relationships could we decide exactly what you intend to do oh tods the planning genius when you can get his nose out of a book kelly told her well get together some of the old outfit tod said me and dermot and two others that will be enough for dillon and salter i wonder how will you travel ashimov asked theres a fella i know called smith who runs air taxis not far from here hes been doing illegal flights for years goes in under six hundred feet so hes not on the radar has a navajo twinengine job thatll do six there are still old world war two airstrips here and there where the local farmer looks the other way if theres enough money in the envelope saves going through security and we can take the right hardware and where will you stay in kilburn ashimov asked naming the most irish borough in london virtually a ghetto if theres ever a hint of ira trouble scotland yard makes straight for kilburn kelly said weve got contacts that could help but its best to keep out of there in fact well try indian territory he glanced at murphy china wharf perfect thats in wapping kelly said its an old tea warehouse owned by tods aunt molly she married an englishman named harris special branch never knew about her she turned it into a lodging house years ago we used to use it as a bolthole in london shes a widow lady of eightythree tod said cant be bothered anymore so she lives on the ground floor and leaves the other rooms empty sounds good to me ashimov got up you sort it all out move when you want to meanwhile greta will research where ferguson keeps his safe houses fine by us kelly said good afterward yuri and greta walked down toward the pier its beautiful she said as they looked over the tiny harbor theres not much going on these days only half a dozen fishing boats and theyre out at the moment the boat at the end of the pier is dermots the kathleen hes had her for years shes his pride and joy it was a thirtyfoot cabin cruiser shabby with paint peeling and greta said it doesnt look like much it snt meant to but its got twin screws radar automatic steering and a depth sounder everything you need for an illegal passage by night plus thirty knots he lit a cigarette come on ill show you the rest of the estate and then its back to london jake cazalet was sitting at his desk in the oval office signing papers when blake johnson came in ive just had charles ferguson on the line mr president dillon seems to have come through bigtime tell me blake did and afterward the president said the man never ceases to amaze me so what happens now ferguson will squeeze selim dry if he can any leads they can prise out of him could prove invaluable you dont need to tell me naturally theyll pass all the relevant information on to us id expect them to in this blake we must rely on ferguson selim is a british citizen he sighed and shook his head my god the times we live in he smiled suddenly i shouldnt think josef belovs too happy about all this i shouldnt imagine he is sir and blake went out on a quiet side road in holland park stood an edwardian town house in the middle of about an acre of gardens surrounded by high walls a sign at the electronic gate said pine groves nursing home it was in fact fergusons safe house hannah miller and dillon delivered selim there and were admitted by military police wearing a kind of uniform of navy blue blazers and flannel slacks selim said nursing home we have medical facilities said dillon so its not a total lie dont be deceived by appearances security is everything here the police may not be in army uniform but theyre all armed there are no bars but the windows are electrically wired this is a fortress doctor selim resign yourself to that now sergeant dalton will show you to your room well talk later selim was amazed at his treatment the room was decent with a window overlooking the garden a selection of clothes was available in the drawers and a closet he showered and changed then miller took him down to a sitting room of sorts with a table chairs a gas fire and a mirror dalton said were aware of your food requirements so the chef has prepared a special meal the door opened and miller came in with a tray which he placed on the table if theres anything unsatisfactory please say so sir no this is fine selim sat down and started to eat i would appreciate some tea which was provided and he continued to eat and on the other side of the mirror ferguson dillon hannah and roper watched waiting until he had finished miller reappeared and took away the tray dalton waited watchful selim raised his voice if you are there behind the mirror general ferguson do come in now whatever else i may be im not a fool dillon grinned at the general right in we go people ferguson said and led the way ferguson nodded to dalton if youd go into the other room and observe id appreciate it certainly sir roper maneuvered his wheelchair as hannah and ferguson sat down dillon sat on the windowsill smoking a cigarette to clarify things ferguson said im responsible for the prime ministers personal security system i have no connection with the other security services i have carte blanche on behalf of the prime minister to operate as i see fit detective superintendent bernstein is my assistant on loan from special branch at scotland yard and mr dillon i know what mr dillon does he kills people and wrath of allah doesnt dillon asked superintendent i appeal to you why am i denied a lawyer is this just hannah had trouble with that and it showed she turned to ferguson sir perhaps perhaps nothing major roper why dont you begin roper said ive prepared a report dr selim it details your relationship to henry morgan and of course his intention to assassinate the president of the united states it outlines the suspicious death of his mother it makes clear the basic links between these two and the queen street mosque as well as your relationship with yuri ashimov and through him josef belov none of this can be proven selim said but his voice was subdued theres little doubt that there has been a trade in young british muslims recruited for terrorist camps originally in iraq now in various muslim countries i have in my possession considerable confidential information regarding the traffic between the belov organization and you acting as a front man for a number of socalled charities all of it perfectly legitimate selim said weakly anything else is a lie many donations to the childrens trust in beirut all for charitable works education charitable the childrens trust is a front of hizbollah thats well known both the marxist league and free the people have links with al qaeda the childrens trust in iraq is simply another way of saying party of god one of the most militant terror groups none of this can be proved selim was desperate now all the trusts the educational groups any payments by me on the belov companys behalf were made in good faith you cant say otherwise mr belov paid for our building work at queen street even the new school i have a list of organizations youve passed money to roper said its a fact im running out of patience ferguson told him im the first to agree that we stand very little chance of bringing belov to a courtroom hes too rich too powerful and hes covered his back too well what i want from you are details of the camps the lists of organizations names and addresses do that properly and youll be let off the hook slate clean i cant selim said weakly all right if thats the way it is then ill have you flown back to iraq or saudi arabia if you like well dump you then spread the word that you talked if youre lucky belovs people will get to you first a bullet would be preferable to being skinned alive by your own people dont you think selim jumped up no i beg you think about it selim think hard ill give you a little time come along people and he led the way out in the other room ferguson said to dalton keep a close eye on him sergeant anything comes up phone me otherwise well speak tomorrow fine sir dalton went out ferguson said to the others any questions roper said ill get back to my computers sir miller can take me in the van ill go with you dillon said you can drop me off hannah said i have to confess i still dont find this easy sir his lack of legal representation you think were infringing on his human rights superintendent i suppose so well in the circumstances in which we find ourselves im not very interested in such a viewpoint does this mean that you would prefer to return to your normal duties at scotland yard she hesitated you make it hard for me sir i have to but ill give you an option tomorrow morning when you go to harley street to see merriman to have the omega implant i suggest you visit the reverend susan hadentaylor at st pauls church you may recall i put dillon in touch with her last year when i wanted his head cleared after the rashid affair and you think she could help shes a priest of the church of england as well as a top psychiatrist dillon said but most important shes a truly good human being and she certainly helped me hannah took a deep breath fine ill do that and she went out dillon walked behind ropers chair with ferguson you can be a hard ould bastard charles its a hard ould world sean and getting harder they stood and watched roper wheel up the ramp into the back of the van miller raised the ramp and closed the door and dillon called wait for me he turned to ferguson are we winning charles god knows but as ive said before we wont if we just play pattycake and ferguson got in the daimler and was driven away dillon got in the rear of the van beside ropers chair well he demanded what do you think ropers eyes were dark in the ravaged burned face dont ask me sean im whats left over after a car bomb about ten miles from drumore place tod murphy turned the land rover into a narrow lane and came to a couple of hangars a decaying control tower and a crumbling tarmac runway if ever a place looked rundown it was this but then world war two and the days when it had been used to patrol the irish borders had been over for a long time a singleengine archer stood outside one of the hangars the doors of the other stood open revealing a twinengine navajo the door of the nissen hut opened and a man in old black flying overalls appeared ted smith around fifty balding slightly and like many pilots rather small is it yourself tod who else would it be you daft bugger is the navajo up and running first class you fancy a day out you could say that four of us me dermot and two of the boys fahy and regan what for a days fishing over the border farther than that that place we used to go in the old days before the bloody peace process dunkley the one that was a lancaster bomber station in the war smiths face dropped jesus tod not that again i thought those days were behind us youll do as youre told and youll be well taken care of but if you say no dermot is likely to take care of you permanently you follow he laughed and slapped smith on the shoulder dont look so worried a quick one ted just like the old days in and out youll be away before you know it jesus tod i dont know im getting old for that sort of jig tod took an envelope from his inside pocket and offered it to him two thousand quid to seal the bargain just to be going on with well leave early in the morning when we want to come back ill phone you therell be a big big payday at the end of it and just for dropping us onto a very old airfield in kent miles from anywhere as usual greed won the day and smith took the envelope all right ill do it tod seventhirty in the morning good man yourself ill see you then and tod got back into the land rover damn the ira but what could he do smith turned and went back into the nissen hut and at half past seven the following morning the navajo fully loaded took off in spite of smiths reluctance theres a lot of bad weather out there a front moving in over the irish sea then well rely on the ham sandwiches and good irish whiskey to keep our spirits up dermot told him jesus tod weve done this run at night in the old days and black as the hob of hell so lets get on with it which they did and the whiskey flowed as the navajo was pushed by a fierce tailwind over the irish sea dampening the spirits of kellys men they crossed the english coast over morecambe it was raining even harder now a front advancing as they turned down toward the south country as smith adjusted his course kelly sitting beside him said everything okay it should start to quiet down if it doesnt we could always turn back you wouldnt want to do that then id have to break your legs wouldnt i dermot smiled looking terrible just get on with it and he got up and joined the others in the cabin it was raining in london too a short time later as billy got out of a cab at professor merrimans office in harley street and went inside dillon and hannah bernstein were already in reception the young nurse behind the desk said whos first thatll be me hannah told her ive got another appointment then follow me please in his office merriman greeted her warmly while the nurse busied herself with items on a side table it only takes a moment superintendent but youll have to remove your blouse you can keep your bra on i only need an armpit will it hurt hannah asked as she took off her blouse not with this an excellent anesthetic the nurse handed him a plastic ampule there was a slight prick on her arm and the skin went numb its instant he said and the nurse handed him a sort of aluminum pistol he placed the muzzle into her right armpit and pulled the trigger she didnt feel a thing is that it she asked as she pulled her blouse on absolutely your implant is already code indexed into the omega computer where you go it goes im not sure im happy about that its a tool superintendent thats all a reflection of the world we live in she pulled on her jacket and coat thats one way of looking at it she said tell me st pauls church is near here i believe end of the street and turn left thank you and good morning she went out and was followed by the nurse who called billy in dillon stood up on your way already i have an appointment at st pauls shes a remarkable lady and good at extracting confessions i should know ill see you later then back at the office she left and billy emerged no big deal good i hate needles billy said ill see you later ive got a bit of business back at the dark man youre an idiot billy smuggled cigarettes from amsterdam and you dont even need the money youll be back behind bars at wandsworth thatll be the day billy said and left when dillon emerged into harley street it was still raining he lit a cigarette looked down the pavement in the direction hannah had gone and walked the same way st pauls church was on the other side of the street when he turned the corner a notice board in front with the times of services and the name of the priest he went up the steps eased open the small judas gate in the main door and stepped inside it was victorian a halfdark sort of place and there was the smell of damp candles and incense he noticed a statue of the virgin and child more candles flickering there all very oldfashioned church of england except for the newer fashion that allowed women priests susan hadentaylor was a calm pleasant woman in a clerical collar and cassock she was sitting on the opposite side of the aisle from hannah two pews away but facing her yes she was saying charles ferguson has spoken to me of your dilemma and his and his hannah was astonished and showed it yes there are always two sides to everything however simplistic that may sound charles tells me you read psychology at cambridge thats right and that your father is arnold bernstein i know his work one of the finest general surgeons in london and my grandfather is rabbi julian bernstein leaving you totally walled in by morality something like that at the back of the church dillon sat on a chair behind a pillar in the corner and listened during my time with the police said hannah ive killed when i had no choice and ive been wounded myself i even killed a woman once a truly evil person who was trying to kill a friend i could accept all this as somehow being part of the job so what is the problem now you know you can speak freely as both a priest and a psychiatrist i must keep your confidence hannah told her when she was done susan hadentaylor said im not taking sides just examining the situation in spite of what hes been responsible for you want selim to have a legal representative which means due process of law and an eventual trial which will probably take six months to come to court if not longer i know all the difficulties whereas ferguson wants the details of all those whove passed through this wrath of allah organization before they have time to set more bombs off in pursuit of that aim he obviously feels that giving selim a hard time is worth it dont you dammit hannah was extremely frustrated it makes me sound so bloody unreasonable ive been raised on the law i believe in the law its all weve got so do i but the times are changing very rapidly and we must face that global terrorism provides a whole new perspective its not that youre wrong hannah but its not that ferguson is wrong either and one final point as in all things each of us has personal choice which means if you really feel strongly about this matter it would be better if you resigned better for yourself in fact better for everyone how strange hannah said that makes me feel as if id be running away its the best i can do im afraid can i offer you a cup of tea no thanks id better get on dillon got up at once and slipped out through the judas gate where he lit a cigarette and stood waiting she came out a few minutes later what are you doing here oh i thought id hang around outside and see how you got on you were right she is a remarkable woman they started along harley street are you still with us then i suppose so ill give it another week or two and see as i was leaving she said the strangest thing and what was that that when christ told us to turn the other cheek he didnt tell us to do it twice what on earth is that supposed to mean dillon grinned it makes perfect sense to me and he hailed a cab at dunkley in kent the visibility was poor in the pouring rain as smith eased the navajo down on the old decaying bomber runway and rolled to a halt by the decrepit hangars a white ford transit was parked nearby a man in a cloth cap and bomber jacket holding an umbrella tod got the door open and they all piled out with their bags smith peered out and kelly said keep your mobile with you at all times when i call you come running you can rely on me dermot but im best out of it now he closed the door went into the cockpit and took off fast a moment later dermot led the way to the transit holding out his hand so you came yourself danny he turned to fahy and regan danny malone runs the best pub in kilburn the green man and a good friend from the great days sure and i thought id come myself dermot they got in and he climbed behind the wheel and ive spoken to your aunt molly about china wharf only she isnt there dermot shes spending time at brighton with an old friend well thats a damn shame tod put in no trouble she told me where a key was hidden and i checked and it was there ive been to the supermarket stocked you up with provisions youll be as right as rain the job is it big when the times right kelly said dillons involved thats all you need to know maybe well get him this time at the ministry of defence hannah knocked on the door of fergusons office and went in followed by dillon ferguson at his desk looked up and sat back so youre both part of omega now we should form a club a very exclusive one sir hannah said did you see susan hadentaylor she nodded and what did she think what did you expect her to think dillon said that difficult decisions are the privilege of rank whereas we the poor bloody foot soldiers just pull the trigger oh shut up for once dillon ferguson told him have you made any decision yet superintendent if i could think it over for a week or so sir ill soldier on the phone rang he picked it up ferguson suddenly he smiled excellent ill be with you shortly he put the phone down it looks like youll have to superintendent that was dalton selim wants to see me youd both better come along china wharf was a relic of the old tea clipper days but times had changed and most of the warehouses were developed or boarded up and awaiting their turn danny malone unlocked the door and led the way in followed by the others there was a large sitting room all the furniture oldfashioned a kitchen on the same scale he put the key on the table two bedrooms and a bathroom down the hall five bedrooms and two bathrooms upstairs from when it was a lodging house itll be fine kelly said and turned to tod ill phone ashimov and let him know we made it then well get together with him and novikova see what shes got he rubbed his hands together now bacon and eggs a good old fryup sounds good to me but whos going to cook it thats the thing well not me danny malone said ill be off now you let me know if theres anything else i can do and he went out at holland park they stood with miller and looked through the false mirror selim sat at the table drinking tea while dalton sat on the other side and they chatted you are a very reasonable man mr dalton selim was saying miller said freds done a really good job on him general i actually think hes about ready to see reason then in we go and ferguson led the way selim and dalton stopped talking and dalton stood up but selim remained seated you wanted to see me ferguson said do i assume youre going to be sensible general i know you are not the gestapo you wont wire up my extremities or inject me with succinylcholine or put me in a bath of water until i nearly drown it isnt the british way but i do know that you will sentence me to death if as you have threatened you return me to iraq or anywhere else in the middle east so what is your decision im a contemptible coward who believed in my mission but is quite simply afraid to die as you rightly point out it would be slow and painful so yes i will cooperate fine ferguson stayed calm but you must tell me everything and i do mean everything not only the names of the wretched young men drawn into your world of violence but the identities of your sponsors the moneymen the belovs selim was just as calm you can never touch belov hes much too powerful that may be true but we can damn well try good luck to you however i do have terms terms ferguson frowned certainly i will deal only with you i will talk only with you mr dillon may have saved my life in iraq but he killed friends of mine while doing it i respect superintendent bernstein but she is jewish and it would not be seemly the sergeants have treated me decently so i have no objection to them however i dont like this place he shook his head i really dont like it at all we are in the middle of london there are too many of my brothers around here too many people who would surely try to kill me if they knew i was here no matter how good the security is is there somewhere else we could go jesus son you dont want much dillon said hannah turned to ferguson huntley hall sir its away from here and the securitys just as good thats true roper could come down and handle the technical stuff no selim said i said only you and i meant it i shouldnt think that would be a problem sir hannah said roper could handle it by remote hes done it before selim said huntley hall its a lovely old house in st leonards forest near horsham about an hour and a half from london it used to be lord favershams place when he died he left it to the nation theres lots of woodland excellent pheasant shooting and now youve turned it into the kind of place where the only things that get shot are intruders dillon laughed youll love it ferguson stood up and said to dalton and miller get him ready ill go home and pack when i return well drive down to huntley be prepared to stay for as long as it takes dr selim ill see you later they took him out and ferguson turned to dillon and hannah its something of a surprise but ill take it as far as i can youre in charge here superintendent very well sir you can rely on me and you ferguson said try to behave yourself dont i always dillon said thatll be the day ferguson said and led the way out it was approximately an hour and a half later that he returned this time in a cab bag in hand fifteen minutes later the land rover emerged miller and dalton in the front ferguson and selim in the rear a few yards down the road a telecom van was parked a manhole cover was up and a man in helmet and yellow jacket was working he had a clear look as the land rover went by and spoke into a small mike in russian land rover just coming your way now two in the front ferguson and selim in the rear stick to them like glue ill notify major novikova the land rover paused at the end of the oneway street then turned into the main road a motorcycle ridden by a man in black leather emerged from a side street and took up station staying well back at china wharf while fahy and regan did the cooking kelly contacted ashimov so here we are what next well come round and see you to discuss that greta did some research in her gru files and discovered that ferguson has a safe house in holland park well thats useful is selim there id be amazed if he wasnt just to make sure though shes got a couple of her people from the embassy on watch there posing as workmen ill let you know what they find out he drove to the embassy and found greta in her office putting papers into her briefcase she looked flushed and excited it marches yuri it marches not only was selim definitely in the safe house hes now left he was seated with ferguson behind two men in a land rover its definite so where were they going i dont know but my numbertwo man a young lieutenant called ivanov is on their trail on a motorcycle is he any good excellent they wont give him the slip even if they try then while were waiting to hear what he comes up with lets go visit those irish clods at china wharf the land rover moved south out of london through heavy traffic to leatherhead then onward to dorking stopping on the other side for fuel it was busy with plenty of cars around and ivanov was able to be unobtrusive he called greta just as she was arriving at china wharf with ashimov he told her where he was the main road leads to horsham does that make any sense plenty i think you may find a village near there named huntley stay with it and call me back huntley ashimov said fergusons other safe house she held up her briefcase its all in here good then lets go in the road to st leonards forest passed through impressive woodland but was not very busy only the occasional car and the odd farm vehicle ivanov stayed way back allowing anything that came to overtake him the road was comparatively straight and he was able to keep the land rover in view far up front in the end he had luck but you always needed that a large agricultural container truck came up behind him and he pulled over to let it pass it provided perfect cover for another couple of miles and he stayed well back looking beyond it until he saw the land rover turn off the road he slowed taking his time allowing the truck to move on and came to high walls topped by what to his practiced eye looked like an electronic fence there was a gate obviously also electronic a small lodge and a sign that said huntley hall institution he kept on going the walls extended for about a quarter of a mile the grounds heavily wooded he had a glimpse of the roof of a large house in the distance no more and then he came to the village of huntley itself very english very traditional cottages scattered on the main street a stone bridge over a brook a village store a fuel station and a pub called the huntley arms he stopped for fuel and a young woman served him his english was perfect which was how he had been trained i seemed to get lost in horsham i wanted to cut across to the brighton road keep going youll come to the a twentythree and thatll take you all the way down to brighton this is certainly an outoftheway place thats true nothing much happens here he followed her to the kiosk and got his money out what was that place i passed huntley park institution some sort of medical outfit people in rehab or that sort of thing i wouldnt know really they keep to themselves he noticed there were a dozen trailers scattered in the woodland at the back of the garage who do you rent those to nobodys staying now birdwatchers sometimes people down for the shooting we get quite busy in the summer i like this place he said give me a card which she did and he added while im here i might as well have something to eat is the pub any good its all right pies sandwiches that sort of thing you wont find anyone in there now except my granddad hes got nothing better to do than drink beer with no one staying in the trailers he gave her a dazzling smile ill give it a go she was right for when he went in the pub it was exactly what he would have expected a stoneflagged floor an oaken bar backed by bottles a beamed ceiling about twenty empty tables and a log fire on an open hearth an old man in a padded jacket and tweed cap was seated by the fire drinking a pint of beer a middleaged woman appeared from somewhere at the back of the bar drying her hands can i help you sir took the wrong road from horsham and lost my way ill have a beer just one since im driving and maybe you could find me a cheese sandwich the young lady at the garage suggested i come in that would be betty my granddaughter the old man called harold lakers my name maybe i could buy you a beer ivanov said a pint of bitter wouldnt be a burden the old scrounger the woman smiled go on you join him and ill bring your drinks and the sandwiches harold laker was eighty years old and boasted of it hed been born on a local farm worked all his life in the village and he demolished a pint and accepted another as ivanov kept him talking of course it wasnt just the farming in the old days there was the fishing the foxhunting though thats long gone the shootings really the only big thing left in season what kind of birds all kinds good pheasant especially on the estate when lord faversham was alive i used to carry his guns load for him wonderful wildlife on the estate rabbits hares not these days mind you why not well when he died he left it to the nation and the powers that be turned it into some sort of medical institution i noticed it when i was driving in what goes on in there nobody really knows but they do say its for people with head problems never see any of them round here mind you he sighed it was a poachers paradise that estate i suppose you had your share but not now with all that security electric fences cameras at the gate and inside the grounds really and how would you know that well lets just say if i want a bird or two or a hare or a nice pheasant i know where to go you amaze me the old man patted the side of his nose with his finger mums the word you dont always need to go over a fence there was cunning in his eyes and ivanov laughed you old devil you obviously know what other people dont he rose well i must be away its been great talking to you mr laker he went to the counter and paid his bill and give him another pint he can talk the hind leg off a donkey she said oh hes all right reminds me of my grandfather you never know what you can learn when he rode away he took the road back to horsham slowing to have another look at the gates as he went past huntley hall about four miles farther on he turned into a nice quiet turnoff in some trees and called greta novikova who was seated at the sittingroom table at china wharf with ashimov and the four irishmen various documents spread in front of her ivanov what have you got for me ferguson has definitely taken selim to huntley hall but theres a lot more to it than that shall i leave it until i get back to london no i want it now just let me plug in my recorder when he was finished she cut in the recorder still on what do you think about harold laker hes like my grandfather in ukraine a cunning old peasant if you want my opinion hes known that estate all his life and he poaches it to suit himself but how with all that security all i know is the old bugger said when he needed a bird or two or a rabbit or a hare he knew where to go and i quote you dont always need to go over a fence hes got a way in she said and there was awe in her voice id say so youve done well come home sergei she hung up and turned to ashimov what do you think well have to send one of these lads for a little chat with mr laker but first things first lets have a look at those plans you showed us greta she laid them out huntley hall quite plain and the rolling areas of woodland you can see where there are cctv cameras and electronic devices in the trees at certain points mind you these plans arent perfect why not kelly demanded because theyre based on memory five years ago we had a british spy called sharkey in our hands in moscow and an exchange was arranged for one of our men orlov who was being held at huntley hall on the odd occasion he was allowed out for a walk in the grounds and picked up a certain amount of visual information tod said sounds risky then im inclined to go with what ivanovs said the old man has a way in i think kelly and i should go down there in the morning well put up at this trailer site ivanov mentioned get to know the old boy and find out his secret by breaking his fingers oh you always want to do things the hard way dermot no three bottles of bushmills should do it and hell turn out to be as greedy as people like him usually are he turned to greta ivanov didnt sound russian what i heard does he have any kind of accent no he was picked out because his mother was english right so hes your english nephew dermot who told you about the place thats why were calling in on our way to london from brighton it was ashimov who said sounds good to me but lets take it a step further if in some way you can gain access to the grounds whats the next move there isnt one tod said not in advance if hes taken out for a walk when were around well shoot him and if not well handle things the way the cards fall there was silence then fahy said what about us youll keep your eye on major roper youve got all his details you need tod said even you cant miss a bionic man in a wheelchair do we waste him if we get the chance regan demanded no you wait to hear how we fare with ferguson and selim and dillon fahy asked you could try greta said and pushed some papers over to them thats his cottage in stable mews and a recent photo of him also his mini car and its number tod laughed did you itemize his body count i didnt want to frighten anyone off she pushed some other papers over dillons friends the salters the young one is as bad as dillon and his uncle was one of the biggest gangsters in london in his time so be warned if the need for any extras arises while were away she went on a car or something like that you call danny malone hell fix you up he used to be a supplier for the provos the only one left is bernstein the special branch superintendent huh fahy said im not worried about her woman coppers should stick to desk work i wouldnt be so sure it says here that she shot dead a woman a leading loyalist hardliner named norah bell greta pointed out and wasnt she the original bitch from hell protestant or not dermot said tod smiled well weve all got our wicked ways norahs were just a little bit more wicked than most is that it then id say so well keep an eye on bernstein greta said she put her papers in her briefcase got up and asked ashimov shall we go i think so he nodded casually to the others stay in touch at all times we have all your mobile numbers so if we dont hear from you youll be hearing from us as she and ashimov went to the door tod said you dont think we can pull this off do you well pigs might fly ashimov lit a cigarette dermot said is it because of dillon greta said lets put it this way i saw him in action in iraq the other night and if i hadnt seen it for myself i wouldnt have believed it so take care she and ashimov went out and fahy exploded dillon fuggin sean dillon thats all we hear about he reached for a raincoat im away out for a drink and im with you regan told him what about you two we have things to do for our morning departure tod said but watch it you two stay out of trouble they went out and dermot put a large canvas bag on the table and opened it he took out an ak and passed it to tod give it a thorough check ill do the other pass me a silencer which dermot did what about you do you really think we can pull this off tod asked as he took the ak apart weve done it before we can do it again were still here arent we and sos sean dillon thats the trouble at about the same time belov landed at ballykelly in the republic close to drumore practically the first thing he did was phone ashimov who had just parked outside an italian restaurant in bayswater greta at his side bring me up to date belov demanded ashimov did its all in place a lot of whatifs belov said and i dont like that for once ashimov took the hard line no i disagree kelly and murphy have good reputations major novikovas spadework has been excellent this lead to huntley hall looks more than promising i think were in good shape all right i hear what youre saying ill stay here until we get some sort of resolution greta said the great man getting nervous to hell with him let me buy you a nice dinner walking along wapping high street fahy said to regan this dark man pub the salters own cant be far from here why dont we have a look sounds good to me they made inquiries to a man at the newspaper stand on a corner who directed them a couple of streets along to the left they walked down between the old warehouses came out on the wharf beside the thames and there was the dark man a few cars parked nearby the very place fahy said shall we go in lets take it slowly regan told him and at that moment lights approached down toward the wharf and they stepped back into shadows a range rover stopped billy salter got out and went into the pub its salter fahy said lets take a look they peered in through one of the windows the bar was busy but billy was talking to dillon at the counter regan said jesus its dillon fahy said are you carrying no mines back in the weapon bag sos mine christ we could have taken a pop at him from the shadows thats a fact regan said although there was a certain relief in his voice well theres one thing i can do fahy took out a switchblade knife and pushed the button he jabbed it into the two front tires which started to deflate thatll give salter and bloody dillon something to think about they were laughing like schoolboys as they cleared off there was a final hiss of air from the tires and then an old and ravaged bag lady in layers of clothes a woolen hat pulled over her head stepped out of the darkness and took a look she turned put down her bags and went into the bar she tapped billy on the shoulder he turned now then gladys not in the bar youd better come outside billy its the big car of yours billy frowned and dillon swallowed his drink and went after him the bastards billy said outside who was it gladys couple of men in raincoats it is raining billy one of them had one of those funny knives where the blade springs up and he stuck it in the tires they were laughing they said that will give salter and bloody dillon something to think about christ if i get my hands on them billy kicked one of the tires they were irish she said irish billy said bleeding irish hold it dillon told him youre sure gladys oh yes they didnt speak like you i mean youre funny irish it was the other way who in the hells got it in for me billy said it doesnt make sense maybe its something to do with me dillon said i know many irishmen who could get very personal where im concerned youd better call the garage and see to the range rover ive got to make a few inquiries ill see you later he hailed a cab on the high street and told the driver to take him to kilburn where he started his rounds working from pub to pub talking to barmen not that anything came up but then it wouldnt the ira werent operating in london those days had gone and then finally there was the green man he went up the alley at the side paused and peered in through the window there he was danny malone a good comrade in the old days but that was a long long time ago danny was obviously going over his accounts so dillon tried the back door it eased to his touch and he moved along the small hall opened the door to the back room and went in malone had been thinking about dillon extremely uneasily since kelly had mentioned him in a sense it had made him face up to what he was getting involved in the kind of thing that had sent him to prison for fifteen years and the fact that dillon was involved made it worse now he looked up and his face sagged sean its you god save the good work danny dillon said and added when malone said nothing god save you kindly was the response to that youre forgetting your manners im sorry sean i was so shocked i mean its been years oh ive had you in mind always danny dillon lit a cigarette and malones smile was ghastly so you work for ferguson and the prime minister now oh you know me always the practical one it got me out of a serb prison i was glad to hear theyd released you danny lucky for you the peace process came along when it did malone was terrified realizing just how stupid hed been to get involved in the way he had took a deep breath and fought to keep control was there something you wanted sean oh just a word danny my friend billy salter left his range rover outside the dark man at wapping tonight two irish guys came along one of whom stuck a flick knife in two tires they cleared off laughing and saying it would give me and billy something to think about dillon reached under his coat produced a walther from his rear waistband laid it on the table and lit another cigarette any ideas danny anyone in town from over the water and malone gave the performance of his life from over the water sean you know yourself theres been nothing in london since the peace process we all got early release take me fifteen years but i only served five and the full sentence is still on the books any kind of involvement and im back inside to serve my full time do you think im mad who would be that crazy dillon said no i suppose theyd have to be very stupid i mean what about that wife of yours jean you wouldnt want to do anything to hurt her shes hurting enough sean breast cancer thats a damn shame dillon said and meant it he took a card from his pocket and dropped it on the table my mobile number is on there anything comes up let me know he put the walther back in his waistband and went out malone went into the small toilet next door and was sick he rinsed his face then went back found a bottle of whiskey and poured a large one he was sweating and desperate to keep control boredom a yearning for some action again had made him respond to kellys phone call in the way he had so foolish dillon had believed him that was the important thing but what to do about kelly if he left it there was the chance that whatever the job was would fail anyway on the other hand it struck him that if he told kelly of dillons appearance it might be enough to make him abort the mission he took a deep breath picked up the phone and called kelly at china wharf and youre sure absolutely sure that dillon bought your performance it would have got me work at the national theatre the business about my wife helped yes that was a good ploy not a ploy dermot true dammit man im sorry it doesnt matter what does is that i dont know what youre up to and i dont want to on the other hand the dark man is only a quarter of a mile away from china wharf on the riverfront if you want the two irishmen who attended to billy salters range rover i think you know who they are but its your problem not mine im out of the whole damn business ive got a nice little villa in spain where my wife is right now resting in the sun and i think ill leave my bar staff in charge and go and join her he put the phone down opened the office safe found his passport a checkbook and two thousand in mad money and phoned for a taxi to heathrow then he ran upstairs and packed fahy was first in through the door over at china wharf was tripped by tod went headfirst on his hands and knees and received a severe kicking in the ribs from kelly mind his face tod said holding regan still an arm up his back at the appropriate moment he released regan and shoved him down to receive the same treatment finally tod heaved them to their feet and kelly explained exactly what theyd done stupid the pair of you not a brain between you and now ive lost danny malone he slapped each one across the face youve got your orders so stick to them do you understand me or do you want to go off the end of china wharf into the thames they didnt have a word to say he was a figure of such menace and his ferocious reputation preceded him tod said go on get out of it and go to bed he turned to kelly as they went out are we still on of course we are theres no reason for sean to suspect anything even malone doesnt know why were here so tomorrow well go for a run in the country lets have a drink on it at huntley hall the meal in the old oakpaneled room had been impressive by any standards all of selims dietary requirements had been taken care of although ferguson had worked his way through roast beef and yorkshire pudding with all the trimmings dalton and miller acted as waiters standing quiet and watchful between the courses ferguson had drunk burgundy selim mineral water ferguson said was the meal satisfactory excellent you can thank the army catering corps im impressed theres not much sign of staff oh theyre there in their unobtrusive way lets go into the hall the hall was impressive a floor of stone flags scattered with rugs deep comfortable sofas a log fire burning on a wide hearth to one side french windows with heavy curtains looked out over a terrace with a balustrade selim sat in a wingbacked chair you do very well yes its a nice place ferguson turned to miller ill have a port if you dont mind staff sergeant a large one certainly sir miller went to a sideboard to get it and ferguson sat opposite selim i wont bother to offer you one there was a time when i would have accepted with pleasure in those days i didnt take my religion seriously public school cambridge and all that and then a few years ago i changed i can see how awkward that would have been for you that i turned to islam not at all im british general ferguson but also a muslim i have no difficulty with that these islands have been home to an infinite variety of people since the romans occupied them two thousand years ago i suppose youre right after all im half scots half irish ferguson finished his port and stood lets have a breath of air on the terrace that would be nice dalton pressed a button and the french windows opened ferguson led the way outside the air was fresh and damp the shrubbery dense on the other side of the lawn trees beyond there were half a dozen garden statues out there roman figures revealed by security lights we had a good start today ferguson said our chat about ashimov and belov was very interesting in a strange sort of way ashimov is angry with the world and this manifests itself in his willingness to kill people belov simply wants to control the world power ultimate power is everything to him he is someone to beware of much more than me general youre important enough the list of organizations youve mentioned and the coded computer details of the young men that have been sent to al qaeda training camps thatll all be extremely helpful may allah forgive me it was then that ferguson came to the important part you could be of enormous use to us you know not just now but in the future in betraying my own people what a shame ferguson said youve spoiled it i thought you were british selim groaned i didnt mean it that way im speaking on behalf of my religion im british but a muslim in tudor times many people were catholics at a time when this was forbidden but still english in fact when some of them were trained for the priesthood in rome ferguson broke in it was called the english college and they produced jesuit priests known as soldiers of christ the best in the business many of whom died here in england for their faith well lets try and see nothing like that happens to you ferguson said in we go a decent nights sleep and we start again tomorrow the french windows closed behind them as they went inside there was only the quiet and then an owl hooted and there was a rustle in the shrubbery where a garden statue of some roman emperor stood half revealed harold laker peered out beside it gazing toward the terrace at the scene inside the house through the french windows he smiled then disappeared back into the shrubbery and it was quiet again the following morning around ten after breakfast kelly and tod murphy left in the ford transit and fahy and regan sat at the kitchen table disgruntled ribs aching now what fahy asked dont ask me brendan regan replied maybe we should split up ill go and have a look at ropers place while you check out dillons cottage or the bernstein womans address i thought ashimov and novikova were seeing to her come off it youre just trying to avoid anything to do with dillon fahy said thats a damn lie anything could happen its a sound idea to have a look at bernstein though okay well use cabs fahy said well meet back here in two or three hours its better than sitting round here like a gorilla in its own shit while dermot and tod go and have all the fun im telling you though im not setting a foot out the door without a pistol in my pocket well im with you there so lets get on with it on the outskirts of horsham kelly and tod pulled in at a fuel station filled up and went into the small caf√© and ordered coffee kelly lit a cigarette i wonder what those two idiots are getting up to i dont trust them an inch maybe it wasnt such a good idea bringing them along hmm let me check tod said and called regan its tod where are you were out and about im checking dillons place and fahys having a look where roper lives i thought i might take in bernsteins pad too werent you listening before ashimov and novikova are on her case so stay out of there familiarize yourself with dillons and ropers places but dont hang around and dont try anything serious until youre told to its like talking to children he said to kelly after hed clicked off theyve lost their edge kelly said money in the pocket too much booze and sitting around on their fat backsides at drumore the mobile went and he answered it was ashimov where are you horsham quit worrying well be there soon he rang off and said to tod to hell with all of them lets you and me get on with it and he led the way out tod said as they walked to the transit why havent you told him about sean and danny malone doing a runner why bother the man he might lose faith and we cant have that he unlocked the transit next stop huntley greta novikova left the russian embassy on foot from kensington palace gardens crossed to the pub on the other side and went in ashimov was seated at the bar reading a newspaper ah there are you would you like a drink not at the moment whats going on ive spoken to kelly they were at horsham thats no more than half an hour to huntley from there things ought to be happening soon i hope so but ive been around a long time greta if it works it works if it doesnt something else will come along survival is the name of the game and you always do because i take precautions for example i have a company falcon on standby at a flying club called archbury about half an hour out of london on standby until i tell it to stand down why its insurance it means that if anything goes wrong i can get the hell out of here quickly he smiled i know nothing will go wrong you will say and as a tribute to your faith i intend to take you to lunch at the ivy come on but thats impossible to get into the magic name of belov works wonders even at the ivy he had a hand on her elbow as they went out lets go over to the embassy and pick up your opel ill show you bernsteins house on the way that should be interesting ive only seen a photo a lady of some wealth id say youll be surprised regan had checked stable mews but there was no sign of dillons mini car outside the cottage he didnt linger but moved out to the square and hailed a cab with a grin he told the driver to take him to the end of lord north street which was where hannah bernstein lived when he got there he walked a bit down the street toward millbank and victoria tower gardens and stood looking across in a way he was just being bloodyminded because he was angry at being put down by tod as he had been it was particularly unfortunate given the circumstances that ashimov and greta came down lord north street at that moment ashimov who was driving said to her impressed as they slowed at hannahs house very greta told him i see what you mean they picked up speed passing regan on the corner and she recognized him my god its regan one of kellys men ashimov pulled in at the curb stupid bastard hes not supposed to be here he got out of the opel greta joined him and they advanced on regan what in the hell are you doing here she demanded regan of course recognized them instantly i was just having a look at the bernstein womans place its not your affair she said you and your friend were told to check out dillons and ropers places were seeing to bernstein all right regan told her i was just trying to get the job done ive been to dillons just do as youre told ashimov advised him you understand me okay okay regan spread his hands no need to make a big case out of it he turned walked away and crossed through traffic to victoria tower gardens very angry indeed ashimov drove away and was just as angry peasants totally unreliable youre right theyre clodhoppers greta said but yuri the important thing is whats happening in huntley we can check on bernstein later and dillon i wonder what hes up to never mind just get me to the ivy im starving at that moment dillon was entering the piano bar at the dorchester hotel where he was warmly greeted by guiliano the manager shes waiting for you guiliano said and led him to where hannah bernstein was sitting hannah was looking terrific in a black armani trouser suit dillon ordered two glasses of champagne kissed her on the forehead and sat down ive had a morning of paperwork dillon said it was intensely boring me too i didnt see you at the office i did it at home any news yes fergusons phoned me twice hes very pleased with the way things are going with selim apparently he had a real breakthrough and its going well this morning i had a minor development of a personal nature last night and he told her what had happened to billy salters range rover and his call on danny malone there couldnt be any significance to it she said we all know who malone was i helped put him away he wouldnt do anything stupid enough to send him back to complete his sentence i suppose even danny couldnt be that silly anyway a day of rest where do you want to have lunch mulligans no right here will do for me plus another glass of champagne sounds good to me and he waved to guiliano regan walking along by the thames in a fury rang fahy where are you watching roper he left his house and went to a pub on the corner of the main road i checked the bar and he was reading the paper in a booth by the window and the staff was making a big fuss over him ordered irish stew well hes got taste at least im pissed off and he told fahy what had happened first of all its tod kicking ass and then the bloody russians oh to hell with the lot of them a decent meal and a glass thats what you need thats the first sensible thing ive heard all day i could murder a pint where shall we go and the reconnaissance turned to talk of pubs at huntley kelly and tod arrived to something of a surprise two of the trailers on the site behind the garage were occupied cars parked outside three children playing ball kelly said jesus christ thats just what we need no in fact that is exactly what we need a couple of families around kids playing tod shrugged a nice normal environment he got out of the transit come on dermot do your stuff betty laker came out of the kiosk fill it up she asked no actually dermot told her were on our way from brighton to london and my nephew called in here a big lad in black leather suzuki motorcycle do you remember him oh i remember him she said her grandfather came out of the kiosk behind her she turned that young man on the motorcycle you were talking to in the pub this gentleman is his uncle well he met us in brighton and told us what a nice place huntley was he mentioned the trailer site so we thought wed stop off and look around can you manage us kelly asked of course we can the old man said ill handle this betty love just follow me gentlemen they parked by the other cars the trailer was clean and decent basically simple and perfectly acceptable tod who was carrying two bags dropped them on one of the beds looks fine to me and what would you gentlemen be up to then laker asked taking a cigarette from behind his ear and lighting it landscape gardening tod told him mostly big estates places that have a problem we get called in all over the country youre irish lads thats it kelly said always on the go in our line of work never in one place more than a few weeks its hard graft and it gives you an appetite tod intervened theres a pub around here i believe there certainly is and the foods good ill show you the way tod opened one of the bags and there was a clunk as he took out two bottles of scotch and put them on the side the old man licked his lips youre well supplied ill give you that i dont like to run out and thats a fact kelly smiled but lets go over to the pub now and get something to eat maybe youd join us be glad to laker said and led the way out the three of them had shepherds pie the scotch whiskey flowed and the old man loved it tod said funny place this dermots nephew was telling us about the big house huntley hall i know all about that yes so he told us and what he knew was what hed heard from you kelly said he passed it on the way in huntley hall institution theyve certainly got some security there i mean some of the big country estates weve worked on have got walls like that but that electronic fence on top is something else again tod slipped off to the bar and got three more large whiskeys he brought them back and pushed one over to laker who took it with alacrity ah its special see they have to have that kind of security cameras and so forth to keep people in theyre all head cases thats the story its not like it was in lord favershams day i was telling your nephew a poachers paradise that estate were tod eased another whiskey over to him not any longer not if theres no way of getting in now you certainly cant climb that fence oh i dont know theres ways and theres ways you dont always need to go over a fence youve got a point there tod said you could go under i suppose now i never said that never did laker said and accepted another whiskey that was pushed his way no i dont believe it kelly said theres no way you could get in a place like that well i wouldnt be too sure laker was already drunk and a little belligerent tod said it doesnt sound likely to me i admit in fact id bet on it the hook was there and laker took it you put your money where your mouth is and ill bloody well show you all right kelly took out his wallet and produced two fiftypound notes there you go a hundred quid says youre making it up lakers eyes gleamed and he reached for the money but kelly snatched his hand away oh no you prove me wrong if you want this i bloody well will laker reached for the remaining whiskey and swallowed it down he got up come on then ill show you whether im lying or not and he made for the door he led the way along the road out of the village no more than five minutes walk then turned into a track leading through heavy woodland it was very quiet only the birds making noise lifting off and calling to each other in spite of the drink taken laker was surprisingly steady on his feet this is witch wood dont ask me why but so its been called that since time long gone if you could see through the trees maybe fifty yards to the left is the main road and the huntley hall estate on the other side so what are we talking about here tod asked as they walked along the track round about eighteen hundred lord ashley faversham made a fortune in the sugar trade in barbados then came home to refurbish the family estate but there was a problem there used to be a river on the far side of the woods and it would overflow it doesnt exist now it was diverted a long time ago to provide water for a canal project but when it was there and there was water seepage into the estate faversham had a series of tunnels built to run it off and and when the river was diverted they had the tunnels closed off tod could already see the way this was going he took out his cigarettes and gave laker one except one of them was overlooked wasnt it lake almost choked on his cigarette how did you know that oh ive got that kind of mind tod said just show me where it is they plowed on and kelly said how long have you known about this since i were a lad laker said my dad told me it were a secret in the family and still is good man yourself tod said now lets be seeing it a few minutes later laker turned left off the track pushed into a thicket paused bent down fumbled in the grass found a handle and lifted an iron grille the hole was quite wide ill lead the way he said and started down an iron ladder below it was damp no more than that with headroom to five feet as tod followed him kelly behind laker took a flashlight from his pocket follow me he took off and after a while rays of light drifted through from above airholes he said that means were under the road and into the gardens a few minutes later they came to the end and another iron ladder gave way to another iron grille he mounted first and pushed the grille back and they followed and found themselves in a copse of dense foliage the house was clearly visible through the trees youve got security lighting mounted on the house over the terrace theres a camera on the left and another on the right more stuff like that on the drive the real problem is the wall even if you got over it theres an electronic beam five foot inside it should take care of anything except for a tunnel that they never knew about tod said exactly they moved forward paused behind a couple of statues and looked across at the terrace just then the french windows opened and selim walked out ferguson behind him kelly said christ its them at the same moment it started to rain and laker said right lets get out of here and he turned and started back to the access grille to the tunnel kelly grabbed at tods arm as they went after him you saw who that was of course i did christ tod if wed had a gun between us it would have been so simple not only selim but ferguson as well and simple is what it will be tod said well be back kelly ould son never you fear and they went after the old man when they surfaced at the entrance laker was in high spirits did i tell you or did i tell you he chorused as they went back through witch wood thats a hundred quid for me youre right old son kelly told him i was wrong and you were right i wouldnt have believed it if i hadnt seen it for myself they reached the trailer site and tod said you owe the man a hundred quid dermot so get it out and well have a drink on it he led the way into their trailer got one of the bottles of scotch open and found three glasses kelly gave the old man the two fiftypound notes and tod handed him the glass of scotch bottoms up me ould son you deserve it laker was thoroughly drunk now and took the whiskey down in a long swallow yes i bloody well do tod gave him the bottle go on youve earned it get off and have a lie down and well see you later the old man clasped the bottle to his chest lurched out of the door and staggered off toward the bungalow at the back of the garage now theres a happy man kelly said and closed the door against the driving rain so what do you think that we go back later in the day tod said and we see if we get lucky only this time well be armed kelly grinned you know im actually believing its going to work im even believing we could call smith up and have him back over here tonight and where would that leave fahy and regan we could give them a call tell them to walk away from the london end of things get a plane to dublin kelly grabbed tod by his arm for gods sake tod ashimov wanted selim and he gets him with ferguson to hell with the others even dillon you cant do much better than that youve got a point dermot but lets see weve still got to think of regan and fahy fuck them kelly said if they cant see to themselves thats their problem now lets have another drink on it and decide when were going back in after a lunch that had contained considerably more than a single glass regan and fahy wandered the streets for a while finally rain coming down regan said to fahy what now back to china wharf to hell with that fahy said lets try the roper fellas place again im tired of just standing around doing nothing something might turn up im with you do we ring dermot and tod first all well get is a bollocking again then lets just go and regan stepped to the pavement and hailed a cab in regency square roper had been looking at computer screens too long and was opening his mouth for a yawn when his mobile rang its sean whats up im tired stressed and ive been sitting at this damn thing too long i need a break roper said how about i come round and take you out for a drink or something sounds good to me roper felt better already and reached in his pocket for cigarettes and found the pack was empty he cursed hed been kept alive from his terrible injuries by a cocktail of drugs and tobacco had become a mainstay it was the same for a lot of soldiers in his situation and the need was overpowering hed have to go out to the corner shop he made for the front door got it open and found it was raining he took an umbrella from the hall stand pressed one of the electronic buttons on his wheelchair to close the door behind him went down the ramp to the pavement and raised the umbrella he sailed in a way down the pavement strangely exhilarated down to the shop on the corner where mr khan had installed a ramp at one of the doors especially to facilitate ropers comings and goings a large bearded muslim with a genial smile and a cockney accent khan greeted roper warmly what you run out of now major cigarettes roper said the old cancer sticks ill take a carton of the usual maybe you should try and give up khan said as he got the carton and took ropers money and live longer you mean in my state roper stowed the carton in a side pocket of the wheelchair wouldnt make much difference khan tried to keep smiling because he liked roper now then major its not like you to be gloomy youre right ill be cheerful charlie from now on he turned his wheelchair and khan said there was a man in here this morning asking if i knew where you lived oh yes an irish geezer ulster id say you know what i mean its a different kind of irish accent isnt it and roper veteran of the irish troubles for twenty years the finest bombdisposal man in the business stopped smiling it certainly is what did he want didnt say just asked if i knew you the thing is i saw him again with another guy a little while ago and he sounded the same as they walked past thanks roper said ill keep an eye out he moved onto the pavement put up his umbrella and took a codex four from his pocket and called dillon where are you in a cab on my way traffics lousy the fact is i could have a problem my friendly local shopkeeper mr khan you know him tells me ive been inquired about and by whom would that be dillon asked couple of men northern irish accents ive got a lot of history there sean where are you now on the street on my way home take it easy just get inside ill be there in ten minutes are you carrying of course good man he switched off and roper started along the pavement regan and fahy standing in a doorway on the other side of the road sheltering from the rain saw him approach the man himself fahy said what do we do regan already had his hand on the butt of a browning in his raincoat pocket wait fahy said not out here on the street let him get himself together then we move very fast over the road and help him inside roper did his usual maneuver turned to position opened the door electronically then started up the ramp quickly regan and fahy darted over the road and fahy grabbed the end of the wheelchair lets help you major he said and pushed roper in regan followed them and closed the street door behind them now then major lets talk fahy said and pushed roper into the living room beside his computer banks roper sat there facing them no fear in him at all regan said do we call dermot and tod brendan dont be stupid fergus fahy said youll be wanting to call ashimov next this is our affair dermot and tod that would be as in kelly and murphy roper said which means that you two idiots are regan and fahy and how would you be knowing that regan demanded because youre thick and stupid you think we dont know all about you you work for ashimov and that means you work for josef belov wheres belov now drumore place does he know youre here you think youre clever dont you fahy said too clever for your own good well have to do something about that and he took the browning from his pocket at that precise moment in time kelly and tod were moving through witch wood and paused at the iron grille in the thicket they both wore hooded anoraks against the rain dermot had phoned smith from the trailer had told him to do the return flight to dunkley at once smith had been unable to conceal his reluctance but had soon seen the error of his ways kelly and tod lit cigarettes well this is it tod said this is where the luck comes in oh you always need that what about fahy and regan or ashimov for that matter tod asked later kelly said when weve got the good news now lets get it done he pulled up the iron grille went down the ladder and tod dropped the weapon bag down and went after him a short while later at the end of the tunnel they paused and opened the weapons bag tod produced an ak and a silencer and passed them to kelly took out another for himself kelly went up the ladder opened the grille and exited and tod followed him they moved through the dense foliage of the copse and crouched behind the roman statues it was quiet only the occasional bird calling and the rain hissed down steadily come on kelly said make my day that was a movie tod murmured this could take more patience so be patient in the sitting room ferguson and selim were having tea at the end of an exhausting session dalton and miller stood watchful as usual as the two men talked open the french windows staff sergeant ferguson said to dalton lets have a breath of air certainly sir dalton pressed the button and the windows opened i like it selim said the smell of the rain in the countryside the sound of it falling through the trees i know what you mean ferguson said and hesitated you know doctor you obviously have a genuine love of your native land do you regret having been born in london no i love the damn place he laughed as he got to his feet im remembering something mr dillon said to me that i should remember there are mosques all over london he moved to the open windows and ferguson joined him then what were you thinking of there is a passage in the koran general that says one sword is worth ten thousand words perhaps that is what i was thinking of and at that moment kelly shot him between the eyes fragmenting the back of his skull as the body hurtled back bouncing against ferguson the general leaned over slightly to catch it and tod murphys bullet went askew slicing ferguson across the left shoulder he sank to the floor clutching selim and dalton and miller darted past each drawing a beretta and firing blindly into the woods but kelly and tod were already working their way back through the copse and dropping down through the grille i got him kelly said clear in my sight right between the eyes they stowed the rifles in the bag and hurried along the tunnel not ferguson tod said i hit him thats a fact but he moved at the last minute i think i clipped his shoulder never mind its a grand days work thats the truth of it kelly said come on lets get out of here and make for dunkley and that navajo weve made our bonus for our russian friends on this one belov will pay us in gold bars they were back at the village in fifteen minutes put their belongings together and stowed them in the transit tod went to the kiosk by the fuel pumps and found betty he got his wallet out ive just had a phone call were needed in london like yesterday thats a shame she said what do i owe you she told him and he paid her its a smashing place and well be back he jumped in the transit got behind the wheel and drove away kelly was on a high produced a bottle of whiskey and swallowed jesus but we did it he got his mobile out ill ring fahy tell him that he and regan should move it he tapped out the number and when it connected said its dermot brendan and its dillon here you bastard what do you think about that at ropers place after fahy had drawn the browning from his pocket things had not gone as he and regan had expected roper hadnt seemed to care had stayed incredibly calm what do i get summary execution irastyle you gentlemen have tried to shoot me and blow me up many times and im still here i need a smoke he took the carton of marlboros from the side pocket of his wheelchair pulled a pack out and extracted a cigarette anyone got a light he asked as he replaced the pack in the side pocket only this time when his hand came out it clutched a walther which he jammed against fahys knee and pulled the trigger fahy cried out and fell back dropping his browning at the same moment dillons voice echoed over the voice box roper its me regan confused stood over fahy who was being noisy roper called theyre here sean one down one to get he pressed the electronic door button and raised his walther to regan who ducked out into the corridor and ran for the rear of the house dillon burst in gun in hand and found fahy groaning roper leaning over him there was regan sean and he cleared off through the kitchen call rosedene dillon said get the paramedics in ill be back he got to the front door and saw regan hurrying down the pavement regan glanced over his shoulder and started to run dillon went after him past the corner shop regan kept running headlong scattering a few people on the pavement then lurched into the main road as a red london doubledecker bus came along and bounced him into the air traffic came to a halt and people milled around as the driver got out of the bus a police car turned out of the traffic stream and eased beside the bus dillon paused and listened saw one of the policemen drop to one knee and examine regan he shook his head hes dead the driver was shocked it wasnt my fault more than one person called out thats right he ran into the road head down dillon turned discreetly and walked away when he rejoined roper he found him holding the walther on fahy who was clutching his trousered knee with both hands groaning dillon went into the kitchen found a couple of towels went back knelt and tied them tightly around fahys knee you always were a stupid bastard brendan so stop moaning and listen we use a private clinic called rosedene theyre on their way so you wont bleed to death however this isnt a public hospital its high security so you belong to ferguson now understand yes fahy moaned play ball and you could stay out of prison you understand that too yes so tell me the whole story and make it quick or i might put one in the other knee and talk fahy did it was just as he finished that the mobile in his pocket sounded its dermot brendan and its dillon here you bastard what do you think about that regans dead and fahys in a poor way hes spilled his guts too i know everything like hell you do kelly said wildly we got selim and ferguson i bet you dont know that it was a good payday sean go to hell he switched off and said to tod put your foot down tod did as he was told whats happened kelly told him tod said what now we get to dunkley and move the hell out of here as long as smiths there hell be there kelly said grimly he wouldnt dare not to be youd better let ashimov know i suppose so id like to leave him to rot in hell but theres belov to consider hes got a long arm that one after a lengthy afternoon at the ivy ashimov and greta had called in at the old red lion in farley street and were sitting in a booth by the fire when his phone sounded theyd been laughing over a shared joke and he was still laughing when he put the phone to his ear ashimov as he listened the smile vanished and his face was terrible to see so thats it youre not even sure about ferguson and fahys spilling his guts to dillon jesus man we got selim for you he was the main priority and fergusons damaged i swear and now youre running for it flying for it and if youve got any sense youll do the same well see you at drumore oh youll see me at drumore all right dont get smart with me ashimov drumore is my patch you need me and you need my friends since the peace process the brits havent been able to lay a finger on us in the irish republic youd do well to remember that you need us he rang off and greta demanded for gods sake what is it he explained when he was finished she said it could be bad right could be how the hell do you think belovs going to take it especially after what fahys no doubt blurted out to dillon my career my association with belov are on the line he punched a number into his phone archbury connect me with captain kelso youre going she said i think it would be the smart thing if we both went kelsos voice came on its me ashimov told him ive got major novikova with me we should be with you in fortyfive minutes immediate takeoff destination ballykelly what about belov she said wed best get it over with i suppose so he called belov at the castle on his private mobile and was answered at once yuri ive been waiting how are things good news and bad news he went over events very briefly there was a long pause and belov switched off without a word the rage in ashimov was obvious fergusons people his whole enterprise have been nothing but trouble ever since manhattan and this dillon has been a stone in my shoe its all gone down the toilet the years of kowtowing to belov doing his dirty work he doesnt make allowances greta its how he is he rose took her arm roughly come on lets get moving to the embassy no way straight to archbury im taking no chances im not even calling in at my place at huntley hall the duty medical officer had done his best with fergusons left shoulder the bullet had plowed through close to the edge its rosedene for you general the young medical corps captain said its a decent patching job ive done but you could do with a scan and professor henry bellamy is far better at embroidery than i am youre going to need some good work ak rounds really leave a mark and you would know wilson six months in iraq sir the second injection ive given will hold you to london but dont disturb the sling let me help you with your jacket which he did and ferguson said and dr selim bagged and awaiting the disposal unit general lets get him to the north london crematorium the latest incinerators dont take much more than an hour and all thats left is six pounds of gray ash do you mind your work for my department after iraq all the official secrets stuff good god no sir its infinitely more interesting as long as you can accept the importance of what we do were at war too you see captain he walked out into the hall and found dalton and miller dalton said the disposal team just collected dr selim general good then we can get back to london in the back of the land rover he called dillon who had driven back to ropers place in his mini car theyd spoken earlier when dillon had phoned huntley hall in a panic after kellys claim to have gotten ferguson as well as selim the general had just been about to undergo treatment in surgery so not much information had been exchanged just tell me everything sean so i get the full picture which dillon did and ferguson said my goodness ashimovs got plenty to answer for all done on belovs behalf with belovs power and money behind him and ropers hunch is that belovs at drumore an interesting pattern he not only wanted selim shut up for good but the rest of us me you major roper even the salters well we did spoil the plot to assassinate president cazalet and then there was baghdad with a few other things that happened i guess we screwed up things bigtime for belov i suppose the only person who seems to have avoided his wrath is superintendent bernstein youve told her whats happened havent been able to both roper and i have been trying but theres been no response on her mobile phone what on earths going on its all right general i got through to her grandfather who told me shed gone to the wedding of an old friend in windsor this afternoon thats what people do at weddings they switch off well keep trying ashimovs still out there someplace at dunkley there was rain and fog and things were down and smith was sweating taking the biggest chance of his life at any other time he would have aborted but he knew what kellys people might do to him back home if he failed in the transit at the side of the airstrip kelly and tod waited listening to the sound of the navajo as smith made one pass and then two the bastard kelly said as the sound faded again hes doing a runner give him a chance dermot this weather is bad news maybe youd like him to crash there was the sound of the engines again and at the controls smith went lower and lower despairing at the gray cotton wool that seemed to surround him and then suddenly at four hundred feet the runway appeared and he bounced down it was one of the worst landings of his career but hed made it he taxied to the far end turned and tod drove toward him in the transit he and kelly jumped out and smith left the cockpit and opened the airstair door kelly led the way in you fuck what were you trying to do frighten us after him tod helped smith wrestle with the door he put a hand on smiths shoulders you did well i just took ten years off my life tod never again ive had it i mean it you can keep your money in future he was into the cockpit and back to work the plane hurtling along the runway and rising into the fog as tod sat across from kelly and fastened his seat belt kelly had a bottle of whiskey out and swallowed from it he laughed wildly we did it we did it and we got away with it actually its smith whos gotten us away with it hes being paid isnt he he offered the whiskey bottle have a drink i dont think so tod lit a cigarette i need my head clear for drumore for little things like belov and ashimov i can handle them tod i can handle ashimov weve survived worse things than those two they need us more than we need them he raised the bottle up the ira yes right up tod said hannah had caught a commuter train from windsor to london after the wedding reception it was early evening dusk falling when she came out of kings cross station and found an enormous taxi line she hesitated debating whether to wait it out then decided on the bus instead and walked to the main road she was sitting on the top deck looking out when her mobile went it was dillon jesus woman ive been trying to get you for hours ive been to a wedding yes while youve been having fun and sipping champagne the roofs fallen in listen when he was finished explaining she was horrified so whats happening now selim is on his way to oblivion and ferguson to rosedene where hes going to need some attention from henry bellamy kelly and tod murphy if i know the score id say theyve flown straight back to louth from this dunkley place and ashimov roper says that a belov international falcon landed at ballykelly yesterday and its still there that means belov must be at drumore place but ashimov is still a loose cannon where are you on top of a numbernine bus on my way home listen hannah this guy has made it personal he wants the whole team even the salters and we dont know where he is you go straight home im coming to get you now watch yourself ashimov had taken the wheel of gretas opel and drove recklessly now through the traffic to gretas alarm watch it yuri for gods sake he was simmering with rage ive been watching it all my life and im still here that terrible scar on his face seemed to stand out im the original survivor never forget that and he swerved around a truck and plowed on hannah got off the bus at millbank and started toward victoria tower gardens she paused at the curb allowing the traffic to pass then started across to lord north street ashimov recognized her at once as she crossed the road in front of him its the bernstein bitch and he dropped a gear swung across the road and went after her she turned into lord north street and saw dillons mini car outside her house and he was standing at the door she called and waved and hurried toward him as ashimov swerved behind her dillon had turned was plainly identifiable and ashimov said ill get them ill get both of them and as they closed on hannah dillon saw them recognized them and his mouth opened in a cry of warning hannah half turned but there was no time ashimov crowded her on the pavement bouncing her to one side and dillon drew his walther and fired but the opel swerved his bullet passing through the roof as it hurtled past for gods sake yuri greta novikova said just shut up he said and lets get to that damned airport and he put his foot down on the pavement hannah bernstein was trying to haul herself up clutching at the railings as dillon got to her youre all right just hold on to me but there was blood coming down her face and he was afraid she spoke but as from a distance it was ashimov sean and the woman i know look just do as i say he eased her around to the passenger seat got behind the wheel took out his mobile and phoned roper and explained what had happened as he started the car phone rosedene tell them im on my way and were going to need bellamy leave it to me dillon drove away hannah leaning back moaning strange he didnt feel some hot burning rage if anything he was cold and conscious of only one thing ashimov was responsible for this london ireland at rosedene dillon paced nervously up and down in reception smoking cigarette after cigarette rabbi julian bernstein sat by the window sean sit down it isnt helping and it isnt good for you if anything goes wrong with her dillon had that devils face on him i swear ill youll do nothing we wait we see vengeance is mine achieves nothing what do i do turn the other cheek well im feeling very old testament right now his mobile sounded it was roper how is she im waiting to hear what have you got ive tracked down another belov plane which lifted off half an hour ago from archbury ashimov and novikova are aboard dammit dillon told him that really rubs it in that shes gone with him i mean theres something else you wont like the opel car its a russian embassy vehicle logged out to a novikova well there you are dillon said make my day whats the intended destination of the plane ballykelly belov internationals got a big development there which includes an airstrip belov dropped in yesterday which means hes already at drumore castle surprise surprise dillon said safely in the republic of ireland where they cant be touched not if i can help it well youll have to hurry sean air traffic control in dublin reports a slot booked out at ten oclock tomorrow morning for belovs falcon to moscow at that moment the door opened and ferguson came in supported by miller and dalton his face was gray eyes sunken they helped him to a chair he looked at dalton be a good chap find us some whiskey theyll have some in the back for medicinal purposes dalton went away and dillon said you look terrible yes well being shot does have that effect but never mind me how is the superintendent bellamys with her now they did a scan ferguson turned to rabbi bernstein this life of hannahs rabbi you must hate it all of it the old man smiled gently its the life she chose general its what she wanted and you do look awful my son is at a medical conference in paris but ive phoned him and hes coming back at once no he said as ferguson started to protest i insist hed never forgive himself otherwise and i wouldnt forgive myself either at doone the navajo had landed smith taxied up to the hangar and switched off he got the airstair door open and kelly and tod followed him out kelly clapped him on the shoulder you did a good job im proud of you tod will take care of you i dont want anything just leave me alone never again smith closed the airstair door kelly said you never say that to me i call you jump go on then put a bullet in my head now smith shook his head as far as im concerned the ira can go to hell youre stuck in the past anyway kelly grabbed at him but tod pulled him back just let it go well go down to the royal george and have a drink with the boys at ballykelly as the falcon touched down it was quiet in the cabin ashimov had drunk steadily and barely exchanged a word with greta they rolled to a halt kelso switched off and brown left the cockpit and opened the door as they stepped down a land rover approached well here we go ashimov said to an uncertain future he hesitated youre with me in this greta of course i am and yet in her heart she didnt know what that meant then lets get on with it beard the ogre in his den they went down the steps and to ashimovs astonishment josef belov got out from behind the wheel of the land rover so there you are ive been waiting professor henry bellamy came in stripping off his gloves and paused in front of ferguson for gods sake charles at your age you cant afford this kind of thing dalton held out a file captain wilson sent this sir never mind me ferguson said what about hannah she has a broken collarbone and right arm and a depressed fracture of the skull he turned to bernstein im sorry rabbi but im transferring her to the neurological unit at the cromwell ive called in george dawson hes the best in the business how bad is it bernstein asked what are her chances oh excellent dawson is worldclass but i should point out one thing and whats that bellamy glanced at ferguson the other year when that party of god hit man tried to kill her she suffered damage to the stomach a bullet to the left lung and a chipped spine it was a miracle she survived thanks to a great surgeon dillon said which means nothing sean shell survive this too dont worry but her future will be more problematic this may well be the end of her career but it means everything to her dillon said i know maybe she could have a desk job i dont know but there are limits to the endurance of the human body of course bernstein said an ambulance is picking her up at any moment which will take her to dawson at the cromwell you of course may go with her rabbi thank you bellamy opened wilsons file had a quick look and shook his head straight in charles this is far worse than id expected he turned to dalton and miller take him through they got ferguson up between them he glanced at dillon dont do anything stupid sean now would i do anything like that yet the eyes burned in his face and there was that look of the devil about him again ferguson said youre going to go after him you can depend on it and nothing i say to dissuade you would work not this time ferguson said then all our departmental resources are available to you just be careful sean he smiled wearily and dalton and miller took him out between them bellamy following the rabbi said ive seen that look on your face before maybe she wouldnt want it ashimov did it deliberately i witnessed it myself he pays in full god help you sean an ambulance driver looked in rabbi bernstein thats me the old man glanced at dillon sighed and went out it was quiet in reception and dillon took a deep breath and lit a cigarette then he phoned roper how is she dillon explained and added fergusons in a poor way himself bellamys just taken him into the operating room before that though the old boy gave me the use of all our departmental resources does this mean what i think it does absolutely will you stay on the line make sure there arent any changes in departure plans at ballykelly sean youre crazy youll never get away with it its as if youve got a death wish ill ring lacey and arrange a drop the beach at drumore will do nicely but you check the weather and confirm it with him speak to the quartermaster for me and arrange some weaponry ill get on it but you cant do this on your own not even the great sean dillon oh i wont dillon went out got in the mini and phoned farley field its dillon i need squadron leader lacey he droned on through traffic onehanded and lacey came on sean nothing has ever been more important so dont argue fergusons been shot hes in a hospital operating room at the moment and hes charged me with full authority ill be with you in perhaps an hour youre going to fly in over drumore in county louth and do a beach drop im not sure about the weather sean weve done it before in worse this one is important we take it right to the edge as you say sean he switched off and dillon carried on one more place to call when he entered the dark man harry salter billy joe baxter and sam hall were in the end booth having a drink except for billy and his usual orange juice harry said so here you are youre hardly keeping us uptodate just shut up and listen dillon said when he was finished harry said these russians what bastards never mind that billy interrupted whats the real word on hannah bellamy says hes sure shell make it but shell never be the same again and ferguson harry demanded i told you he took a slug from an ak he wont die from it but at his age dillon shrugged and selim out of it billy shook his head thats a waste he could have said a lot he came round in the end coughed up plenty there was a silence harry turned to dora a little bushmills here love i think were going to need it he turned back to dillon so belovs at this drumore place and ashimov and the girl have joined them plus the two ira gangsters thats it and you cant touch them because theyre in the irish republic yes harry and theyve got a plane to moscow booked out in the morning id say youre fucked dillon and billy his face as always colder than ice said no he isnt youre going in arent you who else will be there discount regan and fahy id say theres kelly and tod probably danny mcguire and patrick oneill there could be a few more then again times have changed they could even have cleared off for a while kelly has a boat the kathleen which looks like rubbish but is hot stuff he might think a cruise was indicated but the russians for sure belov ashimov and the woman thats all i know for certain billy said so youre going on by air a beach landing billy youre mad dillon harry said harry i just dont like what theyve done ashimovs a butcher and belov thinks he rules the world what theyve done to ferguson and hannah and that poor silly sod selim has to be paid for there was silence and dora brought the drinks dillon took his straight down harry im tired ive been at war with the world for years and its a darker world than when i started ill be honest though i came for help from the boy wonder here and i was wrong hes done enough in hazar last year he got a bullet in the neck eighteen stitches in his face and his pelvis fractured i was stupid to think he should be jumping out of a citation at six hundred feet over drumore bay as for me though i dont have a choice i cant face those bastards walking away from this its not an option dillon got up billy said how many times have we done something like this sean i dont know it blurs three well then this will make it four he got up lets get moving billy his uncle said oh shut up lets go sean in the great hall at drumore place ashimov greta and belov sat beside the log fire burning brightly on the hearth belov said so selim is out of the equation although i wonder just how much he said to ferguson before he met his end that concerns me too having said that except for the wounding of ferguson the rest of the enterprise was a failure when i put it together with what happened in iraq its hardly been a success yuri and fahy and regan this dillon has been a thorn in our side since the start we underestimated him badly he turned to greta wouldnt you agree major she glanced at ashimov but couldnt avoid belovs penetrating stare i went into his past thoroughly there was no doubt he had a remarkable record and you made your opinion known again she glanced at ashimov yes i did particularly to kelly and his people as if trying to make up for the damage she was causing she added kelly and murphy should have been well aware of what they were taking on they were close associates of dillon once its not like they didnt see him firsthand at that moment hamilton an old man from the village who acted as a kind of butler came in excuse me sir dermot kelly and tod murphy are here are they now show them in they sat there waiting and the two of them entered back from the wars i see belov said kelly roused by drink was aggressive we did a grand job for you we killed selim and clipped ferguson and left one of your own men dead and the other one giving every scrap of information ferguson wanted in complete detail not your best days work kelly kelly was speechless with fury it was tod who said smoothly these things happen the fact is we did get selim as dermot says and we wounded ferguson we did our job do you need anything else yes were leaving in the morning for moscow i want you and whats left of your men to stand on watch tonight as to your future well discuss it another time kelly started now look here tod caught his arm thats grand sir thank you for being so understanding he took kelly with him out to the hall shut up dermot our day will come isnt that what we said in the provos in the old days i could kill the bastard not now we go down to the royal george have a drink with mcguire and oneill and then well come back and do what belov wants its to our advantage dermot and thats all that matters in the hall belov said so moscow tomorrow and then what ashimov asked we see if there are any repercussions and we consider our options he looked hard at them both mine and yours at farley field lacey was waiting as they drove up the first thing he said was were using the learjet sean no raf rondels were flying into a friendly country remember dont want to give the wrong impression fine what about weather well be all right theres intermittent sea fog in the area but itll be low tide so theres plenty of beach good enough what about the return lacey asked im glad you think therell be one since we dont want any trouble with the republic you land at belfast airport park in the usual highsecurity patch and make arrangements to receive us when i dont know it could be a hard one on the other hand the border is open these days billy and i should have no difficulty in getting to belfast one way or another i hope thats a given when have i ever let you down all right lets get moving in the operations room the quartermaster an exguards sergeant major waited there were a couple of ak rifles stocks folded on the table two brownings and a jump bag the extras major roper suggested are in the bag sir your equipment is in the next room good well get on with it when he and billy reappeared they wore jumpsuits boots and single parachutes the brownings in shoulder holsters the ak rifles slung across their chests dillon carried the jump bag the others were gathered at the chart table there it is lacey said plenty of sand with the tide low i know it well dillon told him there might even be more moon than wed like but that chance of sea mist could help you mr salter tells me hes coming along for the ride is that all right no it isnt said billy sorry harry ive got enough on my mind harry looked resigned and hugged him you young bastard you look like youre in a vietnam war movie youve said that before billy told him go on get out of it as billy went up the steps harry nodded to dillon as for you i know bring him back or else he followed billy into the lear parry closed the airstair door they settled down unclipping the parachutes and putting the rifles to one side the lear started to roll down the runway so here we go again billy said are we supposed to be some kind of heroes or something no billy dillon said were handing out rough justice the kind of thing other people cant face up to lets leave it at that maybe you have a point oh i do billy dillon took half a bottle of bushmills from a pocket unscrewed the cap and drank to you and me billy the only truly sane men in a world gone mad at rosedene ferguson woke up to find roper seated at his bedside in his wheelchair reading the evening standard ferguson took a deep shuddering breath and roper alerted pulled the alarm button it was the matron herself who hurried in now then general she raised him plumped up the pillows and eased him back a little water she passed the container he sucked on the straw how was it some of the best work ive seen sir henry do twentytwo stitches and the bone was chipped she had known him many years and used the privilege if i may say so youre a bloody old fool to put yourself in such situations at your age i consider myself reprimanded what about superintendent bernstein sir henrys gone over to the cromwell professor dawsons in charge now she couldnt be in better hands excellent will you be serving supper later its always so good here well well see the best i can manage for the moment is a nice cup of tea she turned to roper and you major its better than penicillin and im proof of that she went out and ferguson said fill me in hes gone i suppose he certainly has general and taken young billy salter with him tell me roper did and afterward ferguson said its a kind of madness that gets into dillon he and billy against at least four ira old hands plus ashimov and the woman and she can pull a trigger with the best of them and belov himself hes capable of anything i know sir a young nurse brought tea on a tray and poured it ferguson went on there could be more its an oldfashioned ira area major that sort of place roper sipped his tea dont forget though sir sean dillon is a legend to many of those people yes i suppose so still id feel easier if i could talk to him is that possible roper lifted a kind of handbag i have a codex four in here as you know you can use it even on an aircraft in flight then get dillon for me roper said its me where are you halfway across the irish sea hows ferguson roper told him im putting him on dillon said im glad youre in one piece charles oh never mind me it was worse on the hook in korea when i was eighteen which would mean youre past your sellby date charles time to

through him take care sean dillon laughed nobody lives forever ill be in touch sounding off in the great hall belov greta and ashimov sat at the huge dining table and worked their way through a roast duck old hamilton standing by as the wine waiter excellent belov said mrs ryan has just served me a better duck than the ritz hotel will you tell her that hamilton shes gone sir home to the village

place well off you go then check in at breakfast time and tell murphy to come and see me hamilton scurried out and belov said now why would things be so disturbed have you got a theory major greta said not really sir belov poured a glass of port and lit a russian cigarette its as if kelly and company are expecting somebody do you think they know something tod murphy came in an ak over one shoulder good im glad to see youre prepared belov said for what sir dont fool with me mr murphy it could only be for one man at that very moment they heard the sound of a plane passing very low they all looked up instinctively belov said why there he is tod turned and ran out and ashimov said no it cant be it was greta who said you only had to read the files i kept saying that but nobody would listen on the lear parry had left the cockpit and helped dillon and billy to put their parachutes on and rearm themselves seven minutes he said well still stick to six hundred theres heavy ground fog but clear beach below and the tide is well out he turned as lacey throttled back to almost stalling speed opened the door and dropped the steps there was a huge rush of wind dillon moved forward and turned to billy we should do this more often billy said get the hell out of it pushed and dived after him they descended the moon above into the fog at six hundred then swung clear at two hundred and there was the sea the beach the harbor in swirling fog a handful of boats and kellys kathleen tied to the end of the jetty in the channel dillon made a perfect landing punched his quick release didnt even have to roll glanced over and saw the other parachute billowing just clear of the tidal surge dillon stamped on it and billy unclipped and stood up its coming in he said wed better get moving dillon said toward the jetty why billy demanded i want to check that boat of kellys and he led the way half running the jump bag in his left hand the fog swirled half obscuring the village a few lights gleaming through from the royal george the kathleen was tied up at the end of the jetty dillon said to billy just keep an eye out ill only be a minute what are you up to never mind dillon went over the rail checked the wheelhouse then went aft carrying the jump bag with him he got what he wanted from it then took off the engine hatch and did what he had to do inside he replaced the hatch come on dillon billy hissed what in hell are you doing just immobilizing the engine dillon said now lets get moving they started up through the village on the terrace kelly and tod ashimov and belov stood in the darkness greta behind them belov searched the bay through night glasses and caught the two pale mushrooms descending out of the fog parachutes two he passed the glasses to ashimov who looked for a few moments then caught a clear glimpse of dillons face when he and billy moved to the end of the jetty dillon he passed the glasses to tod well take the bastard now kelly said no it was belov who spoke an old rule mr kelly let the enemy come to you which was fine except for the fact that dillon had produced a pair of night glasses himself and caught them on the terrace theyre there billy tod kelly belov ashimov and the girl and theyve seen us you think thats the lot no at the least there would be mcguire and oneill maybe more is that all billy laughed lets get on with it they moved out from the jetty turned into a narrow cobbled street and started up the slope toward the castle in the hall tod murphy took charge well draw them in by leaving the french windows of the library at the east end of the grand terrace open also the windows at the western end thats the drawingroom end open you take the library danny he said to mcguire theres a trellised summerhouse there you wait and try to get them from the back as they pass making for the windows you patrick he said to oneill do the same thing at the other end by the dining room and what about us ashimov demanded you wait in the library and you in the dining room dermot he said to kelly catch them in cross fire and me and major novikova belov asked ill stand back with you as guard at the rear of the great hall until its all over well lets get on with it kelly said sort the bastards out once and for all and they dispersed billy and dillon crouched together fog swirling a slight drizzle falling dillon looked at the terrace through his night glasses not very bright theyve left the windows open to draw us in have a look theres a movement in that trellised summerhouse and look at the one to the right very na√Øve billy said what do you want to do i think theres someone waiting inside the house as well well do it our way and he quickly explained mcguire waiting nervously in the little summerhouse peering out didnt hear a thing and was aware only of an ak nudging him in the back billy said make a sound and ill blow your spine apart now be good and tell me whos in the library and whos wherever else the russian ashimov mcguire said kellys in the dining room and tods in the great hall with belov and the woman good man and billy rammed the stock of his ak into the base of mcguires skull a moment later dillon rejoined him i got oneill it seems kellys in the dining room ill try and trace him are you sure well see they moved cautiously toward the other end of the terrace dillon crouched at the balustrade and called softly are you there dermot its me patrick weve got a problem he intensified the distinctive northern irish accent even more and it produced a result what is it you stupid eejit kelly whispered back and moved into the open windows where dillon immediately shot him the silenced ak making only a muted cough billy moved in close now what leave ashimov and go in through the dining room i know this place they keep the cars at the front of the house in the courtyard ill go round make sure they cant be used then enter by the front door ill kick up the kind of fuss that will flush ashimov out and you can get him from the rear im your man billy stepped over kellys dead body and dillon faded into the darkness tod in the shadowed archway at the end of the great hall stood between greta and belov a browning in his hand with a twentyround magazine protruding from the butt its too quiet greta said it always is belov told her i knew this was bad news from the start tod said i think we should get out now grab one of the cars and go for ballykelly a man after my own heart belov said greta panicked and called out yuri where are you dont be stupid tod told her and opened the front door dillon who was removing the ignition key from the last of the four cars swung and put a short burst into the brickwork at the side of the door is it yourself tod no way out here damn you dillon belov called and tod kicked the door closed follow me he said well get out through the kitchen tunnel and then what belov demanded the boat the kathleen down at the jetty come on this way but what about yuri greta demanded hell have to look after himself belov said now get moving ashimov alerted by the noise at the front of the house moved cautiously into the corridor from the library at the same moment dillon kicked in the front door went in low straight through the archway to the great hall and called out billy ashimov erupted firing his pistol plucking at dillons sleeve a second round catching the stock of his ak sending it hurtling from his hands at the same moment billy shot ashimov in the left shoulder spinning him around and then shot him again in the heart are you okay he called to dillon thanks to you have tod and the others cleared off by car no ive got all the keys ive an idea hes banking on another form of transportation lets see he led the way through the great hall to the library and the terrace beyond there were only wisps of fog now and the moon was incredibly bright the village below the houses the inn like cardboard cutouts tod belov and greta had emerged from the walled garden and were hurrying down the lane whats going on billy demanded theyre making for the kathleen its always ready for sea thats been the way of it with kelly for years but theyre getting away billy said as he saw them scramble over the rail of the boat belov and greta cast off and tod went into the wheelhouse the engine coughed into life and the kathleen started down the channel not really havent you observed billy that you never really get away from anything in this life the kathleen passed the point and produced a bow wave as tod increased speed dillon took a howler from his pocket pointed and pressed the button there seemed to be a moment of hesitation and then the whole vessel split apart in a huge ball of fire what was left went down like a stone christ almighty billy turned to him semtex it was ropers idea pity about greta novikova she shouldnt have joined billy if she wasnt willing to take the risks maybe i shouldnt have joined either maybe you shouldnt have i expect our day will come dillon smiled wearily for the moment lets get out of here there are four vehicles in the courtyard and i have all the keys two hours to belfast and then to home three or four minutes later they were driving out of the main gate in a land rover leaving drumore place dark and somber behind them epilogue as the lear lifted off at belfast after midnight dillon took out his codex four and called roper there was an instant reply he said dont you sleep not all that much where are you in the lear just lifted off from belfast is billy all right saved my bacon hes just tipped his seat and gone to sleep what about ferguson and hannah hes been feverish and is now drugged up to his eyeballs im very comfortable in the corner of his room as i said sleep doesnt come naturally to me anymore and hannah oh dawson did marvelous work but the truth is she wont be what she was will any of us so what happened we got a superb drop in the fog by the boys then we checked out the kathleen you were right about that so i did as you suggested and we went on to the castle and we left mcguire and oneill in a bad way i got kelly permanently ashimov almost finished me but the boy wonder shot him and saved me and the others they cleared off to the harbor and the kathleen i let them make it beyond the point then used the howler that must have been quite a sight you could say that i was sorry about novikova she saved my life in iraq only because it suited her i suppose youre right we took a land rover from the castle then drove straight up through the border to belfast theres nobody there these days all the old barriers are still there but no troops no police you drive straight through what in the hell did it all mean come home sean roper told him just come home very comforting dillon said give ferguson my love he sat there thinking about it all then opened the bar box took out half a bottle of bushmills and poured some into a plastic cup billy eyes still closed said youre big on moral philosophy dillon do you believe everythings for the best in the best of all possible worlds billy old son sean dillon said believe that and youll believe anything
