negotiator with jewish guerrillas jerusalem i in free fall atvar the fleetlord glided over to the hologram projector he poked the stud at the base of the machine the image that sprang into being above the projector was one the races probe had sent back from tosev eight hundred local years earlier a big ugly warrior sat mounted on a beast he wore leather boots rusty chainmail and a dented iron helmet a thin coat woven from plant fibers and dyed blue with plant juices shielded his armor from the heat of the star the race called tosev to atvar to any male of the race tosev was on the chilly side but not to the natives a long ironpointed spear stood up from a boss on the contraption the warrior used to stay atop his animal he carried a shield painted with a cross on his belt hung a long straight sword and a couple of knives all you could see of the tosevite himself were his face and one hand they were plenty to show he was almost as fuzzy as the beast he rode thick wiry yellow fur covered his jaws and the area around his mouth he had another stripe above each of his flat immobile eyes a thinner layer of hair grew on the back of the visible hand atvar touched his own smooth scaly skin just looking at all that fur made him wonder why the big uglies didnt itch all the time leaving one eye turret aimed at the tosevite warrior he swung the other in the direction of kirel shiplord of theth emperor hetto this is the foe we thought we were opposing he said bitterly truth exalted fleetlord kirel said his body paint was almost as colorful and complex as atvars since he commanded the bannership of the conquest fleet only the fleetlord outranked him atvar stabbed at the projector control with his left index claw the big ugly warrior vanished in his place appeared a perfect threedimensional image of the nuclear explosion that had destroyed the tosevite city of rome atvar recognized the background terrain but it could as easily have been the bomb that vaporized chicago or breslau or miami or the spearhead of the races assault force south of moscow as opposed to the foe we thought we faced this is what we are actually dealing with atvar said truth kirel repeated and as mournful commentary added an emphatic cough atvar let out a long hissing sigh stability and predictability were two of the pillars on which the race and its empire had flourished for a hundred thousand years and expanded to cover three solar systems on tosev nothing seemed predictable nothing seemed stable no wonder the race was having such troubles here the big uglies did not play by any of the rules its savants thought they knew with another hiss the fleetlord poked at the control stud once more now the threatening cloud from the nuclear blast vanished in a way the image that replaced it was even more menacing it was a satellite photograph of a base the race had established in the region of the sssr known to the locals as siberia a place whose frigid climate even the big uglies found appalling the mutineers still persist in their rebellion against duly constituted authority atvar said heavily worse the commandants of the two nearest bases have urged against committing their males to suppress the rebels for fear they would go over to them instead this is truly alarming kirel said with another emphatic cough if we choose males from a distant air base to bomb the mutineers out of existence then will it truly solve the problem i dont know atvar said but what i really dont know by the emperorhe cast down his eyes for a moment at the mention of his sovereignis how the mutiny could have happened in the first place subordination and integration into the greater scheme of the race as a whole are drilled into our males from hatchlinghood how could they have overthrown them now kirel sighed fighting on this world corrodes males moral fiber as badly as its ocean water corrodes equipment we are not fighting the war that was planned before we set out from home and that by itself is plenty to disorient a good many males this is also truth atvar admitted the leader of the mutineersa lowly landcruiser driver if you can image such a thingis shown to have lost at least three different sets of crewmales two including those with whom he served at this base to tosevite action and the third grouping arrested and disciplined as ginger tasters by his wild pronouncements this ussmak sounds like a ginger taster himself kirel said threatening to call in the soviets to his aid if we attack him you mean atvar said we ought to take him up on that if he thinks they would help him out of sheer benevolence the tosevite herb truly has addled his wits if it werent for the equipment he could pass on to the sssr i would say we should welcome him to go over to that set of big uglies given the situation as it actually is exalted fleetlord what course shall we pursue kirels interrogative cough sounded vaguely accusingor maybe atvars conscience was twisting his hearing diaphragms i dont know yet the fleetlord said unhappily when in doubt his first instincttypical for a malewas to do nothing letting the situation come nearer to hatching so you could understand it more fully worked well on home and also on rabotev and halless the other inhabited worlds the race controlled but waiting against the tosevites often proved even worse than proceeding on incomplete knowledge the big ugliesdid things they didnt fret about longterm consequences take atomic weaponsthose helped them in the short run if they devastated tosev in the processwell so what atvar couldnt leave it atso what the colonization fleet was on the way from home he couldnt very well present it with a world hed rendered uninhabitable in the process of overcoming the big uglies yet he couldnt fail to respond either and so found himself in the unpleasant position of reacting to what the tosevites did instead of making them react to him the mutineers had no nuclear weapons and werent big uglies he could have afforded to wait them out if they hadnt threatened to yield their base to the sssr with the tosevites involved you couldnt just sit and watch the big uglies were never content to let things simmer they threw them in a microwave oven and brought them to a boil as fast as they could when atvar didnt say anything more kirel tried to prod him exalted fleetlord you cant be contemplating genuine negotiations with these rebelliousand revoltingmales their demands are impossible not just amnesty and transfer to a warmer climatethose would be bad enough by themselvesbut also ending the struggle against the tosevites so no more males die uselessly to use their word no we cannot allow mutineers to dictate terms to us atvar agreed that would be intolerable his mouth fell open in a bitter laugh then again by all reasonable standards the situation over vast stretches of tosev is intolerable and our forces seem to lack the ability to improve it to any substantial extent what does this suggest to you shiplord one possible answer wasa new fleetlord the assembled shiplords of the conquest fleet had tried to remove atvar once after the sssr detonated the first tosevite fission bomb and had narrowly failed if they tried again kirel was the logical male to succeed atvar the fleetlord waited for his subordinates reply not so much for what he said as for how he said it slowly kirel answered were the tosevites factions of the race opposed to the general willnot that the race would generate such vicious factions of course but speaking for the sake of the hypothesistheir strength unlike that of the mutineers might come close to making negotiations with them mandatory atvar contemplated that kirel was generally speaking a conservative male and had couched his suggestion conservatively by equating the big uglies with analogous groupings within the race an equation that in itself made atvars scales itch but the suggestion however couched was more radical than any straha the shiplord whod led the effort to oust atvar had ever put forward before deserting and fleeing to the big uglies shiplord atvar demanded sharply are you making the same proposal as the mutineers that we discuss with the tosevites ways of ending our campaign short of complete conquest exalted fleetlord did you yourself not say our males seem incapable of effecting a complete conquest of tosev kirel answered still with perfect subordination but not abandoning his own ideas either if that be so should we not either destroy the planet to make sure the tosevites can never threaten us or else he stopped unlike straha he had a sense of when he was going too far for atvar to tolerate no the fleetlord said i refuse to concede that the commands of the emperor cannot be carried out in full we shall defend ourselves in the northern portion of the planet until its dreadful winter weather improves then resume the offensive against the big uglies tosev shall be ours kirel crouched into the races pose of obedience it shall be done exalted fleetlord again the response was perfectly subordinate kirel did not askhow it should be done the race had brought only so much materiel from home it was of far higher quality than anything the tosevites used but there was only a limited quantity of it try as they would the races pilots and missile batteries and artillery had not managed to knock out the big uglies manufacturing capacity the armaments they produced though better than those theyd had when the race first landed on tosev remained inferior but they kept on making them some munitions could be produced in factories captured from the tosevites and the races starships had their own manufacturing capacity that would have been signflicant in a smaller war when added to what the logistics vessels had brought from home that still left the hope of adequacy for the coming campaign and the big uglies were also in distress no doubt about that victory might yet come or of course but atvar did not care to think about that even under a flag of truce mordechai anielewicz felt nervous about approaching the german encampment after starving in the warsaw ghetto after leading the jewish fighters of warsaw whod risen against the nazis and helped the lizards drive them out of the city he was under no illusions about what hitlers forces wanted for his people they wanted them to vanish from the face of the earth but the lizards wanted to enslave everybody jews andgoyim alike the jews hadnt fully realized that when they rose against the nazis had they it wouldnt have mattered much measured against extermination enslavement looked good the germans were still fighting the lizards and fighting hard no one denied their military prowess or their technical skill from afar anielewicz had seen the nuclear bomb theyd touched off east of breslau had he seen it close up he wouldnt be coming here to dicker with the nazis halt the voice might have come out of thin air mordechai halted after a moment a german wearing a white camouflage smock and a whitewashed helmet appeared as if by magic from behind a tree just looking at him made anielewicz who had red armyvalenki on his feet and was dressed in polish army trousers awehrmacht tunic a red army fur hat and a sheepskin jacket of civilian origin feel like a refugee from a rummage sale he needed a shave too which added to his air of seediness the germans lip curled you are the jew we were told to expect no im st nicholas here late for christmas anielewicz who had been an engineering student before the war had learned fluent standard german he spoke yiddish now to annoy the sentry the fellow just grunted maybe he didnt think the joke was funny maybe he hadnt got it he gestured with his mauser you will come with me i will take you to the colonel that was what anielewicz was there for but he didnt like the way the sentry said it even so the german spoke as if the universe permitted no other possible outcome maybe it didnt mordechai followed him through the cold and silent woods your colonel must be a good officer he saidsoftly because the brooding presence of the woods weighed on him this regiment has come a long way east since the bomb went off near breslau that was part of the reason he needed to talk with the local commandant though he wasnt going to explain his reasons to a private who probably thought he was nothing but a damn kike anyway stolid as an old cow the sentry answeredja and then shut up again they walked past a whitewashed panther tank in a clearing a couple of crewmen were guddling about in the panthers engine compartment looking at them hearing one grumble when the exposed skin between glove and sleeve stuck to cold metal you might have thought war no different from any other mechanical trade of course the germans had industrialized murder too they walked by more tanks most of them also being worked on these were bigger tougher machines than the ones the nazis had used to conquer poland four and a half years before the nazis had learned a lot since then their panzers still didnt come close to being an even match for the ones the lizards used though a couple of men were cooking a little pot of stew over an aluminum field stove set on a couple of rocks the stew had some kind of meat in itrabbit maybe or squirrel or even dog whatever it was it smelled delicious sir the jewish partisan is here the sentry said absolutely nothing in his voice that was better than the scorn that might have been there but not much both men squatting by the field stove looked up the older one got to his feet he was obviously the colonel though he wore a plain service cap and an enlisted mans uniform he was in his forties pinchfaced and cleverlooking despite skin weathered from a lifetime spent in the sun and the rain and as now the snow you anielewiczs mouth fell open in surprise jager he hadnt seen this german in more than a year and then only for an evening but he wouldnt forget him yes im heinrich jager you know me the panzer officers gray eyes narrowed deepening the network of wrinkles around their outer corners then they went wide that voice you called yourself mordechai didnt you you were cleanshaven then he rubbed his own chin gray mixed with the brownish stubble that grew there you two know each other that was the moonfaced younger man whod been waiting for the stew to finish he sounded disbelieving you might say so gunther jager answered with a dry chuckle last time i was traveling through poland this fellow decided to let me live those watchful eyes flicked to mordechai i wonder how much he regrets it now the comment cut to the quick jager had been carrying explosive metal stolen from the lizards anielewicz had let him travel on to germany with half of it diverting the other half to the united states now both nations were building nuclear weapons mordechai was glad the usa had them his delight that the thirdreich had them was considerably more restrained gunther staredhe letyou live this ragged partisan anielewicz might as well not have been there he did jager studied mordechai again id expected more from you than a role like this you should be commanding a region maybe the whole area of all the things anielewicz hadnt expected failing to live up to a nazis expectations of him ranked high on the list his shrug was embarrassed i was for a while but then not everything worked out the way id hoped it would these things happen the lizards figured out you were playing little games behind their backs did they jager asked back when theyd met in hrubieszow anielewicz had figured he was no ones fool he wasnt saying anything now to make the jew change his mind before the silence got awkward he waved a hand never mind it isnt my business and the less i know of what isnt my business the better for everyone what do you want with us here and now youre advancing on lodz mordechai said as far as he was concerned that should have been an answer sufficient in and of itself it wasnt frowning jager said damn right we are we dont get the chance to advance against the lizards nearly often enough most of the time theyre advancing on us anielewicz sighed quietly he might have known the german wouldnt understand what he was talking about he approached it by easy stages youve gotten good cooperation from the partisans here in western poland havent you colonel jager had been a major the last time mordechai saw him even if he hadnt come up in the world the german had well yes so we have jager answered why shouldnt we partisans are human beings too a lot of partisans are jews mordechai said the easy approach wasnt going to work bluntly then there are still a lot of jews in lodz too in the ghetto you nazis set up so you could starve us to death and work us to death and generally slaughter us if thewehrmacht goes into lodz the ss follows twenty minutes later the second we see an ss man we all go over to the lizards again we dont want them conquering you but we want you conquering us even less colonel why dont i take this mangy jew and send him on his way with a good kick in the ass the younger mangunthersaid corporal grillparzer when i want your suggestions be sure i shall ask for them jager said in a voice colder than the snow all around when he turned back toward mordechai his face was troubled he knew about some of the things the germans had done to the jews whod fallen into their hands knew and did not approve that made him an unusualwehrmacht man and made anielewicz glad he was the german on the other side of the parley still he had to look out for the affairs of his own side you ask us to throw away a move that would bring us advantages such a thing is hard to justify what im telling you is that you would lose as much as you gain mordechai answered you get intelligence from us about what the lizards are doing with nazis in lodz the lizards would get intelligence from us about you we got to know you too well we know what you did to us we do sabotage back of the lizards lines too instead wed be raiding and sniping at you kikes gunther grillparzer muttered under his breath shit all we gotta do is turn the poles loose on em and that takes care of that jager started to bawl out his corporal but anielewicz held up a hand its not that simple any more back when the war just started we didnt have any guns and we werent much good at using them anyhow its not like that now weve got more guns than the poles do and weve stopped being shy about shooting when somebody shoots at us we can hurt you theres some truth in thisive seen as much jager said but i think we can take lodz and it would make immediate military sense for us to do just that the place is a lizard forward base after all how am i supposed to justify bypassing it whats that expression the english have penny wise and pound foolish thats what youd be if you started your games with the jews again mordechai answered you need us working with you not against you didnt you take enough of a propaganda beating when the whole world found out what you were doing here in poland less than youd think jager said the ice in his voice now aimed at anielewicz a lot of the people who heard about it didnt believe it anielewicz bit his lip he knew how true that was do you suppose they didnt believe it because they didnt trust the lizards to tell the truth or because they didnt think human beings could be so vile that made gunther grillparzer mutter again and made the sentry whod brought mordechai into camp shift hisgewehr so the muzzle more nearly pointed toward the jew heinrich jager sighed probably both he said and mordechai respected his honesty but the whys here dont much matter the whats do if we bypass lodz north and south say and the lizards slice up into one of our columns from out of the city thefuhrer would not be very happy with that he rolled his eyes to give some idea of how much understatement he was using the only thing adolf hitler could do to make anielewicz happy would be to drop dead and to do that properly he would have had to manage it before nevertheless he understood what jager was saying if you bypass lodz to north and south colonel ill make sure the lizards cant mount a serious attack on you from the city youll make sure jager said you can still do so much i think so anielewicz answeredi hope so colonel im not going to talk about you owing me one of course by saying he wasnt going to talk about it hed just talked about it i will say though that i delivered then and i think i can deliver now can you i dont know the german answered he looked down at the pot of stew dug out a mess kit and spoon and ladled some into it instead of eating he passed the little aluminum tub to mordechai your people fed me then i can feed you now after a moment he added the meat is partridge we bagged a couple this morning anielewicz hesitated then dug in meat kasha or maybe barley carrots onionsit stuck to the ribs when he was done he gave the mess kit and spoon back to jager who cleaned them in the snow and then took his own share between bites the german said ill pass on what youve told me i dont promise anything will come of it but ill do my best i tell you this mordechai if we do skirt lodz youd better come through on your promise show that dealing with you people has a good side to it show that you deliver and the people above me are more likely to want to try to do it again i understand that anielewicz answered the same goes back at you i might add if you break faith with us after a deal you wont like the partisans who show up in your backyard and i understand that jager said whether my superiors will he shrugged i told you ill do what i can my word at least is good he eyed anielewicz as if daring him to deny it anielewicz couldnt so he nodded the german let out a long heavy sigh then went on in the end whether we go into lodz or around it wont matter anyhow if we conquer the territory around the city it will fall to us too sooner or later what happens then he wasnt wrong that made it worse not better anielewicz gave him credit he sounded genuinely worried gunther grillparzer on the other hand looked to be just this side of laughing out loud let a bunch of nazi soldiers like him loose in lodz and the results wouldnt be pretty what happens then mordechai sighed too i just dont know ussmak sat in the base commandants officehisoffice now even if he still wore the body paint of a landcruiser driver hed killed hisslef who had led the races garrison at this base in the region of the sssr known as siberia ussmak wondered ifsiberia was the russki word fordeep freeze he couldnt tell much difference between the one and the other along with hisslef a lot of his chief subordinates were dead too hunted down in the frenzy that had gripped the rest of the males after ussmak fired the first shot ginger had had a lot to do with both the shooting and the frenzy that followed it if hisslef had just had the sense to let the males gathered in the communal chamber yell themselves out complaining about the war about tosev and about this miserable base in particular he probably still would have been alive but no hed come storming in intent on stamping this out no matter what and now his corpse lay stiff and coldin siberian winter very stiff and very coldoutside the barracks waiting for the weather to warm up enough for a cremation and hisslef was legitimate commandant and see what happened to him ussmak muttered what will end up happening tome he had no millennia of authority to make his orders obeyed almost as if by reflex either he had to be obviously right or else he had to make the males in the base obey him out of fear of what would happen if they didnt his mouth fell open in a bitter laugh i might as well be a big ugly ruling a notempire he said to the walls they had to rule by fear they had no tradition to give them legitimate authority now he sympathized with them he understood in his gut how hard that was he opened a drawer in what had been hisslefs desk pulled out a vial of powdered ginger that washis by the emperor the emperor against whose officers hed mutinied though he tried not to think about that he yanked off the plastic stopper poured some of the powder into the palm of his hand and flicked out his long forked tongue again and again till the herb was gone exhilaration came quickly as it always did in moments after tasting the ginger ussmak felt strong fast clever invincible in the top part of his mind he knew those feelings save perhaps for heightened reflexes were an illusion when hed driven the landcruiser into combat hed held off on tasting till he got out again if you felt invincible when you really werent youd take chances that were liable to get you killed hed seen that happen to other males more times than he cared to recall now thoughnow i taste all i can because i dont want to think about whats going to happen next he said if the fleetlord wanted to blast this base from the air ussmak and his fellow mutineers had no antiaircraft missiles to stop them he couldnt surrender to the authorities hed put himself beyond the pale when he shot hisslef as his followers had with the killings that followed he couldnt hold out indefinitely here either the base would run short of both food and hydrogen for fueland for heat before long no supplies were coming in he hadnt worried about such things when he raised his personal weapon against hisslef hed just worried about making hisslef shut up thats the gingers fault he said querulouslyeven if his brain was buzzing with it while he complained it makes me as shortsighted as a big ugly hed threatened to yield the base and everything in it to the big uglies of the sssr if it came down to that he didnt know whether he could make himself do it the russkis made all sorts of glowing promises but how many would they keep once they had their claws on him hed done too much fighting against the big uglies to feel easy about trusting them of course if he didnt yield the base to the russkis they were liable to come take it away from him they minded cold much less than the race did fear of soviet raiders had been constant before the mutiny it was worse now no one wants to do anything hard now ussmak muttered going out into the bitter cold to make sure the russkis didnt get close enough to mortar the barracks wasnt duty anyone found pleasant but if the males didnt undertake it theyd end up dead a lot of them didnt seem to care hisslef had got them out there but hed enjoyed legitimate authority ussmak didnt and felt the lack he flicked on the radio that sat on his desk worked the search buttons to go from station to station some of the broadcasts the receivers picked up came from the race others mushy with static brought him the incomprehensible words of the big uglies he didnt really want to hear either group feeling dreadfully isolated from both then to his surprise he found what had to be a tosevite transmission but one where the broadcaster not only spoke his language but was plainly a male of the race no tosevite was free of accent either annoying or amusing this fellow was not just one of his own but by the way he spoke a male of considerable status tell you again this war is being conducted by idiots with fancy body paint they anticipated none of the difficulties the race would confront in trying to conquer tosev and when they found those difficulties what did they do about them not much by the emperor no not atvar and his clique of cloacalicking fools they just pressed on as if the big uglies were the swordswinging savages wed presumed them to be when we set out from home and how many good brave and obedient males have died on account of their stupidity think on it you who still live truth ussmak exclaimed whoever this male was he understood what was what he had a grasp of the big picture too ussmak had heard captive males broadcasting before most of them just sounded pathetic repeating the phrases the tosevites ordered them to say it made for bad unconvincing propaganda this fellow though sounded as if hed prepared his own material and was enjoying every insult he hurled at the fleetlord ussmak wished hed caught the beginning of this transmission so he could have learned the broadcasters name and rank the fellow went on here and there on tosev males are getting the idea that continuing this futile bloody conflict is a dreadful mistake many have thrown down their weapons and yielded to the tosevite empire or notempire controlling the area in which they were assigned most tosevite empires and notempires treat prisoners well i straha shiplord of theth emperor yower can personally attest to this atvar the brainaddled fool was going to destroy me for daring to oppose his senseless policies but i escaped to the united states and have never regretted it even for an instant straha ussmak swung both eye turrets to focus sharply on the radio straha had been the thirdranking male in the conquest fleet ussmak knew hed fled to the big uglies but hadnt known much about why he hadnt caught any of the shiplords earlier broadcasts he clawed at a sheet of paper slicing it into strips straha had told the truth and instead of being rewarded as was proper had suffered for it the refugee shiplord went on nor is yielding to the tosevites your only choice i have heard reports of brave males in siberia who tired at last of endless orders to do the impossible struck a blow for freedom against their own misguided commanders and who now rule their base independent of foolish plans formulated by males who float in comfort high above tosev and who think that makes them wise you who hear my voice ignore orders whose senselessness you can see with one eye turret and with the nictitating membrane over that eye remonstrate with your officers if all else fails imitate the brave siberians and reclaim liberty for yourselves i straha have spoken static replaced the shiplords voice ussmak felt stronger more alive than even ginger could make him however much he enjoyed that intoxication he knew it was artflicial what straha had said though was real every word of it males on the ground had been treated shabbily had been sacrfliced for no good purposefor no purpose at all as far as ussmak could tell straha had also told him something he badly needed to know when hed spoken with the males up in orbit hed threatened to surrender the base to the local big uglies if the race didnt meet his demands or attacked him hed hesitated about doing anything more than threatening since he didnt know how the soviets would treat males they captured but straha had set his mind at ease he didnt know much about tosevite geography but he did know the united states and the sssr were two of the biggest strongest notempires on tosev if the united states treated its captured males well no doubt the sssr would do the same ussmak hissed in satisfaction we now have a new weapon against you he said and turned both eye turrets up toward the starships still in orbit around tosev his mouth dropped open those males up there certainly didnt know much about the big uglies sam yeager looked at the rocket motor painfully assembled from parts made in smalltown machine shops all over arkansas and southern missouri it lookedwellcrude was the politest word that came to mind he sighed once you see what the lizards can do anything people turn out is small potatoes alongside it no offense sir he added hastily none taken robert goddard answered as a matter of fact i agree with you we do the best we can thats all his gray worn face said he was doing more than that he was busy working himself to death yeager worried about him he walked around the motor if you set it alongside the pieces of the one from the lizard shuttlecraft that had brought straha down to exile it was a kids toy he took off his service cap scratched at his blond hair you think itll fly sir the only way to find out is to light it up and see what happens goddard answered if were lucky well get to testfire it on the ground before we wrap sheet metal around it and stick some explosives on top the trouble is testfiring a rocket motor isnt what youd call inconspicuous and wed probably have a visit from the lizards in short order its a straight scaledown from the motor in the lizard shuttlecraft yeager said vesstil thinks that should be a pretty good guarantee itll work the right way vesstil knows more about flying rockets than anyone human goddard said with a weary smile seeing as he flew straha down from his starship when he defected that goes without saying but vesstil doesnt know beans about engineering at least the cutandtry kind everything else changes when you scale up or down and you have to try the new model to see what the devil youve got he chuckled wryly and its notquite a straight scaledown anyhow sergeant weve had to adapt the design to what we like to do and what were able to do well yes sir sam felt his ears heat with embarrassment since his skin was very fair he feared goddard could watch him flush hell of a thing for me to even think of arguing with you goddard had more experience with rockets than anybody who wasnt a lizard or a german and he was gaining on the germans yeager went on if i hadnt read the pulps before the war i wouldnt be here working with you now youve taken advantage of what you read goddard answered if you hadnt done that you wouldnt be of any use to me you spend as much time bouncing around as ive done sir and you know that if you see a chance youd better grab for it with both hands cause odds are youll never see it again yeager scratched his head once more hed spent his whole adult life up till the lizards came playing minorleague ball a broken ankle ten years before had effectively ended whatever chance hed had of making the majors but hed hung in there anyhow and on the endless bus and train trips from one small or mediumsized town to the next hed killed time withastounding and any other sciencefiction magazines hed found on the newsstands his teammates had laughed at him for reading about bugeyed monsters from another planet nownow robert goddard said im glad you grabbed this one sergeant i dont think i could have gotten nearly so much information out of vesstil with a different interpreter its not just that you know his language you have a real feel for what hes trying to get across thanks sam said feeling about ten feet tall soon as i got the chance to have anything to do with the lizards besides shooting at em i knew thats what i wanted theyrefascinating you know what i mean goddard shook his head what they know the experience they havethats fascinating but them he laughed selfconsciously a good thing vesstils not around right now hed be insulted if he knew he gave me the creeps he probably wouldnt sir yeager said the lizards mostly dont make any bones about us giving them the creeps he paused hmm come to think of it he might be insulted at that sort of like if a kukluxer found out some negroes looked down their noses at white men as if we dont have the right to think lizards are creepy you mean thats right sam nodded but snakes and things like that they never bothered me not even when i was a kid and the lizards every time im with one of them im liable to learn something new not just new for me i mean but something nobody no human being ever knew before thats pretty special in a way its even more special than jonathan now he laughed the nervous laugh goddard had used before dont let barbara found out i said that you have my word the rocket scientist said solemnly but i do understand what you mean your son is an unknown to you but hes not the first baby that ever was really discovering something for the first time is a thrill almost as addictive asas ginger shall we say as long as we dont let the lizards hear us say it sure yeager answered they sure do like that stuff dont they he hesitated again then went on sir im mighty glad you decided to move operations back here to hot springs gives me the chance to be with my family lets me help barbara out every now and then i mean we havent even been married a year yet and im glad its worked out well for you sergeant goddard said but thats not the reason i came down here from couch oh i know its not sir sam said hastily as if he hadnt spoken goddard went on hot springs is a decentsized city with at least a little light manufacturing were not far from little rock which has more and we have all the lizards at the army and navy general hospital here upon whom we can draw for expertise that has proved much more convenient than transferring the lizards up to southern missouri one by one like i said its great by me yeager told him and weve moved an awful lot of pieces of the lizard shuttlecraft down here so we can study em better i worried about that goddard said the lizards always knew about where vesstil brought straha down we were lucky we concealed and stripped the shuttlecraft as fast as we did because they tried their hardest to destroy it they easily could have sent in troops by air to make sure theyd done the job and wed have had the devils own time stopping them they dont go poking their snouts into everything the way they did when they first landed here sam said i guess thats because weve hurt em a few times when they tried it a good thing too or i fear wed have lost the war by now goddard rose and stretched though from his grimace that hurt more than it made him feel good another incidental reason for coming to hot springs is the springs im going to my room to draw myself a hot bath id gotten used to doing without such things and almost forgot how wonderful they are yes sir yeager said enthusiastically the fourthfloor room in the army and navy general hospital he shared with barbaraand now jonathandidnt have a tub of its own washing facilities were down at the end of the hall that didnt bother him for one thing goddard was a vip while he was just an enlisted man doing what he could for the war effort for another the plumbing on the nebraska farm where hed grown up had consisted of a well and a twoholer out back of the house he didnt take running water cold or especially hot for granted walking up to his room was a lot more comfortable in winter than it had been in summertime when you didnt need to soak in the local springs to get hot and wet as he headed down the hall toward room he heard jonathan kicking up a ruckus in there he sighed and hurried a little faster barbara would be feeling harassed so would the lizard pows who also lived on this floor when he opened the door barbara sent him a look that went from hunted to relieved when she saw who he was she thrust the baby at him would you try holding him please she said no matter what i do he doesnt want to keep quiet okay hon he said lets see if theres a burp hiding in there he got jonathan up on his shoulder and started thumping the kids back he did it hard enough to make it sound as if he were working out on the drums barbara who had a gentler touch frowned at that the way she usually did but he got results with it as nowjonathan gave forth with an almost baritone belch and a fair volume of halfdigested milk then he blinked and looked much happier with himself oh good barbara exclaimed when the burp came out she dabbed at sams uniform tunic with a diaper there i got most of it but im afraid youre going to smell like sour milk for a while world wont end yeager said this isnt one of your big spit and polish places the smell of sour milk didnt bother him any more it was in the room most of the time along with the reek that came with the diaper pail even when it was closedthat reminded him of the barnyard on his parents farm not that he ever said so to barbara he held his little son out at arms length there you go kiddo you had that hiding in there where mommy couldnt find it didnt you barbara reached for the baby ill take him back now if you want its okay sam said i dont get to hold him all that much and you look like you could use a breather well now that you mention it yes barbara slumped into the only chair in the room she wasnt the pert girl sam had got to know she looked beat as she did most of the time if you didnt look beat most of the time with a new kid around either something was wrong with you or you had servants to look beat for you there were dark circles under her green eyes her blond hairseveral shades darker than samshung limp as if it were tired too she let out a weary sigh what i wouldnt give for a cigarette and especially a cup of coffee oh lordcoffee yeager said wistfully the worst cup of joe i ever drank in the greasiest greasy spoon in the lousiest little town i ever went throughand i went through a lot of em jeez itd go good right now if we had any coffee to ration we ought to share it between soldiers in the front lines and parents with babies less than a year old no one else could possibly need it so badly barbara said frazzled as she was she still spoke with a precision sam admired shed done graduate work at berkeley in medieval english literature before the war the kind of english you heard in ballparks didnt measure up alongside that jonathan wiggled and twisted and started to cry he was beginning to make different kinds of racket to show he had different things in mind sam recognized this one hes hungry hon by the schedule its not time to feed him yet barbara answered but do you know what as far as im concerned the schedule can go to the devil i cant stand listening to him yell until the clock says its okay for him to eat if nursing makes him happy enough to keep still for a while that suits me fine she wriggled her right arm out of the sleeve of the dark blue wool dress she was wearing tugged the dress down to bare that breast here give him to me yeager did the babys mouth fastened onto her nipple jonathan sucked avidly yeager could hear him gulping down the milk hed felt funny at first having to share barbaras breasts with his son but you couldnt bottlefeed these daysno formula no easy way to keep things as clean as they needed to be and after you got used to breastfeeding it didnt seem like such a big thing any more anyhow i think he may be going to sleep barbara said the radio newsman whod announced jimmy doolittles bomber raid over tokyo hadnt sounded more excited about a victory she went on hes going to want to nurse on the other side too though help me out of that sleeve would you sam i cant get it down by myself not while im holding him sure thing he hurried over to her stretched the sleeve out and helped her get her arm back through past the elbow after that she managed on her own the dress fell limply to her waist a couple of minutes went by before she shifted jonathan to her left breast hed better fall asleep pretty soon barbara said im cold he looks as if hes going to sam answered he draped a folded towel over her left shoulder not so much to help warm her as to keep the baby from drooling or spitting up on her when she burped him one of her eyebrows rose as if hes going to she echoed he knew what she meant he wouldnt have said it that way when they first met hed made it through high school then gone off to play ball must be the company i keep he replied with a smile and then went on more seriously i like learning things from the people im aroundfrom the lizards too its turned out is it any wonder ive picked things up from you oh in a way its a wonder barbara said a lot of people seem to hate the idea of ever learning anything new im glad youre not like that it would make life boring she glanced down at jonathan yes he is falling asleep good sure enough before long her nipple slipped out of the babys mouth she held him a little longer then gently raised him to her shoulder and patted his back he burped without waking up and didnt spit up either she slid him back down to the crook of her elbow waited a few minutes more and got up to put him in the wooden crib that took up a large part of the small room jonathan sighed as she laid him down she stood there for a moment afraid he would wake but when his breathing steadied she straightened and reached down to fix her dress before she could sam stepped up behind her and cupped a breast in each hand she turned her head and smiled at him over her shoulder but it wasnt a smile of invitation even though they had started making love again a couple of weeks before do you mind too much if i just lie down for a while she said by myself i mean its not that i dont love you samits just that im so tired i cant see straight okay i understand that he said and let go the soft warm memory of her flesh remained printed on his palms he kicked at the linoleum floor once barbara quickly pulled her dress up to where it belonged then turned around and put her hands on his shoulders thank you she said i know this hasnt been easy for you either takes some getting used to thats all he said being in the middle of the war when we got married didnt help a whole lot and then you were expecting right away as best they could tell that had happened on their wedding night he chuckled of course if it hadnt been for the war we never would have met what do they say about clouds and silver linings barbara hugged him im very happy with you and with our baby and with everything she corrected herself yawning with almost everything i could do with a lot more sleep im happy with just about everything too he said his arms tightening around her back as hed said if it hadnt been for the war they wouldnt have met if they had met she wouldnt have looked at him shed been married to a nuclear physicist in chicago but jens larssen had been away from the met lab project away for so long theyd both figured he was dead and theyd become first friends then lovers and finally husband and wife and then barbara had got pregnantand then theyd found out jens was alive after all sam squeezed barbara one more time then let her go and walked over to the side of the crib to look down at their sleeping son he reached out a hand and ruffled jonathans fine thin head of almost snowwhite hair thats sweet barbara said hes a pretty good little guy yeager answeredand if you hadnt been carrying him odds are ten bucks against a wooden nickel youd have dropped me and gone back to larssen he smiled at the babykid i owe you a big one for that one of these days ill see if i can figure out how to pay you back barbara kissed him on the lips a brief friendly peck and then walked over to the bed iam going to get some rest she said okay sam headed for the door i guess ill find me some lizards and chin with them for a while do me some good now and maybe even after the war too if there ever is an after the war whatever happens people and lizards are going to have to deal with each other from here on out the more i know the better off ill be i think youll be just fine any which way barbara answered as she lay down why dont you come back in an hour or so if jonathans still asleep who knows what might happen well find out yeager opened the door then glanced back at his son sleep tight kiddo the man who wore earphones glanced over at vyacheslav molotov comrade foreign commissar we are getting new reports that theyashcheritsi at the base east of tomsk are showing interest in surrendering to us when molotov didnt answer the technician made so bold as to add you remember comrade the ones who mutinied against their superiors i assure you comrade i am aware of the situation and need no reminding molotov said in a voice colder than moscow wintercolder than siberian winter too the technician gulped and dipped his head to show he understood you were lucky to get away with one slip around molotov you wouldnt get away with two the foreign commissar went on have they any definite terms this time dacomrade foreign commissar the fellow at the wireless set looked down at the notes hed scribbled his pencil was barely as long as his thumb everything was at a premium these days they want pledges not only of safe conduct but also of good treatment after going over to us we can give them those molotov said at once i would think even the local military commander would have the wit to see as much for himself the local military commander should also have had the wit to see that such pledges could be ignored the instant they became inconvenient on the other hand it was probably just as well that the local military commander displayed no excessive initiative but referred his questions back to moscow and the communist party of the soviet union for answers commanders who usurped party control in one area were only too likely to try to throw it off in others the wireless operator spoke groups of seemingly meaningless letters over the air molotov sincerely hoped they were meaningless to the lizards what else do the mutineers want he asked a pledge that under no circumstances will we return them to the lizards not even if an end to hostilities is agreed to between the peaceloving workers and peasants of the soviet union and the alien imperialist aggressors from whose camp they are trying to defect again we can agree to this molotov said it was another promise that could be broken at need although molotov did not see the need as being likely to arise by the time peace between the ussr and the lizards came along he guessed the mutineers would be long forgotten what else they demand our promise to supply them with unlimited amounts of ginger comrade foreign commissar the technician replied again after checking his notes as usual molotovs pale bluntfeatured face revealed nothing of what was in his mind in their own way the lizards were as degenerate as the capitalists and fascists against whom the glorious peasants and workers of the ussr had demonstrated new standards of virtue despite their high technology though the lizards were in social terms far more primitive than capitalist societies they were a bastion of the ancient economic system they were masters seeking human beings as slavesso the dialecticians had decreed well the upper classes of ancient rome had been degenerates too and through degeneracy the exploiters could be exploited we shall certainly make this concession molotov said if they want to drug themselves we will gladly provide them with the means to do so he waited for more code groups to go out over the air then asked again what else they insist on driving the tanks away from the base themselves on retaining their personal weapons and on remaining together as a group the wireless operator answered theyare gaining in sophistication molotov said this i shall have to consider after a couple of minutes he said they may drive their vehicles away from their base but not to one of ours the local commandant is to point out to them that trust between the two sides has not been fully established he is to tell them they will be divided into several smaller groups for efficiency of interrogation he may add that if they are so divided we shall let them retain their weapons otherwise not let me make sure i have that comrade before i transmit it the technician said and repeated back molotovs statement when the foreign commissar nodded the man sent out the appropriate code groups anything more molotov asked the wireless operator shook his head molotov got up and left the room somewhere deep under the kremlin the guard outside saluted molotov ignored him as he had not bothered giving the man at the wireless a farewell superfluities of any sort were alien to his nature that being so he did not chortle when he went upstairs by his face no one could have guessed whether the lizard mutineers had agreed to give up or were instead demanding that he present himself for immediate liquidation but insidefoolshe thoughtthey are fools no matter that theyd become more sophisticated than before the lizards were still naive enough to make even americans seem worldly by comparison hed seen that before even among their chiefs they had no notion of how to play the political games human diplomates took for granted their ruling assumption had plainly been that they would need no such talents that their conquest of earth would be quick and easy now that that hadnt happened they were out of their depth soldiers snapped to attention as he strode through the halls of the kremlin civilian functionaries muted their conversations and gave him respectful nods he did not acknowledge them he barely noticed them had he failed to receive them though he would have made sharp note of that the devils cousin or some other malicious wretch had dumped a stack of papers on his desk while he went down to bring himself up to date on the talks with the mutinous lizards he had high hopes for those talks the soviet union already had a good many lizard prisoners of war and had learned some useful things from them once lizards surrendered they seemed to place humans in the positions of trust and authority their own superiors had formerly occupied for them and to lay hold of an entire base full of the equipment the alien aggressors from the stars manufactured unless soviet intelligence was badly mistaken that would be a coup neither the germans nor the americans could match the british had a lot of lizard gear but the imperialist creatures had done their best to wreck it after their invasion of england failed the first letter on the pile was from the social activities committee ofkolkhoz so the return address stated at any rate but the collective farm not far outside of moscow was where igor kurchatov and his team of nuclear physicists were laboring to fabricate an explosivemetal bomb theyd made one out of metal stolen from the lizards isolating more of the metal for themselves was proving as hard as theyd warned molotov it wouldharder than hed wanted to believe sure enough kurchatov now wrote the latest experiment comrade foreign commissar was a success less complete than we might have hoped molotov did not need his years of reading between the lines to infer that the experiment had failed kurchatov went on certain technical aspects of the situation still present us with difficulties outside advice might prove useful molotov grunted softly when kurchatov asked for outside advice he didnt mean help from other soviet physicists every reputable nuclear physicist in the ussr was already working with him molotov had put his own neck on the block by reminding stalin of that he shuddered to think of the risk hed taken for therodina the motherland what kurchatov wanted was foreign expertise humiliatingmolotov thought the soviet union should not have been so backwards he would never ask the germans for help even if they gave it he wouldnt trust what they gave stalin was just as well pleased that the lizards in poland separated the ussr from hitlers madmen and there molotov completely agreed with his leader the americans molotov gnawed at his mustache maybe just maybe they were making their own explosivemetal bombs just as the nazis were and if he could tempt them with some of the prizes the lizard base near tomsk would yield he pulled out a pencil and a scrap of paper and began to draft a letter jesus god will you lookit this mutt daniels exclaimed as he led his platoon through the ruins of what had been chicagos north side and all from one bomb too dont hardly seem possible does it lieutenant sergeant herman muldoon agreed the kids they were leading didnt say anything they just looked around with wide eyes and even wider mouths at their fair share of a few miles worth of slagged wreckage i been on gods green earth goin on sixty years now mutt said his mississippi drawl flowing slow and thick as molasses in this miserable northern winter i seen a whole lot o things in my time i fought in two wars now and i done traveled all over the us of a but i aint never seen nothin like this here you got that right muldoon said he was daniels age near enough and hed been around too the men alongside them in the ragged skirmish line didnt have that kind of experience but theyd never seen anything like this either nobody had not till the lizards came before they came daniels had been managing the decatur commodores a threei league team one of his ballplayers had liked reading pulp stories about rocketships and creatures from other planets he wondered if sam yeager was still alive these days mutt pulled an image from that kind of story now the north side reminded him of the mountains of the moon when he said that out loud herman muldoon nodded he was tall and thickshouldered with a long tough irish mug and at the moment a chin full of graying stubble i heard that about france back in nineteen an eighteen and i thought it was pretty straight then goes to show what i knew dont it yeah daniels said hed seen france too france had more cratersn you could shake a stick at thats for damn sure tween us and the frogs and the limeys and theboches we musta done fired every artillery shell in the world bout ten times over but this here its just the one you could tell where the bomb had gone off all the wreckage leaned away from it if you drew a line from the direction of fallen walls and houses and uprooted trees then went west a mile or so and did the same thing the place where those lines met would have been around ground zero there were other ways of working out where that lay though identfliable wreckage was getting thin on the ground now more and more it was just lumpy halfshiny dirt baked by the heat of the bomb into stuff that was almost like glass it was slippery like glass too especially with snow scattered over it one of mutts men had his feet go out from under him and landed on his can oww he said and then ahh shit as his comrades laughed at him he tried to get upand almost fell down again you want to play those kind o games kurowski you get yourself a clown suit not the one youre wearin mutt said sorry lieutenant kurowski said in injured tones that had nothing to do with his sore fundament it aint like im doing it on purpose yeah i know but youre still doin it mutt gave up ragging him he recognized the big pile of brick and steel off to the left it had come through the blast fairly well and had shielded some of the apartment houses behind it so they werent badly damaged at all but the sight of upright buildings in the midst of the wreckage wasnt what made the hair stand up on the back of his neck aint that wrigley field he whispered gotta be from where its at and what it looks like hed never played in wrigley fieldthe cubs had still been out at old west side grounds when he came through as a catcher for the cardinals before the first world war but seeing the ballpark in ruins brought the reality of this war home to him like a kick in the teeth sometimes big things would do that sometimes little ones he remembered a doughboy breaking down and sobbing like a baby when he found some french kids dolly with its head blown off muldoons eyes slid over toward wrigley for a moment gonna be a long time before the cubs win another pennant he said as good an epitaph as any for the parkand the city south of wrigley field a big fellow with a sergeants stripes and a mean expression gave daniels a perfunctory salute come on lieutenant he said im supposed to get your unit into line here well then go on and do it mutt said most of his men didnt have enough experience to wipe their asses after they went and squatted a lot of them were going to end up casualties because of it sometimes all the experience in the world didnt matter either mutt had scars on his backside from a lizard bulletluckily a throughandthrough flesh wound that hadnt chewed up his hipbone a couple three feet up though and it would have hit him right in the ear the sergeant led them out of the blast area down through the near north side toward the chicago river the big buildings ahead stood empty and battered as meaningless to what was happening now as so many dinosaur bones might have beenunless of course they had lizard snipers in them we shoulda pushed em farther back the sergeant said spitting in disgust but what the hell you gonna do them lizards theyre hard to push daniels agreed glumly he looked around the big bomb hadnt leveled this part of chicago but any number of small bombs and artillery shells had had their way with it so had fire and bullets the ruins gave ideal cover for anybody who felt like picking a line and fighting it out there this heres a lousy part of town for pushin em too this heres a lousy part of town periodsir the sergeant said all the dagos used to live here till the lizards ran em outmaybe they did somethin decent there you ask me knock off the crap about dagos daniels told him he had two in his platoon if the sergeant turned his back on giordano and pinelli he was liable to end up dead now he sent mutt an odd glance as if wondering why he didnt agree no pudgy old redfaced guy who talked like a johnny reb could be a dago himself so what was he doing taking their part but mutt was a lieutenant so the sergeant shut up till he got the platoon to its destination this heres oak and cleveland sir they call it dead corner on account of the dathe eyetalian gents got in the habit of murdering each other here during prohibition somehow there never were any witnesses funny how that works aint it he saluted and took off the platoon leader daniels replaced was a skinny blond guy named rasmussen he pointed south lizard lines are about four hundred yards down that way out past locust last couple days its been pretty quiet okay daniels brought field glasses up to his eyes and peered down past locust he spotted a couple of lizards things had to be quiet or they never would have shown themselves they were about the size of tenyearolds with greenbrown skin painted in patterns that meant things like rank and specialization badges and service stripes swively eyes and a forwardleaning skittery gait unlike anything ever spawned on earth they sure are ugly little critters rasmussen said littles the word too how do things that size go about making so much trouble they manage thats a fact mutt answered what i dont see is now that theyre here how we ever gonna get rid of all of em theyve come to stay no two ways about that atall just have to kill em all i guess rasmussen said good luck mutt said theyre liable to do that to us instead real liable you ask menot that you didwe got to find some other kind of way he rubbed his bristly chin only trouble is i aint got a clue what it could be hope somebody does if nobody does we better find one pretty damn quick or were in all kinds of trouble like you said i didnt ask you rasmussen told him ii high above dover a jet plane roared past without looking up david goldfarb couldnt tell whether it was a lizard aircraft or a british meteor given the thick layer of gray clouds hanging low overhead looking up probably wouldnt have done him any good either thats one of ours flight lieutenant basil roundbush declared if you say so goldfarb answered tacking on sir half a beat too late i do say so roundbush told him he was tall and handsome and blond and ruddy with a dashing mustache and a chestful of decorations first from the battle of britain and then from the recent lizard invasion as far as goldfarb was concerned a pilot deserved a bloody medal just for surviving the lizard attack even meteors were easy meat against the machines the lizards flew to make matters worse roundbush wasnt just a fighting machine with more ballocks than brains hed helped fred hipple with improvements on the engines that powered the meteor he had a lively wit and women fell all over him taken all in all he gave goldfarb an inferiority complex he did his best to hide it because roundbush within the limits of possessing few limits was withal a most likable chap i am but a mere umble radarman sir goldfarb said making as if to tug at a forelock he didnt have i wouldnt know such things i wouldnt youre a mere umble pile of malarkey is what you are roundbush said with a snort goldfarb sighed the pilot had the right accent too his own despite studious efforts to make it more cultivated betrayed his east end london origins every time he opened his mouth he hadnt had to exaggerate it much to put on his umble air for roundbush the pilot pointed the oasis lies ahead onward they quickened their strides the white horse inn lay not far from dover castle in the northern part of town it was a goodly hike from dover college where they both labored to turn lizard gadgetry into devices the raf and other british forces could use it was also the best pub in dover not only for its bitter but also for its barmaids not surprisingly it was packed uniforms of every sortraf army marines royal navymingled with civilian tweed and flannel the great fireplace at one end of the room threw heat all across it as it had been doing in that building since the fourteenth century goldfarb sighed blissfully the dover college laboratories where he spent his days were clean modernand bloody cold as if in a rugby scrum he and roundbush elbowed their way toward the bar roundbush held up a hand as they neared the promised land two pints of best bitter darling he bawled to the redhead in back of the long oaken expanse for you dearie anything sylvia said with a toss of her head all the men who heard her howled wolfishly goldfarb joined in but only so as not to seem out of place he and sylvia had been lovers a while before it wasnt that hed been mad about her it wasnt even that he d been her only one at the time she was in her own way honest and hadnt tried to string him along with such stories but seeing her now that theyd parted did sometimes stingnot least because he still craved the sweet warmth of her body she slid the pint pots toward them roundbush slapped silver on the bar sylvia took it when she started to make change for him he shook his head she smiled a large promising smileshe was honestly mercenary too goldfarb raised his mug to group captain hipple he said he and roundbush both drank if it hadnt been for fred hipple the raf would have had to go on fighting the lizards with hurricanes and spitfires not jets but hipple had been missing since the lizards attacked the bruntingthorpe research station during their invasion the toast was all too likely to be the only memorial hed ever get roundbush peered with respect at the deep golden brew he was quaffing thatsbloody good he said these handmade bitters often turn out better than what the brewers sold all across the country youre right about that goldfarb said thoughtfully smacking his lips he fancied himself a connoisseur of bitter well hopped nutty he took another pull to remind himself of what he was talking about the pint pots quickly emptied goldfarb raised a hand to order another round he looked around for sylvia didnt see her for a moment then he did she was carrying a tray of mugs over to a table by the fire as if by magic another woman materialized behind the bar while his head was turned you want a fresh pint she asked two pintsone for my friend here he answered automatically then he looked at her hullo youre new here she nodded as she poured beer from the pitcher into the pint pots yesmy names naomi she wore her dark hair pulled back from her face it made her look thoughtful she had delicate features skin pale without being pink narrow chin wide cheekbones large gray eyes elegantly arched nose goldfarb paid for the bitter all the while studying her at last he risked a word not in englishyehudeh those eyes fixed on him sharply he knew she was searching his featuresand knew what shed find his brown curly hair and formidable nose had not sprung from native english stock after a moment she relaxed and said yes im jewishand you unless im wrong now that he heard more than a sentence from her he caught her accentlike the one his parents had though not nearly so strong he nodded guilty as charged he said which won a cautious smile from her he left her a tip as large as the one basil roundbush had given sylvia though he could afford it less well he raised his mug to her before he drank then asked what are you doing here in england do you mean she asked wiping the bar with a bit of rag my parents were lucky enough smart enoughwhatever you liketo get out of germany in i came with them i was fourteen then that made her twenty or twentyone now a fine age goldfarb thought reverently he said my parents came from poland before the first world war so i was born here he wondered if he should have told her that german jews sometimes looked down their noses at their polish cousins but she said you were very lucky then what we went through and we were gone before the worst and in poland they say it was even worse everything they say is true too david answered have you ever heard moishe russie broadcast were cousins ive talked with him after he escaped from poland if it hadnt been for the lizards there wouldnt be any jews left there by now i hate being grateful to them but there you are yes i have heard him naomi said terrible things therebut there at least theyre over in germany they go on i know goldfarb said and took along pull at his bitter and the nazis have hit the lizards as many licks as anyone else maybe more the worlds gone crazy it bloody well has basil roundbush had been talking with a sandyhaired royal navy commander now he turnedback to find a fresh pint at his elbowand naomi behind the bar he pulled himself straight he could turn on two hundred watts of charm the way most men flicked on a light switch well well he said with a toothy smile our publicans taste has gone up it has indeed where did he find you not sportinggoldfarb thought he waited for naomi to sigh or giggle or do whatever she did to show she was smitten he hadnt seen roundbush fail yet but the barmaid just answered coolly enough i was looking for work and he was kind enough to think i might do now if you will excuse me she hurried off to minister to other thirststricken patrons roundbush dug an elbow into goldfarbs ribs not sporting old man you have an unfair advantage there unless im much mistaken damn it hewas sharp to have identflied the accent or placed her looks so quickly me goldfarb said youre a fine one to talk of advantages when youve got everything in a skirt from here halfway to the isle of wight going all soppy over you whatever could you be talking about my dear fellow roundbush said and stuck his tongue in his cheek to show he was not to be taken seriously he gulped down his pint then waved the pot at sylvia who had at last come back another round of these for david and me if you please darling coming up she said roundbush turned back to the royal navy man goldfarb asked sylvia when did she start here his eyes slid toward naomi a few days ago sylvia answered you ask me shes liable to be too fine to make a go of it you have to be able to put up with the drunken randy sods who want anything they can get out of youor into you thanks goldfarb said youve just made me feel about two inches high blimey youre a gent you are next to a lot of these bastards sylvia said praising with faint damn she went on naomi her way looks to be pretending she doesnt notice the pushy ones or understand what they want from her thats only good for so long sooner or laterlikely soonersomebodys going to try reaching down her blouse or up her dress then well before she could say see the riflecrack of a slap cut through the chatter in the white horse inn a marine captain raised a hand to his cheek naomi quite unperturbed set a pint of beer in front of him and went about her business timed that well i did though i say so my own self sylvia remarked with more than a little pride that you did goldfarb agreed he glanced over toward naomi their eyes met for a moment he smiled she shrugged as if to sayall in a days work he turned back to sylvia good for her he said liu han was nervous she shook her head no she was more than nervous she was terrflied the idea of meeting the little scaly devils facetoface made her shiver inside shed been a creature under their control for too long first in their airplane that never came down where they made her submit to one man after another so they could learn how people behaved in matters of the pillow and then after shed got pregnant down in their prison camp not far from shanghai after shed had her baby theyd stolen it from her she wanted her child back even if it was only a girl with all that in her past she had trouble believing the scaly devils would treat her like someone worth consideration now and she was a woman herself which did nothing to ease her confidence the doctrine of the peoples liberation army said women were and should be equal to men in the top part of her mind she was beginning to believe that down deep though a lifetime of teachings of the opposite lesson still shaped her thoughtsand her fears perhaps sensing that nieh hoting said it will be all right they wont do anything to you not at this parley they know we hold prisoners of theirs and what will happen to those prisoners if anything bad happens to us yes i understand she said but she shot him a grateful glance anyhow in matters military he knew what he was talking about hed served as political commissar in the first detachment of maos revolutionary army commanded a division in the long march and been an army chief of staff after the lizards came hed led resistance against themand against the japanese and against the counterrevolutionary kuomintang cliquefirst in shanghai and then here in peking and he was her lover though shed been born a peasant her wits and her burning eagerness for revenge on the little devils for all theyd done to her had made her a revolutionary herself and one whod risen quickly in the ranks a scaly devil emerged from the tent that his kind had built in the middle of thepan jo hsiang tai the fragrant terrace of wisdom the tent looked more like a bubble blown from some opaque orange shiny stuff than an honest erection of canvas or silk it clashed dreadfully not only with the terrace and the walls and the elegant staircases to either side but also with everything on thechiung hua tao the white pagoda island liu han stifled a nervous giggle peasant that she was shed never imagined back in the days before the little scaly devils took hold of her life and tore it up by the roots that she would find herself not just in the imperial city inside peking but on an island the old chinese emperors had used as a resort the little devil turned one turreted eye toward liu han the other toward nieh hoting you are the men of the peoples liberation army it asked in fair chinese and added a grunting cough at the end of the sentence to show it was a question a holdover from the usages of its own language when neither human denied it the scaly devil said you will come with me i am essaff inside the tent the lamps glowed almost like sunlight but slightly more yelloworange in tone that had nothing to do with the material from which the tent was made liu han had noticed it in all the illumination the little scaly devils used the tent was big enough to contain an antechamber when she started to go through the doorway essaff held up a clawed hand wait he said and tacked on a different cough one that put special emphasis on what he said we will examine you with our machines to make sure you carry no explosives this has been done to us before liu han and nieh hoting exchanged glances neither of them said anything liu han had had the idea of sending beastshow men whose trained animals fascinated the scaly devils to perform for themwith bombs hidden in the cases that also held their creatures a lot of those bombs had gone off fooling the little devils twice with the same trick was next to impossible essaff had the two humans stand in a certain place he examined images of their bodies in what looked like a small film screen liu han had seen its like many times before it seemed as common among the little devils as books among mankind after hissing like a bubbling pot for a minute or two essaff said you are honorable here in this case you may go in the main chamber of the tent held a table with more of the scaly devils machines at one end behind the table sat two males pointing to them in turn essaff said this one is ppevel assistant administrator eastern region main continental masschina you would say that one is ttomalss researcher in tosevitehuman you would saybehavior i know ttomalss liu han said holding emotion at bay with an effort of will that all but exhausted her ttomalss and his assistants had photographed her giving birth to her daughter and then taken the child before she could ask him how the girl was essaff said you tosevites you sit down with us the chairs the scaly devils had brought for them were of human make a concession shed never seen from them before as she and nieh hoting sat essaff asked you will drink tea no nieh said sharply you examined our bodies before we came in here we cannot examine the tea we know you sometimes try to drug people we will not drink or eat with you ttomalss understood chinese ppevel evidently did not essaff translated for him liu han followed some of the translation shed learned a bit of the scaly devils speech that was one reason she was here instead of niehs longtime aide hsia shoutao through essaff ppevel said this is a parley you need have no fear you had fear of us nieh answered if you do not trust us how can we trust you the scaly devils drugs did not usually work well on people nieh hoting and liu han both knew that nieh added even among our own peoplehuman beings i meanwe chinese have had to suffer under unequal treaties now we want nothing less than full reciprocity in all our dealings and give no more than we get ppevel said we are talking with you is this not concession enough it is a concession nieh hoting said it is not enough liu han added an emphatic cough to his words both ppevel and essaff jerked in surprise ttomalss spoke to his superior in a low voice liu han caught enough to gather that he was explaining how shed picked up some of their tongue let us talk then ppevel said we shall see who is equal and who is not when this war is over yes that is true nieh hoting agreed very well we shall talk do you wish this discussion to begin with great things and move down to the small or would you rather start with small things and work up as we make progress best we start with small things ppevel said because they are small you and we may both find it easier to give ground on them if we try too much at the beginning we may only grow angry with each other and have these talks fail altogether you are sensible nieh said inclining his head to the little scaly devil liu han listened to essaff explaining to ppevel that that was a gesture of respect nieh went on as we have notedhis voice was dry the peoples liberation army had noted it with bombswe demand that you return the girl child you callously kidnapped from liu han here ttomalss jumped as if someone had jabbed him with a pin this is not a small matter he exclaimed in chinese and added an emphatic cough to show he meant it essaff was put in the odd position of translating for one little devil what a different one said nieh hoting raised an eyebrow liu han suspected the gesture was wasted on the scaly devils who had no eyebrowsnor any other hair nieh said what would you call a small matter then i could tell you i find the stuff from which you have made this tent very ugly but that is hardly something worth negotiating compared to having all you imperialist aggressors leave china at once the fate of this baby is small or at least smaller when that had been translated ppevel said yes that is a small matter compared to the other in any case this land is now ours which admits of no discussionas you are aware nieh smiled without replying in words the european powers and the japanese had said such things to china too but failed in their efforts to consolidate what they had taken at bayonet point marxistleninist doctrine gave nieh a long view of history a view hed been teaching to liu han but she knew from her own experience that the little scaly devils had a long view of history too one that had nothing to do with marx or lenin they were inhumanly patient what worked against britain or japan might fail against them if they werent lying even the chinese the most anciently and perfectly civilized nation in the world might have been children beside them is my daughter well liu han asked ttomalss at last she dared not break down and cry but talking about the girl made her nose begin to run in lieu of tears she blew between her fingers before going on are you taking good care of her the hatchling is both comfortable and healthy ttomalss took out a machine of a sort liu han had seen before he touched a stud above the machine by some magic of the scaly devils an image of the baby sprang into being she was up on all fours wearing only a cloth around her middle and smiling wide enough to show two tiny white teeth liu han did start to weep then ttomalss knew enough to understand that meant grief he touched the stud again the picture vanished liu han didnt know whether that made things better or worse she ached to hold the baby in her arms gathering herself she said if you talk to people as equals or something close to equals you do not steal their children from them you can do one or the other but not both and if you do steal children you have to expect people to do everything they can to hurt you because of it but we take the hatchlings to learn how they and the race can relate to each other when starting fresh ttomalss said as if that were almost too obvious to need explanation ppevel spoke to him in the scaly devils tongue essaff declined to translate what he said nieh looked a question to liu han she whispered he says one thing they have learned is that people will fight for their hatchlings uh children this may not have been what they intended to find out but it is part of the answer nieh neither replied nor looked directly at ppevel liu han had enough practice at reading his face to have a pretty good notion that he thought ppevel no fool she had the same feeling about the little devil ppevels eye turrets swung back toward her and nieh hoting suppose we give back this hatchling he said through essaff ignoring another start of dismay from ttomalss suppose we do this what do you give us in return do you agree to no more bombings like those that marred the emperors birthday liu han sucked in a long breath she would have agreed to anything to have her baby back but that decision was not hers to make nieh hoting had authority there and nieh loved the cause more than any individual or that individuals concerns abstractly liu han understood that that was the way it should be but how could you think abstractly when youd just seen your baby for the first time since it was stolen no we do not agree to that nieh said it is too much to demand in exchange for one baby who cannot do you any harm giving back the hatchling would harm our research ttomalss said both nieh and ppevel ignored him nieh went on if you give us the baby though we will give you back one of your males whom we hold captive he must be worth more to you than that baby is any male is worth more to us than a tosevite ppevel said this is axiomatic but the words of the researcher ttomalss do hold some truth disrupting a longterm research program is not something we males of the race do casually we require more justflication for this than your simple demand does childstealing mean nothing to you as a crime liu han said not a great deal ppevel answered indifferently the race does not suffer from many of the fixations on other individuals with which you tosevites are so afflicted worst liu han realized was that he meant it the scaly devils were not evil not in their own strange eyes they were just so different from mankind that when they acted by their own standards of what was right and proper they couldnt help horrifying the people on whom they inflicted those standards understanding that though did nothing to get her daughter back tell me ppevel she asked with a dangerous glint in her eye how long have you been assistant administrator for this region nieh hotings gaze slid toward her for a moment but he didnt say anything or try to head her off the communists preached equality between the sexes and nieh followed that preachingbetter than most from what shed seen hsia shoutaos idea of the proper position for women in the revolutionary movement for instance was on their backs with their legs open i have not had this responsibility long ppevel said i was previously assistant to the assistant administrator why do you ask this irrelevant question liu han did not have a mouthful of small sharp pointed teeth as the little scaly devils did the predatory smile she sent ppevel showed she did not need them so your old chief is dead eh she said did he die on your emperors birthday all three scaly devils lowered their eyes for a moment when essaff translated emperor into their language ppevel answered yes but who do you think will replace you after our next attack liu han asked interrupting at a parley was probably bad form but she didnt care you may not think stealing children is a great crime but we do and we will punish all of you if we cant reach the guilty oneshe glared at ttomalssand you dont make amends this matter requires further analysis within the circles of the race ppevel said he had courage we do not say yes at this time but we do not say no let us move on to the next item of discussion very well nieh hoting said and liu hans heart sank the little scaly devils were not in the habit of lying over such matters and she knew it discussion on getting her daughter back would resume but every day the little girl was away would make her stranger harder to reclaim she hadnt seen a human being since she was three days old what would she be like even if liu han finally got her back from the outside the railroad car looked like one that hauled baggage david nussboym had seen that before the boredlooking nkvd men submachine guns in hand but plainly sure they wouldnt have to use them herded him and his companions in misfortune into it inside it was divided into nine compartments like any passenger car in an ordinary passenger car though four to a compartment was crowded people looked resentfully at one another as if it was the fault of the person on whom the irritated gaze fell that he took up so much space in each of the five prisoner compartments on this car nussboym shook his head he was a scrupulous man a meticulous man he didnt know how many people each of the other compartments held he knew there were twentyfive men in his he and three others had perchesnot proper seatsupon the baggage racks by the ceiling the strongest toughest prisoners lay in relative comfortand extremely relative it was tooon the hard middle bunk the rest sat jammed together on the lower bunk and on the floor on top of their meager belongings nussboyms rackmate was a lanky fellow named ivan fyodorov he understood some of nussboyms polish and a bit of yiddish when the polish failed nussboym in turn could follow russian after a fashion and fyodorov threw in a word of german every now and again he wasnt a mental giant tell me again how youre here david aronovich he said ive never heard a story like yours not even once nussboym sighed hed told the story three times already in the two dayshe thought it was two dayshed been perched on the rack its like this ivan vasilievich he said i was in lodz in poland in the part of poland the lizards held my crime was hating the germans worse than the lizards why did you do that fyodorov asked this was the fourth time hed asked that question too up till now nussboym had evaded it your average russian was no more apt to love jews than was your average pole cant you figure it out for yourself he asked now but when fyodorovs brow furrowed and did not clear he snapped damn it dont you see im jewish oh that yeah sure i knew that his fellow prisoner said sunny still aint no russian with a nose that big anyhow nussboym brought a hand up to the offended member but ivan hadnt seemed to mean anything by it past a simple statement of fact he went on so you were in lodz how did you gethere thats what i want to know my chums wanted to get rid of me nussboym said bitterly they wouldnt give me to the naziseven they arent that vile but they couldnt leave me in poland either they knew i wouldnt let them get away with collaborating so they knocked me unconscious took me across lizardheld country till they came to land you russians still controlledand they gave me to your border patrols fyodorov might not have been a mental giant but he was a soviet citizen he knew what had happened after that smiling he said and the border patrol decided you had to be a criminaland besides you were a foreigner and azhid to bootand so they dropped you into thegulag now i get it im so glad for you nussboym said sourly the window that looked out from the compartment to the hallway of the prison car had crosshatched bars over it nussboym watched a couple of nkvd men make their way toward the compartment entrance which had no door only a sliding grate of similar crosshatched bars the compartment had no windows that opened on the outside world just a couple of tiny barred blinds that might as well not have been there nussboym didnt care hed learned that when the nkvd men walked by with that slow deliberate stride they had food with them his stomach rumbled spit rushed into his mouth he ate better in the prison cara stolypin car the russians universally called itthan he had in the lodz ghetto before the lizards came but not much better one of the nkvd men opened the grate then stood back covering the prisoners with a submachine gun the other one set down two buckets all right youzeks he shouted feeding time at the zoo he laughed loudly at his own wit though he made the joke every time it was his turn to feed the prisoners they laughed too loudly if they didnt laugh nobody got anything to eat theyd found that out very fast a couple of beatings soon forced the recalcitrant ones into line satisfied the guard started passing out a chunk of coarse black bread and half a salted herring apiece theyd got sugar once but the guards said they were out of that now nussboym didnt know whether it was true but did know he was in no position to find out the prisoners who reclined on the middle bunk got the biggest loaves and fishes theyd enforced that rule with their fists too nussboyms hand went to the shiner below his left eye hed tried holding out on them and paid the price he wolfed down the bread but stuck his bony fragment of herring in a pocket hed learned to wait for water before he ate the fish it was so salty thirst would have driven him mad till he got something to drink sometimes the guards brought a bucket of water after they brought food sometimes they didnt today they didnt the train rumbled on in summer having two dozen men stuffed into a compartment intended for four would have been intolerablenot that that would have stopped the nkvd in a russian winter animal warmth was not to be despised in spite of being cold nussboym wasnt freezing his stomach growled again it didnt care that he would suffer agonies of thirst if he ate his herring without water all it knew was that it was still mostly empty and that the fish would help fill it up with a squeal of brakes the train pulled to a halt nussboym almost slipped down onto men below ivan had done that once theyd fallen on him like a pack of wolves beating and kicking him till he was black and blue after that the fellows perched on the baggage racks had learned to hang on tight during stops where are we do you think somebody down below asked in hell somebody else answered which produced laughs both more bitter and more sincere than the ones the guard had got for himself thisll be pskov i bet azek in the middle bunk declared i hear tell weve cleared the lizards away from the railroad line that leads there from the west after thathe stopped sounding so arrogant and sure of himselfafter that its north and east on to the white sea or maybe to the siberiangulags nobody spoke for a couple of minutes after that winter labor up around archangel or in siberia was enough to daunt even the heartiest of spirits small clangs and jerks showed that cars were either being added to the train or taken off it one of thezeks sitting on the bottom bunks said didnt the hitlerites take pskov away from therodina shit they cant do anything worse to us than our own people do oh yes they can nussboym said and told them about treblinka thats lizard propaganda is what that is the bigmouthedzek in the middle bunk said no nussboym said even in the face of opposition from the powerful prisoner about half thezeks in the car ended up believing him he reckoned that a moral victory a guard came back with a bucket of water a dipper and a couple of mugs he looked disgusted with fate as if by letting the men drink he was granting them a privilege they didnt deserve come on you slimy bastards he said queue upand make it snappy i dont have all day healthy men drank first then the ones with tubercular coughs and last of all the three or four luckless fellows who had syphilis nussboym wondered if the arrangement did any good because he doubted the nkvd men washed the mugs between uses the water was yellowish and cloudy and tasted of grease the guard had taken it from the engine tender instead of going to some proper spigot all the same it was wet he drank his allotted mug ate the herring and felt for a moment almost like a human being instead of azek georg schultz spun the us twobladed wooden prop the fivecylinder shvetsov radial caught almost at once in a russian winter an aircooled engine was a big advantage ludmila gorbunova had heard stories aboutluftwaffe pilots who had to light fires on the ground under the nose of their aircraft to keep their antifreeze from freezing up ludmila checked the rudimentary collection of dials on thekukuruzniks instrument panel all in all they told her nothing she didnt already know the wheatcutter had plenty of fuel for the mission she was going to fly the compass did a satisfactory job of pointing toward north and the altimeter said she was still on the ground she released the brake the little biplane bounced across the snowy field that served as an airstrip behind her she knew men and women with brooms would sweep snow over the tracks her wheels made the red air force tookmaskirovka seriously after one last jounce the u didnt come down ludmila patted the side of the fuselage with a gloved but affectionate hand though designed as a primary trainer the aircraft had harassed first the germans and then the lizardskukuruzniks flew low and slow and but for the engine had almost no metal they evaded the lizards detection systems that let the alien imperialist aggressors hack more sophisticated warplanes out of the sky with ease machine guns and light bombs werent much but they were better than nothing ludmila swung the aircraft into a long slow turn back toward the field from which shed taken off georg schultz still stood out there he waved to her and blew her a kiss before he started trudging for the pine woods not far away if tatiana saw you doing that shed blast your head off from eight hundred meters ludmila said the slipstream that blasted over the windscreen into the open cockpit blew her words away she wished something would do the same for georg schultz the german panzer gunner made a firstrate mechanic he had a feel for engines the way some people had a feel for horses that made him valuable no matter how loud and sincere a nazi he was since the soviet union and the hitlerites were at least formally cooperating against the lizards his fascism could be overlooked as fascism had been overlooked till the nazis treacherously broke their nonaggression pact with the ussr on june what ludmila couldnt stomach was that he kept trying to get her to go to bed with him though she had about as much interest in sleeping with him as she did with say heinrich himmler youd think he would have left me alone after he and tatiana started jumping on each other ludmila said to the cloudy sky tatiana pirogova was an accomplished sniper whod shot at nazis before she started shooting at lizards she was at least as deadly as schultz maybe deadlier as far as ludmila could see that was what drew them together men she added a complete sentence despite enjoying tatianas favors schultz still kept trying to lay her too under her breath she muttered damned nuisance she buzzed west across pskov soldiers in the streets some in russian khaki others in german fieldgray still others in winter white that made their nationality impossible to guess waved at her as she flew by she didnt mind that at all sometimes though human troops would fire at her in the air on the assumption that anything airborne had to belong to the lizards a train pulled out of the station heading northwest the exhaust from the locomotive was a great black plume that would have been visible for kilometers against the snow had the low ceiling not masked it the lizards liked shooting up trains whenever they got the chance she waved to the train when she came closest to it she didnt think anyone on board saw it but she didnt care trains pulling out of pskov were a hopeful sign during the winter the red armyand the germansludmila thought reluctantlyhad pushed the lizards back from the city and back from the railroad lines that ran through it these days you could if you were lucky get through to riga by train but you still needed luck and you still needed time that was why lieutenant general chill had sent his despatch with hernot only did it have a better chance of getting through it would reach his nazi counterpart in the latvian capital well before it could have got there by rail ludmila skinned back her teeth in a sardonic grin oh how the mighty nazi general wished he could have sent a mighty nazi flier to carry his message for him she said but he didnt have any mighty nazi fliers so he was stuck with me the expression on chills face had been that of a man biting into an unripe apple she patted the pocket of her furlined leather flying suit in which the precious despatch rested she didnt know what it said by the way chill had given it to her that was a privilege she didnt deserve she laughed a little as if he could have stopped her from opening the envelope and reading what was inside maybe he thought she wouldnt think of that if he did he was stupid even for a german perverse pride though had made her keep the envelope sealed general chill wasformallyan ally and had entrusted her with the message no matter how reluctant he was about it she would observe the proprieties in return thekukuruznik buzzed along toward riga the countryside over which it skimmed was nothing like the steppe that surrounded kiev where ludmila had grown up instead of endless empty kilometers she flew above snowdappled pine woods part of the great forest that stretched east to pskov and far far beyond here and there farms and villages appeared in the midst of the forest at first the human settlements in the middle of the wilderness almost startled ludmila as she flew on toward the baltic they grew ever more frequent their look changed about halfway to riga when she crossed from russia into latvia it wasnt just that the buildings changed though plaster walls and tile roofs took the place of wood and sometimes thatch things became more orderly too and more conservative of space all the land was used for some clearly defined purposecropland town woodlot or whatever it might have been everything plainly was being exploited not lying around waiting in case some use eventually developed for it it might as well be germany ludmila said aloud the thought gave her pause latvia had only been reincorporated into the soviet union a little more than a year before the hitlerites treacherously invaded therodina reactionary elements there had welcomed the nazis as liberators and collaborated with them against soviet forces reactionary elements in the ukraine had done the same thing but ludmila tried not to think about that she wondered what sort of reception shed get in riga pskov had had soviet partisans lurking in the nearby forests and was now essentially a codominion between german and soviet forces she didnt think any signflicant soviet forces operated anywhere near latviafarther south maybe but not by the baltic so she said there soon will be a signflicant soviet force in latvia me the slipstream blew away the joke and the humor from it she found the baltic coast and followed it south toward riga the sea had frozen some kilometers out from the shore the sight made her shiver even for a russian that was a lot of ice smoke rose from riga harbor the lizards had been pummeling harbors lately when ludmila approached the docks she started drawing rifle fire shaking her fists at the idiots who took her biplane for a lizard aircraft she swung away and looked around for someplace to land thekukuruznik not far from what looked like the main boulevard she spied a park full of barebranched trees it had enough empty spacesnow and dead yellowbrown grassand to spare for the biplane no sooner had she slid to a jerky stop than german troops in fieldgray and white came running up to her they saw the red stars on thekukuruzniks wings and fuselage who are you you damned russian and what are you doing here one of them shouted a typically arrogant german he assumed she spoke his language as it happened he was right this time senior lieutenant ludmila gorbunova red air force ludmila answered in german i have with me a despatch for general brockdorffahlefeldt from general chill in pskov will you be so kind as to take me to him and will you camouflage this aircraft so the lizards cannot spot it the hitlerite soldiers drew back in surprise to hear her voice she was sitting in the cockpit and her leather flying helmet and thick winter gear had effectively disguised her sex the german whod spoken before leered now and said weve heard of pilots who call themselves stalins hawks are you one of stalins sparrows now he useddu rather thansie ludmila wasnt sure whether he intended the familiar intimacy or insult either way she didnt care for it perhaps she answered in a voice colder than the weather but only if youre one of hitlers jackasses she waited to see whether that would amuse or anger the german she was in luck not only did he laugh he threw back his head and brayed like a donkey you have to be a jackass to end up in a godforsaken place like this he said all rightkameradno kameradin senior lieutenant ill take you to headquarters why dont you just come along with me several germans ended up escorting her maybe as guards maybe because they didnt want to leave her alone with the first one maybe for the novelty of walking along with a woman while on duty she did her best to ignore them riga interested her more even after being battered by years of war it didnt look like a godforsaken place to her the main streetbrivibas street it was called her eyes and brain needed a little while to adjust to the latin alphabethad more shops and smarterlooking ones than shed seen in kiev the clothes civilians wore on the street were shabby and none too clean but of better fabric and finer cut than would have been usual in russia or the ukrainian soviet socialist republic some of the people recognized her gear in spite of her german escort they yelled at her in accented russian and in latvian she knew the russian was insulting and the latvian sounded less than complimentary to rub in the point one of the germans said they love you here in riga there are plenty of places where they love germans even more she said which made the nazi shut up with a snap had it been a chess game she would have won the exchange therathaus where the german commandant had his headquarters was near the corner of brivibas and kaleiyu streets to ludmila the germanstyle building looked old as time like thekrom in pskov it had no sentries on the outside to give away its location to the lizards once inside the ornately carved doors though ludmila found herself inspected by two new and hostile germans in cleaner fresher uniforms than she was used to seeing what do you have here one of them asked her escort russian flier she says she has a despatch from pskov for the commanding general the talky soldier answered i figured wed bring her here and let you headquarters types sort things out she the sentry looked ludmila over in a different way by god it is a woman isnt it under all that junk shes wearing i couldnt tell he plainly assumed she spoke only russian she did her best to look down her nose at him which wasnt easy since he was probably thirty centimeters the taller in her best german she said it will never matter to you one way or the other i promise you that the sentry stared at her her escorts whod been chatting with her enough to see her more or less as a human beingand who like any real fighting men had no great use for headquarters troopssuppressed their snickers not quite well enough that made the sentry look even less happy in a voice full of winter he said come with me i will take you to the commandants adjutant the adjutant was a beefy redfaced fellow with a captains two pips on his shoulder straps he said give me this despatch young ladygeneralleutnant graf walter von brockdorffahlefeldt is a busy man i shall convey to him your message as soon as it is convenient maybe he thought the titles and doublebarreled name would impress her if so he forgot he was dealing with a socialist ludmila stuck out her chin and looked stubbornnein she said i was told by general chill to give the message to your commandant not to anyone else i am a soldier i follow orders redface turned redder one moment he said and got up from his desk he went through a door behind it when he came out again he might have been chewing on a lemon the commandant will see you good ludmila headed for that door herself had the adjutant not hastily got out of her way she would have walked right over him shed expected an overbred aristocrat with pinched features a haughty expression and a monocle walter von brockdorffahlefeldt had pinched features all right but plainly for no other reason than that he was a sick man his skin looked like yellow parchment drawn tight over bones when he was younger and healthier hed probably been handsome now he was just someone carrying on as best he could despite illness he did get up and bow to her which took her by surprise his cadaverous smile said hed noticed too then he surprised her again saying in russian welcome to riga senior lieutenant sowhat news do you bring me from lieutenant general chill sir i dont know ludmila took out the envelope and handed it to him here is the message brockdorffahlefeldt started to open it then paused and got up from his chair again he hurriedly left the office by a side door when he came back his face was even paler than it had been i beg your pardon he said finishing the job of opening the envelope i seem to have come down with a touch of dysentery he had a lot more than a touch by the look of him hed fall over dead one fine day before too long intellectually ludmila had known the nazis clung to their posts with as much courage and dedicationor fanaticism oneas anyone else seeing that truth demonstrated though sometimes left her wondering how decent men could follow such a system that made her think of heinrich jager and a moment later start to blush general brockdorffahlefeldt was studying general chills note to her relief he didnt notice her turning pink he grunted a couple of times softly unhappily at last he looked up from the paper and said i am very sorry senior lieutenant but i cannot do as the german commandant of pskov requests she hadnt imagined a german could put that so delicately even if he was a hitlerite he waskulturny what does general chill request sir she asked then added a hasty amendment if its not too secret for me to know by no means he answeredhe spoke russian like an aristocrat he wanted me to help resupply him with munitions he paused and coughed so he would not have to depend on soviet equipment you mean ludmila said just so brockdorffahlefeldt agreed you saw the smoke in the harbor though he courteously waited for her nod before continuing that is still coming from the freighters the lizards caught there the freighters that were full of arms and ammunition of all sorts we shall be short here because of that and have none to spare for our neighbors im sorry to hear that ludmila said and found she was not altogether lying for the sake of politeness she didnt want the germans in pskov strengthened in respect to soviet forces there but she didnt want them weakened in respect to the lizards either finding a balance that would let her be happy on both those counts would not be easy she went on do you have a written reply for me to take back to lieutenant general chill i shall draft one for you brockdorffahlefeldt said but firstbeck he raised his voice the adjutant came bounding into the room fetch the senior lieutenant here something from the mess brockdorffahlefeldt told him she has come a long way on a sleeveless errand and she could no doubt do with something hot jawohl herr generalleutnantbeck said he turned to ludmila if you would be so kind as to wait one moment please senior lieutenant gorbunova he dipped his head almost as if he were a maitre d in some fancy decadent capitalist restaurant then hurried away if his commander accepted ludmila he accepted her too when captain beck came back he carried on a tray a large steaming bowlmaizes zupe ar putukrejumu a latvian dish he said its corn soup with whipped cream thank you ludmila said and dug in the soup was hot and thick and filling and didnt taste that alien russianstyle cooking used a lot of cream too though sour as often as sweet while ludmila ate beck went out to his own office then came back a couple of minutes later to lay a sheet of paper on general brockdorffahlefeldts desk the german commander at riga studied the message and glanced over at ludmila but kept silent until with a sigh she set down the bowl then he said i have a favor to ask of you if you dont mind that depends on what sort of favor it is she answered cautiously grafwalter von brockdorffahlefeldts smile made him look like a skeleton that had just heard a good joke i assure you senior lieutenant i have no improper designs upon your undoubtedly fair body this is a purely military matter one where you can help us i didnt think you had designs on me sir ludmila said no the german general smiled again how disappointing while ludmila was trying to figure out how to take that brockdorffahlefeldt went on we are in contact with a number of partisan bands in poland he paused for a moment to let that sink in i suppose i should note this is partisan warfare against the lizards not against thereich the bands have in them germans poles jewseven a few russians i have heard this particular one down near hrubieszow has informed us they could particularly use some antipanzer mines you could fly those mines to them faster than we could get them there any other way what say you i dont know ludmila answered i am not under your command have you no aircraft of your own aircraft yes a few but none like that flying sewing machine in which you arrived brockdorffahlefeldt said ludmila had heard that german nickname for the u before it never failed to fill her with wry pride the general went on my last fieselerstorch liaison plane could have done the job but it was hit a couple of weeks ago you know what the lizards do to larger more conspicuous machines hrubieszow is about five hundred kilometers south and a little west of here can you do the job i might add that the panzers you help disable will probably benefit soviet forces as much as those of thewehrmacht since the germans had driven organized soviet forcesas opposed to partisansdeep into russia ludmila had her doubts about that still the situation had grown extremely fluid since the lizards arrived and a senior lieutenant in the red air force did not know all there was to know about deployments either ludmila said will you be able to get word to lieutenant general chill without my flying back to give it to him i think we can manage that brockdorffahlefeldt answered if its all that stands in the way of your flying this mission im sure we can manage it ludmila considered youll have to give me petrol to get there she said at last as a matter of fact the partisans will have to give me petrol to let me get back have they got any they should be able to lay their hands on some the german general said after all it hasnt been used much in poland since the lizards came and of course when you return here we will give you fuel for your return flight to pskov she hadnt even asked about that yet in spite of that forbidding name and those titlesgeneralleutnant graf walter von brockdorffahlefeldt was indeed a gentleman of the old school that helped ludmila make up her mind to nod in agreement to him later she would decide she should have picked better reasons for making up her mind richard peterson was a decent technician but as far as brigadier general leslie groves was concerned a hopeless stickinthemud he sat in the hard chair in groves office in the science building of the university of denver and said this containment scheme you have in mind sir its going to be hard to maintain it and increase plutonium production at the same time groves slammed a big meaty fist down on the desk he was a big meaty man with shortcropped gingery hair a thin mustache and the blunt features of a mastiff he had a mastiffs implacable aggressiveness too so what are you telling me peterson he rumbled ominously are you saying were going to start leaking radioactives into the river so the lizards can figure out where they are youd better not be saying that because you know whatll happen if you are of course i know petersons voice went high and shrill the lizards will blow us to kingdom come thats just exactly right groves said im damn lucky i wasnt in washington dc when they dropped their bomb there he snorted all they got rid of in washington was some congresscrittersodds are they helped the war effort but if they land one on denver we cant make any more nuclear bombs of our own and if we cant do that we lose the war i know that too peterson answered but the reprocessing plant can only do so much if you get more plutonium out of it you put more byproducts into the filtersand if they make it through the filters they go into the south platte we have to have more plutonium groves said flatly if that means putting in more filters or doing more scrubbing of the ones we have then take care of it thats what youre for you tell me you cant do it ill find somebody who can i promise you that youve got top priority for getting materials not just from denver but from all over the country use it or find another job behind his hornrimmed glasses peterson looked like a puppy whod got a kick in the ribs for no reason at all its not the materials general were desperately short of trained personnel we groves glowered at him i told you i dont want excuses i want results if you dont have enough trained men train more or else use untrained men and break all your procedures down into baby steps any idiot can understand if this happens when you do that then go on and do this next thing if something else happens do that instead and try the procedure again and ifthat orthat happens yell for your boss who really knows whats going on takes a while to draft procedures like that so youd better get cracking on it but peterson began groves ignored himostentatiously ignored him picking up the topmost sheet from his overflowing in basket the technician angrily got up and stomped out of the office groves had all he could do not to laugh hed seen furious stomps much better done he made a mental note to keep an extra close watch on the plutonium reprocessing plant over the next few weeks either peterson would get production up without releasing radioactive contamination into the river or somebody else would get a crack at the job the sheet groves had picked up was important in its own right though important even by the standards of the moment where everything in any way connected with atomic weapons had top priority he rubbed his chin this one was routed through the office of strategic services which was something he didnt see every day so the damn russians want our help do they he muttered he didnt think much of the russians either their politics or their engineering ability still theyd made the first humanbuilt atomic bomb even though they had used fissionables theyd stolen from the lizards that showed they had more on the ball than hed given them credit for now though they were having trouble turning out their own radioactives and they wanted somebody to get over there some kind of way and give them a hand if it hadnt been for the lizards groves would have reacted to that with all the enthusiasm of a man whod had a rattlesnake stuck in his skivvies but with the lizards in the picture you worried about them first and only later about the prospect of uncle joe with an atomic bomb or rather a whole bunch of atomic bombs groves leaned back in his swivel chair it squeaked he wished for a cigarettewhile youre at it why not wish for the moon instead of worrying about the moon he said i wish larssen were still with us hed be the perfect guy to ship off to moscow larssen though was dead hed never been the same after his wife took up with that army fellowyeager that was his name then even after larssen made it to hanford washington and back nobodyd wanted to disrupt work at the metallurgical laboratory by relocating that had been a hell of a trip too bad it was wasted when it came to coping with the travails of the open road larssen was topnotch what he couldnt handle were his own inner demons finally they must have got the better of him because hed shot a couple of men and headed east toward lizardheld territory if hed sung a song for the aliens as groves had feared he might nuclear fire would have blossomed above denver but the cavalry had hunted him down before he could go over to the enemy well who does that leave groves asked the office walls trouble was the memorandum hed got didnt tell him enough he didnt know where the reds were having trouble did they even have an atomic pile going was separating plutonium from an active pile their problem or were they trying to separate u from u the memo didnt say trying to figure out what to do was like trying to put together a jigsaw puzzle when you didnt have all the pieces and werent sure which ones were missing since they were russians he had to figure their problems were pretty basic his own problem was pretty basic too could he spare anybody and ship him halfway around the world in the middle of war with no guarantee hed get there in one piece and if he could who did he hate enough to want to send him to moscow or wherever the russians had their program he sighed yeah larssen would have been perfect he said nothing he could do about that though nothing anybody could do about it not till judgment day groves was not the sort to spend timeto waste time as he would have thought of iton something he couldnt do anything about he realized he couldnt decide this one off the top of his head hed have to talk things over with the physicists he looked at the letter from the oss again if somebody went over to lend the russians a hand the usa would get paid back with gadgets taken from a lizard base that had mutinied and surrendered to the soviet army have to make sure the reds dont cheat and give us stuff that doesnt work or that weve already got he told the walls the one thing you could rely on about the russians was that you couldnt rely on them then he stopped and read the letter again hed missed something there by letting his worries about the russians blind him to the other things that were going on a lizard base up and mutinied he said he hadnt heard of anything like that happening anywhere else the lizards made for solid disciplined troops no matter how much they looked like chameleons with delusions of grandeur he wondered what had driven them far enough over the edge to go against their own officers damn i wish yeager and those lizard pows were still here he muttered id pump em dry if they were inciting lizards to mutiny had nothing to do with his current assignment but when curiosity started itching at him he felt as if he had to scratch or die then reluctantly he decided it was just as well yeager hadnt been around when jens larssen got back from hanford larssen probably would have gone after him and barbara both with that rifle he carried that whole mess hadnt been anybodys fault but larssen hadnt been able to let go of it either one way or another groves was sure it had flipped him over the edge well no point in worrying about it now he said larssen was dead yeager and his wife were gone to hot springs arkansas along with the lizard pows groves suspected yeager was still doing useful things with the lizards hed had a real flair for thinking along with them groves didnt know exactly what that said about yeagers own mental processesnothing good odds werebut it was handy he dismissed yeager from his thoughts as he had larssen if the russians were willing to pay to get the knowledge they needed to build atomic bombs they needed it badly on the other hand lenin had said something about the capitalists selling the soviet union the rope the reds would use to hang them if they got nuclear secrets would they think about using them against the united states one fine day of course they willtheyre russians groves said for that matter had the shoe been on the other foot the usa wouldnt have hesitated to use knowledge in its own best interests no matter where that knowledge came from that was how you played the game the other question was did such worries really matter it was shortterm benefits versus longterm risks if the russians had to bail out of the war because they got beat without nuclear weapons then worrying about what would happen down the line was foolish youd fret about what a russia armed with atomic bombs could do to the united states after russia had done everything it could do to the lizards from all hed learnedyeager and the lizard prisoners came back to mindthe lizards excelled at longterm planning they looked down their snouts at people because people measured by the way they looked at things had no foresight from a merely human perspective though the lizards were so busy looking at the whole forest that they sometimes didnt notice the tree next door was in the process of toppling over and landing on their heads sooner or later well find out whether theyre right or we are or maybe that everybodys wrong he said that wasnt the sort of question with which he was good at dealing tell him you needed this built within that length of time for the other amount of money and hed either make it for you or tell you it couldnt be doneand why those were the kinds of questions engineers were supposed to handleyou want philosophy he thoughtyou should have gone to a philosopher and yet in the course of his engineering work for this project hed listened to a lot of what the physicists had to say learning how the bomb did what it did helped him figure out how to make it but when fermi and szilard and the rest of them got to chewing the fat the line between engineering and philosophy sometimes got very blurry hed always thought he had a good head for math but quantum mechanics made that poor head spin well he didnt have to worry about it not in any real sense of the word what he did have to worry about was picking some luckless physicist and shipping him off to russia of all the things hed ever done in his nations service he couldnt think of one that roused less enthusiasm in him and compared to the poor bastard whod actually have to go he was in great shape iii panagiotis mavrogordato pointed to the coastline off thenaxos port rail there it is he said in greekaccented german the holy land we dock in haifa in a couple of hours moishe russie nodded meaning no offense he added in german of his own with a guttural yiddish flavor to it but i wont be sorry to get off your fine freighter here mavrogordato laughed and tugged his flatcrowned black wool sailors cap down lower on his forehead moishe wore a similar cap a gift from one of the sailors aboard thenaxos hed thought the mediterranean would be warm and sunny all the time even in winter it was sunny but the breeze that blew around himblew through himwas anything but warm theres no safe place in a war mavrogordato said if we got through this i expect we can get through damn near anythingtheou thelontos he took out a string of amber worry beads and worked on them to make sure god would be willing i cant argue with you about that russie said the rusty old ship had been sailing into rome when what had been miscalled the eternal cityand was the lizards chief center in italyexploded in atomic fire the germans were still bragging about that over the shortwave even though the lizards had vaporized hamburg shortly afterwards in retaliation make sure you and your family are ready to disembark the minute we tie up at the docks mavrogordato warned the lot of you are the only cargo were delivering here this trip and as soon as the englishmen pay us off for getting you here in one piece were heading back to tarsus as fast as thenaxos will take us he stamped on the planking of the deck thenaxos had seen better decades not that thats what youd call fast we didnt bring enough to have to worry about having it out of order moishe answered as long as i make sure reuven isnt down in the engine room well be ready as soon as you like thats a good boy you have there the greek captain answered mavrogordatos definition of a good boy seemed to be one who got into every bit of mischief imaginable moishes standards were rather more sedate but considering everything reuven had been througheverything the whole family had been throughhe couldnt complain nearly so much as he would have back in warsaw he went back to the cabin he shared with reuven and his wife rivka to make sure hed not been telling fables to mavrogordato sure enough their meager belongings were neatly bundled and rivka was making sure reuven stayed in one place by reading to him from a book of polish fairy tales that had somehow made the trip first from warsaw to london and then from london almost to the holy land if you read to reuven or if he latched onto a book for himself hed hold still otherwise he seemed a perpetual motion machine incarnated in the shape of a small boyand moishe could think of no more fitting shape for a perpetualmotion machine to have rivka put up the book and looked a question at him we land in a couple of hours he said she nodded she was the glue that held their family together and hewell he was smart enough to know it i dont want to get off thenaxos reuven said i like it here i want to be a sailor when i grow up dont be foolish rivka told him this is palestine were going to the holy land do you understand that there havent been many jews here for hundreds and hundreds of years and now were going back we may even go to jerusalem next year in jerusalem people say during the high holy days that will really come true for us now do you see reuven nodded his eyes big and round despite their travels and travails they were bringing him up to understand what being a jew meant and jerusalem was a name to conjure with it was a name to conjure with for moishe too hed never imagined ending up in palestine even if he was being brought here to help the british rather than for any religious reason rivka went back to reading moishe walked up to the bow of thenaxos and watched haifa draw near the town rose up from the sea along the slopes of mount carmel even in winter even in cold the mediterranean sun shed a clearer brighter light than he was used to seeing in warsaw or london many of the houses and other buildings he saw were whitewashed in that penetrating sunlight they sparkled as if washed with silver mixed among the buildings were groves of low spreading trees with graygreen leaves hed never seen their like when captain mavrogordato came up for a moment he asked him what they were the greek stared in amazement you dont know olives he exclaimed no olive trees in poland moishe said apologetically not in england either the harbor drew near a lot of the men on the piers wore long robessome white others bright with stripesand headclothsarabs moishe realized after a moment the reality of being far far away from everything hed grown up with hit him like a club other men wore work clothes of the kind with which he was more familiar baggy pants longsleeved shirts a few in overalls cloth caps or battered fedoras taking the place of the arabs kerchiefs and off by themselves stood a knot of men in the khaki with which moishe had grown so familiar in england british military men mavrogordato must have seen them too for he steered thenaxos toward the pier where they stood the black plume of coal smoke that poured from the old freighters stacks shrank then stopped as the ship nestled smoothly against the dockside sailors and dockworkers made thenaxos fast with lines others dropped the gangplank into place with that thump moishe knew he could walk down to the land of israel the land from which his forefathers had been expelled almost two thousand years before the hair at the back of his neck prickled up in awe rivka and reuven came out on deck moishes wife was carrying one duffel bag a sailor had another slung over his shoulder moishe took it from the man sayingevkharisto poly thanks very much it was almost the only greek hed picked up on the long nervous voyage across the mediterranean but a useful phrase to have parakalothe sailor answered with a smile youre welcome the uniformed englishmen walked toward thenaxos may imay wego to them moishe asked mavrogordato go ahead the captain said im coming too to make sure i get paid moishes feet thudded on the gangplank rivka and reuven followed closely with mavrogordato right behind them moishe took one last step then he was off the ship and onto the soilwell the docksof the holy land he wanted to kneel down and kiss the dirty creosotestained wood before he could one of the englishmen said you would be mr russie im colonel easter your liaison here well get you in contact with your coreligionists as soon as may be things have been rather dicey lately so your assistance will be most welcome having everyone pulling in the same direction will help the war effort dont you know i will do what i can moishe answered in his slow accented english he studied easter without much liking the man plainly saw him as a tool nothing more that was how the lizards had seen him too he liked the british cause better than he had that of the aliens but he was sick of being anyones tool off to one side a british officer handed panagiotis mavrogordato several neat rolls of gold sovereigns the greek beamed from ear to ear he didnt think of moishe as a tool he thought of him as a meal ticket and made no bones about it that struck moishe as a more honest approach than the one easter showed the englishman said if youll come with me mr russie you and your family we have a buggy waiting down past the end of the dock sorry we cant lay on a motorcar for you but petrol is in rather short supply these days petrol was in short supply all over the world colonel easter hardly needed to be polite in mentioning its absence he ignored politeness at a much more basic level neither he nor any of his men made any move to take the duffel bags from moishe and rivka you worried about whether guests were comfortable toolswho cared about tools the buggy was a blackpainted english brougham and might have been preserved in cotton wool and tinfoil for the past two generations well take you to the barracks easter said getting aboard with the russies and an enlisted man who picked up the reins the rest of the officers climbed into another almost identical carriage easter went on well get you something to eat and drink there and then see what sort of quarters we can arrange for the lot of you if theyd cared about anything more than using him they would have had quarters ready and waiting at least they did remember that he and his family needed food and water he wondered if theyd remember not to offer him ham too the driver flicked the reins and clucked to the horses the wagon rattled away from the harbor district whatever the british had in mind for him hed soon find out about it he stared wideeyed at the palm trees like huge feather dusters at the whitewashed buildings of mud brick at the mosque the buggy rolled past arab men in the long robes hed already seen and arab women covered so that only their eyes hands and feet showed watched the wagons as they clattered through the narrow winding streets moishe felt very much an interloper though his own folk had sprung from this place if colonel easter had the slightest clue that god had not anointed him to rule this land he gave no sign of it suddenly the buildings opened out onto a marketplace all at once moishe stopped feeling like an alien and decided he was at home after all none of the details was like what hed known back in warsaw not the dress of the merchants and the customers not the language they used not the fruits and vegetables and trinkets they bought and sold but the tone the way they haggledhe might have been back in poland rivka was smiling too the resemblance must also have struck her and not all the men and women in the marketplace were arabs moishe saw when he got a closer look some were jews dressed for the most part in work clothes or in dresses that while long displayed a great deal of flesh when compared to the clothes in which the arab women shrouded themselves a couple of jewish men carrying brass candlesticks walked by close to the wagon they were talking loudly and animatedly rivkas smile disappeared i dont understand them she said thats hebrew theyre speaking not yiddish moishe answered and shivered a little hed caught only a few words himself learning hebrew so you could use it in prayer and actually speaking it were two different things hed have a lot to pick up here he wondered how fast he could do it they passed the market by houses and shops closed in around them again at bigger streetcorners british soldiers directed traffic or tried to the arabs and jews of haifa werent as inclined to obey their commands as the orderly folk of london might have been a couple of blocks past one thoroughfare the road all but doubled back on itself a short young fellow in a shortsleeved shirt and khaki trousers stepped out in front of the wagon that held the russies he pointed a pistol at the drivers face you will stop now he said in accented english colonel easter started to reach for his sidearm the young man glanced up to the rooftops on either side of the road close to a dozen men armed with rifles and submachine guns most of them wearing kerchiefs to hide their faces covered both wagons heading back to the british barracks very slowly and carefully easter moved his right hand away from his weapon the cocky young fellow in the street smiled as if this were a social occasion rather thanwhatever it was ah thats good thats very good he said you are a sensible man colonel what is the point of thisthis damned impudence easter demanded in tones that said he would have fought had he seen the remotest chance for success we are relieving you of your guests the hijacker answered he looked away from the englishman and toward moishe dropping into yiddish to say you and your family you will get out of the buggy and come with me why moishe said in the same language if you are who i think you are i would have been talking with you anyhow yes and telling us what the british want us to hear the fellow with the pistol said now get outi havent got all day to argue with you moishe climbed down from the buggy he helped his wife and son down too gesturing with the pistol the hijacker on the street led him through a nearby gate and into a courtyard where a couple of other men with guns waited one of them set down his rifle and efficiently blindfolded the russies as he tied a cloth over moishes eyes he spoke in hebrewa short sentence that after a moment made sense to moishe it was in fact much the same sort of thing he might have said had he been blindfolder rather than blindfoldee nice job menachem thanks but no chatter the man whod been on the street said in yiddish he was menachem then he shoved russie lightly in the back someone else grabbed his elbow get moving having no choice russie got big uglies pushed munitions carts toward teerts killercraft most of them were of the dark brown variety of tosevite not the pinkishtan type the dark brown ones on this part of the lesser continental mass were more inclined to cooperate with the race than the lighter ones from what the flight leader had gathered the lighter ones had treated them so badly rule by the race looked good in comparison his mouth fell open in amusement as far as he was concerned a big ugly was a big ugly and no more needed to be said the tosevites themselves though evidently saw things differently these tosevites had stripped off the tunics that covered the upper parts of their bodies the metabolic water they used for bodily cooling glistened on their hides as far as they were concerned it was hot to teerts the temperature was comfortable though he found the air far too moist to suit him still the humidity in this florida place was the only thing about its weather he didnt care for hed spent winters in manchuria and nippon next to them florida seemed wonderful a couple of armorers began loading the munitions onto teerts klllercraft he looked at the load only two airtoair missiles he said unhappily the senior armorer said be thankful youve got two superior sir he was a solid fellow named ummfac though he was nominally subordinate to the killercraft pilots wise ones treated him and his ilk as equalsand often got better loads because of it now he went on pretty soon itll be nothing but cannon fire we and the big uglies hammering away at each other from short range theres a nasty thought teerts said he sighed youre probably right though thats the way the war seems to be going these days he patted the skin of the killercrafts fuselage the emperor be praised that we still fly superior aircraft truth ummfac said theres the question of spares even with them teerts climbed up into the cockpit and snuggled down in the armored padded seat as if he were a hatchling curling up inside the eggshell from which hed just emerged he didnt want to think about problems with spares already the big uglies were flying aircraft far more dangerous to his machine than they had been when the race first came to tosev he laughed again bitterly the big uglies werent supposed to have been flying any aircraft they were supposed to have been pretechnological barbarians as far as he was concerned barbarians they were no one whod ever been in nipponese captivity could possibly argue with that pretechnological however had turned out to be another matter he went through his preflight checklist everything was as it should have been he stuck a finger into the space between a loose piece of padding and the inner wall of the cockpit no one had found his vial of ginger that was good the nipponese had addicted him to the herb while he lay in their hands after hed escaped from captivity hed discovered how many of his fellow males tasted it of their own accord he called the local flight controller got permission to take off the twin turbofans in the killercraft roared to life the vibration and noise went all through him a good and familiar feeling he taxied down the runway then climbed steeply acceleration shoving him back hard into his seat his horizon expanded marvelously as it did whenever he went airborne he enjoyed that expansion less than he had from other bases though for it soon brought into view the ruins of miami teerts had been flying down to florida when that area went up in an appalling cloud had he been a little ahead of himself the fireball might have caught him or the blast might have wrecked his killercraft or flipped it into a spin from which it never would have recovered even thinking about that squeezed an alarmed hiss from him of itself his hand started to reach for the little plastic vial of powdered ginger when he was reassigned to the lesser continental mass hed wondered if he would still be able to get the powdered herb he craved but a good many males on the florida base used it and the darkskinned big uglies who labored for the race seemed to have an unending supply they hadnt yet asked him for anything more than trinkets little electronic gadgets he could easily afford to give up in exchange for the delights ginger brought him buti will not taste now he said and made his hand retreat however good ginger made him feel he knew it clouded his judgment engaging the big uglies wasnt so easy or so safe as it had once been if you went at them confident youd have things all your own way no matter what you were liable to end up with your name on the memorial tablet that celebrated the males who had perished to bring tosev into the empire rabotev and halless had such tablets at their capitals hed seen holograms of them before setting out from home the one on halless had only a few names the one on rabotev only a few hundred teerts was sure the race would set up memorial tablets for tosev if theyd done it on the other worlds theyd conquered theyd do it here if you didnt maintain your traditions what point to having a civilization but the memorial tablets here would be different from those of the other two habitable worlds the race had conquered we can set up the tablets then build the capital inside them teerts said in spite of himself his mouth fell open the image was macabre but it was also funny the memorial tablets to commemorate the heroes who fell in the conquest of tosev would have alot of names on them teerts flew his prescribed sweep north and west over the lesser continental mass a lot of the territory over which he passed was still in the hands of the local big uglies every so often antiaircraft fire would splotch the air below and behind him with black puffs of smoke he didnt worry about that he was flying too high for the tosevites cannon to reach him he did keep a wary eye turret turned toward the radar presentation in his headup display intelligence said the americans lagged behind the british and the deutsche when it came to jet aircraft and they mostly used their pistonandairfoil machines for ground attack and harassment duties but you never could tell and intelligence wasnt always as omniscient as its practitioners thought that was another painful lesson the race had learned on tosev here and there snow dappled the higher ground as far as teerts was concerned that was as good a reason as any to let the big uglies keep this part of their world but if you let them keep all the parts where snow fell youd end up with a depressingly small part of the world to call your own he drew nearer the large river that ran from north to south through the heart of the northern half of the lesser continental mass the race controlled most of the territory along the river if his aircraft got into trouble he had places where he could take refuge the large river marked the westernmost limit of his planned patrol he was about to swing back toward florida which no matter how humid it was did at least enjoy a temperate climate when his forwardlooking radar picked up something new and hideous whatever it was it took off from the ground and rapidly developed more velocity than his killercraft had for a moment he wondered if something inside his radar had gone wrong if it had would the base have the components it needed to fix the problem then his paradigm shifted that wasnt an aircraft like the rocketpowered killercraft the deutsche had started using it was an outandout rocket a missile the deutsche had those too but he hadnt known the americans did from his briefings he didnt think intelligence knew it either he flicked on his radio transmitter flight leader teerts calling florida base intelligence he said satellite relay connected him almost as quickly as if hed been in the next room intelligence florida base aaatos speaking your report flight leader teerts teerts gave the particulars of what his radar had picked up then said if you like i have fuel enough to reach the launch site attack any launcher or tosevite installation visible and still return to base you are a male of initiative aaatos said among the race the phrase was not necessarily a compliment though teerts chose to take it as one aaatos resumed please wait while i consult my superiors teerts waited though every moment increased the likelihood that he would have to refuel in the air but aaatos was not gone long flight leader teerts your attack against the tosevite installation is authorized punish the big uglies for their arrogance it shall be done teerts said the computers aboard the killercraft held the memory of where radar had first picked up the missile they linked to the satellite mappers the race had orbiting tosev and guided teerts toward the launch site he knew the race was desperately low on antimissile missiles theyd expended a lot of them against the rockets the deutsche hurled at poland and france teerts had no idea how manyif anywere left but he didnt need to wear the fleetlords body paint to figure out that if the race had to start using them here in the united states whatever remaining reserves there were would vanish all the sooner he skimmed low over the woods west of the great river and over a clearing where if his instruments didnt lie the american missile had begun its flight and sure enough he spotted a burned place in the dead grass of the clearing but that was all he saw whatever launcher or guide rails the big uglies had used theyd already got them under cover of the trees had he had an unlimited supply of munitions teerts would have shot up the area around the clearing on the off chance of hitting worthwhile as things were he radioed the situation back to the florida air base aaatos said return here for full debriefing flight leader teerts we shall have other opportunities to make the big uglies look back in sorrow upon the course they have chosen returning to base teerts acknowledged if the american tosevites were starting to use missiles the race would have plenty of chances to attack their launchers in the future anyhow whether that was just what aaatos had meant teerts didnt know holding his white flag of truce high george bagnall moved out into the clearing in the pine woods south of pskov hisvalenki made little scrunching noises as he walked through the packed snow the big floppy boots put him in mind of wellingtons made of felt however ugly they were though they did a marvelous job of keeping his feet warm for the rest of him he wore his raf furandleather flying suit anything that kept him from freezing above angels twenty was just about up to the rigors of a russian winter on the far side of the clearing a lizard came into sight the alien creature also carried a swatch of white cloth tied to a stick it too wore a pair ofvalenki no doubt plundered from a dead russian soldier in spite of them in spite of layers of clothes topped by awehrmacht greatcoat that fit it like a tent it looked miserably cold gavoritye livui po russkiit said with a hissing accent oder sprechen sie deutsch ich spreche deutsch besserbagnall answered and then to see if he was lucky added do you speak english ich verstehe nichtthe lizard said and went on in german my name is nikeaa i am authorized to speak for the race in these matters bagnall gave his name i am a flight engineer of the british royal air force i am authorized to speak for the german and soviet soldiers defending pskov and its neighborhood i thought the britainish were far from here nikeaa said but it could be i do not know as much of tosevite geography as i thought whattosevite meant came through from context britain is not close to pskov bagnall agreed but most human countries have allied against your kind and so i am hereand i bloody well wish i werent his lancaster bomber had flown in a radar set and a radarman to explain its workings to the russians and then been destroyed on the ground before he could get back to england he and his comrades had been here a year now even if they had established a place for themselves as mediators between the reds and the naziswho still hated each other as much as either group hated the lizardsit was a place he would just as soon not have had nikeaa said very well you are authorized you may speak your commanders asked this truce of us we have agreed to it for now to learn what the reason is for the asking you will tell me thissofort immediately he madesofort come out as a long menacing hiss we have prisoners captured over a long time fighting here bagnall answered some of them are wounded we have done what we can for them but your doctors will know better what to do with them and how to treat them truth nikeaa said he moved his head up and down in a nod for a moment bagnall took that for granted then he realized the lizard had probably had to learn the gesture along with the german and russian languages his respect for nikeaas accomplishments went up a peg what hed told the lizard was indeed true from everything hed heard the troops around pskov treated lizard prisoners far better than the germans had treated their russian captives or vice versa being hard to come by lizard prisoners were valuable the nazis and reds had had plenty of chances to take each others measure in return for giving these wounded males back to the race you want what nikeaa asked and made a queer coughing noise that sounded like something left over from his own language we also have captives germans and russians we have no britainish here this i tell you we do not harm these captured ones after we have them we give them for yours we give ten for one if you like not enough bagnall said then we give twenty for one nikeaa said bagnall had heard from others whod dealt with the lizards that they were not good bargainers now he saw what theyd meant human negotiators would not have backpedaled so readily still not enough he said along with the soldiers we want a hundred of your books or films and two of your machines that play the films along with working batteries for them nikeaa drew back in alarm you want us to give you our secrets he made that coughing noise again it cannot be no no you misunderstand bagnall said hastily we know you will not give us any military manuals or things of that sort we want your novels your stories whatever science you have that will not let us build weapons with what we learn from it give us these things and we will be content if you cannot use them immediately why do you want them reading tone into a lizards voice probably told you more about yourself than about the lizard but bagnall thought nikeaa sounded suspicious the alien went on this is not how tosevites usually behave yes he was suspicious we want to learn more about your kind bagnall answered eventually this war will end and your people and mine will live side by side yes you will be our subjects nikeaa said flatly but bagnall shook his head not necessarily if your conquest were as easy as youd thought it was going to be it would have been finished by now youll need to be dealing with us more nearly as equals at least until the end of the war and maybe afterwards as well and we with youthe same does apply i gather youve been studying us for a long time were just beginning to learn about youand most of what we have learned i dont fancy i have not the authority to decide this on my own nikeaa said it is not a demand we were prepared for and so i must consult with my superiors before replying if you must then you must bagnall said hed already notedand he was sure he was far from the only one who hadthat the lizards were not good at deciding things on the spur of the moment hed tried to put disappointment in his own voice when he replied though he doubted whether nikeaa recognized it even inserting it wasnt easy if the lizards did come up with the books and films and readers they wouldnt stay in pskov half of them would go to moscow the other half to no not to berlin which was ruined but to some town in germany the nkvd no doubt would pore over one set and thegestapo over the other no matter how much he wanted mankind to defeat the lizards bagnall had a devil of a time finding much enthusiasm for the notion of the bolsheviks and nazis getting a leg up on england and the united states in understanding the alien invaders hed seen hitler and stalins men in action and had more often been horrflied than impressed nikeaa said i will report this condition of yours and will make my reply when my superiors determine what the correct response should be shall we meet again in fifteen days i hope to have their decision by that time i had not expected so long a delay bagnall said decisions should not be made hastily especially those of such importance nikeaa said was that reproach he was trying to convey bagnall had trouble being sure the lizard added we are not tosevites after all to rush into everything yes reproach or perhaps just scorn fifteen days then bagnall said and made for the woods where his escorta mixed party or rather two separate parties one german the other russianawaited his return he glanced back over his shoulder nikeaa was hurrying away toward his own folk bagnalls sigh sent a plume of fog out ahead of him but for ken embry the pilot and jerome jones the radarman his folk were far from pskov captain martin borcke was holding bagnalls horse thewehrmacht man spoke fluent english bagnall thought he was in intelligence but wasnt certain in english he asked have we got the exchange agreement bagnall wished borcke hadnt used english as if expecting a reply in the same tongueone the russians did not know keeping the two alleged allies from each others throats was anything but easy the raf man answered in german which many of the red army men could follow no we have no agreement yet the lizards need to talk to their superiors before they decide whether they can give us the books we want the russians accepted that as a matter of course to their way of thinking moving an inch past the orders you had was dangerous if anything went wrong the blame landed squarely on you borcke snorted in contempt thewehrmacht let people do more thinking for themselves well it cant be helped he said and then turned that into russiannichevo nichevo dabagnall said and swung up onto the horse riding it wasnt as pleasant as being in a heated motorcar but it did keep his legs and thighs warm that was something he hadnt been on horseback above half a dozen times before he came to pskov now he sometimes felt ready to ride in the derby intellectually he knew that wasnt so but the strides he had made in equitation encouraged him in the fancy after a cold night encampment he got back into pskov the next afternoon he went over to thekrom the medieval stone castle to report the delay to lieutenant general kurt chill and to brigadiers nikolai vasiliev and aleksandr german the german and russian officers commanding in the city with them as hed expected he found ken embry the raf men being relatively disinterested served as lubricant betweenwehrmacht and red army personnel after bagnall made his report he and embry headed back to the wooden house they shared with jerome jones when they drew near they heard a dish shatter with a crash and then angry voices two mens and a womans shouting loudly oh bugger thats tatiana ken embry exclaimed youre right bagnall said they both started to run panting bagnall added why the devil couldnt she leave jones alone after she took up with that jerry because that would have been convenient embry answered ever since hed been pilot and bagnall flight engineer aboard their lancaster theyd had a contest to see who could come up with the most casually cynical understatements for the moment embry had taken the lead bagnall though was a better runner and got to the door a couple of strides ahead of his comrade he would willingly have forgone the honor all the same he threw the door open and rushed inside embry right behind him georg schultz and jerome jones stood almost nosetonose screaming at each other off to one side tatiana pirogova had a plate in her hand ready to fling by the shards shed thrown the last one at jones that didnt mean this one wouldnt fly at schultzs head at that bagnall was glad tatiana was still flinging crockery instead of reaching for the scopesighted mosinnagant snipers rifle she wore slung on her back she was a striking woman blond blueeyed shapelyaltogether lovely if face and body were all you cared about shed made advances to bagnall not so long ago that shed been jones lover at the time hadnt been the only reason hed declined it would have been like bedding a sheleopardprobably fun while it lasted but you could never afford to turn your back afterward shut up all of you he shouted now first in english then in german and finally in russian the three squabblers didnt shut up of course they started yelling at him instead he thought the fair tatiana was going to let fly with that plate but she didnt not quitegood sign he thought having them scream at him was another good sign since he wasntthank god sleeping with any of them they might be slower to get lethally angry at him behind him ken embry said what the devil is going on here he used the same mixture of russian and german he did with lieutenant general chill and the russian partisan brigadiers their squabbles sometimes came near to blows too this bastards still fucking my woman georg schultz shouted pointing at jerome jones i am not your woman i give my body to whom i please tatiana answered just as hotly i dont want your body jerome jones yelled in pretty fluent russian hed studied the language in his undergraduate days at cambridge he was a thin cleverlooking fellow in his early twenties about as tall as schultz but not nearly so solidly made he went on christ and the saints how many times do i have to tell you that his picturesque oath meant nothing to tatiana or even less she spat on the floorboards that for christ and the saints i am a soviet woman free of such superstitious twaddle and if i want you again little man i will have you what about me schultz said like the others conducting the argument at the top of his lungs this will be even more delightful to mediate than the generals brawls bagnall murmured in an aside to ken embry embry nodded then grinned impudently its rather more entertaining to listen to though isnt it have been sleeping with you tatiana was saying so you have no cause for complaint i do this even though last time you got on top of me you called me ludmila instead of my own name i what schultz said i never you did tatiana said with a certainty that could not be deniedand an obvious malicious pleasure in that certainty you can still think about that soft little red air force pilot you pined for like a puppy with its tongue hanging out but if i think of anyone else its like you think your poor mistreated cock will fall off if you think i mistreat your cock when its in there it can stay out she turned to jones swinging her hips a little and running her tongue over her lips to make them fuller and redder bagnall could see exactly what she was doing but that didnt mean he was immune to it neither was the british radarman he took half a step toward tatiana then stopped with a very visible effort no dammit he yelled this is how i got into trouble in the first place he paused and looked thoughtful so well that bagnall wondered if the expression was altogether spontaneous and when jones spoke again he made a deliberate effort to turn the subject havent seen ludmila about for the past few days shes overdue from her last flight isnt she jaschultz said his head bobbed up and down she flew last to riga and should have been back soon no not necessarily bagnall said general chill got a message answering whatever query hed sent with her and saying also that the soldier commanding in riga was taking advantage of her light airplane for some mission of his own now he had trouble keeping his face straight hed been interested in ludmila gorbunova too but she hadnt been interested back ah that is good that is very good schultz said i had not heard it tatiana started to smash the plate over his head he was fast he knocked it out of her hand so that it flew across the room hit the timbers of the wall and broke there tatiana cursed him in russian and in the bad german shed picked up when shed run through all her invective onceand the choicer bits twiceshe shouted since no one cares about me to the devils uncle with the lot of you she stormed out of the house slamming the door behind her loud enough probably to make the neighbors think an artillery round had hit it there georg schultz surprised bagnall by starting to laugh then schultz a farmerly type surprised him again by quoting goethedie ewige weibliche the eternal feminine the german shook his head i dont know why i get myself into such a state over her but i do must be love ken embry said innocently god forbid schultz looked around at the shattered crockery ah the hell with it his gaze fixed on jerome jones and the hell with you tooenglander from you thats a compliment jones said bagnall took a step over to the radarmans side if schultz wanted to try anything he wouldnt be going against jones alone but the german shook his head again rather like a bear be deviled by bees and left the house he didnt slam the door as hard as tatiana had but broken pieces of dishes jumped all the same bagnall took a deep breath the scene hadnt been as bad as combat but it hadnt been any fun either he clapped jerome jones on the back how the devil did you ever get tangled up with that avalanche who walks like a man the fair tatiana now jones shook his headruefully she doesnt walk like a man she walks like a womanthat was the problem and she doesnt want to give you up even though she has her dashing nazi too bagnall saiddashing wasnt the right word to describe georg schultz and he knew itcapable fit pretty welldangerous was in there too perhaps not as overtly as with tatiana pirogova but part of the mix nonetheless thats about it jones muttered tell her to go away often enough and shell eventually get the message old man bagnall said you dowant her to go away dont you most of the time of course i do jones answered but sometimes when imyou know he glanced down at the crockerystrewn floor and didnt go on bagnall did it for him when youre randy you mean jones nodded miserably bagnall looked at ken embry embry was looking at him they both groaned the coming of the lizards had brought ruin to hundreds of towns for every one it helped lamar colorado though was one of the latter the prairie town a noaccount county seat before the aliens invaded had become a center for the defense against them people and supplies had flowed into it rather than streaming away as was the usual case captain rance auerbach thought about that as he watched mutton chops sizzle on the grill of a local cafe the fire that made them sizzle was fueled by dried horse dung not much in the way of timber around lamar and coal was in short supply and natural gas unavailable there were however plenty of horses aroundauerbach himself wore a cavalry captains bars a waitress with a prizefighters beefy arms set down three mugs of home brew and a big bowl of boiled beetsbeets being one of the leading local crops she too glanced at the chops uhhuhshe said as much to herself as to auerbach timed that about rightthosell be ready in just a couple minutes auerbach slid one of the mugs of beer down the counter to rachel hines who sat on his left and the other to penny summers who sat on his right he raised his own mug confusion to the lizards he said hell with em penny agreed and gulped down half of what her mug held with her flat midwestern accent she could have been a native of lamar auerbachs texas drawl proclaimed him an outsider every time he opened his mouth neither penny nor rachel was from lamar though auerbach and his men had rescued both of them from lakin kansas when his company raided the base the lizards had set up there after a moments hesitation penny summers softly echoed confusion to the lizards and also sipped at her beer she did everything softly and slowly these days in the escape from lakin her father had been blown to sloppily butchered raw meat before her eyes shed never been quite the same since the waitress went around the counter stabbed the mutton chops with a longhandled fork and slapped them onto plates there ygo folks she said eat heartyynever know when youll get another chance aint that the truth rachel hines said she attacked the mutton with knife and fork her blue eyes glowed as she gulped down a big bite she hadnt been the same since she got out of lakin either but she hadnt withdrawn into herself the way penny had these days she wore the same khaki uniform auerbach did though with a pfcs single chew on rather than his captains badges she made a pretty fair trooper she could ride she could shoot she didnt mouth off too much and the rest of the company paid her what had to be the ultimate compliment for the most part they treated her like one of the boys she cut off another bite frowning a little as she transferred the fork to her left hand so she could use the knife hows your finger doing auerbach asked rachel looked down at her hand still missing she reported and spread the hand so he could see the wide gap between middle finger and pinkie now if id been shot by a lizard it would have been one thing she said having that crazy son of a bitch nail me though that just makes me mad but it could have been worse i expect so ive got no real kick coming few men auerbach knew could have talked about a wound so dispassionately if rachel was one of the guys she was a better one than most auerbach said that larssen fellow was supposed to be going over to the lizards with stuff they werent supposed to know hed shot two men dead too he had what he got when we caught up with him coming you ask me im just sorry we took casualties bringing him down wonder what it was he knew rachel hines said auerbach shrugged his troopers had been asking that question since the order to hunt down larssen came out of denver he didnt know the answer but he could make some pretty fair guesses ones he didnt share back a while before hed led the cavalry escort that got leslie groves into denver and groves had been carrying somethinghe wouldnt say whathe treated as just a little more important than the holy grail if it didnt have something to do with the atomic bombs that had knocked the lizards for a couple of loops auerbach would have been mightily surprised penny summers said i spent a lot of time praying everyone would come through the mission safe i do that every time people ride out of here its not the worst thing to do auerbach said but coming out and cooking or nursing or whatever you want wouldnt hurt either since shed come to lamar penny had spent a lot of time in a little furnished room in an overcrowded apartment house brooding and reading the bible getting her out for mutton chops was something of a triumph or so he thought till she shoved her plate away and said i dont like mutton it tastes funny and its all greasy we never had it much back in lakin you should eat auerbach told her knowing he sounded like a mother hen you need it that was true penny was railthin she hadnt been that way when she came to lamar but she hadnt been the same in a lot of ways since wendell summers got himself messily killed hey its food rachel hines said i dont even mind the beets not any more i just shovel it all down i quit worrying about it as soon as i put on the uniform she filled out that uniform in a way the army bureaucrats whod designed it hadnt had in mind despite her talk of gluttony she wasnt the least bit fat if she hadnt been so allaround goodnatured she would have had half the men in the company squabbling over her there were times when auerbach had been tempted to pull rank himself even if shed been interested though that would have created as many problems as it solved maybe more he glanced over to penny again he felt responsible for her too he also had the feeling more was there than met the eye with rachel what you saw was what you gothe couldnt imagine her holding anything back with penny he got the feeling her present unhappiness masked something altogether different he shrugged the other possibility was that his imagination had gone and run away with himwouldnt be the first time he thought to his surprise she did take back the plate and start eating again not with any great enthusiasm but doggedly as if she were fueling a car with what shed been giving herself lately a car would long since have run out of gas he didnt say anything that might have broken the spell rachel hines shook her head shed cropped her hair into a short bob the better to have it fit under a helmet she said going off and giving secrets to the lizards i purely cant fathom that and theres a fact but plenty of people in lakin got on with em just fine and dandy like they were the new county commissioners or something youre right penny summers face twisted into an expression both fierce and savage one altogether unlike any auerbach had seen on her since shed come to lamar joe bentley over at the general store he sucked up to them for all he was worth and when edna wheeler went in there and called them a bunch of goggleeyed things from out of a freak show you tell me he didnt go trotting off to them fast as his legs could take him and the very next day she and her husband and both their kids got thrown out of their house thats so rachel said nodding it sure is and mel sixkiller i guess he got sick of folks calling him halfbreed all the time on account of hed even make up tales to take to the lizards and theyd believe em too he got a lot of people in trouble like that yeah some people were mean to him but you dont go getting even by hurting em that kind of way and miss proctor the home economics teacher at the high school penny said what was it she always called the lizards the wave of the future that was it like we couldnt do anything about em no matter what and then shed go out and make sure we couldnt do anything yeah she sure did rachel said and they went on for another five or ten minutes talking about the collaborators back in their little hometown auerbach sat quietly drinking his beer finishing his supper he didnt mind mutton but he could have lived for a long time without looking another beet in the eye and listening hed never seen penny summers so lively and hed never seen her finally clean her plate eithershe didnt seem to notice she was doing it complaining about the old neighbors got her juices flowing as nothing else had the brawny waitress came by get you folks some more beer or are you gonna sit there takin up space ill have another one thanks auerbach said to his surprise penny nodded before rachel did the waitress went away came back with fresh mugs thanks irma auerbach told her she glowered at him as if doing her job well enough to deserve thanks showed shed somehow failed at it youve raided lakin since you got us out havent you captain rachel asked sure we have auerbach answered you werent along for that were you no you werenti remember we hurt em too drove em clean out of town i thought wed be able to keep it but when they threw too much armor at us he spread his hands what can you do thats not what she meant penny said i know what she meant auerbach stared at her she surely hadnt been this animated before what did she mean he asked hoping to keep her talkingand more than that hoping to keep her involved with the world beyond the four walls within which shed chosen to shut herself away it worked too pennys eyes blazed she meant did you settle up scores with the quislings she said rachel hines nodded to show her friend was right no i dont think we did auerbach said we didnt know just who needed settling back then and we were too busy with the lizards to risk putting anybodys nose out of joint by getting the locals mad at us for giving the wrong people a hard time were not going back to lakin any time soon are we rachel asked not that i know of anyhow auerbach said colonel nordenskold might have a different idea but he hasnt told me about it if he does and if he gets orders from somewhere up the line he spread his hands again above the regimental level the chain of command kept getting broken links local commanders had a lot more autonomy than anybody had figured they would before the lizards started plastering communications the colonel needs to get word to the partisans rachel said sooner or later those bastards ought to get whats coming to em she brought out the word as casually as any cavalry trooper might have auerbach didnt think of it as a woman swearing till he listened to the sentence over again inside his head even if she had curves rachel was a cavalryman all right thats what needs doing penny summers said with a vigorous nod oh yes indeed seems funny talking about american partisans rachel said i mean we saw the russians hiding in the woods in the newsreels before the lizards came but to have to do that kind of stuff ourselves funny to you maybe but youre from kansas auerbach answered you come from texas the way i do or from virginia like lieutenant magruder and youll know about bushwhacking cause odds are youre related to somebody who did some of it during the states war he touched his sleeve good thing this uniform isnt blue the way it used to be you come out of the south your part of the countrys been invaded before rachel shrugged for me the civil wars something out of a history book thats all not to southerners auerbach said mosby and forrest are real live people to us even nowadays i dont know who they are but ill take your word for it penny said thing of it is if we can do that we ought to can colonel nordenskold get in touch with the partisans oh yeah auerbach said and do you know how he waited for her to shake her head then set a finger by the side of his nose and grinned carrier pigeons thats how not even any radio for the lizards to intercept and they havent figured it out yet he knew he was talking too much but the chance to see penny summers act like a real live human being led him to say a little more than he should she bounced up off her stool now thats terrflic lets go talk with the colonel right this minute it was as if shed flicked a switch inside herself and everything shed turned off over the past months came back to life all at once it was quite a thing to seehell of a woman there auerbach thought and then a moment laterand shes a civilian too colonel morton nordenskold made his headquarters in what still said it was lamars first national bank back in the twenties some sort of spectacular robbery had happened there lamar natives talked about it even now there werent a lot of lamar natives left any more though soldiers and refugees dominated the town now no sentries stood outside the bank half the town away a couple of dummies from feldmans tailor shop dressed in army uniform from helmet to boots guarded a fancy house if the lizards came by with bombers the hope was that theyd hit there instead of the real hq so far they hadnt bothered either one inside where reconnaissance couldnt spot them two real live soldiers came to attention when auerbach walked through the door with rachel and penny yes sir you can see the colonel now one of them said thanks auerbach said and headed for nordenskolds office behind him one of the sentries turned to the other and said not quite quietly enough look at that lucky son of a bitch will you walkin out with two o the bestlookin broads in town auerbach thought about going back and calling him on it then decided he liked it and kept on toward the colonels office the tosevite hatchling made a squealing noise that grated in ttomalss hearing diaphragms it reached up for the handle of a low cabinet grabbed hold on about the third try and did its best to pull itself upright its best wasnt good enough it fell back down splat ttomalss watched curiously to see what it would do next sometimes after a setback like that it would wail which he found even more irritating than its squeals sometimes it thought a fall was funny and let out one of its annoyingly noisy laughs today rather to ttomalss surprise it did neither of those it just reached up and tried again as deliberate and purposeful an action as hed ever seen from it it promptly fell down again and banged its chin on the floor this time it did start to wail the cry it made to let the world know it was in pain when it did that it annoyed everyone up and down the corridor of the starship orbiting above tosev when the other males researching the big uglies got annoyed they grew more likely to side against ttomalss in his struggle to keep the hatchling and keep studying it rather than returning it to the female from whose body it had emerged be silent foolish thing he hissed at it the hatchling of course took no notice of him but continued to make the air hideous with its howls he knew what he had to do he stooped and being careful not to prick its thin scaleless skin with his claws held it against his torso after a little while the alarming noise eased the hatchling liked physical contact young of the race when newly out of the eggshell fled from anything larger than they were instinctively convinced it would catch and eat them for the first part of their lives big uglies were as immobile as some of the limestoneshelled creatures of homes small seas if they got into trouble the females whod ejected them and a hideous processthat was too had to save them and comfort them with no such female available here the job fell to ttomalss the hatchlings cheek rubbed against his chest that touched off its sucking reflex it turned its head and pressed its soft wet mouth against his hide unlike a tosevite female he did not secrete nutritive fluid little by little the hatchling was realizing that faster than it had a good thing too ttomalss muttered and tacked on an emphatic cough the little tosevites saliva did unpleasant things to his body paint he swung down an eye turret so he could look at himself sure enough hed have to touch up a spot before he was properly presentable he hadnt intended to demonstrate experimentally that body paint was not toxic to big uglies but hed done it he turned the other eye turret down studied the hatchling with both eyes it looked up at him its own eyes were small and flat and dark he wondered what went on behind them the hatching had never seen itself nor its own kind did it think it looked like him no way to know not until its verbal skills developed further but its perceptions would have changed by then too he watched the corners of its absurdly mobile mouth curl upwards among the tosevites that was an expression of amiability so he had succeeded in making it forget about its hurt then he noticed the cloth he kept around its middle was wet the tosevite had no control over its bodily function interrogations suggested big uglies did not learn such control for two or three of their yearsfour to six of those by which ttomalss reckoned as he carried the hatchling over to a table to clean it off and set a new protective cloth in place he found that a very depressing prospect youare a nuisance he said adding another emphatic cough the hatchling squealed then made a noise of its own that sounded like an emphatic cough it had been imitating the sounds ttomalss made more and more lately not just emphatic and interrogative coughs but sometimes real words sometimes he thought it was making those noises with deliberate intent tosevites could and did talk often to excessno doubt about that when the hatchling was clean and dry and content he set it back down on the floor he tossed the soaked cloth into an airtight plastic bin to prevent its ammoniacal reek from spreading then squirted cleansing foam on his hands he found the tosevites liquid wastes particularly disgusting the race excreted neat tidy solids the hatchling got up on all fours and crawled toward the cabinets again its quadrupedal gait was much more confident than it had been at the beginning for a couple of days the only way it had been able to get anywhere was backwards it tried pulling itself erectand promptly fell down once more the communicator chimed for attention ttomalss hurried over to it the screen lit showing him the image of ppevel assistant administrator for the eastern region of the main continental mass i greet you superior sir ttomalss said doing his best to hide nervousness i greet you research analyst ppevel replied i trust the tosevite hatchling whose fate is now under discussion with the chinese faction known as the peoples liberation army remains healthy yes superior sir ttomalss said he turned one eye turret away from the screen for a moment trying to spot the hatchling he couldnt that worried him the little creature was much more mobile than it had been which meant it was much more able to get into mischief too hed missed some of what ppevel was saying im sorry superior sir ppevel waggled his eye turrets ever so slightly a sign of irritation i said are you prepared to give up the hatchling on short notice superior sir of course i am but i do protest that this abandonment is not only unnecessary but also destructive to a research program vital for the successful administration of this world after it is conquered and pacflied ttomalss looked around for the hatchling again and still didnt see it in a way that was almost a relief how could he turn it over to the chinese if he didnt know where it was no definitive decision on this matter has yet been made if that is your concern the administrator said if one is reached however rapid implementation will be mandatory at need it shall be done and promptly ttomalss said hoping he could keep relief from his voice i understand the maniacal stress the big uglies sometimes place on speedy performance if you do understand it you have the advantage over most males of the race ppevel said the tosevites have sped through millennia of technical development in a relative handful of years i have heard endless speculation as to the root causes of this the peculiar geography the perverse and revolting sexual habits the big uglies practice this latter thesis has been central to my own research superior sir ttomalss answered the tosevites certainly differ in their habits from ourselves the rabotevs and the hallessi my hypothesis is that their constant sexual tensions to use an imprecise simile are like a fire continually simmering under them and stimulating them to ingenuity in other areas i have seen and heard more hypotheses than i care to remember ppevel said when i find one with supporting evidence i shall be pleased our analysts these days too often emulate the tosevites not only in speed but also in imprecision superior sir i wish to retain the tosevite hatching precisely so i can gather such evidence ttomalss said without studying the big uglies at all stages of their development how can we hope to understand them a point to be considered ppevel admitted which made ttomalss all but glow with hope no administrator had given him so much reason for optimism in a long time ppevel continued we ttomalss wanted to hear more but was distracted by a yowlan alarmed yowlfrom the big ugly hatchling it also sounded oddly far away excuse me superior sir but i believe i have encountered a difficulty the researcher said and broke the connection he hurried along the corridors of his laboratory area looking to see what the hatchling had managed to get itself into this time he didnt see it anywhere which worried himhad it managed to crawl inside a cabinet was that why its squawks sounded distant then it wailed again ttomalss went dashing out into the corridorthe hatchling had taken it into its head to go exploring ttomalss almost collided with tessrek another researcher into the habits and thought patterns of the big uglies in his arms none too gently tessrek carried the wayward tosevite hatchling he thrust it at ttomalss here this is yours kindly keep better track of it in future it came wandering into my laboratory chamber and i assure you it is not welcome there as soon as ttomalss took hold of it the hatchling stopped wailing it knew him and knew he cared for it he might as well have been its mother a tosevite term with implications far more powerful than its equivalent in the language of the race tessrek went on the sooner you give that thing back to the big uglies the happier everyone else along this corridor will be no more hideous noises no more dreadful stenchesa return to peace and quiet and order the hatchlings ultimate disposition has not yet been determined ttomalss said tessrek had always wanted the little tosevite gone its jaunt today would only give him fresh ammunition getting rid of it will improve my disposition he said and let his mouth fall open in appreciation of his own joke then he grew serious once more if you must have it keep it in your own area i cannot answer for its safety if it invades my laboratory once more like any hatchling it is as yet ignorant of proper behavior ttomalss said coldly if you ignore that obvious fact and deliberately mistreat it i cannot answer foryour safety to make sure hed made his point he turned and carried the hatchling back into his own chamber with one eye turret he watched tessrek staring after him iv an ugly little tracked ammunition carrier cameputputting up to the panthers halted in the forest north of lodz the front hatch of the frenchbuilt machinebooty from the triumphant campaign of opened and a couple of men scrambled out calling here lads weve got presents for you about time heinrich jager said we were down to our last few rounds for each panzer thats not where you want to be against the lizards either gunther grillparzer added the gunner went on their armor is so good you can waste a lot of hits before you get one penetration the ammunition haulers grinned they wore onepiece coveralls like the panzer crewmen but in the fieldgray of selfpropelled gun units rather than panzer black one of them said new toys for you herea notion we borrowed from the lizards and put into production for ourselves that was plenty to get the panzer men crowding around them jager took shameless advantage of his rank to push his way to the front what do you have he demanded well show you sir the fellow whod spoken before answered he turned to his companion show them fritz fritz went around to the back of the lorraine hauler undid the whitewashed canvas tilt on top of the storage bin at the rear of the machine he reached in and grunting a little at the weight drew out the oddestlooking shell jager had ever seen what the devil is it half a dozen men asked at once you tell em joachim fritz said i never can say it right armorpiercing discarding sabot joachim said importantly see the aluminum sabot fits your gun barrel but as soon as it gets out it falls off and the round proper goes out with a lot more muzzle velocity than you can get any other way its capped with wolfram too for extra penetration is that so jager pricked up his ears my brother is a panzer engineer and he says wolfram is in short supply even for machine tools now theyre releasing it for antipanzer rounds i dont know anything about machine toolsherr oberst joachim said and fritzs head solemnly bobbed up and down to signify he didnt know anything either but i do know these shells are supposed to give you half again as much penetration as you get with regular capped armorpiercing ammunition are supposed to give you that was karl mehler jagers loader loaders had an inherently pessimistic view of the world when panzers were moving they didnt see much of it they stayed down in the bottom of the turret doing what the gunner and the commander ordered if you were a loader you never had a clue before a shell slammed into your machine one second youd be fine the next butchered and burnt mehler went on how good are they really fritz and joachim looked at each other fritz said they wouldnt issue them to frontline units if they didnt think theyd perform as advertised would they you never can tell mehler said darkly some poor slobs have to be the guinea pigs i suppose we must have drawn the short straw this time thats enough karl jager said the rebuke was mild but plenty to make the loader shut up jager turned to the men with the munitions conveyor do you have any of our conventional armorpiercing rounds to use in case these things arent as perfect as the people away from the firing line seem to think uh no sir joachim answered this is what came off the train so this is what we have the mutters that rose from the panzer crewmen werent quite rumbles of mutiny but they werent rapturous sighs either jager sighed also not rapturously well we all still have a few rounds of the old issue anyhow we know what that will doand what it wont tell me one thing right now you two is this new round supposed to be able to pierce the frontal armor of a lizard panzer regretfully the ammunition resupply men shook their headsherr oberst the next round that can do that will be the first joachim said i was afraid you were going to say as much jager answered the way things are now it costs us anywhere between six and ten panzers on average for every lizard machine we manage to killthats just panzer against panzer mind you it would be even worse if we didnt have better crews than they dobut weve lost so many veterans that our edge there is going the thing that would help us most is a gun that would let us meet them facetoface the thing that would help us most is another one of those bombs that they set off outside of breslau and rome gunther grillparzer put in and i know just where to set it too wheres that jager asked curious to see what his gunner used for a sense of strategy lodz grillparzer answered promptly right in the middle of town blast all the lizards and all the kikes there to kingdom come just like that he was wearing gloves so instead of snapping his fingers he spat in the snow wouldnt mind getting rid of the lizards jager agreed the jews he shrugged anielewicz said hed keep the lizards from mounting a counterattack out of the city and hes done it he deserves the credit for it too if you ask me yes sir the gunners round fleshy face went sullen not that grillparzer didnt look a little sullen most of the time he knew better than to argue with his regimental commander but he wasnt about to think warm kind thoughts about any jews either jager glanced around the rest of the panzer crewmen nobody disagreed with him not out loud but nobody sprang up to say anything nice about the jews in the lodz ghetto that worried jager he wasnt massively enamored of jews himself but hed been horrflied when he learned what german forces had done to them in the areas thereich had conquered he hadnt wanted to learn about such things but hed had his nose rubbed in them and he was not the sort of man who could pretend he was blind when be wasnt a lot of german officers hed found to his dismay had no trouble at all managing that right this second though he didnt have to think about it lets share out what theyve brought us he told his men if all youve got is a dead pig you eat pork chops this stuff is liable to turn us all into dead pigs karl mehler muttered under his breath but that didnt keep him from taking his fair share of the newfangled rounds he stowed them in the panthers ammunition bins it doesnt look right he grumbled when he scrambled back out of the panzer it looks funny weve never had anything like it before intelligence says one of the reasons we drive the lizards crazy is that we keep coming up with new things jager said they dont change or dont change much do you want to be like them well no sir but i dont want to change for the worse either and not for the hell of it mehler said these things look like a sausage sticking out of a bun like some engineer is having a joke with us they dont pay off on looks jager answered if these new shells dont work the way theyre supposed to then somebodys head rolls first though we have to find out if these new shells dont work the way theyre supposed to our heads roll karl mehler said maybe somebody elses head rolls afterwards but we wont get to watch that since mehler was right the only thing jager could do was glare at him with a shrug the loader climbed back into the turret a moment later gunther grillparzer followed him jager climbed in too and flipped up the lid to the cupola so he could stand up and see what he was doing the driver johannes drucker and the hull gunner bernhard steinfeldt took their positions at the front of the panthers fighting compartment the big maybach petrol engine started up steam and stinking exhaust roared from the tailpipe all through the clearing panthers tigers and panzer ivs were coming to life jager really thought of it that way they seemed like so many dinosaurs exhaling on a cold winters morning drucker rocked the panther back and forth going from low gear to reverse and back to break up the ice that accumulated overnight between the panzers interleaved road wheels that freezeup problem was the only drawback to the suspension it gave a smooth ride over rugged terrain but sometimes even rocking the panzer wouldnt free up the road wheels then you had to light a fire to melt the ice before you could get going if the enemy attacked you instead of the other way around that could prove hazardous to your life expectancy but today the germans were hunters not huntedat least for the moment the panzers rolled out of the clearing with them came a few selfpropelled guns and a couple of threequartertracked carriers full of infantrymen some of the foot soldiers carried handheld antipanzer rocketsanother idea stolen from the lizards jager thought about remarking on that to his crewmen but decided not to bother they were doing fine as things stood against the poles against the french against the russians thewehrmacht panzers had charged out ahead of the infantry cutting great gaps in the forces of the enemy do that against the lizards and your head would roll sure as sure the only way you had any hope of shifting them was with a combinedarms operationand even then youd better outnumber them jager would have been just as well content to find no trace of the aliens he knew how many times hed been lucky christ crucflied hed killed a lizard panzer with the mm gun of a panzer iii back in the days when the lizards had just come to earth and if that wasnt luck he didnt know what was and here he was almost two years later still alive and still unmaimed not many whod seen as much action could say the same up ahead the trees thinned out he got on the allvehicles wireless circuit well halt at the forests edge to reconnoiter charge out into open country and you deserved to get slaughtered foot soldiers in winter white got down from their carriers and trotted ghostlike out across the snowcovered fields a couple of them had rocket launchers also whitewashed on their backs the rest carried mp submachine guns jager had heard hugo schmeisser wasnt involved with the design of that weapon but it got called a schmeisser just the same from behind a barn a machine gun started chattering kicking up clumps of snow thewehrmacht men out in the open dove for whatever cover they could find two panzers fired highexplosive shells at the barn to flush out the lizards in back of it not ten seconds later one of those panzers brewed up flame and smoke spurting from every hatch and out the top of the cupola jagers mouth went dry thats a lizard panzer there he shouted into the microphone to his wireless set it was stating the obviousoverstating the obviousbut it had to be said armorpiercing gunther grillparzer said to karl mehler give me one of the new roundswell see what they can do if they can do anything mehler said gloomily but he slammed one of the aluminumsabot rounds into the breach of the panthers long mm cannon with a clang grillparzer closed it range jager asked long sir the gunner answered better than fifteen hundred meters jager grunted he didnt see any other good hiding places for panzers ahead but that didnt mean there werent any even against the one sending his own panzers out to flank it was more likely to get them picked off one at a time than anything else the lizard panzers turret had a powered traverse about which jager was fearfully jealous he couldnt just sit here either even if hed bumped into the last of the lizard rear guard that panzer could call down artillery on his head or maybe even summon a helicopter or two with their rockets lizard helicopters made nasty antipanzer weapons and they chewed up infantry like teething biscuits the barn started to burn the sole result of the highexplosive shells the germans had thrown at it that was a break the smoke would screen his panzers from the lizards eyes at least until they shifted position and set alongside his other options flanking out the lizard panzer didnt look so bad after all he was off to the right of the barn he ordered out a tiger from off to the left and a panzer iv from right out in front that done he spoke to the driver of his own machine come on hanstime to earn our pay forward jawohjohannes drucker sped out into the open country the panzer iv fired at the lizard panzer its gun wasnt much worse than the panthers but at long range its odds of doing anything useful were slim indeed a shell knocked down a tree behind the panzer iv when the lizards missed it was commonly because they couldnt see well their panzer did move out into the open the tiger fired at it the scored a clean hit but the lizard panzer kept moving it was unfair how tough they were the cannon in that panzer spoke the tigers turret flew off shells inside exploding as it crashed to the ground five or six meters away from the stricken panzer the chassis burned merrily too all five crewmen had to be dead an infantryman fired an antipanzer rocket at the lizard machine he hit it right in the glacis plate but the lizard panzers frontal armorfrom what jager had heard it wasnt just steeldefeated the shapedcharge warhead the machine gun kept searching for germans on foot range jager said again down under five hundred meters sir gunther grillparzer answered driver halt jager said and then fire because he was still standing up in the cupola rather than sheltered in the turret the noise was like the end of the world a tongue of flame spurted from the cannons muzzle flame and smoke spurted from the lizard panzer too hit everybody in jagers panzer screamed together jager listened to the breech clang shut on another round the long mm gun bellowed againanother hit hatches popped open in the lizard machine the panthers hullmounted machine gun started barking in short precise bursts in moments the three lizards whod bailed out lay motionless on the ground their all too humanly red blood staining the snow their panzer kept on burning very seriously gunther grillparzer said sir this is good ammunition we can get good use from it even if it looks funny jager teased even so the west wind brought the yellow dust of the gobi with it the dust left a thin film over everything you could taste it if you smacked your lips a couple of times nieh hoting was used to it it came with life in and around peking major mon rubbed at his eyes the dust bothered him in fair chinese he asked nieh sowhat do you want from me now more timers i hear you did well with the last batch no not this time nieh answered his first thought was that the japanese major was a fool if he thought a trick would work against the lizards twice running but the eastern devil could not have been a fool not if hed kept his force in being this long even with the lizards the peoples liberation army the troops loyal to the kuomintang reactionary clique and the chinese peasantry all arrayed against him what then niehs lips skinned back from his teeth in a grin that showed scant amusement the likeliest explanation was that major mori hoped hed try the same trick twice in a rowand get smashed as a result in moris boots nieh would have hoped for something like that well whatare you after now mori demanded although the troops he led were hardly more than a guerrilla band he kept all the arrogance the japanese had shown when they held the whole of northeastern china and coastal enclaves elsewhereand could push forward as they wished even if they couldnt always hold the gains theyd made artillery shells would be useful about now nieh said musingly maybe so but you wont get them from us mon said we still have some mm guns in commission though i wont tell you where nieh hoting knew where the japanese were concealing those cannon going after them struck him as being more trouble than it was worth since they were far more likely to be turned on the lizards than on his own men he said soldiers can be coolies and haul mm guns from one place to another as you say they are also easy to hide but the japanese army used to have heavier artillery too the scaly devils destroyed those big guns or else youve had to abandon them but you still should have some of the ammunition left do you mori studied him for a while before answering the eastern devil was somewhere not far from forty perhaps a couple of years older than nieh his skin was slightly darker his features slightly sharper than a chinese was likely to have that didnt bother nieh nearly so much as moris automatic assumption of his own superioritybarbarian nieh thought scornfully secure in his knowledge that china was the one true home of culture and civilization but even a barbarian could be useful what if we do mori said if you want one of those shells what will you give us for it capitalistnieh thoughtimperialist if all you care about is profit you dont deserve even that aloud though he answered i can give you the names of two men you think reliable who are in fact kuomintang spies mori smiled at him it was not a pleasant smile just the other day the kuomintang offered to sell me the names of three communists it wouldnt surprise me nieh said we have been known to give the names of japanese sympathizers to the kuomintang miserable war mori said just for a moment the two men understood each other completely then mori asked and when you dicker with the little devils whom do you sell to them why the kuomintang of course nieh hoting answered when the war with you and the scaly devils is over the reactionaries and counterrevolutionaries will still be here we shall deal with them they think they will deal with us but the historical dialectic shows they are mistaken you are mistaken if you think japanese cannot enforce on china a government friendly to its wishesleaving the little scaly devils out of the picture of course major mori said whenever your troops and ours meet in battle yours always come off second best and what has that got to do with the price of rice nieh asked in honest bewilderment eventually you will get sick of winning expensive battles and being nibbled to death inside areas you think you control and then you will go away and leave china alone the only reason you win now is that you started using the machines of the foreign devilsby which he meant europeansbefore we did we will have our own factories one day and then mori threw back his head and laughed a deliberate effort to be insultinggo ahead nieh thoughtlaugh now one fine day the revolution will cross the sea to your islands too japan had a large urban proletariat exploited workers with nothing to offer but their labor as interchangeable to a big capitalist as so many cogs and gears they would be dry tinder for the flame of class warfare but not yetthe lizards remained to be beaten first nieh said are we agreed on the price of one of these shells not yet the japanese answered information is useful yes but we need food too send us rice send us noodles send usshoyu send us pork or chicken do this and we will give you as many mm shells as you can use whatever you plan to do with them they started dickering about how much food would buy nieh how many shells and when and how to arrange deliveries as he had before nieh kept the contempt he felt from showing on the long march hed dickered with warlords officers and bandit chieftains over things like this in china now though what survived of the oncemighty imperial japanese army was reduced to bandit status the japanese couldnt do much more than prey on the countryside and they didnt even do that well not if they were trading munitions for food nieh resolved not to tell liu han any details about how he was negotiating with the japanese her hatred for them was personal as it was for the little devils nieh hated the japanese and the scaly devils too with an ideological purity his woman could never hope to match but she had imagination and came up with ways to hurt the enemies of the peoples liberation army and the communist party that he would never have dreamt of success especially among those who did not form largescale policy could make up for a lack of ideological purityfor a while anyhow major mon was not the best bargainer nieh had ever faced two chinese out of three could have got more supplies from him than mori did he gave a mental shrug well that was moris fault for being a barbarous eastern devil the japanese made good soldiers but not much else as far as he was concerned the same went for the little scaly devils they could conquer but seemed to have no idea how to hold down a rebellious land once under their control they didnt even use the murder and terror the japanese had taken for granted as far as nieh could tell all they did was reward collaborators and that was not enough excellent major mori exclaimed when the haggling was over he slapped his belly we will eat well for a time the military tunic he wore hung on him like a tent he might once have been a heavyset man no more and we will have a present for the little devils one day before too long nieh replied even if he could do what he hoped with the mm shells he aimed to try to blame it on the kuomintang liu han would not approve of that shed want the japanese to receive the scaly devils wrath but as nieh had said the kuomintang was more dangerous in the long run so long as the little scaly devils did not blame the peoples liberation army for the attacks talks with them could go on unimpeded those talks had been building in size and importance for some time now they needed to continue something of greater substance might come from them than the stalled negotiations about liu hans baby nieh hoped so at any rate he sighed if hed had his choice the peoples liberation army would have driven the japanese and the scaly devils out of china altogether he didnt have his choice though if hed ever needed reminding of that the long march would have given it to him you did what you had to do after that if you were lucky you got the chance to do what you wanted to do he bowed to major mori the major returned the compliment miserable war nieh said again mori noddedbut the workers and peasants will win it here in china and all over the world nieh thought he glanced at the japanese officer maybe mori was thinking victorious thoughts too well if he was he was wrong nieh had the dialectic to prove it mordechai anielewicz stepped out onto the sidewalk in front of the building on lutomierska street i can deal with my enemies he said the nazis and lizards are not a problem not like that my friends now he rolled his eyes in theatrical despairvay iz mir bertha fleishman laughed she was a year or two older then mordechai and normally so colorless that the jewish resistance of lodz often used her to pick up information you had trouble noticing she was there but her laugh stood out she had a good laugh one that invited everybody around to share the joke now she said actually weve done pretty well all things considered the lizards havent been able to get much through lodz to throw at the nazis she paused of course not everyone would say this is a good thing i know anielewicz grimaced i dont say its a good thing myself this is even worse than being caught between the nazis and the russians whoever winswe lose the germans are living up to their promise not to attack lodz so long as we keep the lizards from mounting any moves from here bertha said they havent thrown any of their rocket bombs at us lately either for which god be thanked anielewicz said before the war hed been a secular man that hadnt mattered to the nazis whod dumped him into the warsaw ghetto all the same what hed seen there what hed seen since had left him convinced he couldnt live without god after all what would have been ironic in came out sincere today were useful to them at the moment bertha fleishmans mouth turned down even thats progress before we were working in their factories making all kinds of things for them and they slaughtered us anyhow i know mordechai kicked at the paving stones i wonder if they tried out their poison gas on jews before they started using it against the lizards he didnt want to think about that if he let himself brood on it hed wonder why he was helping hitler himmler and their henchmen against the lizards then hed take a look at bunim and the other lizard officials in lodz and be sure he couldnt help them beat the germans and in so doing subject all of mankind it isnt fair bertha said has anyone since the world began ever been in such a predicament were the chosen people anielewicz answered with a shrug if you think id be just as glad if we hadnt been chosen for this though youre right speaking of which arent the lizards supposed to be moving a convoy of lorries through town in about half an hour bertha asked since she was the one whod come up with that bit of intelligence the question was rhetorical she smiled shall we go watch the fun the convoy was supposed to head north up franciszkanska street to bring reinforcements to the lizards who were trying to cut the base off one of the german prongs advancing to either side of lodz the lizards had not had much luck with their countermovements what they would do when they figured out why would be interestingand likely unpleasant jews and poles stood on the corner of inflancka and franciszkanska and in the streets themselves chatting chaffering and carrying on their business as they would have on any other day it was a scene that might almost have come from the time before the war save that so many of the menand a few of the womenhad rifles on their backs or in their hands cheating these days was liable to meet with swift and summary punishment about fifteen minutes before the convoy was due to come through human policemen some jews some poles began trying to clear the street anielewicz watched themespecially the jewswith undisguised loathing the jewish policethugs would have been a better word for themowed allegiance to mordechai chaim rumkowski who had been eldest of the jews when the lodz ghetto was in nazi hands and still ran it for the lizards they still wore the long coats shinybrimmed caps and redwhiteandblack rank armbands the germans had given them too maybe it made them feel important it made everyone else despise them they didnt have much luck with their street clearing either they were armed with nothing better than truncheons that had been intimidating back in the days when the nazis held lodz it did not do much though to shift men with rifles anielewicz knew the jewish police had been screaming at the lizards for guns of their own what had been in place before the lizards arrived though seemed to be like the torah to them not to be changed or interfered with by mere mortals the police remained without firearms an old jewish man driving a horsedrawn wagon that carried tables stacked four and five high tried to cross franciszkanska on inflancka just as a polish lorrydriver rumbled down franciszkanska with a load of empty tin milk cans the pole tried to slow down but seemed to be having trouble with his brakes his lorry crashed into the old jews wagon the racket that immediately followed the collision was louder than the crash itself the rear gate of the lorry hadnt been well secured so milk cans clattered down onto the pavement and started rolling away as best mordechai could see the load of tables hadnt been secured at all they landed in the street too some of them broke some didnt by what looked like a miracle the wagon driver hadnt been hurt surprisingly agile for an old man he jumped down from his beast and ran up to the drivers side of the lorry screaming abuse in yiddish shut up you damned kike the pole answered in his own language stinking old christkiller youve got your nerve yelling at me id yell at your father except even your mother doesnt know who he is the jew retorted the polish lorrydriver jumped out of the cab and grabbed the jew in a moment they were wrestling on the ground jews and poles both ran toward the altercation here and there some of them bumped into one another and started fresh trouble policemenjews and polesblew furiously on whistles and waded into the crowd trying to clear it some of them got drawn into fistfights too mordechai anielewicz and bertha fleishman watched the unfolding chaos with eyebrows raised high into the chaos came the lizards motor convoy some of their lorries were of their own manufacture others human products theyd appropriated a lizard lorry horn made a noise that reminded mordechai of what youd get if you dropped a bucket of water onto a redhot iron plate when you added in the klaxons from the opels and other humanmade lorries the din became truly dreadful no one in the street paid the least attention to it as far as the jews and poles were concerned the impatient lizards might have been back on the far side of the moon or wherever it was they came from what a pity mordechai said it looks like the lizards are going to be delayed thats terrible bertha said in the same solemn tones hed used without warning both of them started to laugh in a low voice bertha went on this worked out even better than we thought it would so it did anielewicz agreed yitzkhak and boleslaw both deserve those statues the americans give their best cinema actors every year bertha fleishmans brown eyes twinkled no they couldnt have played that much better if theyd rehearsed it for years could they the rest of our peopleand also thearmija krajowamen she admitted are doing nicely too good thing most of the people at this corner really do belong to us or the polish home army mordechai said otherwise wed have a real riot on our hands not a scripted one i am glad no ones decided to pull a rifle off his back and use it bertha said not everybody here knows were playing a game thats true anielewicz said the police dont and the lizard lorry drivers dont either he pointed back to the rear of the long stalled column of motor vehicles oh look some of them look like theyre trying to turn around and use a different route to get out of town bertha shaded her eyes so she could see better so they are but they seem to be having some trouble too i wonder who started an argument way down there whoever it was he certainly managed to pull a lot of people into the street in a hurry he certainly did mordechai grinned at her she was grinning back maybe she wasnt beautiful but he certainly liked the way she looked when she was happy like this i dont think those poor lizard lorries will be able to go anywhere for quite a while im afraid youre right bertha sighed theatrically isnt it a pity she and mordechai laughed again lizards werent what youd call big to begin with even as lizards went straha was on the shortish side a husky nineyearold would have overtopped him with lizards as with people though size had little to do with force of personality whenever sam yeager got to talking with the former shiplord of theth emperor yower he needed only a couple of minutes to forget that straha was hardly more than half his size by not falling at once you big uglies presented atvar the brainaddled fleetlord with a problem he will not be able to solve straha declared at the time i urged him to strike a series of blows against you so strong that you would have no choice but to yield to the race did he heed me he did not strahas emphatic cough was a masterpiece of rudeness why didnt he yeager asked ive always wondered about that the race never seemed to want to turn up the pressure more than one notch at a time that let ushow would i say it i guessadapt is the word i want truth straha said with another emphatic cough one thing we did not realize until far later than we should have was how adaptable you tosevites are fool that he is atvar always intended to come as close as he could to the campaign we would have fought had you been the preindustrial savages we expected you to be even his eye turrets are not entirely locked in place and he did conclude a greater effort would be called for but he always did his best to keep the increases to a minimum so as to have the least possible distortion in the plan with which we came to tosev most of you lizards are like that arent you sam used mankinds disparaging name for the race as casually as straha used the races handle for humanity you dont much care for change do you of course not straha saidand for a lizard he was a radical if you are in a good situation where you are why if you have any sense would you want to alter it it would be only too likely to get worse change must be most carefully controlled or it can devastate an entire society sam grinned at him how do you account for us then our scholars will spend thousands of years attempting to account for you straha answered it could be that had we not arrived you would have destroyed yourselves in relatively short order you were after all already working to develop your own atomic weapons and with those you would have had no trouble rendering this planet uninhabitable almost a pity you failed to do so thanks a lot yeager said we really love you lizards a whole bunch too he added an emphatic cough to that even though he wasnt sure whether the race used them for sardonic effect strahas mouth dropped open in amusement so maybe they didor maybe the exshiplord was laughing at the way sam mangled his language straha said like most males of the race atvar is a minimalistyou big uglies now you are maximalists in the long term as i pointed out this will probably prove disastrous for your species i cannot imagine you tosevites building an empire stable for a hundred thousand years can you nope sam admitted the years straha used were only about half as long as their earthly equivalents but stillfifty thousand years ago people had been living in caves and worrying about mammoths and sabertooth tigers yeager couldnt begin to imagine what things would be like in another fifty years let alone fifty thousand in the short term though your penchant for change without warning presents us with stresses our kind has never before faced straha said by the standards of the race i am a maximalistthus i would have been well suited to lead us against your kind by human standards straha was more mossbound than a southern democrat with fortyfive years seniority but yeager didnt see any good way to tell him so the lizard went on i believe in taking action not waiting until it is forced upon me as atvar and his clique do when the soviets nuclear bomb showed us how disastrously wed misjudged your kind i tried to have atvar the fool ousted and someone more suitable such as myself raised to overall command and when that failed i took the direct action of fleeing to you tosevites rather than waiting for atvar to have his revenge upon me truth yeager said and it was truthmaybe straha really was a fireball by lizard standards theres more direct action from you people these days isnt there what are the mutineers in siberia doing anyhow your radio intercepts indicate they have surrendered to the russkis straha answered if they are treated well that will be a signal for other disaffected unitsand there must be manyto realize they too can make peace with tosevites that would be nice sam said when will the fleetlord realize he needs to make peace with us that he cant conquer the whole planet the way the race thought it would when you set out from home had straha been a cat he would have bristled at that question yes he despised atvar yes hed defected to the americans somewhere down in his heart of hearts though he was still loyal to the emperor back on tau cetis second planet the idea that a scheme the emperor had endorsed might fail gave him the galloping collywobbles but the shiplord countered gamely asking in return when will you big uglies realize that you cannot exterminate us or drive us off your miserable chilly planet now yeager grunted in turn when the usa had been fighting the nazis and the japs everybody had figured the war would go on till the bad guys got smashed flat that was the way wars were supposed to work wasnt it somebody won and he took stuff away from the guys who had lost if the lizards came down and took part of earth away from humanity didnt that mean theyd won when sam said that out loud straha waggled both eye turrets at him a sign of astonishment truly you big uglies are creatures of overweening pride the shiplord exclaimed no plan of the race has ever failed to the extent of our design for the conquest of tosev and its incorporation into the empire if we fail to acquire the whole of the planet if we leave big ugly empires and notempires intact and independent upon it we suffer a humiliation whose like we have never known before is that so yeager said well if we think letting you have anything is a mistake and if you think letting us keep anything is an even bigger mistake how are lizards and people ever going to get together and settle things one way or the other sounds to me like were stuck we might not be were it not for atvars stubbornness straha said as i told you before the only way he will consent to anything less than complete victory is to become convinced it is impossible if he hasnt gotten that idea by now but sam paused and shook his head you had to remember the lizards point of view what looked like disastrous defeats from up close might seem only bumps in the road if considered in a thousandyear context men prepared for the next battle the lizards for the next millennium straha said when he does get that ideaif ever he doeshe will do one of two things i think he may fly to make peace along the lines you and i have been discussing or he may try to use whatever nuclear arsenal the race has left to force you tosevites into submission this is what i would have done that i proposed it may make it less likely now good yeager said sincerely hed been away from the american nuclearbomb program for a while now but he knew the infernal devices didnt roll off the assembly line like so many de sotos the other thing holding him back is your colonization fleet isnt it truth straha replied at once this consideration has inhibited our actions in the past and continues to do so atvar may decide however that making peace with you will leave the race less of the habitable surface of tosev than he could hope to obtain by damaging large portions of the planet on our behalf it wouldnt keep us from fighting back you know sam said and hoped he wasnt whistling in the dark evidently straha didnt think he was because the shiplord said we are painfully aware of this it is one of the factors that has to this point deterred us from that course more important though is our desire not to damage the planet for our colonists as you have noted mmhmm sam said tasting the irony of earths safety riding more on the lizards concern for their own kind than on any worries about human beings weve got what something like eighteen years before the rest of your people get here no twice that straha answered then he made a noise like a bubbling teakettle my apologiesif you are using tosevite years you are correct yeah i wasim a tosevite after all yeager said with a wry grin what are your colonists going to think if they come to a world that isnt completely in your hands the way they thought it would be when they set out from home the starship crews will be aware of changed conditions when they intercept our signals beamed back toward home straha said no doubt this will fill them with consternation and confusion remember we of the conquest fleet have had some time now to try to accommodate ourselves to the unanticipated conditions on tosev these will be new for them and the race does not adapt well in any case there will be little they can do the colonization fleet is not armed the assumption was that we of the conquest fleet would have this world all nicely pacflied before the colonists arrived and of course the colonists themselves are in cold sleep and will remain ignorant of the true situation until they are revived upon the fleets arrival theyll get quite a surprise wont they sam said chuckling how many of them are there anyhow i do not know not in precise figures straha replied my responsibility after all was with the conquest fleet but if our practice in colonizing the worlds of the rabotevs and hallessi was followed back on homeas it almost certainly would have been given our fondness for precedentthen we are sending here something between eighty and one hundred million males and females those coughs mean nothing in my language samyeager he pronounced yeagers name as if it were one word have they some signflication in yours im sorry shiplord sam said when he could speak coherently again must have swallowed wrong or somethingeighty or a hundred millioncolonists the race doesnt do things by halves does it of course not straha said one mortflication after another atvar said in deep discontent from where he stood the situation down on the surface of tosev looked gloomy almost better we should have expended a nuclear device on those mutineers than let them go over to the sssr truth kirel said the loss of the armaments is bad before long the big uglies will copy whatever features they can figure out how to steal that has happened before and is happening again we have recent reports that the deutsche for instance are beginning to deploy armorpiercing discarding sabot ammunition against our landcruisers i have seen these reports the fleetlord agreed they do not inspire me with delight nor me kirel answered moreover the loss of the territory formerly controlled by the base whose garrison mutinied has given us new problems though weather conditions in the area remain appallingly bad we have evidence that the sssr is attempting to reestablish its eastwest rail link how can they do that atvar said surely even big uglies would freeze if forced to work in such circumstances from what we have seen in the sssr exalted fleetlord it would appear hardly more concerned about the wellbeing of its laborers than is deutschland kirel said mournfully getting the task done counts for more than the number of lives expended in the process truth atvar said and then added madness and an emphatic cough the deutsche sometimes appear to put expending lives above extracting labor what was the name of that place where they devoted so much ingenuity to slaughter treblinka that was it the race had never imagined a center wholly devoted to exterminating intelligent beings atvar would have been as glad never to have been exposed to some of the things hed learned on tosev he waited for kirel to mention the most important reason why the fall of the siberian base was a disaster kirel didnt mention it all too likely kirel hadnt thought of it he was a good shiplord none better when someone told him what to do even for a male of the race though he lacked imagination atvar said we now have to deal with the problem of propaganda broadcasts from the mutineers by all they say they are cheerful well fed well treated with plenty of that pernicious herb ginger for amusement transmissions such as these are liable to touch off not only further mutinies but also desertions by individual males who cannot find partners with whom to conspire what you say is likely to be correct kirel agreed it is to be hoped that increased vigilance on the part of officers will help to allay the problem it is to be hoped indeed atvar said with heavy sarcasm it is also to be hoped that we shall be able to keep from losing too much ground in this northernhemisphere winter and that guerrilla raids against our positions will ease in some placesmuch of italia springs to mindwe are unable to administer or control territory allegedly under our jurisdiction we need more cooperation from the tosevite authorities who yielded to us kirel said this is true all over the planet and especially so in italia where our forces might as well be at war again most of the italian authorities such as they were went up with the atomic bomb that destroyed roma atvar answered too many of the ones who are left still favor their overthrown notemperor that mussolini how i wish the deutsch raider that skorzeny hadnt succeeded in stealing him and spiriting him off into deutschland his radio broadcasts along with those of our former ally russie and the traitor straha have proved most damaging of all counterpropaganda efforts against us that skorzeny has been a pin driven under our scales throughout the campaign of conquest kirel said he is unpredictable even for a tosevite and deadly as well i wish i could dispute it but it is truth the fleetlord said sadly in addition to all the other harm he has inflicted on our cause he cost me drefsab the one intelligence officer we had who was both devious and energetic enough to match the big uglies at their own primary traits wherefore now exalted fleetlord kirel asked we carry on as best we can atvar answered a response that did not satisfy him and plainly did not satisfy kirel trying to amplify it he went on one thing we must do is increase security around our starships if the big uglies can smuggle nuclear weapons within range of them rather than of cities they potentially have the ability to hurt us even worse than they have already i shall draft an order seeking to forestall this contingency kirel said i agree it is a serious menace i shall also draft procedures whose thorough implementation will make the order effective good atvar said be most detailed allow no conceivable loopholes through which a careless male might produce disaster all that was standard advice from one male of the race to another after a moment though the fleetlord added in thoughtful tones before promulgating the order and procedures consult with males who have had experience down on the surface of tosev they may possibly make your proposed procedures more leakproof against the ingenious machinations of the big uglies it shall be done exalted fleetlord kirel promised may i respectfully suggest that none of us up here in orbit has enough firsthand experience with conditions down on the surface of tosev there is some truth in what you say atvar admitted perhaps we should spend more time on the planet itselfin a reasonably secure area preferably one with a reasonably salubrious climate he called up a flat map of the surface of tosev on a computer screen one set of color overlays gave a security evaluation with categories ranging from unconquered to pacflied though depressingly little of the planet showed that placid pink tone another gave climatological data he instructed the computer to show him where both factors were at a maximum kirel pointed the northern coastal region of the subcontinental mass the tosevites term africa seems as near ideal as any region so it does atvar said i have visited there before itis pleasant parts of it could almost be home very well shiplord make the requisite preparations we shall temporarily shift headquarters to this region the better to supervise the conduct of the conquest at close range it shall be done exalted fleetlord kirel said ludmila gorbunova wanted to kickgeneralleutnant graf walter von brockdorffahlefeldt right where it would do the most good since the damned nazi general was in riga and she was stuck outside hrubieszow that wasnt practical in lieu of fulfilling her desire she kicked at the mud instead it clung to her boots which did nothing to improve her mood she hadnt thought of brockdorffahlefeldt as a damned nazi when she was in riga herself then hed seemed a charmingkulturny general nothing like the boorish soviets and coldblooded germans it had mostly been her lot to deal with fly me one little mission senior lieutenant gorbunova she muttered under her breath take a couple of antipanzer mines to hrubieszow then come on back here and well send you on to pskov with a pat on the fanny for your trouble that wasnt exactly what thekulturny general had said of course and he hadnt tried to pat her on the fanny which was one of the things that made himkulturny but if he hadnt sent her to hrubieszow herkukuruznik wouldnt have tried to taxi through a tree which would have meant shed still be able to fly it which would have meant i wouldnt be stuck here outside of hrubieszow she snarled and kicked at the mud again some of it splashed up and hit her in the cheek she snarled and spat shed always thought of us as nearly indestructible not least because they were too simple to be easy to break down in the ukraine shed buried one nosefirst in the mud but that could have been fixed without much trouble if she hadnt had to get away from the little biplane as fast as she could wrapping akukuruznik around a tree thoughthat was truly championshipquality ineptitude and why did the devils sister leave a tree in the middle of the landing strip she asked the god in whom she did not believe but it hadnt been the devils sister it had been these miserable partisans it wastheir fault of course shed been flying at night of course shed had one eye on the compass one eye on her wristwatch one eye on the ground and sky one eye on the fuel gaugeshed almost wished she was a lizard so she could look every which way at once just finding the partisans poorly lit landing strip had beennot a miracle for she didnt believe in miraclesa major achievement thats what it had been shed circled once shed brought the wheatcutter down shed taxied smoothly shed never seen the pine saplingno it was more than a sapling worse lucktill she ran into it broken wing spars she said ticking off the damage on her fingers broken propeller both of those were wood and reparable broken crankshaft that was of metal and she had no idea what she was going to do about itwhat shecould do about it behind her someone coughed she whirled around like a startled cat her hand flew to the grip of her tokarev automatic the partisan standing there jerked back in alarm he was a weedy bearded nervous little jew who went by the name sholom she could follow pieces of his polish and pieces of his yiddish and he knew a little russian so they managed to make themselves understood to each other you come he said now we bring blacksmith out from hrubieszow he look at your machine all right ill come she answered dully yes a u was easy to work on but she didnt think a blacksmith could repair a machined part well enough to make the aircraft fly again he was one of the largest men shed ever seen almost two meters tall and seemingly that wide through the shoulders too by the look of him he could have bent the crankshaft back into its proper shape with his bare hands if it had been in one piece but it wasnt just bent it was broken in half too the smith spoke in polish too fast for ludmila to follow sholom turned his words into something she could understand witold he say if it made of metal he fix it he fix lots of wagons he say has he ever fixed a motorcar ludmila asked if the answer there was yes maybe she did have some hope of getting off the ground again after all when he heard her voice witold blinked in surprise then he struck a manly pose his already huge chest inflated like a balloon muscles bulged in his upper arms again he spoke rapidly again sholom made what he said intelligible he say of course he do he say for you he fix anything ludmila studied the smith through slitted eyes she thought hed said more than that some of his polish had sounded close to what would have been a lewd suggestion in russian well if she didnt understand it she didnt have to react to it she decided that would be the wisest course for the time being to sholom she said tell him to come look at the damage then and see what he can do witold strutted along beside her chest out back straight chin up ludmila was not a tall woman and felt even smaller beside him whatever he might have hoped that did not endear him to her he studied the biplane for a couple of minutes then asked what is broken that takes a smith to fix the crankshaft ludmila answered witolds handsome face remained blank even after sholom translated that into polish ludmila craned her neck to glare up at him with poisonous sweetness she asked you do know what a crankshaft is dont you if youve worked on motorcars youd better more translation from sholom another spate of fast polish from witold ludmila caught pieces of it and didnt like what she heard sholoms rendition did nothing to improve her spirits he say he work on car springs on fixing dent inhow you say this in mudguards you understand he not work on motor of motorcar bozhemoiludmila muttered atheist she might be but swearing needed flavor to release tension and so she called on god there stood witold strong as a bull and for all the use he was to her he might as well have had a bulls ring in his nose she rounded on sholom who cringed why didnt you find me a real mechanic then not this blundering idiot witold got enough of that to let out a very bulllike bellow of rage sholom shrugged helplessly before war only two motor mechanics in hrubieszow lady pilot one of them he dead nowforget whether nazis or russians kill him the other one he licks the lizards backsides we bring him here he tell lizards everything witold he may not do much but he loyal witold followed that too he shouted something incendiary and drew back a massive fist to knock sholom into the middle of next week the jewish partisan had not looked to be armed now with the air of a man performing a conjurers trick he produced a luger apparently from thin air and pointed it at witolds middle jews have guns now witold youd better remember it talk about my mother and ill blow your balls off we dont need to takegowno from you poles any more in polish or in russian shit was shit witolds pale blue eyes were wide and staring his mouth was wide too it opened and closed a couple of times but no words emerged still wordlessly he turned on his heel and walked away all the swagger had leaked out of him like the air from a punctured bicycle tire quietly ludmila told sholom youve just given him reason to sell us out to the lizards sholom shrugged the luger disappeared he has reason to want to breathe more too he keep quiet or he is dead he knows there is that ludmila admitted sholom laughed yes there is that all russia is that yes ludmila started to make an angry retort but stopped before the words passed her lips she remembered neighbors teachers and a couple of cousins disappearing in and one day they were there the next gone you didnt ask questions about it you didnt talk about it if you did you would disappear next that had happened too you kept your head down pretended nothing was going on and hoped the terror would pass you by sholom watched her his dark deepset eyes full of irony at last feeling she had to say something she answered i am a senior lieutenant in the red air force do you like hearing your government insulted mygovernment sholom spat on the ground i am jew you think the polish government is mine he laughed again this time the sound carried the weight of centuries of oppression and then the nazis come and make poles look like nice and kindly people who thinks anyone can do that so why are you here and not with the lizards inside hrubieszow ludmila asked a moment later she realized the question was imperfectly tactful but shed already let it out some things are bad some things are worse some things are worst of all sholom answered he waited to see if ludmila followed the polish comparative and superlative when he decided she did he added for jews the nazis are worst of all for people the lizards are worst of all am i a person first or am i a jew first you are a person first ludmila answered at once from you it sounds so easy sholom said with a sigh my brother mendel he is in hrubieszow the jew shrugged yet again these things happen not knowing what to say ludmila kept quiet she gave her u one more anxious glance it was covered up so it would be hard to spot from the air but it wasnt concealed the way a red air force crew would have done the job she did her best not to worry about it the guerrillas remained operational so their camouflage precautions were adequate in some way theirmaskirovka was downright inspired with tricks like those shed seen from her own experience a couple of kilometers away from their encampment large fires burned and cloth tents simulated the presence of a goodsized force the lizards had shelled that area a couple of times while leaving the real site alone fires here were smaller all of them either inside tents or else hidden under canvas sheets held up on stakes men went back and forth or sat around the fires some cleaning their weapons others gossiping still others playing with packs of dogeared cards with the men were a fair number of women perhaps one in six of the partisans some it seemed were there for little more than to cook for the men and to sleep with them but some were real soldiers the men treated the women who fought like any other fighters but towards the others they were as coarse and scornful as peasants were to their wives a fellow who wore a german greatcoat but who had to be a jew got up from his card games to throw some powdered herbs into a pot and stir it with a woodenhandled iron spoon catching ludmilas eye on him he laughed selfconsciously and said something in yiddish she got the gist of it hed been a cook in hrubieszow and now he was reduced to this better a real cook should cook than someone who doesnt know what hes doing she answered in german and set a hand on her stomach to emphasize what she meant this yes the jew answered he stirred the pot again but thats salt pork in there its the only meat we could get so now we eat it and i have to make it tasty too he rolled his eyes up to heaven as if to say a reasonable god would never have made him put up with such humiliation as far as ludmila was concerned the dietary regulations he agonized over transgressing were primitive superstitions to be ignored by modern progressive individuals she kept that to herself though even the great stalin had made his peace with the orthodox patriarch of moscow and enlisted god on the side of the red army if superstition would serve the cause then what point to castigating it she was young enough that such compromises with medievalism still struck her as betrayals in spite of the indoctrination shed received on the subject then she realized the jew undoubtedly thought cooking salt pork and worse yet eating it was a hideous compromise with godlessness he was wrong of course but that did not make him insincere when she got a bowl of the pork stew she blinked in amazement at the flavor he might have thought it an abomination but hed given it his best she was scrubbing out her bowl with snow when one of the camp womennot one of the ones who carried a riflecame up to her hesitantly in slow russian the woman girl really she couldnt have been more than seventeen asked you really flew that airplane against the lizards yes and against the nazis before them ludmila answered the girls eyesvery big very bluewent wide she was slim and pretty and would have been prettier if her face hadnt had a vacant cowlike expression heavens she breathed how many men did you have to screw to get them to let you do that the question was innocent candid somehow that made it worse ludmila wanted to shake her i didnt screw anybody she said indignantly i its all right the girlstefania thats what her name wasinterrupted you can tell me its not like its something important if youre a woman you have to do such things now and again everybody knows it ididntscrewanybody ludmila repeated spacing out the words as if she were talking to a halfwit plenty of men have tried to screw me i got to be a red air force pilot because id been in theosoaviakhim the state pilot training programbefore the war im good at what i do if i werent id have got killed twenty times by now stefania studied her the intent look on the polish girls face made ludmila think shed made an impression on her then stefania shook her head her blond braids flipped back and forth we know what we get from russiansnothing but lies as witold had she walked away ludmila wished she were pointing a pistol at the stupid little bitch she finished cleaning her bowl this was her second trip outside the soviet union both times shed seen how little use foreigners had for her country her immediate reaction to that was disdain foreigners had to be ignorant reactionaries if they couldnt appreciate the glorious achievements of the soviet state and its promise to bring the benefits of scientflic socialism to all mankind then she remembered the purges had her cousin her geometry teacher and the man who ran the tobacconists shop across from her block of flats truly been counterrevolutionaries wreckers spies for the trotskyites or the decadent imperialists shed wondered at the time but hadnt let herself think about it since such thoughts held danger she knew instinctively how glorious were the achievements of the soviet state if you didnt dare think about them frowning she piled her bowl with all the rest v ussmak didnt think hed ever seen such a sorrylooking male in all his days since hatchlinghood it wasnt just that the poor fellow wore no body paint although being bare of it contributed to his general air of misery worse was the way his eye turrets kept swiveling back toward the big ugly for whom he was interpreting as if that tosevite were the sun and he himself only a very minor planet this is colonel boris lidov the male said in the language of the race although the title was in the russki tongue he is of the peoples commissariat for the interiorthe nkvdand is to be your interrogator ussmak glanced over at the tosevite male for a moment he looked like a big ugly and not a particularly impressive one skinny with a narrow wrinkled face not much fur on the top of his head and a small mouth drawn up even tighter than was the tosevite norm thats nice ussmak said hed figured the big uglies would have questions for him who are you though friend how did you get stuck with this duty i am called gazzim and i was an automatic riflemale second grade before my mechanized infantry combat vehicle was destroyed and i taken prisoner the male replied now i have no rank i exist on the sufferance of the soviet union gazzim lowered his voice and now so do you surely its not so bad as that ussmak said straha the shiplord who defected claims most tosevite notempires treat captives well gazzim didnt answer lidov spoke in the local language which put ussmak in mind of the noises a male made when choking on a bite too big to swallow gazzim replied in what sounded like the same language perhaps to let the tosevite know what ussmak had said lidov put the tips of his fingers together each digit touching its equivalent on the other hand the strange gesture reminded ussmak he was indeed dealing with an alien species then the tosevite spoke in his own tongue once more gazzim translated he wants to know what you are here for i dont even know where i am let alone what for ussmak replied with more than a hint of asperity after we yielded the base to the soldiers of the sssr we were packed first into animaldrawn conveyances of some sort and then into some truly appalling railroad cars then finally into more conveyances with no way of seeing out these russkis are not living up to their agreements the way straha said they would when that was translated for him lidov threw back his head and made a peculiar barking noise he is laughing gazzim explained he is laughing because the male straha has no experience with the tosevites of the sssr and does not know what he is talking about ussmak did not care for the sound of those words he said this does not strike me as the place of honor we were promised when we agreed on surrender terms if i didnt know better i would say it reminded me of a prison lidov laughed again this time before ussmaks words were translatedhe knows some of our language ussmak thought and resolved to be more wary about what he said gazzim said the name of this place is lefortovo it is in moskva the capital of the sssr casually without even seeming to think about it lidov reached out and smacked gazzim in the snout the paintless male cringed lidov spoke loudly to him had the big ugly been a male of the race no doubt he would have punctuated his speech with emphatic coughs gazzim flinched into the posture of obedience when lidov was done the interpreter said i am to tell you that i am allowed to volunteer no further information this session is to acquire knowledge from you not to give it to you ask your questions then ussmak said resignedly and the questions beganthey came down like snow in the siberian blizzards ussmak had grown to hate at first they were the sort of questions he would have asked a tosevite collaborator whose background he did not know well questions about his military specialty and about his experience on tosev since being revived from cold sleep he was able to tell colonel lidov a lot about landcruisers crewmales of necessity had to know more than their own particular specialties so they could continue to fight their vehicles in case of casualties he talked about driving the vehicle about its suspension about its weapons about its engine from there lidov went onto ask him about the races strategy and tactics and about the other big uglies he had fought that puzzled him surely lidov was more familiar with his own kind than ussmak could hope to be gazzim said he wants you to rank each type of tosevite in order of the fighting efficiency you observed does he ussmak wanted to ask gazzim a couple of questions before directly responding to that but didnt dare not when the big ugly interrogator was likely to understand the language of the race he wondered how candid he should be did lidov want to hear his own crewmales praised or was he after real information ussmak had to guess and guessed the latter tell him the deutsche fought best the british next and then soviet males gazzim quivered a little ussmak decided hed made a mistake and wondered how bad a mistake it was the interpreter spoke in the croaking russki tongue relaying his words to colonel lidov the tosevites little mouth pursed even tighter he spoke a few words tell him why gazzim said giving no indication what if anything lidov thought of the answer your egg should have been addled instead of hatching gazzimussmak thought but having begun his course he saw no choice but to run it through to the end the deutsche keep getting new kinds of equipment each better than the last and they are tactically adaptable they are better tactically than our simulators back on home and almost always surprising lidov spoke again in the russki language he says the sssr also discovered this to their sorrow the sssr and deutschland were at peace were friends with each other and the cowardly treacherous deutsche viciously attacked this peaceloving notempire lidov said something else gazzim translated and what of the british ussmak paused to think before he answered he wondered what a deutsch male would have said about the war with the sssr something different he suspected he knew tosevite politics were far more complicated than anything he was used to but this lidov had slammed home his view of the situation like a landcruiser gunner shelling a target into submission that argued he wouldnt care to hear anything unpleasant about his own group of big uglies still his question about the british gave ussmak some time to prepare for what he would say about the sssr the former landcruiser driver who now wished hed never become anything but a landcruiser driver answered british landcruisers do not match those of deutschland or the sssr in quality british artillery though is very good and the british were first to use poisonous gases against the race also the island of britain is small and densely settled and the british showed they were very good at fighting in builtup areas they cost us many casualties on account of that taklidov said ussmak turned one eye toward gazzima question without an interrogative cough the interpreter explained this means so or well it signflies he has taken in your words but does not indicate his thoughts on them now he will want you to speak of the males of the sssr it shall be done ussmak said politely responding as if lidov were his superior i will say these russki males are as brave as any tosevites i have encountered i will also say that their landcruisers are well made with good gun good engine and especially good tracks for the wretched ground conditions so common on tosev lidovs mouth grew a little wider ussmak took that as a good sign the male from thewhat was it the nkvd that was the acronymspoke in his own language gazzim rendered his words as with all these compliments why do you place the glorious soldiers of the red army behind those of deutschland and britain ussmak realized his attempt at flattery had failed now he would have to tell the truth or at least some of it with no reason to be optimistic that lidov would be glad to hear it the males of the sssr had been skillful at breaking the rebellious siberian males into smaller and smaller groups each time with a plausible excuse now ussmak felt down to his toes how alone he really was picking his words with great care he said from what i have seen in the sssr the fighting males here have trouble changing their plans to match changing circumstances they do not respond as quickly as the deutsche or the british in that way they were much like the race which was probably why the race had had such good success against them communications also leave a good deal to be desired and your landcruisers while stoutly made are not always deployed to best advantage colonel lidov grunted ussmak didnt know much about the noises the big uglies made but that one sounded like what would have been a thoughtful hiss from a male of the race then lidov said tell me of the ideological motivations behind your rebellion against the oppressive aristocracy which had controlled you up to the point of your resistance after gazzim translated that into the language of the race ussmak let his mouth fall open in a wry laugh ideology what ideology i had a head full of ginger my crewmales had just been killed and hisslef wouldnt stop screaming at me so i shot him after that one thing led to another if i had it to do over again i probably wouldnt its been more trouble than its worth the big ugly grunted again he said everything has ideological underpinnings whether one consciously realizes it or not i congratulate you for the blow you struck against those who exploited your labor for their own selfish benefit all that did was convince ussmak that lidov didnt have the slightest idea of what he was talking about all survivors of the conquest fleetassuming there were survivors from the conquest fleet which looked imperfectly obviouswould be prominent wellestablished males on the conquered world by the time the colonization fleet arrived theyd have years of exploiting its resources the first starship full of trade goods might well have headed homeward before the colonists got here ussmak wondered how much clandestine ginger would have been aboard that first starship even if the big uglies had been the animalriding barbarians everyone thought they were tosev would have been trouble for the race thinking of ginger made ussmak wish he had a taste too colonel lidov said you will now itemize for me the ideologies of the progressive and reactionary factions in your leadership hierarchy i will ussmak said in some surprise to gazzim he went on remind this tosevitehe remembered not to call the big ugly a big uglythat i was only a landcruiser driver if you please i did not get my orders straight from the fleetlord you know gazzim spoke in the russki tongue lidov listened replied gazzim translated back the other way tell me whatever you know of these things nothing is of greater importance than ideology offhand ussmak could have come up with a whole long list of things more important than ideology topping the list at that moment would have been the ginger hed thought of a moment before he wondered why the big ugly was so obsessed with an abstraction when there were so many genuinely important things to worry about tell him im sorry but i dont know how to answer ussmak said to gazzim i was never a commander of any sort all i did was what i was told this is not good enough gazzim answered after lidov had spoken the male sounded worried he believes you are lying i must explain so you will understand why that a specflic ideological framework lies under the political structure of this notempire and serves as its center in the same way as the emperor does for us lidov did not hit gazzim as he had before evidently he wanted ussmak to have that explanation as he had been conditioned to do ussmak cast down his eyesthis in spite of having betrayed the emperor first by mutiny and then by surrender to the tosevites but he answered in the only way he could i cannot invent bogus ideological splits when i know of none gazzim let out a long hissing sigh then translated his reply for the male from the nkvd lidov flicked a switch beside his chair from behind him a brilliant incandescent lamp with a reflector in back of it glared into ussmaks face he swung his eye turrets away from it lidov flicked on other switches more lights to either side burned at ussmak the interrogation went on from there good god almighty damn mutt daniels said with reverent irreverence its the country bread me and fry me if it aint bout time they took us out o line for a while dont you think sir sergeant herman muldoon answered they never kept us in the trenches so long at a stretch in the great warnothin like what they put us through in chicago not even close nope mutt said they could afford to fool around in france they had the men an they had the initiative here in shytown we was like the germans over therewe was the ones who had to stand there and take it with whatever we could scrape together i wouldnt exactly call elgin the country to illustrate what he meant captain stan szymanski waved his arm to take in the factories that checked the towns grid of streets the wave took in what had been factories anyhow they were ruins now jagged and broken against the gray sky every one of them had been savagely bombed some were just mediumsized hills of broken bricks and rubble walls and stacks still stood on others whatever they had made though they werent making it any more the sevenstory clock tower of the elgin watch factory which had made a prime observation post was now scarcely taller than any other wreckage mutt pointed westward across the fox river but thats farm country out there yonder sir he said aint seen nothin but houses and skyscrapers and whatnot when i look out for a long time its right nice you ask me what it is lieutenant is damn fine tank country szymanski said in a voice that brooked no argument since the lizards have damn fine tanks and we dont i cant get what youd call enthusiastic about it yes sir daniels said it wasnt that szymanski wasnt righthe was it was just the way these young men born in this century looked at the world born in this century hellodds were szymanskid still been pissing his drawers when mutt climbed on a troopship to head over there but no matter how young the captain was on the outside he had a coldblooded way of evaluating things the farmland over across the river was good tank country and the lizards had good tanks so to hell with the whole landscape one of these days there might not be a war going on when mutt looked at farmland he thought about that and about what kind of crops youd get with this soil and climate and how big your yield was liable to be szymanski didnt care where they gonna billet us sir muldoon asked just off of fountain square not far from the watch factory szymanski answered were taking over a hotel that hasnt been bombed to smithereens the threestory red brick building over there he pointed fountain square yeah i been there sergeant muldoon chuckled its a triangle and it aint got no fountain great little place give me a choice between a hotel an the places we been stayin at in chicago an i aint gonna carry on a whole lot mutt said nice to lie down without worryin about whether a sniper can pick up where youre sleepin and blow your head off without you even knowin the bastard was there amen muldoon said enthusiastically sides which he glanced over at captain szymanski then decided not to go on mutt wondered what that was all about hed have to wander over to fountain square himself and see what he could see szymanski didnt notice muldoon s awkward pause he was still looking westward no matter what they do and what kind of armor they might bring up the lizards would have a tough time forcing a crossing here he observed were nicely up on the bluffs and well dug in no matter how hard they pasted us from the air wed still hurt their tanks theyd have to try flanking us out if they wanted to take this place yes sir muldoon said again the brass didnt think the lizards would be trying to take elgin any time soon or they wouldnt have sent the company here to rest and recuperate of course the brass wasnt always right about such things but for the moment no bullets were flying no cannon bellowing it was almost peaceful enough to make a man nervous come on lieutenant muldoon said ill show that there hotel and again he didnt go on he made a production of not going on what the devil had he found over by fountain square a warehouse full of lucky strikes a cache of booze that wasnt rotgut or moonshine whatever it was he sure was acting coy about it for a midwest factory town elgin looked to be a pretty nice place the blasted plants didnt make up a single district as they did so many places instead they were scattered among what had been pleasant homes till war visited them with fire and sword some of the houses the ones that hadnt been bombed or burned still looked comfortable fountain square hadnt been hit too badly maybe because none of the town buildings was tall enough to draw lizard bombers god only knew why it had the name it did because as muldoon had said it was neither square nor overburdened with fountains what looked to be a real live working saloon greeted gis with open doorsand with a couple of real live working mps inside those open doors to make sure rest and recuperation didnt get too rowdy was that what muldoon had had in mind he could have mentioned it in front of szymanski the captain didnt mind taking a drink now and then or even more often than that then mutt spotted the line of guys in grimy olive drab snaking their way down a narrow alley hed seenhell hed stood inlines like that in france they got themselves a whorehouse goin he said you betcha they do muldoon agreed with a broad grin it aint like i need to get my ashes hauled like i did when i was over in france but hell it aint like im dead neither i figure after we got our boys settled in at the hotel maybe you an me he hesitated might be they got a special house for officers the frenchies they done that over there yeah i know i remember mutt said but i doubt it though hell i didnt figure theyd set up a house atall chaplains woulda given em holy hell if theyd tried it back in times have changed lieutenant muldoon said yeah a whole bunch of different ways daniels agreed i was thinkin about that my own self not so long ago captain szymanskis was not the only company billeted at the gifford hotel along with the beds there were mattresses and piles of blankets on the floor to squeeze in as many men as possible that was fine unless the lizards scored a direct hit on the place if they did the gifford would turn into a kingsized tomb when things were going smoothly there mutt and muldoon slid outside and went back to fountain square muldoon gave daniels a sidelong look dont it bother you none to have all these horny kids watch you gettin in line with em lieutenant he asked slyly youre an officer now after all hell no mutt answered no way now they can figure i aint got any balls muldoon stared at him then broke up he started to give mutt a shot in the ribs with an elbow but thought better of it before he made contact as hed said even in a brothel line an officer was an officer the line advanced steadily mutt figured the hookers however many there were would be moving the dogfaces through as fast as they could both to make more money and to give themselves more breathers however brief between customers he wondered if thered be mps inside the place there werent which probably meant it wasnt quite official just winked at he didnt care as his foot hit the bottom of the stairway that led up to the girls he noticed nobody was coming downstairs they had a back exit then he nodded whether this crib was official or not it was certainly efficient at the top of the stairs sat a toughlooking woman with a cash boxand a presumably to keep the wages of sin from being redistributed fifty bucks she told mutt hed heard her say that a dozen times already all with the exact same intonation she might have been a broken record he dug in his hip pocket and peeled greenbacks off a roll like a lot of guys he had a pretty good wad of cash when you were up in the front lines you couldnt do much spending a big blond gi who didnt look a day over seventeen came out of one of the doors down the hall and headed sure enough toward a back stairway go on the madam told mutt thats number aint it suzies in there now anyway i know whose sloppy seconds im gettinmutt thought as he walked toward the door the kid hadnt looked like somebody with vd but what did that prove not much and who could guess whod been in there before him or before that guy or before the fellow ahead ofhim the door did have a tarnished brass on it daniels knocked inside a woman started laughing come on in she said it sure as hell aint locked suzie mutt said as he went into the room the girl dressed in a worn satin wrap sat on the edge of the bed she was about thirty with short brown hair and a lot of eye makeup but no lipstick she looked tired and bored but not particularly mean that relieved mutt some of the whores hed met had hated men so much he never could figure out why theyd lie down with them in the first place she sized him up the same way he did her after a couple of seconds she nodded and tried a smile on for size hello pops she said not unkindly you know maybe only one guy in four or five bothers with my name you ready she pointed to a basin and a bar of soap why dont you wash yourself off first it was a polite order but an order just the same mutt didnt mind suzie didnt know him from adam either while he was tending to it she shrugged the wrap off her shoulders she wasnt wearing anything underneath it she wasnt a vargas girl or anything but she wasnt bad she lay back on the narrow mattress while mutt dried himself off and got out of the rest of his clothes he couldnt tell if the moans she made while he was riding her were genuine or professional which meant odds were good they were professional she had hellacious hip action but then shed naturally try to bring him off in a hurry he would have come pretty damn quick even if shed just lain there like a dead fish hed been without for a long time as soon as he was done he rolled off her got up and went over to the basin to soap himself off again he pissed in the chamber pot by the bed tooflush the pipes he thought you dont take chances do you pops suzie said that could have come out nasty but it didnt it sounded more as if she approved of him for knowing what he was doing not a whole bunch anyways he answered reaching for his skivvies if he hadnt taken any chances he wouldnt have gone in there with her in the first place but since he had he didnt want to pay any price except the one from his bankroll suzie sat up her breasts tipped with large pale nipples bobbed as she reached for the wrap that rita out there she keeps most of what you give her the cheap bitch she said her voice calculatedly casual twenty for me sure would come in handy ive heard that song before mutt said and the hooker laughed altogether unembarrassed he gave her ten bucks even if he had heard the tune shed been pretty good and friendlier than she had to be in an assemblyline operation like this she grinned and stuck the bill under the mattress mutt had just set his hand on the doorknob when a horrible racket started outside men shouting and cursing and bellowing no what the hells goin on mutt said the question wasnt rhetorical it didnt sound like any brawl hed ever heard through the shouts came the sound of a woman weeping as if her heart would break my god suzie said quietly mutt looked back toward her she was crossing herself as if to explain she went on thats rita i didnt think rita would cry if you murdered whatever family shes got right in front of her face fists pounded not on the door but against the wall mutt went out into the hallway gis were sobbing unashamed tears cutting winding clean tracks through the dirt on their faces at the cash box rita had her head buried in her arms what the hell is going on mutt repeated the madam looked up at him her face was ravaged ancient hes dead she said somebody just brought news hes dead by the way she said it she might have been talking about her own father but if she had been none of the dogfaces would have given a damn all they were here for was a fast fuck same as mutt whos dead he asked the president rita answered at the same time as a corporal choked out fdr mutt felt as if hed been kicked in the belly he gaped for a moment his mouth falling open like a bluegills out of water then to his helpless horror he started bawling like everybody else iosef vissarionovich there is no reason to think the change in political leadership in the united states will necessarily bring on a change in american policy or in the continuation of the war against the lizards vyacheslav molotov said necessarily iosef stalin spoke the word in a nasty mocking singsong voice this is a fancy way to say you havent the faintest idea what will happen next as far as the united states is concerned molotov scribbled something on the pad he held in his lap to stalin it would look as if he was taking notes actually he was giving himself a chance to think the trouble was the general secretary was right the man who would have succeeded franklin d roosevelt henry wallace was dead killed in the lizards nuclear bombing of seattle the foreign commissariat was however quite familiar with cordell hull the new president of the united states the foreign commissar trotted out what they did know as secretary of state hull consistently supported roosevelts foredoomed effort to reinvigorate the oppressive structure of american monopoly capitalism forging trade ties with latin america and attempting financial reform as you well know he also strongly supported the president in his opposition to fascism and in his conduct of the war first against the hitlerites and then against the lizards as i say i think it reasonable to assume he will continue to carry out the policies his predecessor initiated if you want someone to carry out a policy you hire a clerk stalin said his voice dripping scorn what i want to know is what sort of policies will hull set only the event will tell us molotov replied reluctant to admit ignorance to stalin but more afraid to make a guess that would prove wrong soon enough for the general secretary to remember it with his usual efficiency he hid the resentment he felt at stalins reminding him he was hardly more than a glorflied clerk himself stalin paused to get his pipe going he puffed in silence for a couple of minutes the reek ofmakhorka cheap harsh russian tobacco filled the little room in the basement of the kremlin not even the head of the soviet union enjoyed anything better these days like everyone else stalin and molotov were getting by on borscht andshchi beet soup and cabbage soup they filled your belly and let you preserve at least the illusion that you were being nourished if you were lucky enough to be able to put meat in them every so often as the leaders of the soviet union were illusion became reality do you think the death of roosevelt will affect whether the americans send us assistance for the explosivemetal bomb project stalin asked molotov started scribbling again stalin was coming up with all sorts of dangerous questions today they were important molotov couldnt very well evade them and he couldnt afford to be wrong either at last he said comrade general secretary i am given to understand that the americans had agreed to assign one of their physicists to our project because of the increase in lizard attacks on shipping however he is coming overland by way of canada alaska and siberia i do not believe he has yet entered soviet territory or i should have been apprised of it stalins pipe emitted more smoke signals molotov wished he could read them beria claimed he could tell what stalin was thinking by the way the general secretary laughed but beria claimed a lot of things that werentnecessarilyso telling the nkvd chief as much carried its own set of risks though hoping to improve stalins mood molotov added the takeover of the lizard base near tomsk will ease our task in transporting the physicist once he does arrive on our soil if he does arrive on our soil stalin said if he is still in north america he is still subject to recall by the new regime another puff of smoke rose from the pipe the tsars were fools idiots imbeciles to give away alaska that might or might not have been true but molotov couldnt do anything about it any which way stalin often gave the impression that he thought people were persecuting him given the history of the soviet union given stalins own personal history he often had reason for that assumption butoften was notalways reminding him of that was one of the more delicate tasks presenting itself to his aides molotov felt like a man defusing a bomb carefully he said it is in the americans shortterm interest to help us defeat the lizards and when iosef vissarionovich did you ever know the capitalists to consider their longterm interest hed picked the right line stalin smiled he could when he chose look astonishingly benevolent this was one of those times spoken like a true marxistleninist vyacheslav mikhailovich we shall triumph over the lizards and then we shall proceed to triumph over the americans too the dialectic demands it molotov agreed he did not let his voice show relief any more than he had permitted himself to reveal anger or fear stalin leaned forward his face intent vyacheslav mikhailovich have you been reading the interrogation reports from the lizard mutineers who gave that base to us do you credit them can the creatures be so politically naive or is this some sort ofmaskirovka to deceive us i have indeed seen these reports comrade general secretary molotov felt relief again at last something upon which he could venture an opinion without the immediate risk of its blowing up in his face my belief is that their naivete is genuine not assumed our interrogators and other experts have learned that their history has been unitary for millennia they have had no occasion to acquire the diplomatic skills even the most inept and feckless human governmentsay for example the quasifascist clique formerly administering polandlearns as a matter of course marshal zhukov and general koniev also express this view stalin said i have trouble believing it stalin saw plots everywhere whether they were there or not had proved that the only plot he hadnt seen was hitlers in june molotov knew that going against his chiefs opinion was risky hed done it once lately and barely survived here though the stakes were smaller and he could shade his words you may well be right iosef vissarionovich but if the lizards were in fact more politically sophisticated than they have shown thus far would they not have demonstrated it with a better diplomatic performance than they have given since launching their imperialist invasion of our world stalin stroked his mustache this could be so he said musingly i had not thought of it in those terms if it is so it becomes all the more important for us to continue resistance and maintain our own governmental structure comrade general secretary now molotov didnt follow stalins eyes glowed so long as we do not lose the war comrade foreign commissar do you not think it likely we will win the peace molotov considered that not for nothing had stalin kept his grip on power in the soviet union for more than two decades yes he had shortcomings yes he made mistakes yes you were utterly mad if you pointed them out to him but most of the time he had an uncarmy knack for finding the balance of power for judging which side was strongeror could become so may it be as you say molotov answered atvar hadnt known such excitement since the last time hed smelled the pheromones of a female during mating season maybe ginger tasters knew something of his exhilaration if they did he came closer to forgiving them for their destructive addiction than he ever had before he turned one eye turret toward kirel and away from the reports and analyses still flowing across his computer screen at last he exclaimed maybe i needed to come down to the surface of this planet to change our luck that luck has been so cruel to us it is time and past time for it to begin to even out the death of the american notemperor roosevelt will surely propel our forces to victory in the northern region of the lesser continental mass exalted fleetlord may it be as you say kirel answered may it bemay it be atvar said indignantly the air of this place called egypt tasted strange in his mouth but it was warm enough and dry enough to suit himquite different from that of so much of this miserable world of course it will be it must be the big uglies are so politically naive that events cannot but transpire as we wish we have been disappointed in our hopes here so many times exalted fleetlord that i hesitate to rejoice before a desired event actually does take place kirel said sensible conservatism is good for the race atvar said a truism if ever there was one he needed kirels conservatism if kirel had been a wild radical like straha he wouldnt be fleetlord now but he went on consider the obvious shiplord the united states is not an empire is it indeed not kirel said that was indisputable atvar said and because it is not an empire it by definition cannot have the stable political arrangements we enjoy now can it that would seem to follow from the first kirel admitted caution in his voice just so atvar said joyfully and this united states has fallen under the rule of the notemperor called roosevelt thanks in part to him the american tosevites have maintained a steadfast resistance to our forces truth truth kirel said and what follows from this truth does so as inevitably as a statement in a geometric proof springs from its immediate predecessor atvar said roosevelt is now dead can his successor take his place as smoothly as one emperor succeeds another can his successors authority be quickly and smoothly recognized as legitimate without a preordained imperial succession how is this possible my answer is that it is impossible that the american tosevites are likely to undergo some severe disorders before this hull the big ugly who claims authority is able to exercise it if he ever is so also state our political analysts who have been studying tosevite societies since the beginning of our campaign here this does seem to be reasonable kirel said but reason is not always a governing factor in tosevite affairs for instance do i not remember that the american big uglies are among the minority who attempt to govern their affairs by counting the snouts of those for and against various matters of interest to them atvar had to glance back through the reports to see whether the shiplord was right when he had checked he said yes that appears to be so what of it some of these notempires use snoutcounting to confer legitimacy on leaders in the same way we use the imperial succession kirel answered this may tend to minimize the disruption that will arise in the united states as a result of the loss of roosevelt ah i see your point atvar said here though it is not valid roosevelts viceregent a male named wallace also chosen through the snoutcounting farce has predeceased him he died in our bombing of seattle no notempirewide snoutcounting has ever been perpetrated for this hull he must surely be reckoned an illegitimate usurper perhaps other wouldbe rulers of america will rise in various regions of the notempire to contest his claim if that comes to pass it would indeed be excellent kirel said i admit it does fit with what we know of tosevite history and behavior patterns but we have been disappointed so often with regard to the big uglies i find optimism hard to muster these days i understand and i agree atvar said in this case though as you note the big uglies irksome proclivities work with us not against us as they do on most occasions my opinion is that we may reasonably expect control over major areas of the notempire of the united states to fall away from its unsnoutcounted leader and that we may even be able to use the rebels who arise for our own purposes cooperating with the big uglies galls me but the potential profit in this case seems worthwhile considering the use the big uglies have got out of straha using their leaders against them strikes me as fitting revenge kirel said atvar wished kirel hadnt mentioned straha every time he thought of the shiplord whod escaped his just punishment by fleeing to the american tosevites it was as if he got an itch down under his scales where he couldnt scratch it despite that though he had to admit the comparison was fair at last he said we shall find where the limits of tosevite resilience lie surely no agglomeration of big uglies lacking the stability of the imperial form can pass from one rule to another in the midst of the stress of warfare why we would be hardpressed ourselves if during such a crisis the emperor happened to die and a less experienced male took the throne he cast down his eyes then asked truth truth kirel said leslie groves sprang to his feet and forced his bulky body into as stiff a brace as he could take mr president he said its a great honor and privilege to meet you sir sit down general cordell hull said he sat down himself across from groves in the latters office just seeing a president of the united states walk into that office jolted groves so did hulls accent a slightly lisping tennessee drawl rather than the patrician tones of fdr the new chief executive did share one thing with his predecessor though he looked desperately tired after groves was seated hull went on i never expected to be president not even after vice president wallace was killed and i knew i was next in line all i ever wanted to do was go on doing my own job the best way i knew how yes sir groves said if hed been playing poker with hull he would have said the new president was sandbagging hed been secretary of state since roosevelt became president and had been roosevelts strong right arm in resisting first the human enemies of the united states and then the invading aliens all right then hull said lets get down to brass tacks that didnt strike groves as sounding very presidential to him hull looked more like an aging smalltown lawyer than a president too grayhaired bald on top with wisps combed over to try to hide it jowly dressed in a baggy dark blue suit hed plainly been wearing for a good many years regardless of whether he looked like a president or sounded like one though he had the job that meant he was groves boss and a soldier did what his boss said whatever you need to know sir groves said now the obvious first hull answered how soon can we have another bomb and then the one after that and then one more you have to understand general that i didnt know a thing not one single solitary thing about this project until our first atomic bomb went off in chicago security isnt as tight now as it used to be either groves answered before the lizards came we didnt want the germans or the japs to have a clue that we thought atomic bombs were even possible the lizards know that much yes you might say so hull agreed his voice dry if i hadnt happened to be out of washington one fine day youd be having this conversation with someone else right now yes sir groves said we dont have to conceal from the lizards that were working on the project just where were doing it which is easier i see that the president said as may be though president roosevelt chose not to let me know till the lizards came he sighed i dont blame him or anything of the sort he had more important things to worry about and he worried about themuntil it killed him he was a very great man christhe pronounced itchwist only knows how ill fill his shoes in peacetime he would have lived longer with the weight of the countryby god general with the weight of the worldon his shoulders moving from place to place like a hunted animal he just wore out thats all there is to it that was the impression i had when he came here last year groves said nodding the strain was more than his mechanism could take but he took it anyhow for as long as he could youve hit the nail on the head hull said but speaking of nails weve forgotten about the brass tacks the bombs general groveswhen well have enough plutonium for the next one in a couple of months sir groves answered after that well be able to make several per year weve about come to the limit of what we can do here in denver without giving ourselves away to the lizards if we do need a lot more production well have to start a second facility somewhere elseand we have reasons we dont want to do that the chief one being that we dont think we can keep it secret this place is still secret hull pointed out yes sir groves agreed but we had everything set up and going here before the lizards knew we were a serious threat to build nuclear weapons theyll be a lot more alert nowand if they catch us at it they bomb us general marshall and president roosevelt never thought the risk was worth it i respect general marshalls assessment very highly general groves hull said so highly that im naming him secretary of statemy guess is hell do the job better than i ever did but he is not the commanderinchief and neither is president roosevelt not any more i am yes sir groves said cordell hull might not have expected to become president he might not have wanted to become president but now that the load had landed on his shoulders they looked to be wide enough to carry it i see two questions in the use of atomic bombs hull said the first one is are we likely to need more than we can produce here at denver and the second one related to the first is if we use all we produce and the lizards retaliate in kind will anything be left of the united states by the time the war is done they were both good questions they went right to the heart of things the only trouble was they werent the sort of questions you asked an engineer ask groves whether something could be built how long it would take and how much it would cost and hed answer in detail whether immediately or after hed gone to work with a slide rule and an adding machine but he had neither the training nor the inclination to deal with the imponderables of setting policy he gave the only answer he could i dont know sir i dont know either hull said ill want you to be prepared to split off a team from this facility to start up a new one i dont know whether ill decide to do that but if i do ill want to be able to do it as quickly and efficiently as i can yes sir groves repeated as a contingency plan what the new president proposed made good sense you wanted to keep as many options as possible open for as long as you could good hull said taking it for granted that groves would do as hed been told the president stabbed out a blunt forefinger general im still getting into harness here what should i know about this place that maybe i dont groves chewed on that for a minute or so before he tried answering it was another good question but also another openended one he didnt know what hull did or didnt know at last he said mr president it could be that nobodys told you weve detached one of our physicists from the facility and sent him off to the soviet union to help the russians with their atomic project no i didnt know that hull clicked his tongue between his teeth why do the russians need help they set off their atomic bomb before we did before the germans before anybody yes sir but they had help groves explained how the russians had built that bomb out of nuclear material captured from the lizards and how some of that same material had also helped the germans and the united states he finished but weand the nazis too by the look of thingshave been able to figure out how to make more plutonium on our own the russians dont seem to have managed that isnt that interesting hull said under any other circumstances i cant think of anybody id less rather see with the atomic bomb than stalinunless its hitler he laughed unhappily and now hitler has it and if we dont help stalin then odds are the lizards beat him all right were helping him blow the lizards to kingdom come if we win that one then we worry about him trying to blow us to kingdom come too meanwhile i dont see what choice we have but to help him what else is there that i ought to know that was the most important thing i could think of sir groves said and then a moment later may i ask you a question mr president go ahead and ask hull said i reserve the right not to answer groves nodded of course i was just wondering its sir how are we going to hold an election this november with the lizards occupying so much of our territory well probably hold it the same way we held congressional elections november before last hull answered which is to say we probably wont the officials we have will go on doing their jobs for the duration and that looks like it will include me he snorted im going to stay unelected a good while longer general its not the way id like it but its the way things are if we win this war the supreme court is liable to have a field day afterwards but if we lose it what those nine old men in black robes think will never matter again ill take the chance of their crucifying me so long as i can put them in a position of being able to do so what do you think of that general from an engineering standpoint it strikes me as the most economical solution sir groves answered i dont know for a fact whether its the best one i dont either hull said but it looks like its what were going to do the old romans had dictators in emergencies and they always thought the best ones were the ones most reluctant to take over i qualify there no two ways about it he got to his feet he wasnt very young and he wasnt very spry but he did manage again seeing a president not only upright but mobile in that position reminded groves things would never be the same again good luck sir he said thank you general ill take all of that i can get hull started to walk toward the door then stopped and looked back at groves do you remember what churchill told roosevelt when lendlease was just getting rolling give us the tools and we will finish the job thats what the united states needs from the metallurgical laboratory give us the tools youll have them groves promised the white cliffs of dover stretched a long way and curved as they did if oneor even twowalked along them that oneor those twocould look down at the sea crashing against the base of those cliffs david goldfarb had read somewhere that if the wave action continued with no other factor to check it in some millions of yearshe couldnt remember how manythe british isles would disappear and the waters of the north sea and the atlantic commingle when he said that aloud naomi kaplan raised an eyebrow the british isles have plenty of things to worry about before millions of years go by she said the wind from off the north sea tried to blow her words away it did the same for her hat she saved that with a quick grab and set it more firmly on her head goldfarb didnt know whether to be glad shed caught it or sorry he hadnt had the chance to be gallant and chase it down of course the wind might have turned and flung it over the cliff which wouldnt have done his chances for gallantry much good feigning astonishment he said why what ever can you mean just because weve been bombed by the germans and invaded by the lizards in the past few years he waved airily mere details now if wed had one of those atomic bombs or whatever theyre called dropped on us the way berlin did god forbid naomi said youre right weve been through quite enough already her accentuppercrust british laid over germanfascinated him a good many things about her fascinated him but he concentrated on the accent for the moment it was a refined version of his own lowermiddleclass english laid over the yiddish hed spoken till he started grammar school i hope youre not too chilly he said the weather was brisk especially so close to the sea but not nearly so raw as it had been earlier in the winter you no longer needed to be a wildeyed optimist to believe spring would get around to showing up one of these days even if not right away naomi shook her head no its all right she said as if to give the lie to her words the wind tried to flip up the plaid wool skirt she wore she smiled wryly as she grabbed at it to keep it straight thank you for inviting me to go walking with you thanks for coming he answered a lot of the chaps who visited the white horse inn had invited naomi to go walking with them some had invited her to do things a great deal cruder than that shed turned everybody downexcept goldfarb his own teeth were threatening to chatter but he wouldnt admit even to himself that he was cold it ispleasanthere naomi said picking the adjective with care before i came to dover i had never seen never imagined cliffs like this mountains i knew in germany but never cliffs at the edge of the land straight down for a hundred meters and more and then nothing but the sea glad you like them goldfarb said as pleased as if he were personally responsible for dovers most famous natural feature its hard to find a nice place to take a girl these daysno cinema without electricity for instance and how many girls did you take to the cinema and other nice places when there was electricity naomi asked she might have made the question sound teasing david would have been easier about it if she had but she sounded both curious and serious he couldnt fob her off with a light casual answer either if he tried that she could get the straight goodsor a large chunk of themfrom sylvia he hadnt taken sylvia to the cinema either hed taken her to bed she was friendly enough to him now when he dropped into the white horse inn for a pint but he couldnt guess what sort of character shed give him if naomi asked hed heard women could be devastatingly candid when they talked with each other about mens shortcomings when be didnt answer right away naomi cocked her head to one side and gave him a knowing look that made him feel about two feet high but instead of pounding away at him on the point as hed expected her to do she said sylvia tells me you did something very brave to get one of yourwas it a cousin she wasnt sureout of poland does she he said in glad surprise maybe sylvia hadnt given him such a bad character after all he shrugged having been born in england hed taken as his own at least part of the notion of british reserve but if naomi already knew some of the story telling more wouldnt hurt he went on yes my cousin is moishe russie remember i told you that back at the pub she nodded yes you did the one who broadcast on the wireless for the lizardsand then against them after hed seen what they truly were thats right goldfarb said and they caught him too and clapped him in gaol in lodz till they figured out what to do with him i went over with a few other chaps and helped get him out and spirited him back here to england you make it sound so simple naomi said werent you frightened that fight had been his first taste of ground combat even if it had only been against lizard and polish prison guards too taken by surprise to put up all the resistance they might have since then hed got sucked into the infantry when the lizards invaded england that had been much worse he couldnt for the life of him imagine why some men presumably in their right minds chose the infantry as a career he realized he hadnt answered naomis question frightened he said as a matter of fact i was ruddy petrflied to his relief she nodded again hed been afraid his candor would put her off when you tell me things like this she said you remind me you are not an englishman after all not many english soldiers would admit to anyone who is not one of theirwhat do you call them their mates that is itthat they feel fear or much of anything else yes ive seen that goldfarb said i dont understand it either he laughed but what do i know im only a jew whose parents got out of poland i wont understand englishmen down deep if i live to be ninety which doesnt strike me as likely the way the world wags these days maybe my grandchildren will have the proper stiff upper lip and my parents got me out of germany just in time naomi said her shiver had nothing to do with the sea breeze it was bad there and we escaped before thekristallnacht what she hesitated perhaps nerving herself after a moment she finished the question what was it like in poland goldfarb considered that you have to remember the nazis had been out of lodz for a year more or less before i went in there she nodded he went on keeping that in mind i think about what i saw there and i try to imagine how it was when the germans were there nunaomi prodded he sighed his breath smoked in the chilly air from everything i saw from everything i heard there might not be any jews left alive there by now if the lizards hadnt come i didnt see all of poland of course only lodz and the road to and from the sea but there might not be any jews left in the whole country if the lizards hadnt come when the germans saidjudenfrei they werent joking naomi bit her lip this is what i have heard on the wireless hearing it from someone i know who has seen it with his own eyes makes it more real her frown deepened and the germans the wireless says are pushing deeper into poland again i know ive heard that too my friendsmygoyishe friendscheer when they hear news like that when i hear it i dont know what to think the lizards cant win the war but the bloody nazis cant either shouldnt naomi said with the precision of one who had learned english from the outside instead of growing up with it they can the lizards can the germans can they shouldnt she laughed bitterly when i was a little girl going to school before hitler came to power they taught me i was a german i believed it too isnt that peculiar thinking about it now its more than peculiar its goldfarb groped for the word he wanted what do they call those strange paintings where its raining loaves of bread or you see a watch dribbling down a block as if it were made of ice and melting surreal naomi said at once yes that is it that is it exactly mea german she laughed again then stood to attention her right arm rigidly outstretchedein volk ein reich ein fuhrer she thundered in what wasnt the worst imitation of hitler hed ever heard he thought it was meant for a joke maybe shed thought the same thing when she started it but as her arm fell limp to her side she stared at it as if it had betrayed her her whole body sagged her face twisted she began to cry goldfarb took her in his arms its all right he said it wasnt all right they both knew it wasnt all right but if you let yourself think too much about the way it was how could you go on doing what needed doing with that thought david realized he was closer to understanding the british stiff upper lip than hed imagined naomi clung to him as if he were a life preserver and she a sailor on a ship that had just taken a torpedo from a uboat he held her with something of the same desperation when he tilted her face up to kiss her he found her mouth waiting she moaned deeply in her throat and put her hand on the back of his head pulling him to her it might have been the oddest kiss hed ever known it didnt stir him to lust as so many less emphatic kisses with girls about whom he cared less had done yet he was glad to have it and sorry when it was over i ought to walk you back to your digs he said yes maybe you should naomi answered you can meet my mother and father if you like hed fought the lizards gun to gun would he quail from such an invitation now by the slimmest of margins he didnt capital he said doing his best to sound casual naomi slipped her arm in his and smiled up at him as if hed just passed a test maybe he had a large group of darkskinned big uglies formed ragged lines on a grassy meadow next to the florida air base teerts watched another tosevite of the same color stomp his way out in front of them the pilot shivered in his nononsense stride and fierce features the big ugly with three stripes on each sleeve of his upperbody covering reminded him of major okamoto whod been his interpreter and keeper while the nipponese held him captive the male with the stripes on his sleeve shouted something in his own language tennhut was what it sounded like to teerts the rest of the tosevites sprang to stiff verticality their arms pressed tight against their sides given teerts forwardslung posture that only made them seem more ridiculous to him but it seemed to satisfy or at least to mollify the big ugly with the striped upperbody covering that male shouted again a whole string of gibberish this time teerts had picked up a good deal of nipponese in captivity but it didnt help him understand the florida locals the empires three worlds all used the same language encountering a planet where tens of different tongues were spoken required a distinct mental leap for males of the race the darkskinned big uglies marched this way and that across the grassy field obeying the commands the male with the stripes gave them even their feet went back and forth in the same rhythm when that didnt happen the male in command screamed abuse at those who were derelict teerts did not have to be a savant of otherspecies psychology to figure out that the commanding male was imperfectly pleased he turned to another male of the race who was also watching the tosevites at their evolutions the fellow wore the body paint of an intelligence specialist his equivalent rank was about the same as teerts the pilot asked can we truly trust these big uglies to fight on our behalf our analysis is that they will fight bravely the male from intelligence said the other local tosevites so mistreated them that they will see us as a superior alternative to the continued authority of the lighterskinned big uglies teerts tried to place the other males voice you are aaatos not so he asked hesitantly truth the male answered and you are teerts unlike teerts his voice held no doubts if he didnt know who was who around the base he wouldnt be earning his keepor preserving intelligences reputation for omniscience that reputation had taken a beating since the race came to tosev a lot of reputations had taken a beating since the race came to tosev teerts said i hope you will forgive me but i will always be nervous in the presence of armed big uglies we have given arms to the natives of other parts of this planet and from what i have heard the results have often left much to be desired he could think of no politer way to say that the big uglies had the habit of turning their guns against the race aaatos said truth again but went on we are improving control procedures and will not permit these tosevites to travel independently in large numbers while under arms we shall always use signflicant cadres of males of the race with them they are intended to supplement our security details not to supplant them thus we shall not be troubled by embarrassments such as the ones you mentionthe case of poland springs prominently to mind polandyes that is one of the names i have heard teerts said he would have had trouble placing it on a map but for manchukuo and nippon which he knew in detail more intimate than he had ever wanted to acquire his familiarity with tosevite geography was limited nothing like that can happen here aaatos said and gave an emphatic cough to show he meant it may you be proved correct teerts let it go at that what he had seen on tosev left him convinced of two things that the big uglies were more devious than most males of the race could grasp till they got their snouts rubbed in the fact and that trying to convince those males of that fact before their snouts were rubbed in it was a losing proposition from the start out on the meadow the big uglies marched and marched now reversing their course now shifting at right angles the male with stripes on his sleeves marched right along with them berating them into performance ever more nearly perfect eventually all of their legs were moving as if under the control of a single organism this is intriguing to watch teerts said to aaatos but what is its function any males who implemented these tactics in actual ground combat would be quickly destroyed even i a killercraft pilot know males are supposed to spread wide and seek cover this is only common sense he let his mouth fall open not that common sense is common among the big uglies this marching i am given to understand promotes group solidarity among the tosevites the male from intelligence answered i do not understand exactly why this is so but that it is so appears undeniable every native military uses similar disciplinary techniques one theory currently popular as to the reason why is that the big uglies being a species less inherently disciplined than the race employ these procedures to inculcate order and conformity to commands teerts thought about that it made more sense than a lot of theories hed heard from intelligence that didnt necessarily mean it was truenothing necessarily meant anything on tosev as far as he could tellbut he didnt have to keep from laughing in aaatos face he went back to watching the marching tosevites after a while they stopped marching and stood in a neat grid still stiffly erect as the male with stripes on his sleeves harangued them every so often they would break in with chorused responses do you understand their language teerts asked aaatos what are they saying their leader is describing the attributes of the fighting males he wants them to become aaatos said he is asking them whether they desire to possess and do possess these attributes they answer in the affirmative yes i can see that they might teerts said we have never had cause to doubt the fighting attributes of the tosevites but still i persist in wondering will these attributes be employed for us or against us in the end i do not think the danger is so great as you fear aaatos said and in any case we must take the chance or risk losing the war teerts had never heard it put so bluntly he started worrying in earnest vi one of the nice things about lamar colorado was that when youd gone a mile past the outskirts of town the place might as well not have existed there was nothing but you the prairie a million stars shining down on you from a sky clearer and blacker than the sky had any business beingand the person whod walked a mile past the outskirts of town with you penny summers snuggled against rance auerbach and said i wish id joined the cavalry the way rachel did then id be riding out with you tomorrow instead of staying stuck back here he slipped his arm around her waist im glad youre not he answered if i were giving you orders it wouldnt be fair for me to do something like this he bent down and kissed her the kiss went on for a long time you wouldnt need to give me orders to get me to want to do that she said breathlessly when their lips separated at last i like it then she kissed him hoo he said after a whilea noisy exhalation that sent breath smoking from his lungs spring was coming but the nights didnt know it yet that it was cold gave him another excuse to hold her tight against him after one more kiss penny threw back her head and stared up at the night sky through halfclosed eyelids she couldnt have sent him a fancier invitation if shed had one engraved the sweet curve of her neck was pale as milk in the starlight he started to bend to kiss it then checked himself she noticed that her eyes opened all the way again whats the matter she asked her voice no longer throaty but a little cross its chilly out here he said which was true but only part of an answer now she exhaledindignantly wouldnt bethat chilly she said specially while we were doinyou know he wanted her they both had on long heavy coats but he knew she knew she wouldnt have needed to be the heroine in the story of the princess and the pea to tell but even though she wasnt under his command hauling her denims down and screwing her in the dirt wasnt what he had in mind no matter how much hed been thinking about it when hed asked her to go walking with him he tried to put that into words so it would make sense to him as well as to her doesnt seem quite fair somehow not when you were so poorly for so long i want to make sure youre all right before ibefore i what if all hed wanted to do was lay her that would have been simple crazy how being interested in her as herself made himnot less interested in her as a naked girl but not so interested in that just for its own sake she didnt get it im fine she said indignantly yeah it hit me hard when my pa got killed but im over that now im as good as im ever going to be okay he said he didnt want to argue with her but when people went from down in the dumps to up in the clouds too darn quick that didnt mean they got off the roller coaster and stayed up there from what hed seen the ride kept right on going well then she said as if it were all settled look heres what well do he told her wait till i come back from this next mission thatll be plenty of time to do whatever we want to doand youll have had more of a chance to sort yourself out make sure youre not just throwing yourself at the first guy whos handy she pouted but youre going away for a long time rachel says this next mission isnt just a little raid she says youre going out to try and wreck one of the lizards spaceships she shouldnt have told you that auerbach answered security came natural to him hed been a soldier all his adult life he knew penny wouldnt run off and blab to the lizards but who else had rachel told about the planned strike and who had they told the idea of humans collaborating with the lizards had been slow to catch on in the united states at least in the parts that were still free but such things did happen rachel and penny both knew about them yet rachel had talked anyway that wasnt so good maybe she shouldnt have but she did so i know about it penny said with a toss of the head that seemed to addso there what if i go and find somebody else while youre gone mr rance auerbach sir what about then he wanted to laugh here he was trying to be careful and sensible and where was it getting him into hot water he said if you do that you wouldnt want to tell him about a time like this would you she glared at him you think youve got all the answers dont you shut up he said he didnt aim to stop a fight or to make one worse he spoke the words in a tone of voice entirely different from the one hed been using penny started to reply sharply but then she too heard the distant roar in the sky it grew louder with hideous speed those are lizard planes aint they she said as if hoping hed contradict her he wished he could they sure are he said more than ive heard in a while too usually they fly higher when theyre on their way to a target then go down low to hit it dont know why theyre acting different this time unless before he could finish the sentence antiaircraft guns east of lamar and then in the town itself started pounding away tracers and shell bursts lit up the night sky dimming the multitude of stars even well outside of lamar the din was overwhelming shrapnel started pattering down like hot jagged hail if that stuff came down on your head you could end up with a fractured skull auerbach wished he were wearing a tin hat when you took a pretty girl out for a walk though you didnt worry about such things he never saw the lizard warplanes till after theyd bombed and rocketed lamar and then only the flames shooting out of their tailpipes after their run they stood on their tails and climbed like skyrockets he counted nine of them in three flights of three ive got to get back he said and started toward lamar at a trot penny came right with him her shoes at first thumping on dirt and then clunking along the blacktop like his the lizard planes returned to lamar before the two of them got there they gave the town another pounding then streaked off toward the east the antiaircraft guns kept firing long after they were gone that was a universal constant of air raids from everything auerbach had seen and heard another constant was that even when the guns were blazing away at real live targets they hardly ever hit them penny was panting and gasping before she and auerbach got to the outskirts of lamar but she gamely stayed with him he said go on over to the infirmary why dont you theyre sure to need extra hands there okay she answered and hurried off he nodded to her back even if she remembered later on that she was supposed to be mad at him it was better to see her up and doing things than tucked away in her miserable little room with nothing but a bible for company no sooner had she disappeared round a corner than he forgot all about her he made his way toward the barracks through chaos in the streets bucket brigades poured water on the fires the air attack had started some of those fires would burn for a long time and were liable to spread lamar depended on wells for its water these days and well water and buckets werent going to be enough to douse the flames wounded men and women cried and screamed so did wounded horsesat least one bomb had hit the stables some of the horses had got out they were running through the streets shying from the fires lashing out in panic with their hooves and making life more difficult for the people who were trying to help them and help put lamar back together captain auerbach sir somebody bawled right in rances ear he jumped and whirled around his secondincommand lieutenant bill magruder stood at his elbow the firelight showed magruders face covered with so much soot he might have been in blackface he said glad to see youre in one piece sir im okay auerbach said nodding absurdly he felt guilty for not having been on the receiving end of the punishment the lizards had dished out whats the situation here that was as discreet a way as he could find of saying he didnt have the slightest idea what the hell was going on sir not to put too fine a point on it weve taken a hell of a licking men horses he waved at a horse that ran past its mane smoldering the ammo weve been stockpiling got hit goddamn hard too those bastards never pounded on lamar like this before he stuck his hands on his hips as if to say the lizards had no business pulling a rabbit out of a hat auerbach understood that because the aliens didnt do new things very often you could get the idea they never did anything new at all if you did though it might be the last mistake you ever made losing the ammunition hurt we can forget about tomorrows mission sounds like auerbach said im afraid so captain magruder grimaced be a while before we can think about it again too his soft virginia accent made him sound all the more mournful dont know whats going on with production but getting the stuff from one place to another isnt easy any more tell me something i dont know auerbach said he slammed a fist into the side of his thigh damn it if we could have blown up one of their spaceships we really would have given them something to think about i know it too magruder answered somebodys got to do iti agree with you there just doesnt look like its going to be us he quoted a military maxim no plan survives contact with the enemy and isnt that the sad and sorry truth auerbach said the enemy that dirty dog he goes and has plans of his own he laughed even if it hurt you just cant trust the son of a bitch that way sure cant magruder looked around at the wreckage that had been lamar other thing is his plan tonight it worked out fine lamar was a mess no two ways about it isnt that the truth auerbach said again thezeks whod been up at thegulag near petrozavodsk for a while described the weather as nine months of winter and three of bad skiing and they were russians used to winters far worse than david nussboym was he wondered if the sun ever came out if the snow ever stopped falling nights were bad even with a fire in the stove in the center of the barracks it stayed bitterly cold nussboym was a new fish a political prisoner as opposed to an ordinary thief and a jew to boot that earned him a toplevel bunk far away from the stove and right next to the poorly chinked wall so that a frigid draft constantly played on his back or his chest it also earned him the duty of getting up and feeding the stove coal dust in the middle of the nightand earned him a beating if he stayed asleep and let everyone else get as cold as he usually was shut your mouth you damnedzhid or youll be denied the right to correspondence one of theblatnye the thieveswarned him when he groaned after a kick in the ribs as if i have anyone to write to he said later to ivan fyodorov whod made the trip to the same camp and who being without connections among theblatnye himself also had an unenviable bunk site naive as the russian was though he understood camp lingo far better than nussboym did you are a dumbzhid he said without the malice with which theblatnoy had loaded the word if youre deprived of the right to correspond that means youre too dead to write to anybody anyhow oh nussboym said in a hollow voice he hugged his ribs and thought about reporting to sick call brief consideration was plenty to make him discard that idea if you tried to report sick and the powers that be werent convinced you got a new beating to go with the one youd just had if they were convinced the borscht andshchi in the infirmary were even thinner and more watery than the horrible slop they fed ordinaryzeks maybe the theory was that sick men couldnt digest anything with actual nourishment in it whatever the theory if you werent badly sick when you went into the infirmary odds were you would be by the time you got outif you got out alive he huddled in his clothes under the threadbare blanket and did his best to ignore both the pain in his ribs and the lice that swarmed over him everybody had lice there was no point in getting upset about itexcept that it disgusted him hed never thought of himself as particularly fastidious but his standards he was learning differed from those of thegulag eventually he drifted down into a light uneasy sleep the horn that announced morning roll call made him jerk as if hed grabbed hold of an electrflied fencenot that the camp near petrozavodsk boasted any such luxury barbed wire being reckoned plenty to contain the likes of him coughing and grunting and grumbling under their breaths thezeks lined up so the guards could count them and make sure no one had vanished into thin air it was still black as pitch outside and cold as the devils wife as the russians said petrozavodsk the capital of the karelian soviet socialist republic lay well north of leningrad some of the guards couldnt count their fingers and get the same answer twice running too all that made roll call even longer and more miserable than it might have been otherwise the guards didnt much care they had warm clothes warm barracks and plenty to eat why should they worry when it left the camp kitchen theshchi nussboym gulped down might have been hot by the time it got ladled from the pot into his tin cup it was tepid going on cold in another fifteen minutes it would be cabbageflavored ice he got a lump of hard coarse black bread to go with itthe regulation ration not enough he ate some and stuck the rest in the knee pocket of his padded pants for later now im ready to go out and chop wood he declared in a ringing voice that would have sounded false even if hed just feasted on all the beefsteak and eggs he could hold some of thezeks those who understood his polish laughed itwas funny it would have been even funnier if what hed just eaten hadnt been starvation rations even for a man who didnt have to do hard physical labor work detail the guards bawled they sounded as if they hated the prisoners theyd have to watch likely they did even if they didnt have to work they did have to go out into the cold forest instead of back to the barracks along with the rest of the men in his gang nussboym shuffled over to get an axe a big clumsy one with a heavy handle and a dull blade the russians would have got more labor from thezeks had they given them better tools but they didnt seem to care about such things if you had to work a little longer you had to work a little longer and if you lay down in the snow and died another prisoner would take your place come morning as thezeks slogged out toward the forest nussboym thought of a riddle hed heard one german guard in lodz tell another and translated it into a soviet equivalent an airplane carrying stalin molotov and beria crashes no one lives who is saved ivan fyodorovs brow furrowed if no one lives how can anybody be saved its a joke fool one of the otherzeks hissed he turned to nussboym all right jew ill bite who the russian people nussboym answered fyodorov still didnt get it the other zeks pinched narrow face stretched to accommodate a grin not bad he said as if that were a major concession you want to watch your mouth though tell that one where too many politicals can hear it and one of emll rat on you to the guards nussboym rolled his eyes im already here what else can they do to me ha the otherzek snorted laughter i like that after a moments thought he stuck out his gloved hand anton mikhailov like most prisoners in the camp he didnt bother with patronymics david aronovich nussboym nussboym answered trying to stay polite hed been able to make himself prominent in the lodz ghetto maybe he could manage the same magic here come on shouted stepan rudzutak the gang boss we dont make our quota we starve even worse than usual dastepan the prisoners chorused they sounded resigned they were resigned the ones whod been in thegulags since or even longer more so than new fish like nussboym even the regular camp ration wasnt enough to keep a man strong if they cut it because you didnt meet your norm pretty soon theyd throw you in the snow to keep till the ground got soft enough for them to bury you anton mikhailov grunted and if we work like a pack of stakhanovites we starve then too which ismeshuggeh nussboym said you did get your bread ration increased if you overfulfilled your quota mikhailov was right about that but you didnt come close to getting enough extra to make up for the labor you had to expend to achieve that overfulfillment coming close enough to quota to earn regular rations was hard enough six and a half cubic yards of wood per man per day wood had been something nussboym took for granted when he was burning it producing it was something else again you talk like azhid zhid mikhailov said above the face cloth he wore to keep his nose and mouth from freezing his gray eyes twinkled nussboym shrugged like fyodorov mikhailov spoke without much malice snow drifted around treetrunks high as a mans chest nussboym and mikhailov stomped it down with theirvalenki without the thick felt boots nussboyms feet would have frozen off in short order if you didnt have decent boots you couldnt do anything even the nkvd guards understood that much they didnt want to kill you right away they wanted to get work out of you first once they got the snow down below their knees they attacked the pine with their axes nussboym had never chopped down a tree in his life till he landed in karelia if he never chopped down another one that would suit him fine no one cared what he thought of course if he didnt chop wood theyd dispose of him without hesitation and without remorse he was still awkward at the work the cottonpadded mittens he wore didnt help with that although like thevalenki they did keep him from freezing as he worked even without them though he feared the axe would still have turned every so often in his inexpert hands so that he hit the trunk with the flat of the blade rather than the edge whenever he did it it jolted him all the way up to the shoulder the axe handle might have been possessed by a swarm of bees clumsy fool mikhailov shouted at him from the far side of the pine then he did it himself and jumped up and down in the snow howling curses nussboym was rude enough to laugh out loud the tree began to sway and groan as their cuts drew nearer each other then all at once it toppled look out they both yelled to warn the rest of the gang to get out of the way if the pine fell on the guards too damn bad but they scattered too the thick snow muffled the noise of the pines fall although several branches heavy with ice snapped off with reports like gunshots mikhailov clapped his mittened hands together nussboym let out a whoop of glee less work for us they exclaimed together theyd have to trim the branches from the tree any that broke off of their own accord made life easier in thegulag not much did that what they still had left to trim was quite bad enough finding where the branches were wasnt easy in the snow lopping them off wasnt easy dragging them through the soft powder to the pile where everybody was stacking branches was plenty to make your heart think it would burst good luck nussboym said the parts of him exposed to the air were frozen under his padded jacket and trousers though he was wet with sweat he pointed to the snow still clinging to the green sapfilled wood of the pine boughs how can you burn those in this weather mostly you dont the otherzek answered used to be youd just get them to smoke for a while so the guards would be happy and say youd fulfilled your norm there but the lizards have a habit of bombing when they spot smoke so now we dont do that any more nussboym didnt mind standing around and talking but he didnt want to stiffen up either come on lets get a saw he said the quicker we are the better the chance for a good one the best saw had redpainted handles it was there for the taking but nussboym and mikhailov left it alone that was the saw stepan rudzutak and the assistant gang boss a kazakh named usmanov would use nussboym grabbed another one he remembered as being pretty good mikhailov nodded approval they carried the saw over to the fallen tree back and forth back and forth bend a little more as the cut got deeper make sure you jerk your foot out of the way so the round of wood doesnt mash your toe then move down the trunk a third of a meter and do it again then again and again after a while you might as well be a piston in a machine the work left you too busy and too worn for thought break for lunch rudzutak shouted nussboym looked up in dull amazement was half the day gone already the cooks helpers were grumbling at having to leave the nice warm kitchens and come out to feed the work gangs too far away to come in and they were yelling at thezeks to hurry up and feed their ugly faces so these precious delicate souls could get back in away from the chill some of the men in the work gang screamed abuse at the cooks helpers nussboym watched rudzutak roll his eyes he was a new fish here but hed learned better than that in the lodz ghetto turning to mikhailov he said only a fool insults a man whos going to feed him youre not as dumb as you look after all the russian answered he ate his soupit wasntshchi this time but some vile brew of nettles and other weedsin a hurry to get whatever vestigial warmth remained then took a couple of bites out of his chunk of bread and stuck the rest back in the pocket of his trousers nussboym ate all his bread when he got up to go back to his saw he found hed gone stiff that happened every day near enough a few minutes at the saw cured it back and forth back and forth bend lower jerk your foot move down the trunkhis mind retreated when rudzutak yelled for the gang to knock off for the day he had to look around to see how much wood hed cut plenty to make quota for him and mikhailovand the rest of the gang had done fine too they loaded the wood onto sledges and dragged it back toward the camp a couple of guards rode with the wood thezeks didnt say a word it would have been their necks if they had maybe theyll mix some herring in with the kasha tonight mikhailov said nussboym nodded as he trudged along it was something to look forward to anyhow someone knocked on the door to liu hans little chamber in the peking roominghouse her heart leaped within her nieh hoting had been out of the city for a long time what with one thing and another she knew hed been dickering with the japanese which revolted her but she hadnt been able to argue him out of it before he left he put what he thought of as military necessity before anything else even her he was honest about it at any rate given that she could accept that he wouldnt yield to her and yet go on caring about him most men from all shed seen would promise you theyd never do something go ahead and do it anyway and then either deny that theyd promised or that theyd done it or bothusually both she thought with a curl of her lip the knock came again louder and more insistent she scrambled to her feet if nieh was knocking like that maybe he hadnt bedded down with the first singsong girl hed seen after his prong got heavy if so that spoke well for himand meant she ought to be extra grateful now smiling she hurried to the door lifted the bar and opened it wide but it wasnt nieh standing in the hall it was his aide hsia shoutao the smile slid from her face she made haste to stand straight like a soldier abandoning the saucy tilt to her hip that shed put on for nieh too late hsias broad ugly features twisted into a lecherous grin what a finelooking woman you are he said and spat on the floor of the hall he never let anyone forget he was a peasant by birth and took any slight trace of polite manners as a bourgeois affectation and probably the sign of counterrevolutionary thought what do you want liu han asked coldly she knew the most probable answer to that but she might have been wrong there was at least a chance hsia had come up here on party business rather than in the hope of sliding his proud pestle into her jade gate she didnt stand aside to let him into the room but he came in anyway he was blocky and broadshouldered and strong as a bullockwhen he moved forward he would walk right over you if you didnt get out of his way still trying to keep his voice sweet though he said you did a fine job helping to blow up the little scaly devils with those bombs in the gear the animalshow men used that was clever and i admit it that was also a long time ago now liu han said why pick this time to come and give me a compliment any time is a good time hsia shoutao answered casually he kicked the door shut behind him liu han knew exactly what that meant she started to worry not many people were in the roominghouse in the middle of the afternoon she wished she hadnt opened the door hsia went on ive had my eye on you for a long time do you know that liu han knew it only too well she said i am not your woman i am partnered to nieh hoting maybe that would make him remember he had no business being up here sniffing after her he did respect nieh and did do as nieh ordered himwhen those orders had nothing to do with women at any rate hsia laughed liu han did not think it was funny hsia said he is a good communist nieh is he will not mind sharing what he has with no more ado than that he lunged at her she tried to push him away he laughed againhe was much stronger than she was he bent his face down to hers when he tried to kiss her she tried to bite him without any visible show of anger he slapped her in the face his erection big and thick rammed against her hipbone he shoved her down onto the thick pile of bedding in a corner of the room got down beside her and started puffing off her black cotton trousers in pain half stunned for a moment she lay still and unresisting her mind flew back to the bad days aboard the little scaly devils airplane that never came down when the little devils had brought men into her metal cell and theyd had their way with her whether she wanted them or not she was a woman the scaly devils starved her if she did not give in what could she do then shed been able to do nothing except yield shed been altogether in the little scaly devils powerand shed been an ignorant peasant woman who knew no better than to do whatever was demanded of her she wasnt like that any more instead of fear and submission what shot through her was rage so raw and red she marveled it didnt make her explode hsia shoutao yanked her trousers off over her ankles and flung them against the wall then he pulled down his own just halfway the head of his organ rampantly free of its foreskin slapped liu hans bare thigh she brought up her knee and rammed it into his crotch as hard as she could his eyes went wide and round as a foreign devils with white all around the iris he made a noise half groan half scream and folded up on himself like a pocketknife his hands clutching the precious parts shed wounded if she gave him any chance to recover hed hurt her badly maybe even kill her careless that she was naked from the waist down she scrambled away from him snatched a long sharp knife out of the bottom drawer of the chest by the window and went back to touch the edge of the blade to his thick bulllike neck you bitch you whore you he took one hand away from his injured privates to try to knock her aside she bore down on the blade blood trickled from the cut hold very stillcomrade she hissed loading what should have been an honored title with every ounce of scorn she could if you think i wouldnt like to see you dead youre even stupider than i give you credit for hsia froze liu han pressed the knife in a little deeper anyhow careful he said in a tiny strangled voice the more he made his throat move the more the knife cut him why should i be careful she snarled it was she realized a good question the longer this tableau held the better the odds hsia shoutao would find a way to turn the tables on her killing him now would make sure he didnt if she left him alive shed have to move fast while he was still too shocked and in too much pain to think clearly are you ever going to do that to me again she demanded he started to shake his head but that made the knife blade move in his flesh too no he whispered she started to ask if he would ever do such a thing to any other woman again but changed her mind before the words crossed her lips he would say no to that too but he would undoubtedly be lying thinking of one lie would make it easier for him to think of others instead she said get on your hands and kneesslowly dont do anything to get yourself bled out like a pig he managed he was awkward not just because of his battered testicles but also because his trousers were still in disarray impeding his movement that was one of the things liu han counted on even if he wanted to grab her having his pants around his ankles would slow him up she took the knife away from his neck stuck it in the small of the back now crawl to the door she said if you think you can knock me down before i shove this all the way in go ahead and try hsia shoutao crawled at liu hans order he pulled the door open and crawled out into the hall she thought about kicking him again as he left but decided not to after the humiliation from that she would have to kill him he hadnt cared what humiliation he might visit on her but she couldnt afford to be so cavalier she slammed the door after him let the bar down with a thud only then after it was over did she start to shake she looked down at the knife in her hand she could never leave the room unarmed not now she couldnt leave the knife in a drawer while she slept any more either it would have to stay in the bedding with her she walked over got her trousers and started to put them back on then she paused and threw them down again she took a scrap of rag wet it in the pitcher on the chest of drawers and used it to scrub at the spot where hsia shoutaos penis had rubbed against her only after that was done did she get dressed a couple of hours later someone knocked on the door ice shot up liu hans back she grabbed the knife who is it she asked weapon in hand she realized it might not do her any good if hsia had a pistol he could shoot through the door and leave her dead or dying at no risk to himself but the answer came quick and clear nieh hoting with a gasp of relief she unbarred the door and let him in oh its so good to be back in peking he exclaimed but as he moved to embrace her he saw the knife in her hand whats this he asked one eyebrow rising what it was seemed obvious as for why it wasliu han had thought shed be able to keep silent about hsias attack but at the first question the tale poured forth nieh listened impassively he kept silent except for a couple of questions to guide her along till she was through what do we do about this man liu han demanded i know i am not the first woman he has done this to from the men in my village i would have expected nothing different is the peoples liberation army run like my village though you say no do you mean it i do not think hsia will bother you again not that way nieh said if he did he would be a bigger fool than i know him to be it is not enough liu han said the memory of hsia shoutao tearing at her clothing brought almost as much fury as had the actual assault its not me alonehe needs to be punished so he never does this to anyone the only sure way to manage that is to purge him and the cause needs him even if he is not the perfect man for it nieh hoting answered he held up a hand to forestall liu hans irate reply we shall see what revolutionary justice can accomplish come down to the meeting of the executive committee tonight he paused thoughtfully that will also be a way of getting your views heard there more often you are a very sensible woman perhaps you will be a member before too long i will come liu han said concealing her satisfaction she had come before the executive committee before when she was advocating and refining her plan for bombing the little scaly devils at their feasts she hadnt been invited backtill now maybe nieh had ambitions of using her as his puppet she had ambitions of her own much of the business of the executive committee proved stupefyingly dull she held boredom at bay by glaring across the table at hsia shoutao he would not meet her eye which emboldened her to glare more fiercely nieh hoting ran the meeting in ruthlessly efficient style after the committee agreed to liquidate two merchants known to be passing information to the little devils and also known to be backers of the kuomintang he said it is unfortunate but true that we of the peoples liberation army are ourselves creatures of flesh and blood and all too fallible comrade hsia has provided us with the latest example of such frailty comrade he looked toward hsia shoutao likethe comparison that sprang to liu hans mind waslike a landlord whos caught a peasant cheating him out of his rents like that guilty peasant hsia looked down not at his accuser forgive me comrades he mumbled i confess i have failed myself failed the peoples liberation army failed the party and failed the revolutionary movement because of my lust i tried to molest the loyal and faithful follower in the revolutionary footsteps of mao tsetung our soldier liu han the selfcriticism went on for some time hsia shoutao told in humiliating detail how he had made advances to liu han how she rebuffed him how he tried to force her and how she defended herself i was in error in all regards in this matter he said our soldier liu han had never shown signs of being attracted to me in any way i was wrong to try to take her for my own pleasure and wrong again to ignore her when she made it plain she did not want me she did right to rebuff me and right again in courageously resisting my treacherous assault i am glad she succeeded the oddest part of it was liu han believed him he would have been glad in a different way had he raped her but his ideology drove him toward recognizing that what he had done was wrong she didnt know for certain whether that made her respect the ideology more or frightened her green when hsia shoutao completed the selfcriticism he glanced toward nieh hoting to see whether it had been adequateno liu han thought but it was not her place to speak and after a moment nieh said in a stern voice comrade hsia this is not your first failing along these linesyour worst yes but far from your first what have you to say of that hsia bowed his head again i admit it he said humbly i shall be vigilant from now on in eliminating this flaw from my character never again shall i disgrace myself with women if i should i am ready to suffer the punishments prescribed by revolutionary justice see to it that you remember what you have said here today nieh hoting warned him in a voice that tolled like a gong women too are part of the revolution liu han added which made nieh the other men of the executive committee and even hsia shoutao nod she didnt say anything more and everyone nodded again not only did she say what was true she didnt rub peoples noses in it one day probably one day before too long the executive committee would need a new member people would recall her good sense with that and with nieh backing her she would gain a regular seat here yesshe thoughtmy time will come george bagnall stared in fascination at the gadgets the lizards had turned over along with captive germans and russians to get their own prisoners back the small disks were plastic of some sort with a metallic finish that somehow had shifting rainbows in it when you put one into a reader the screen filled with color images more vivid than any hed ever seen in the cinema how the devil do they do it he asked for what had to be the tenth time lizard talk came hissing out of the speakers to either side of the screen small as they were those speakers reproduced sound with greater fidelity than any manufactured by human beings youre the bleeding engineer ken embry said youre supposed to tell the rest of us poor ignorant sods how its done bagnall rolled his eyes how many hundreds of years of scientflic progress for humanity lay between the aircraft engines hed monitored and these innocentlooking almost magical disks hundreds maybe how many thousands even the alleged explanations we get from lizard prisoners dont make much sensenot that anyone here in pskov speaks their language worth a damn bagnall said what the bleeding hell is askelkwank light whatever it is it pulls images and sounds out of one of these little blighters but im buggered if i know how we dont even know enough to ask the right questions embry said in a mournful voice too right we dont bagnall agreed and even though we see the stories and hear the sounds that go with them most of the time they still dont make any sense to us the lizards are just too strange and do you know what i dont think theyll be a farthings worth clearer to the jerries or the bolsheviks than they are to us for that matter what would a lizard make ofgone with the wind embry said hed need it annotated the way we have to put footnotes to every third word in chaucer but even worse that bit in the one story where the lizard kept doing whatever he was doinglooking things up maybeand the images appeared one after another on the screen he was watching what the devil was that supposed to mean embry shook his head damned if i know maybe it was supposed to be all deep and symbolic or maybe we dont understand whats going on or maybe the lizard who made the film didnt understand what was going on how can we know how can we even guess do you know what it makes me want to do bagnall said if youre anything like me it makes you want to go back to our house and drink yourself blind on that clear potato spirit the russians brew embry said youve hit it in one bagnall said he hefted another story disk and watched the shimmering rainbows shift what worries me most about having all these go to the nazis and the reds is that if they do manage to decipher them better than we can in this onehorse town theyll learn things we wont know in england this thought has crossed my mind embry admitted do recall though the lizards must have left all sorts of rubbish behind when their invasion failed if we dont have a goodly number of theseskelkwank readers and the disks that go with them ill be very much surprised you have a point bagnall said the trouble is of course its rather likeno its exactly likehaving a library scattered at random across the landscape you never can tell beforehand which book will have the pretty picture youve been looking for all along ill tell you what id like embry lowered his voice some red army men and a fair number from thewehrmacht could follow english id like to see the germans and the russiansto say nothing of the bloody lizardsscattered at random across the landscape you couldnt make me much happier than that nor me bagnall looked around at the maplined chamber where they regularly kept the nazis and bolsheviks from going for each others throats the readers and disks were stored there not least because it was tenuously neutral ground with neither side likely to try to steal everything for itself from it he sighed i wonder if well ever see england again not likely im afraid i fear youre right embry sighed too were doomed to grow old and to die in pskovor more likely doomed not to grow old and to die in pskov only blind lucks kept us intact thus far blind luck and not getting infatuated with any snipers of the female persuasion unlike poor jones bagnall said he and embry both laughed though it wasnt funny not really bagnall added being around the fair tatiana is likelier to make certain you dont grow old and die in pskov than any other single thing i can think of offhand how right you are embry said feelingly he would have gone on in that vein for some time but aleksandr german chose that moment to walk into the chamber he went from english to halting russian good day comrade brigadier hello german did not look like a brigadier with his red mustache long unkempt hair and blazing black eyes he looked half like a bandit half like an old testament prophet which occasionally made bagnall wonder how much distinction there was between those two now he looked over at the lizards reading machines marvelous devices he said it first in russian then in yiddish which bagnall followed better that they are bagnall answered in german which german the partisan leader also understood the brigadier tugged at his beard he continued in yiddish in musing tones before the war you know i was not a hunter or a trapper or anything of the sort i was a chemist here in pskov making medicines that did not so much good bagnall hadnt known that aleksandr german usually said but little of himself his eyes still on the reader he went on i was a boy when the first airplane came to pskov i remember the cinema coming and the wireless and the talking cinema how could anything be more modern than the talking cinema and then the lizards come and show us we are children playing with childrens toys i had this same thought not long ago bagnall said i also had it when the first lizard fighter plane flew past my lancaster it was worse then aleksandr german stroked his beard again that is right you are a flier his laugh showed bad teeth and missing ones very often i forget this you and your comradeshe nodded to embry and with the plural included jones toohave done such good work here keeping us and the nazis more angry at the lizards than at each other that i do not recall it is not why you came to pskov sometimes we have trouble remembering that ourselves bagnall said embry nodded emphatically they have never tried to involve you with the red air force german said before either englishman could speak he answered his own question no of course not the only aircraft weve had around these parts arekukuruzniks and they wouldnt bother foreign experts over such small and simple things i suppose not bagnall said and sighed the biplanes looked as if they flew themselves and as if anyone with a spanner and a screwdriver could repair them having him work on one would have been like calling out the head of the royal college of surgeons for a hangnail but he wouldnt have minded fiddling about with any kind of aircraft aleksandr german studied him hed had a lot of russians and germans study him since hed got to pskov most of the time he had no trouble figuring out what they were thinking how can i use this chap for my own advantage they were usually so obvious about it it wasnt worth getting annoyed over he couldnt so readily fathom the partisan brigadiers expression at last perhaps talking as much to himself as to bagnall aleksandr german said if you cannot use your training against the lizards here you might do well with the chance to use it someplace else so you might again he didnt wait for a reply scratching his head and muttering under his breath he strode out of the chamber bagnall and embry both stared after him you dont suppose he meant he could get us back to englanddo you embry whispered sounding afraid to mention the thought aloud i doubt it bagnall answered more likely hes just wondering if he can turn us into a couple of stalins hawks even that wouldnt be so badbit of a change from what weve been doing what as for the other he shook his head i dont dare think about it wonder whats left of blighty these days embry murmured bagnall wondered too now he knew he would keep on wondering and wondering if there really was a way to get home again no point dreaming about what you knew you couldnt have but if you thought you might somehowhope was out of its box now it might disappoint him but he knew hed never be without it again the tosevite hatchling was out of its box again and allseeing spirits of emperors past only knew what it would get into next even with his swiveling eye turrets ttomalss had an ever more difficult time keeping track of the hatchling when it started crawling on the laboratory floor he wondered how big ugly females whose vision had a field of view far more limited than his own managed to keep their hatchlings away from disaster a lot of them didnt he knew that even in their most technologically sophisticated notempires the big uglies lost appalling numbers of hatchlings to disease and accident in the less sophisticated areas of tosev somewhere between a third and a half of the hatchlings who emerged from females bodies perished before the planet had taken one slow turn around its star the hatchling crawled out to the doorway that opened onto the corridor ttomalss mouth dropped open in amusement no you cant get out not these days he said as if it understood him the hatching made the irritating noises it emitted when frustrated or annoyed hed had a technician make a wire mesh screen he could set in the doorway and fasten to either side of it the hatchling wasnt strong enough to pull down the wire or clever enough to unscrew the mounting brackets it was for the moment confined and you wont risk extermination by crawling off into tessreks area ttomalss told it that could have been funny but wasnt ttomalss like most males of the race had no particular use for big uglies tessrek though had conceived a venomous hatred for the hatchling in particular for its noise for its odor for its mere existence if the hatchling went into his territory again he might bring himself to the notice of the disciplinarians ttomalss didnt want that to happen it would interfere with his research the hatchling knew none of that the hatching knew nothing about anything that was its problem it pulled itself upright by clinging to the wire and stared out into the corridor it made more little whining noises ttomalss knew what they meant i want to go out there no he said the whining noises got louderno was a word the hatchling understood even if one it usually chose to ignore it whined some more then added what sounded like an emphatic cough i really want to go out there no ttomalss said again and the hatchling went from whining to screaming it screamed when it didnt get what it wanted when it screamed all the researchers along the whole corridor joined in hating both it and ttomalss for harboring it he went over and picked it up im sorry he lied as he earned it away from the door he distracted it with a ball hed taken from an exercise chamber here you see this stupid thing bounces the hatchling stared in evident amazement ttomalss knew relief it wasnt always easy to distract any more it remembered what it had been doing and what it wanted to do but the ball seemed interesting when it stopped bouncing the hatchling crawled over to it picked it up and stuck it up against its mouth ttomalss had been sure it would do that and had washed the ball beforehand hed learned the hatchling would stick anything it could into its mouth and learned not to let it get its hands on things small enough to go inside there sticking his hand into its slimy little maw to retrieve this or that was not something he relished and hed already had to do it more than once the communicator squawked for his attention before going to answer he quickly scanned the area where the tosevite sat to make sure nothing swallowable was close by satisfied over that he answered the instrument ppevels face stared out of the screen at him superior sir he said activating his own video i greet you psychologist ppevel said i am to warn you that there is an increased probability you will be required to turn over the tosevite hatchling upon which you are currently conducting research to the big ugly female from whose body it emerged do not merely be prepared for this eventuality anticipate it as nearterm reality it shall be done ttomalss said he was after all a male of the race even as he pledged obedience though he knew a sinking feeling he did his best not to show it as he asked superior sir what has led to this hasty decision ppevel hissed softlyhasty was a term of condemnation among the race but he answered civilly enough the female from whose body this hatchling came has acquired increased status in the peoples liberation army the tosevite group in china responsible for most of the guerrilla activity against us there thus propitiating her is of increased priority when compared to its importance a short while ago isee ttomalss said slowly as he tried to think the tosevite hatchling started whimpering it got nervous now when he was out of its sight for very long doing his best to ignore the little squalling nuisance he tried to keep his wits on the course they had begun if this females status in the outlaw organization is lowered then superior sir the pressure to turn over the hatchling also lessens once more is that not correct in theory yes ppevel replied how you can hope to turn theory to practice in this particular instance is difficult for me to comprehend our influence over any tosevite groups even those allegedly favoring us is more limited than we would like our influence over those in active opposition to us is for all practical purposes nil except for measures military he was right of course the big uglies were prone to believe that what they wanted would come true merely because they wanted it the delusion afflicted the race to a lesser degreeand yet ttomalss thoughtthere ought to be a way it wasnt as if the female liu han had had no contact with the race before giving birth to this hatchling the small creature had been conceived in an orbiting starship its mother had been part of the races initial study cadre on the bizarre nature of tosevite sexuality and mating patterns all at once ttomalss mouth fell open are you laughing at me psychologist ppevel asked his voice soft and dangerous by no means superior sir ttomalss answered hastily i do believe however that i have devised a way to lower the status of the female liu han if successful as you say this will lower her rank and prestige in the peoples liberation army and will allow my vital research program to continue my belief is that you place higher priority on the second than on the first ppevel said since that was true ttomalss did not reply ppevel went on i forbid military action against or assassination of the female in question either of these tactics even if successful will raise rather than lower her status some males have fallen into the slipshod tosevite habit of obeying only such orders as suit them you would be most unwise psychologist to number yourself among them in this particular case it shall be done as you say in every particular superior sir ttomalss promised i have no plans for violence against the big ugly in question i plan to reduce her status through ridicule and humiliation if this can be done well enough ppevel said getting the big uglies even to notice they have been humiliated though is a difficult undertaking not in all instances superior sir ttomalss said not in all instances he made his goodbyes checked the hatchlingwhich for a wonder hadnt got into any mischiefand then went to work on the computer he knew just where to look for the data sequences he had in mind nieh hoting turned south offchang men ta the street that led into the chinese city of peking from the western gateand ontoniu chieh the district that centered on cow street was where the muslims of peking congregated nieh did not normally think much of muslims their outmoded faith blinded them to the truth of the dialectic but against the little scaly devils ideology could for the moment be overlooked he was reasonably well fed which made the curioshop owners standing in the doorways of their establishments shout and wave with particular vigor as he walked past nine out of every ten of that breed were muslims given the trash they sold that helped reinforce the view most chinese had of the muslim minority that their honesty was not always above reproach further downniu chieh on the eastern side of the street stood the largest mosque in peking hundreds maybe thousands worshiped there every day theqadis who led them in prayer had a potentially large group of recruits ready to hand recruits who could also give good service to the peoples liberation armyif they would a large crowd of men stood around no they arent outside the mosque theyre in front of it nieh said aloud he wondered what was going on and hurried down cow street to find out as he drew nearer he saw that the scaly devils had setup in the street one of their machines that could make threedimensional pictures appear in the air above it they sometimes tried broadcasting their propaganda on those machines nieh had never bothered suppressing their efforts as far as he was concerned the scaly devils propaganda was so laughably bad that it served only to estrange them from the people now though they were up to something new the images floating in midair above the machine werent propaganda at all not in any conventional sense of the word they were just pornography a chinese woman fornicating with a man who was too hairy and who had too big a nose to be anything but a foreign devil nieh hoting walked down cow street toward the display he was a straitlaced sort himself and wondered if the little devils hoped to provoke their audience into degeneracy the show they were putting on here was disgusting but if that wasnt what they intended apparently pointless as nieh drew nearer the picture machine the foreign devil who had had his head lowered for a while so he could tease the womans nipple with his tongue raised it again nieh stopped in his tracks so suddenly that a laborer behind him carrying two buckets on a shoulder pole almost ran into him and shouted angrily nieh ignored the fellow he recognized the foreign devil it was bobby fiore the man who had put liu hans baby into her then the woman whose straining thighs clenched bobby fiores flanks turned her face toward nieh and he saw that she was liu han he bit his lip her features were slack with lust the pictures had sound accompanying them he listened to her little gasps of pleasure just as he had when he held her in his arms in the pictures liu han moaned bobby fiore grunted like a stuck pig both of them glistened with sweat a chinese mana running dog for the little scaly devilsspoke over their ecstatic noises explaining to the crowd what it was watching here we see the famous peoples revolutionary liu han as she relaxes between her murders arent you proud to have this kind of person claiming to represent you dont you hope she gets everything she wants eeesaid one of the men around the picture machine i think she is getting everything she wants that foreign devil hes made like a donkey everyone who heard him laughedincluding nieh hoting though stretching his mouth into the proper shape and making the right sounds come out of his throat hurt as if he were being flayed with knives the machine started a new film of liu hanwith a different man this time here is true communism the narrator said from each according to his abilities to each according to his needs the crowd of loafers guffawed at that too again nieh hoting made himself join the men around him the first rule was not to look conspicuous as he laughed though he noted that the narrator was probably a kuomintang manyou had to be familiar with marxist rhetoric to use it so effectively in burlesque form he also noted that man down for assassination if he could find out who he was after nieh had stood around for a couple of minutes he went on to the mosque he was looking for a man named su shunchin and found him sweeping the prayer area clean that bespoke sincerity and dedication had su shunchin been at his trade merely for profit he would have had an underling do the unpleasant parts of the job he looked at nieh with something less than perfect liking how can you expect us to work with folk who are not only godless but who put sluts in positions of authority he demanded the scaly devils are right to scorn you for that nieh did not mention that he and liu han were lovers instead he said this poor woman was captured by the little scaly devils and forced to give her body to these men or be starved is it any wonder that now she burns for revenge against them they seek to discredit her to lower her effectiveness as a revolutionary leader i have seen some of these pictures the little devils show su shunchin answered in one or two the woman liu han looks to be forced yes in others thoughthe ones with the foreign devil with the fuzzy back and chestshe is doing nothing but enjoying herself this is very plain liu han had fallen in love with bobby fiore at first maybe it had been nothing more than two miserable people thrown together in a situation where they had no relief save each other but it had grown to more than that nieh knew it he also knew from his time with bobby fiore on the road and in shanghai that the foreign devil had loved her too even if he hadnt bothered being faithful to her no matter how true all that was none of it would matter to theqadi nieh tried a different tack whatever she did in the past that the little devils show she did only because without doing it she would have been starved to death possibly she did not hate all of it possibly this foreign devil was decent to her in a place where anything decent was hard to find but whatever she did it is the scaly devils fault not hers and she repents of having done it maybe su shunchin said by chinese standards his face was long and craggy he might have had a foreign devil or two in his distant ancestry his features lent themselves to stern disapproval do you know what else the scaly devils did to the woman liu han nieh said when theqadi shook his head he went on they photographed her giving birth to a child and photographed that child coming forth from between her legs then they stole it to use it for their own purposes as if it were a beast of burden you will not see them showing pictures of that i would wager this is so su shunchin said you communists you are good at inventing lies to advance your cause nieh reckoned all religion a lie to advance a cause but did not say so thisis so he answered quietly theqadi studied him you are not lying to me now i do not think he said at last no i am not lying to you now nieh agreed he wished he had not tacked on the last word then he saw su shunchin nodding soberly perhaps pleased he was acknowledging he did sometimes lie he went on in truth the woman liu han gains face from these pictures the scaly devils show she does not lose it they prove that the little devils fear her so much they need to discredit her by whatever means they can su shunchin chewed on that like a man working meat from a chunk of pork that was mostly gristle perhaps there is some truth in this he said after a long pause nieh had to work hard not to show the relief he felt as theqadi continued i will present your interpretation of these pictures to the men who believe as i do at any rate that will be very fine nieh said if we stand together in a popular front we may yet defeat the little scaly devils perhaps there is some truth in this su repeated but here only some when you say a popular front you mean a front you will lead you do not believe in equal partnerships nieh hoting put as much indignation as he could into his voice you are wrong that is not true to his surprise su shunchin started to laugh he waggled a finger in niehs face ah now you are lying to me again he said nieh started to deny it but theqadi waved him to silence never mind i understand you have to say what you have to say to support your cause even if i know it is wrong you think it is right go now and may god the compassionate the merciful someday put wisdom into your heart sanctimonious old foolnieh thought but su shunchin had shown he wasnt a fool and he was going to work with the communists to fight the little devils propaganda and he was right about one thing if the peoples liberation army was part of a popular front that front would come to reflect the views of the communist party after nieh left the mosque he went wandering through the streets and narrowhutungs of peking the scaly devils had set up a lot of their picture machines liu hans images floated above every one of them coupling with one man or another usually bobby fiore but not always the little scaly devils turned up the sound at the moments when she neared and reached the clouds and rain and also for the unctuous commentary of their chinese lackey the propaganda piece did some of what the scaly devils wanted it to do a lot of the men watching liu han being penetrated called her a bitch and a whore just as hsia shoutao had from what shed said and mocked the peoples liberation army for having raised her to a position of leadership i know what position id like to raise her to one wit cracked and raised a loud laugh around that particular picture machine not all the men reacted that way though some did sympathize with her plight and said so out loud and nieh found most interesting the reactions of the women who watched the record of liu hans degradation almost without exception they used the same words ohh poor thing they would use those words not only among themselves but also to their husbands and brothers and sons the chinese way of life shoved women into the background but that didnt mean they had no way of making their opinions felt if they thought the little scaly devils were oppressing liu han they would let their men know about itand sooner or later the opinions those men held would start to change too the partys counterpropaganda wouldnt hurt there either nieh smiled with any luck at all the little scaly devils had wounded themselves in a way the party couldnt have managed and he vowed hed give luck a hand vii all right god damn it where the hell is he that booming badtone that lookoutworldhereiam arrogance could only have belonged to one man of heinrich jagers acquaintance he had not expected to hear from that one man while campaigning against the lizards in western poland he got to his feet careful not to overturn the little aluminum stove on which his supper simmered skorzeny he called what the devil are you doing here the devils work my lad the devils work ssstandartenfuhrer otto skorzeny answered folding jager into a ribcrunching bearhug skorzeny towered over jager by fifteen centimeters but dominated most men not because of his size but by sheer physical presence when you fell under his spell you wanted to charge out to do whatever he told you to no matter how impossible the rational part of your brain knew it was jager had been on several missions with skorzeny in russia in croatia in france he marveled that he remained in one piece after them he marveled even more that skorzeny did he also set himself to resist whatever blandishments skorzeny hurled his way if you stood up to the ss man you got respect if you didnt you got run over skorzeny thumped his belly the scar that furrowed his left cheek pulled up the corner of his mouth as he asked got any food around these parts or do you aim to starve me to death youre not wasting away jager said looking him over with a critical eye we have some stewpork and turnipsand some ersatz coffee will they suit your majesty no truffled pheasant eh well stew will do but fuck ersatz coffee and the dying horse that pissed it out skorzeny pulled a canteen off his belt undid the stopper and passed the canteen to jager have a snort jager drank warily with skorzenys sense of humor you had to be wary jesus he whispered where did you come by this not a bad cognac eh skorzeny answered smugly courvoisier vsop fivestar smoother than the inside of a virgins twat jager took another sip this one with appropriate reverence then handed the feltcovered aluminum flask back to skorzeny ive changed my mind i dont want to know where you found it if you tell me ill desert and go there myself wherever it is its a nicer place than this which isnt saying one hell of a lot when you get down to it skorzeny said now wheres that stew when hed filled the metal bowl from his own mess kit he gulped the stuff down then sent a shot of cognac after it shame to chase anything so vile but the hooch doesnt do me any good if i dont drink it eh he gave jager a shot in the ribs with his elbow whatever you say jager answered if you let the ss man sweep you away you were in troublehe kept reminding himself of that of course since skorzeny was here he was going to find himself in trouble anyway skorzeny brought it with him along with heavenly cognac what sort of trouble now that varied from mission to mission jager got up and stretched as lazily as he could then said lets go for a little walk shall we oh you just want to get me alone skorzeny said in a shrill arch falsetto the panzer crewmen still eating their suppers guffawed in delight gunther grillparzer swallowed wrong and started to choke somebody had to pound him on the back before he could breathe straight again if i were that desperate you big ugly lunk i think id shoot myself first jager retorted the troopers laughed again so did skorzeny he dished it out but he could take it too he and jager strode away from the encampment not far enough to get lost but out of earshot of the soldiers their boots squelched in mud the spring thaw had done as much as the lizards to slow the german advance off in a pond not far away one of the first frogs of the new year let out a loud mournful croak hell be sorry skorzeny said an owl will get him or a heron he sounded as if he thought the frog had it coming jager didnt care about frogs one way or the other the devils work you said what sort of deviltry have you got in mind and where do i fit into it dont even know if you do or not skorzeny answered have to see how things go but as long as i was in the neighborhood i thought id drop by and say hello he bowed from the waist hello youre impossible jager said with a snort by the way skorzeny beamed he took that for a compliment holding onto his patience with both hands jager went on lets try it again why are you in the neighborhood im going to deliver a present as soon as i figure out the best way to do it the ss man said knowing the kind of presents you deliver im sure the lizards will be delighted to have this one jager told him anything i can do to tie a bow on the package you know you have only to ask there hed gone and said it one way or another odds were it would get him killed he waited for the ssstandartenfuhrer to go into extravagant probably obscene detail about the latest plan for making the lizards lives miserable skorzeny took a childish delight in his murderous schemes jager got a sudden mental image of him as a child of six inlederhosen opening a package of tin soldiers somehow the child skorzeny in his mind had a scarred face too now though he sent jager a hooded look before answering its not for the lizards no jager raised an eyebrow well if its for me what are you doing giving me fair warning he suddenly sobered officers who displeased the high command had been known to disappear from the face of the earth as if they had never been what had he done to displease anyone save the foe if youre carrying a pistol with one bullet in it youd better tell me why isthat what youre thinkinggott im himmel no skorzeny held up his right hand as if taking an oath nothing like that i swear not you not anybody you command or who commands youno germans at all as a matter of fact well all right then jager said in considerable relief so what are you getting all coy with me for the enemies of thereich are the enemies of thereich well smash them and go on skorzenys face grew unreadable again you say that now but its not the song youve always sung jews are enemies of thereich nicht wahr if they werent beforehand weve certainly done enough to make them so jager said even so weve had good cooperation from the ones in lodz keeping the lizards from using the city as a staging point against us when you get down to it theyre human beingsja weve had cooperation from them skorzeny said not answering jagers question ill tell you whos had cooperation from them the lizards thats who if the jews hadnt stabbed us in the back wed hold a lot more of poland than we do jager made a tired gesture why do we need to get into all of that you know what we were doing to the jews in poland and russia is it any wonder they dont love us for the good christians we are no its probably no wonder skorzeny said without any rancor jager could hear but if they want to play that game with us theyre going to have to pay the price nowdo you want me to go on with what i have to say or would you sooner not listen so you dont have to know a thing go ahead jager said im not an ostrich to stick my head in the sand skorzeny grinned at him the scar on his cheek pulled half his face into a grimace that might have come from a gargoyle sitting somewhere high on a medieval cathedralor maybe that was just jagers mind pulling horror from the ss mans words im going to set off the biggest damned nervegas bomb the world has ever seen and im going to do it right in the middle of the lodz ghetto so what do you think of that are you a colonel or just a scoutmaster in the wrong uniform fuck you skorzeny jager said evenly as the words came out of his mouth he remembered a jewish partisan whod used that invitation about every other sentence ss men had shot the jewmax his name wasat a place called babi yar outside of kiev theyd botched the job or max wouldnt have had the chance to tell his story god only knew how many they hadnt botched thats not an answer skorzeny said as immune to insult as a lizard panzer was to machinegun bullets tell me what you think i think its stupid jager answered the jews in lodz have been helping us if you start killing off the people who do that you run out of friends in a hurry ahh those bastards are playing both ends against the middle and you know it as well as i do skorzeny said they kiss whichever ass is closest to them it doesnt matter one way or the other anyhow ive got my orders and im going to carry them out jager came to attention and flipped up his right armheil hitler he said he had to give skorzeny credit the big bruiser recognized it was sarcasm not acquiescence not only that he thought it was funny come on dont be a wet blanket he said weve been through a lot together you and i you can give me a lot of help this time too yes id make a splendid jew jager said deadpan how long do you suppose a circumcision takes to heal up you didnt used to be such a smartmouth skorzeny said rocking back on his heels and sticking thumbs into trouser pockets so he looked like a young lout on a streetcorner must be senility coming on eh if you say so how am i supposed to help though ive never been inside lodz in fact the offensive steered wide around it so we wouldnt get bogged down in street fighting there we cant afford to go losing panzers to molotov cocktails and things like that we lose too many of them to the lizards as is yeah thats the line you sent back to division and division sent it back to army group headquarters and the high command bought it skorzeny said with a nod bully for you maybe youll get red stripes on your trousers like a general staff officer and its worked too jager said i saw more street fighting in russia than i ever wanted nothing in the world chews up men and machines like that and we dont have them to waste ja ja jaskorzeny said with exaggerated patience he leaned forward and glared at jager and i also happen to know that one of the reasons we swung around lodz in two prongs is that you cut a deal with the jewish partisans there what do you have to say to that mr general staff officer it might have stopped snowing but it was anything but warm all the same jager felt his face heat if skorzeny knew that it was in an ss dossier somewhere which did not bode well for his longterm survival let alone his career even so he answered as calmly as he could i say it was military necessity this way we have the partisans on our side and driving the lizards crazy instead of the other way round its worked out damned well so you can take your i also happen to know and flush it down the wc why what does winston churchill want with it skorzeny said with a leer the joke would have been funnier if the germans hadnt been making it on the radio from the day churchill became prime minister to the night the lizards arrived the ss man went on you have to understand i dont really give a damn but it does mean you have connections with the jews you ought to be able to use those to help me get my little toy right to the center of town jager stared at him and you pay me thirty pieces of silver afterwards dont you i dont throw away connections like that i dont murder them either why not ask me to betray my own men while youre at it thirty pieces of silver thats pretty good christ was a damn kike too remember and a whole fat lot of good it did him so skorzeny studied jager the more help we get from your little chums the easier the job will be and im in favor of easy jobs whenever i can get em they pay me to risk my neck but they dont pay me to stick it out when i dont have to this from a man whod blown up a lizard panzer by jumping onto it and throwing a satchel charge between turret and hull maybe skorzeny called that a necessary sort of risk jager had no way of knowing he said you touch off a nervegas bomb in there youre going to kill a lot of people who dont have thing one to do with the war this time skorzenys laugh was rude you fought in russia same as i did so what he thumped jager in the chest with a forefinger listen and listen good im going to do this with you or without you itd make my life easier if it was with you but my life has been tough before if its tough again believe me ill cope so what do you say i dont say anything right now jager answered im going to have to think this one over sure go ahead skorzenys big head bobbed up and down in a parody of sweet reason think all you want just dont take too long doing it the guard pointed a sten gun at moishe russies middle come on get moving he said his voice harsh and merciless russie rose from the cot in his cell the nazis put me in the ghetto the lizards put me in gaol he said i never thought jews would treat me the same way if hed hoped to wound the guard he was disappointed lifes tough all over the fellow answered indifferently he gestured with the submachine gun now put it in gear he might have been an ss man moishe wondered if hed learned his military manner from the genuine article hed seen that in poland after the jews and poles helped the lizards chase out the germans quite a few jews suddenly become soldiers imitated the most impressive most ferocious human warriors theyd known if you tried pointing that out to them though you were liable to get yourself killed moishe maintained a prudent silence here he didnt know exactly wherehere was somewhere in palestine of course but he and his family had been brought in tied and blindfolded and concealed under straw the outer walls of the compound were too high for him to see over them he could tell he was in a town from the noises that came through the golden sandstone smiths pounding on metal wagons rattling by the distant babel of a marketplace wherever he was he was surely walking on soil mentioned in the torah whenever he remembered that awe prickled through him most of the time other things were on his mind chief among them was how to keep the lizards from walking on this holy soil hed quoted the bible at the jewish underground leaders thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed isaiah had been talking about the egyptians and the lizards were in egypt now russie didnt want them to follow moses across the sinai and into palestine very few people cared about what he wanted worse luck the local jews fools that they were reckoned the british here as oppressive as the nazis in polandor so they said anyhow some of them had escaped from poland after the nazis conquered it so they should have known better turn the guard said unnecessarily for moishe knew the way to the interrogation chamber as well as a rat knew how to run through a familiar maze he never got rewarded with a piece of cheese for doing it right though maybe his handlers hadnt heard of pavlov when he got to the right doorway the guard stood back and motioned for him to work the latch that never failed to amuse him his captors took him for a dangerous man who would seize a weapon and wreak havoc with it if he got the slightest chance ifonly it were sohe thought wryly give him a swatter and he might be dangerous to a fly past that past that the members of the underground were letting their imaginations run away with them he opened the door took one step into the room and stopped in surprised dismay there at the table along with begin and stern and the other usual questioners sat a lizard the alien swung an eye turret toward him this is the one i have a hard time being sure he said in fair german moishe stared at him the body paint he wore was far drabber than that which moishe remembered but no denying the voice was familiar zolraag he knows me the former lizard governor of poland said either you have coached him well or he is indeed the male who gave the race such a difficult time in poland hes russie all right stern said he was a big dark fellow a fighter rather than a thinker if looks mattered which wasnt always so he says we should steer clear of you no matter what he spoke german too with a polish accent and i say to you that we will give you quite a lot to have him in our claws again zolraag answered he betrayed ushe betrayed meand he should pay for this betrayal lizards didnt have much in the way of facial expressions but moishe didnt like the way zolraag looked or sounded he hadnt thought the race worried about such things as revenge either if he was wrong there he would have been happier not knowing it nobody said anything about turning him over to you menachem begin said in yiddish that was not why we brought you here he was short and slight not a whole lot bigger than a lizard himself he was nothing much to look at but when he spoke you had to take him seriously he shook a finger at zolraag we hear what you have to say we hear what he has to say and then we decide what to do you would be well advised to take the race and its desires more seriously zolraag answered his voice cold as he had back in poland he assumed his concerns were more important than mankinds simply because they were his had he been blond and blueeyed instead of greenbrown and scaly he would have made a good ss man himself the race certainly had the notion of theherrenvolk down solid he did not succeed in impressing begin you would be well advised to remember where you are the underground leader replied imperturbably we can always sell you to the british and maybe get more from them for you than your people would give us for russie here i took this risk when i let you bring me up to this part of the continental mass zolraag said he had courage whatever you thought of him and his kind i still have hopes though of persuading you that aligning with the race the inevitable victors in this conflict will serve you best in the long run moishe spoke for the first time what he really hopes is to get back his old rank his body paint is very plain these days yes and that is your fault zolraag said with an angry hiss like that of a venomous serpent it was through you that the province of poland passed from being peaceful to becoming restive and you turned on us and blamed us for policies of similar nature to those you had previously praised bombing washington was not the same as bombing berlin moishe answered picking up the old argument and now you cannot hold a rifle to my head to try to make me sing your praises and then use your machines to twist my words when i refuse i was ready to die to tell the truth and you would not let me of course i exposed you when i got the chance ready to die to tell the truth zolraag echoed he swung his eye turrets toward the jews who might lead palestine into rebellion for his people and against the british you are sensible rational tosevites sirs you must see the fanaticism the futility of this attitude moishe started to laugh he didnt intend to but couldnt help himself the degree to which zolraag misunderstood people in general and jews in particular was breathtaking the folk who had given the world masada who had stubbornly stayed jews when slaughtered for sport or for refusing to convert to christianity and he expected them to choose the path of expedience no russie couldnt help but laugh then menachem begin laughed too and then stern and then all the underground leaders even the guard with the sten gun at first glance as humorless amamzer as was ever spawned chuckled under his breath the idea of jews choosing rationality over martyrdom was too deliciously absurd to resist now the underground leaders glanced at one another how could you explain zolraags unintentional irony nobody tried maybe you couldnt explain it not so it made sense to him didnt that show the essential difference between lizards and human beings moishe thought so before he could drive the point home stern said we will not turn russie over to you zolraag get used to that idea we take care of our own very well the lizard answered we also do this here i think your behavior may be more stubborn than necessary but i comprehend it your mirth however i find beyond understanding you would have to know more of our history for it to make sense to you moishe told him that set zolraag to making unhappyteakettle noises again russie hid a grin hed said that with malice aforethought the lizards had a history that reached far back into the depths of time to the days when men still lived in caves and fire was the great new invention of the age as far as they were concerned mankind had no history to speak of the idea that they should concern themselves with human ephemera hit a nerve menachem begin spoke to zolraag suppose we do rise against the british suppose you help us in the fight suppose that helps you come into palestine afterwards what do we get from it besides a new master to lord it over us in place of the master we have now are you now as free as any tosevites on this planet zolraag asked adding an interrogative cough to the end of the sentence if we were the british wouldnt be our masters stern answered just so the lizard said after the conquest of tosev is over though you will be raised to the same status as any other nation under us you will have the highest degree ofwhat is the word autonomy yes which is not much moishe put in you be silent zolraag said with an emphatic cough why russie jeered when none of the jewish underground leaders chose to back the lizard im just being truthful which is sensible and rational isnt it besides who knows if the conquest of tosev will ever be over you havent beaten us yet and weve hurt you badly truth zolraag admitted which disconcerted moishe for a moment the lizard went on and among the tosevite notempires that has hurt us worst is deutschland which also hurt you jews worst do you cheer on the deutsche now where you fought them before russie tried not to show his wince zolraag might have had no notion of what the history of the jews was like but he knew mentioning the nazis to jews was like waving a red flag before a bull he did it to take away their power of rational thought reckoning him a fool did not do we are not talking about the germans now moishe said were talking about the british who have treated jews well on the whole on the one hand and your chances for conquering the world which do not look as good as they might on the other of course we shall conquer tosev zolraag said the emperor has ordered ithe looked down at the floor for a momentand it shall be done he didnt sound particularly sensible or rational himself there what he sounded like was an ultrapious jew who got everything he knew from the torah and the talmud and rejected all secular learning his faith sustained him in the face of all obstacles sometimes that kept you going through bad times sometimes it blinded you to things you should see moishe studied his captors would they see zolraags blind spot or would their own blind them to it he picked a different argument if you choose to deal with the lizards youll always be a little fish next to them they may think youre useful now but what happens after they have palestine and they dont need you any more menachem begin showed his teeth in what was not a grin of amusement then we start giving them a hard time the same as we do the british now this i believe zolraag said it would certainly follow the polish pattern did he sound bitter hard to tell with a lizard but that would have been moishes guess if the race conquers the whole world though who will back you against us he asked begin what can you hope to gain now begin started to laugh we are jews no one will back us we will gain nothing and we will fight anyway do you doubt it not even slightly moishe said for a moment captive and captor understood each other perfectly moishe had been zolraags captive too they had stared at each other across a gap of incomprehension wide as the black gulf of space that separated the lizards world from earth zolraag did not fully follow what was going on now either he said what is your answer tosevites if you must if there is fire for him in your innards because he is of your clutch of eggs keep this russie but what do you say about the bigger question will you fight alongside us when we move forward here and punish the british do you lizards decide things on the spur of the moment stern demanded no but we are not tosevites either zolraag answered with evident relish you do everything quickly do you not not everything stern said chuckling a little this we have to talk about well send you back safe i was hoping to bring an answer with me zolraag said this would not only help the race but improve my own status but we dont care about either of those except insofar as they help us stern said he nodded to russies guard take him back to his room he didnt call it a cell even jews used euphemisms to sugarcoat the things they did stern went on you can let his wife and son visit or just his wife if hed rather they arent going anywhere right come on you the guard said to moishe as usual punctuating his orders with a jerk of the sten guns barrel as they walked down the corridor toward the chamberhowever you wanted to describe itin which russie was confined the fellow added no you arent going anywherenot alive youre not thank you so much you do reassure my mind moishe replied for one of the rare times since the jewish underground had stolen him from the british he heard that hardnosed guard laugh out loud ice was still floating in the moscow river a big chunk banged into the bow of the rowboat in which vyacheslav molotov sat knocking the boat sideways sorry comrade foreign commissar the fellow at the oars said and put the rowboat back on its proper course upstream its all right molotov answered absently of course the oarsman belonged to the nkvd but he had such a heavy bovineokane a gorky accent that turned as into os until he sounded as if he himself had been turned out to pasturethat no one hearing him for the first time could possibly take him seriously a nice bit ofmaskirovka thats what it was a couple of minutes later another piece of ice ran into the boat the nkvd man chuckled bet you wish youd taken apanje wagon to thekolkhoz now eh comrade no molotov answered coldly he waved a gloved hand over to the riverbank to illustrate why he said what he said apanje wagon pulled by atroika of horses slowly struggled along even the russian wagons with their tall wheels and boatlike bottoms had a tough time getting through the mud of the springrasputitsa the muddy season would vary in the fall depending on how heavy the rains were in spring when a winters worth of snow and ice melted the mud was always thick enough to seem bottomless not a bit put out at his abruptness the rower chuckled again when he wanted to he showed skill with the oars dodging more pieces of drift ice with almost a ballerinas adroitness molotov thought of anastas mikoyan caught by rain at a party to which hed come without an umbrella when the hostess exclaimed that he would get wet hed just smiled and said oh no ill dance between the raindrops if any man could do it mikoyan was the one like a lot of riverside collective farmskolkhoz had a rickety pier sticking out into the turbid brown water of the river the nkvd boatman tied up the rowboat at the pier then scrambled up onto it to help molotov out when molotov started toward the farm building the oarsman didnt follow him the foreign commissar would have been astonished if he had he might have been nkvd but he surely didnt have the security clearance hed need for this project cows lowed which made molotov think again of the rowers intonation pigs grunted they didnt mind mudon the contrary neither did ducks and geese chickens struggled puffing one foot out of the muck and then the other and looking down with little beady black eyes as if wondering why the ground kept trying to grab them molotov wrinkled his nose thekolkhoz had a fine barnyard odor no doubt about that its buildings were typical for those of collective farms too unpainted and badly painted wood all looking decades older than they were men in cloth caps collarless shirts and baggy trousers tucked into boots tramped here and there some with pitchforks some with shovels it was allmaskirovka carried out with russian thoroughness when molotov rapped on the door to the barn it opened quicklyzdrastye comrade foreign commissar his welcomer said closing the door behind him for a moment he was in complete darkness then the man opened the inner door of what might as well have been an airlock and bright electric light from inside flooded into the chamber molotov shed his coat and boots in there igor kurchatov nodded approvingly the nuclear physicist was about forty with sharp features and a pointed chin beard that gave his handsome face almost a satanic aspect hello comrade foreign commissar he repeated his tone somewhere between polite and fawning molotov had pushed his enterprise and had kept stalin from gutting it when results flowed more slowly than he liked kurchatov and all the other physicists knew molotov was the only man between them and thegulag they werehis good day he answered as always disliking the time polite small talk wasted how is progress we are working like a team of superstakhanovites vyacheslav mikhailovich kurchatov answered we advance on many fronts we do you yet produce this plutonium metal which will yield the large explosions the soviet union desperately requires molotov interrupted kurchatovs devilish features sagged in dismay not yet he admitted his voice went high and shrill i warned you when this project began that it was a matter of years the capitalists and fascists were ahead of us in technique when the lizards came to earth and they remain ahead of us we tried and failed to separate u from u the best chemical for this is uranium hexafluoride which is as poisonous as mustard gas and hideously corrosive to boot we do not have the expertise we need for that separation process we have had no other choice but to seek to manufacture plutonium which has also proved difficult i am painfully aware of this i assure you molotov said iosef vissarionovich is also painfully aware of it but if the americans succeed if the hitlerites succeed why do you continue to fail design of the requisite pile is one thing kurchatov answered there the americans arrival has already helped us having worked with one in full running order maksim lazarovich has given us many valuable insights i hoped he might molotov said learning that max kagan had reachedkolkhoz was what had brought him up here he hadnt yet told stalin the americans had chosen to send a clever jew stalin was no russian but had a thoroughly russian dislike for what he called rootless cosmopolites being married to a clever jew himself molotov didnt now he went on this is one problem what others have you the worst one comrade is getting both the uranium oxide and the graphite in the nuclear pile free enough from impurities to serve our purposes kurchatov said there kagan however learned and experienced he is in his own field cannot help us much as i wish he could you know the measures your producers are required to take to furnish you with materials of requisite purity molotov asked when kurchatov nodded molotov asked another question the producers know they will suffer the highest form of punishment if they fail to meet your demands hed scribbled vmnforvysshaya mera nakazamiya beside the names of plenty of enemies of the revolution and the soviet state and theyd been shot shortly thereafter such deservedand gotno mercy but kurchatov said comrade foreign commissar if you liquidate these men their less experienced successors will not deliver improved supplies to us the required purities you see are on the very edgeperhaps just over the edgeof what soviet chemistry and industry can achieve we are all doing everything we can in the fight against the lizards sometimes what we do is not enoughnichevo it cant be helped i refuse to acceptnichevo from an academician in a time of crisis any more than i would accept it from a peasant molotov said angrily kurchatov shrugged then you will go back and tell the general secretary to replace us and good luck to you and therodina with the charlatans who will take over this laboratory he and his men were in molotovs power true for molotov held stalins wrath at bay but if molotov exercised that power he would hurt not only the physicists but the soviet motherland that made for an interesting and unpleasant balance between him and the laboratory staff he exhaled angrily a show of temper as strong with him as pounding a shoe on a desk would have been for another man have you any more problems standing between you and building these bombs yes one small one kurchatov answered with an ironic glint in his eye once some of the uranium in the atomic pile is transmuted to plutonium we have to get it out and shape it into the material required for a bomband we have to do all this without letting any radioactivity leak into the air or the river we knew this already and maksim lazarovich has been most insistent on it why is it a difficulty molotov asked i confess i am no physicist to understand subtle points without explanation kurchatovs smile grew most unpleasant this point is not subtle a leak of radioactivity is detectable if it is not only detectable but detected by the lizards this area will become much more radioactive shortly thereafter molotov needed a moment to realize exactly what kurchatov meant when he did he nodded a single sharp upanddown jerk of his head the point is taken igor ivanovich can you bring kagan here to me or take me to him i wish to extend to him the formal thanks of the soviet workers and peasants for his assistance to us that was business of a different sort please wait here comrade foreign commissar i will bring him do you speak english or german no never mind i will interpret for you he hurried down along a whitepainted corridor utterly alien to the roughhewn exterior of the laboratory building kurchatov returned a couple of minutes later with another fellow in a white lab coat in tow molotov was surprised at how young max kagan looked he couldnt have been much past thirty he was a mediumsized man with curly dark brown hair and intelligent jewish features kurchatov spoke to kagan in english then turned to molotov comrade foreign commissar i present to you maksim lazarovich kagan the physicist on loan from the metallurgical laboratory project of the united states kagan stuck out his hand and vigorously pumped molotovs he spoke in voluble english kurchatov did the honors he says he is pleased to meet you and that he aims to blow the lizards to hell and gone this is an idiom and means about what you would think tell him i share his aspirations and hope they are realized molotov answered he eyed kagan and was bemused to find kagan eyeing him back soviet scientists were properly deferential to the man who was second in the ussr only to the general secretary of the communist party to judge by kagans attitude he thought molotov was just another bureaucrat to deal with in small doses the attitude was bracing kagan spoke in rapidfire english molotov had no idea what he was saying but his tone was peremptory kurchatov answered hesitantly in the same language kagan spoke some more slamming a fist into an open palm to emphasize his point again kurchatovs answer sounded cautious kagan threw his hands in the air in obvious disgust tell me what he is saying molotov said he is complaining about the quality of the equipment here he is complaining about the food he is complaining about the nkvd man who accompanies him whenever he goes outsidehe attributes to the man unsavory sexual practices of which he can have no personal knowledge in any case he has strong opinions molotov remarked hiding his amusement can you do anything about the equipment of which he complains no comrade foreign commissar kurchatov answered it is the best available in the ussr then he will have to use it and make the best of it molotov said as for the others thiskolkhoz already has better food than most but we shall see what we can do to improve it and if he does not want the nkvd man to accompany him the nkvd man will not do so kurchatov relayed that to max kagan the american answered at some length he will do his best with the equipment and says he will design better kurchatov translated he is on the whole pleased with your other answers is that all molotov asked it sounded like more tell me exactly what he said very well comrade foreign commissar igor kurchatov spoke with a certain sardonic relish he said that since i was in charge of this project i ought to be able to take care of these matters for myself he said i should be able to do more than wipe my own arse without a party functionarys permission he said that having the nkvd spy on scientists as if they were wreckers and enemies of the people would turn them into wreckers and enemies of the people and he said that threatening scientists with the maximum punishment because they have not fulfilled norms impossible of fulfillment is the stupidest thing he has ever heard of these are his exact words comrade molotov fixed his icy stare on max kagan the american glared back too ignorant to know he was supposed to wilt a little of his aggressive attitude was bracing a lot of it loose in the soviet union would have been a disaster and kurchatov agreed with kagan molotov saw that too for now the state and the party needed the scientists expertise the day would come though when they didnt molotov looked forward to it if you were going to keep your clothes on you couldnt have a whole lot more fun than riding a horse down a winding road through a forest in new springtime leaf the fresh hopeful green sang in sam yeagers eyes the air had that magical spicy odor you didnt get at any other season of the year it somehow smelled alive and growing birds sang as if there was no tomorrow yeager glanced over to robert goddard if goddard sensed the spring magic he didnt show it you okay sir yeager asked anxiously i knew we should have put you in a buggy im all right goddard answered in a voice thinner and raspier than yeager was used to hearing from him his face was more nearly gray than the pink it should have been he wiped his forehead with his sleeve then made a small concession to the evils the flesh is heir to not much farther eh no sir sam answered as enthusiastically as he was able actually they had another day of hard riding ahead of them maybe two days if goddard didnt get over being poorly and when we do get there well give the lizards stumpy little tails a hell of a tweak wont we goddards smile wasnt altogether exhausted thats the plan sergeant how well it works remains to be seen but i do have hopes its got to work sir doesnt it yeager said doesnt look like were going to be able to hit the lizards spaceships any other way but longrange rockets a lot of brave men have died trying anyhowthats a fact so it isa melancholy one goddard said so now we see what we can do the only problem is the aiming on these rockets could be a lot finer he let out a wry chuckle it couldnt be much worse when you get down to itand thats another fact yes sir yeager said all the same he still felt like somebody in the middle of a john campbell story invent the weapon one day try it the next and put it into mass production the day after that goddards longrange rockets werent quite like that hed had help on the design not only from the lizards but also from the germans and they hadnt been built in a day any more than rome was but they had come along pretty darn quick and sam was proud to have had a hand in that as hed feared they didnt make it into fordyce by sunset that meant camping by the side of us yeager didnt mind for himself but he worried about what it was doing to goddard even with sleeping bags and a tent among their gear the rocket scientist needed all the pampering he could get and with the war on he couldnt get much he was as game as they came and didnt complain he had some trouble choking down the rations theyd packed but drank a couple of cups of the chicory brew that made do for coffee he even made jokes about mosquitoes as he slapped at them sam joked too but wasnt fooled when goddard got into his sleeping bag after supper he slept like a dead man not even more of the chicory ersatz got him out of first gear the next morning either but after hed managed to heave himself up into the saddle he said today we give the lizards a surprise that seemed to hearten him where rest and notquitecoffee hadnt fordyce arkansas bustled in a way yeager had seen in few towns since the lizards came it boasted several lumber mills and cottonginning establishments and a casket factory wagons hauled away the output of the lastnamed establishment which had never had slack time even during the lost days of peace and probably stayed busy round the clock these days the country south and west of fordyce along us looked to be a hunters paradise stands of oak and pine that had to be full of deer and turkey and who could say what all else theyd given sam a tommy gun before he set out from hot springs hunting with it wasnt what youd call sporting but when you were hunting for the pot sportsmanship went out the window anyhow four or five miles outside of fordyce a fellow sat on the rusted hood of an abandoned packard whittling something out of a stick of pine the guy had on a straw hat and beatup overalls and looked like a farmer whose farm had seen a lot of better days but he didnt have a drawl or a hillbilly twang in his voice when he spoke to yeager and goddard we been waitin for youse he said in purest brooklyn captain hanrahan yeager asked and the disguised new yorker nodded he led goddard and yeager off the highway into the woods after a while they had to dismount and tie their horses a soldier in olive drab appeared as if from nowhere to look after the beasts sam worried about looking after goddard tromping through the woods was not calculated to make him wear longer after about fifteen minutes they came to a clearing hanrahan waved to somethinga camouflaged shapeunder the trees on the far side dr goddards here he shouted by the reverence in his voice that might have beengods here a moment later sam heard a sound hed long since stopped taking for granted a big diesel engine starting up whoever was inside the cabin let it get warm for a minute or two then drove it out into the middle of the clearing things started happening very quickly after that soldiers dashed out to strip off the branchladen tarp that covered the back of the truck captain hanrahan nodded to goddard then pointed to the rocket revealed when the tarp came off deres your baby sir he said goddard smiled and shook his head juniors been adopted by the us army i just come visit to make sure you boys know how to take care of him i wont have to do that much longer either a smooth silent hydraulic ram started raising the rocket from horizontal to vertical it moved much more slowly than sam would have liked every second they were out in the open meant one more second in which the lizards could spot them from the air or from one of those instrumentladen artflicial moons theyd placed in orbit around the earth a fighter plane had shot up the woods a couple of launches ago and scared him into the quivering fidgets only fool luck the rockets hadnt wrecked a lot of this scrapedtogether equipment as soon as the rocket was standing straight up two smaller truckstankersrolled up to either side of it douse your butts a sergeant in coveralls shouted though nobody was smoking a couple of soldiers carried hoses up the ladder that was part of the launch frame pumps started whirring liquid oxygen went into one tank proof alcohol into the other wed get slightly longer range from wood alcohol but good old ethanol is easier to cook up goddard said yes sir hanrahan said nodding again this way the whole crew gets a drink when were done too well have earned it by godoined was what he really said and the lizards over by greenville they get a hell of a surprise ninety milesyeager thoughtmaybe a few more once it went offif it didnt do anything stupid like blowing up on the launcherit would cross the mississippi river and land in mississippi in the space of a couple of minutes he shook his head if that wasnt science fiction what was it fueled the driver of the launch truck sang outhe had the gauges that let him see how the rocket was doing the soldiers disconnected the hoses climbed down the ladder and got the hell out of there the two fuel tankers went back into the woods the launcher had a rotating table at the base it turned slightly lining up the azimuth gyro with the planned course east to greenville the driver stuck his fist out the window and gave a thumbsup the rocket was ready to fly goddard turned to captain hanrahan thereyou see you didnt need me here i could have been back at hot springs playing tiddlywinks with sergeant yeager yeah when everything goes good it goes great hanrahan agreed but when its snafu you like having the guy who dreamed up the gadget around you know what i mean sooner or later youll be doing it without me goddard said absently scratching at the side of his neck sam looked at him wondering how hed meant that probably both wayshe knew he was a sick man hanrahan took the statement at face value whatever you say doc now whaddaya say we get the hell out of here before hanrahan could do that he had to make a connection at the base of the rocket then trailing a wire after him he loped for the cover of the woods where the rest of the crew already waited goddards trot was slow but dogged sam stayed with him when they were out of the clearing hanrahan gave goddard the control box here you go sir you wanna do the honors ive done it before thanks goddard passed the box to sam sergeant why dont you take a turn me sam said in surprise but why not you didnt need to know atomic physics to figure out how the control box worked it had one large red button right in the middle thank you dr goddard he pushed the button hard flame spurted from the base of the rocket blue for a moment then sunyellow the roar of the engine beat at yeagers ears the rocket seemed to hang unmoving above the launcher for a moment sam nervously wondered if they were far enough awaywhen one of those babies blew it blew spectacularly but it didnt blow all at once it wasnt hanging any more it was flying like an arrow like a bullet like nothing on gods green earth the roar sank down toward the merely unbearable the blast shield at the base of the launcher kept the grass from catching fire the driver sprinted out toward the cab of the truck the launcher sank back toward the horizontal once more now we get the hell outta here hanrahan said come on ill take youse back to your horses he set a brisk pace yeager needed no urging to keep up neither did goddard though he was breathing harshly by the time they reached the soldier in charge of the animals yeager had just swung one foot into the stirrup when a flight of helicopters buzzed by overhead and started lashing the clearing from which the rocket had flown and the surrounding woods with gunfire and little rockets of their own none of the ordnance came close to him he grinned at goddard and captain hanrahan as the helicopters headed east back toward the mississippi they dont like us he said hey dont blame me hanrahan said youre the guy shot that thing off yeah yeager said almost dreamily how about that this is unacceptable atvar declared that the deutsch tosevites fire missiles at us is one thing that some other big uglies have now acquired the art presents us with severe difficulties truth exalted fleetlord kirel said this one impacted uncomfortably close to theth emperor satla and would surely have destroyed it had the targeting been better he paused then tried to look on the bright side like the deutsch rockets it is very inaccuratemore an area weapon than a pinpoint one if they fire enough of them that ceases to matter atvar snapped the deutsche have killed a starship though i dont believe their intelligence realizes as much if they knew such a thing they would boast of it but those losses we absolutely cannot afford nor can we hope to prevent them altogether kirel said we have expended the last of our antimissile missiles and closein weapons systems offer only a limited chance of a target kill i am all too painfully aware of these facts atvar felt uncomfortable unsafe on the surface of tosev his eye turrets nervously swiveled this way and that i know we are a long distance from the nearest sea but what if it occurs to the big uglies to mount their missiles on those ships they use to such annoying effect we have not been able to sink all of them for all we know a missilearmed ship may be approaching egypt while we are holding this conversation exalted fleetlord this is indeed possible but strikes me as unlikely kirel said we have enough genuine concerns to contemplate without inventing fresh ones the tosevites use missiles the tosevites use ships the tosevites are revoltingly ingenious this does not strike me as an invented concern atvar said adding an emphatic cough this whole north african region is as salubrious to us as any on the planet if all of tosev were like it it would be a far more pleasant world i do not want our settlements here to come into danger from big ugly waterborne assaults no male would exalted fleetlord kirel drew back from the implied criticism hed aimed at atvar one way to improve our control over the area would be to annex the territory to the northeast of us the region known as palestine i regret that zolraag did not succeed in gaining the allegiance of the rebellious males there they would reduce requirements for our own resources if they rose against the british truth atvar said but only part truth tosevite allies have a way of becoming tosevite enemies look at the mexicanos look at the italianos look at the jews and polandand are these big uglies not jews too they are exalted fleetlord kirel replied how these jews pop up in such widely separated areas is beyond my understanding but they do they certainly do and they cause trouble wherever they appear too atvar said since the ones in poland were so unreliable i entertain no great hope that we shall be able to count on the ones in palestine either they would not turn moishe russie over to zolraag for instance which makes me doubt their good faith however much they try to ascribe their failure to group solidarity we may yet be able to use them though even if we cannot trust them kirel said a sentiment the race had employed with regard to a large variety of big uglies since coming to tosev the shiplord sighed a pity the jews discovered the tracking device zolraag planted in their conference chamber or we could have swept down on the building that housed it and plucked russie away from them it is a pity especially when the device was so small that their crude technology cannot come close to duplicating it atvar agreed they must be as suspicious of us as we are of them his mouth dropped open in a wry chuckle they also have a nasty sense of humor truth exalted fleetlord kirel said finding that the tracker led directly to the largest british base in palestine wasa disappointment males of the race had been saying that about a large variety of things since they came to tosev too when mordechai anielewicz left lodz as had been true when hed left warsaw he was reminded that the jews however numerous they were in poland remained a small minority of its population most of them had guns now and they could call on their militias which could bring heavier weapons to bear but they were thin on the ground that meant dealing with the poles when he went out into the countryside and dealing with the poles made him nervous a large majority of poles had either done nothing or applauded when the nazis shut the jews away in bigcity ghettos or massacred them in the towns and villages a lot of those poles hated the lizards not for having driven out the germans but for arming the jews whod helped them do it and so when a message came into lodz that a polish peasant urgently needed to speak to him mordechai wondered if he was walking into a trap then he wondered who might be setting the trap if it was such the poles might want his scalp so might the lizards so for that matter might the germans if they wanted to rid the jews of a fighting leader and the jews who worried about the nazis more than the lizards might want revenge on him for shipping david nussboym off to the russians bertha fleishman had spelled out all those possibilities in detail when the request for a meeting came in dont go shed urged think of all the things that can go wrong and how few can go right hed laughed back inside what had been the jewish ghetto of lodz among his own people laughter had come easily we didnt get out from under the nazis thumbs by being afraid to take chances hed said whats one more among so many and so hed prevailed and so here he was somewhere north of lodz not far from where lizard control gave way to german and so here he was regretting hed come now when the only people in the fields were polish everyone sent a stranger suspicious looks he himself didnt look like a stereotypical jew but hed seen on previous travels that he couldnt readily pass for a pole among poles either fourth dirt road north of that miserable little town go west fifth farm on the left then ask for tadeusz he muttered to himself he hoped hed counted the roads rightly was that little track supposed to be one or not hed find out his horse was ambling toward the fifth farmhouse on the left a big burly blond man in overalls was forking beet tops into a manger for his cows he didnt bat an eyebrow as mordechai german rifle slung over his shoulder rode up a mauser identical to anielewiczs leaned against the side of the barn the fellow in overalls could grab it in a hurry if he had to he stabbed the pitchfork into the ground and leaned on it you want something he asked his deep voice wary but polite im looking for tadeusz anielewicz answered im supposed to tell him lubomir says hello fuck hello the polepresumably tadeuszsaid with a big booming laugh wheres the five hundred zlotys he owes me anielewicz swung down off his horse that was the recognition signal he was supposed to get back he stretched his back creaked he rubbed at it saying im a little sore im not surprised you ride like a clodhopper tadeusz said without rancor listen jew you must have all sorts of weird connections leastways i never heard of any other clipcocks a german officer was trying to get hold of a german officer for a moment mordechai simply stared then his wits started working again a panzer officer a colonel he still didnt trust the big pole enough to name names tadeuszs head bobbed up and down which made his bushy golden beard alternately cover and reveal the topmost brass fastener on his overalls thats the one he said from what i gather he would have come looking for you himself except that would have given him away given him away to whom the lizards mordechai asked still trying to figure out what was going on now tadeuszs head went from side to side and so did the tip of his beard i dont think so way i got the story its some other stinking nazi hes worried about the pole spat on the ground to hell with all of em i say to hell with all of em is easy to say but we have to deal with some of them though god knows i wish we didnt anielewicz said off to the north and east artillery lire rumbled mordechai pointed in that direction you see thats the germans likely aiming at the railroad or the highway into lodz the lizards have trouble getting supplies in there now and a devil of a time fighting out of the placenot that we havent done our bit as far as that goes tadeusz nodded shaded by a shapeless almost colorless cloth cap his eyesa startlingly bright bluewere very keen mordechai wondered if hed been a peasant before the war broke out or perhaps something like an army major under the german occupation polish officers had had plenty of incentive to make themselves invisible his suspicion gained intensity when tadeusz said the lizards wont just be having trouble bringing in military supplies either your people will be getting hungry by and by thats so mordechai admitted rumkowskis noticed ithes hoarding everything he can for the bad times ahead the bastard will lick the boots of anybody over him but he can smell trouble i give thealter kacker that much tadeusz had no trouble understanding the couple of words of yiddish in the middle of the polish conversation not the worst thing for a man to be able to do he remarked no anielewicz said reluctantly he tried to wrench matters back to those at hand do you have any idea who this other nazi is if i knew that i might have a better notion of why the panzer officer was trying to warn me what do you knowwhat will you tell me if tadeusz was a polish officer lying low he was liable to have the full measure of aristocratic contempt for jews if on the other hand he really was a peasant he was even more liable to have a simple but even more vivid hatred running through his veins and yet if that were so he wouldnt have relayed jagers message in the first place mordechai couldnt let his own ingrained distrust of the poles get in the way of the facts now tadeusz tugged at his beard before answering you have to remember i got this fourth maybe fifthhand i dont know how much of it to trust myself yes yes anielewicz said impatiently just tell me whatever you got and ill try and put the pieces together this german could hardly rig up a field telephone and call right into lodz now could he stranger things have happened tadeusz said and mordechai remembering some of his own telephone calls out of the city had to nod the pole went on all right this is everything i got told whatevers going to happenand i dont know what that isits going to happen in lodz and its going to happen to you jews in lodz word is theyve brought in some kind of an ss man with a whole bunch of notches on his gun to do the job thats the craziest thing i ever heard of mordechai said its not just that were not doing anything to the nazis were helping them for gods sake the lizards havent been able to do much of anything out of lodz and it isnt because they havent tried tadeusz looked at him with what he first took for scorn and then realized was pity i can give you two good reasons why the nazis are doing what theyre doing for one thing youre jews and then for another thing youre jews you know about treblinka dont you without waiting for anielewicz to nod he finished they dont care about what you do they care about what you are well i wont say youre wrong anielewicz replied he had a polish army canteen on his belt he took it off removed the stopper and offered it to tadeusz here wash the taste of that out of your mouth the poles larynx worked as he took several long blissful swallowsshikker iz ein goy ran through mordechais head the gentile is a drunk but tadeusz stopped before the canteen was empty and handed it back to him if thats not the worst applejack ive ever drunk i dont know what is he thumped his belly the sound was like someone hitting a thick hard plank even the worst though is a damn sight better than none mordechai swigged from the canteen the raw spirit charred its way down his gullet and exploded like a mm shell in his stomach yeah you could strip paint with just the fumes from that couldnt you but youre not wrongas long as it has the kick thats what you need he could feel his skin flush and his heart start racing so what am i supposed to do when this ss man shows up in lodz shooting him on the spot doesnt sound like the worst idea ive ever heard tadeuszs eyes were slightly crossed hed taken a big dose on an empty stomach and perhaps hadnt realized how strong the stuff was till hed got outside it people who drank a lot were like that sometimes they were used to strong so they didnt notice very strong till too late the poles eyebrows drew together as he tried to gather his wits what else did your nazi chum say he wondered aloud hes no chum of mine anielewicz said indignantly but maybe that wasnt true if jager hadnt thought something lay between them he wouldnt have sent a message even a garbled one into lodz anielewicz had to respect that whatever he thought of the uniform jager wore he took another cautious sip of applejack and waited to see if tadeuszs brains would start working again after a while they did now i remember the pole said his face lighting up i dont know how much to trust this thoughlike i said it came through a lot of mouths before it got to me what came through his mouth was a loud and unmistakable hiccup god and the virgin and the saints only know if it came through the way it was supposed to numordechai said trying to get tadeusz moving forward once more instead of sideways all right all right the pole made pushing motions as if to fend off his impatience if it came to me straight what he said was that next time you saw him you shouldnt believe anything he told you because hed be lying through his teeth he sent a message to tell me hed be lying anielewicz scratched his head whats that supposed to mean not my problem god be praised tadeusz answered mordechai glared at him then turned remounted his horse and rode back toward lodz without another word viii leslie groves couldnt remember the last time hed been so far away from the metallurgical laboratory and its products now that he thought back on it he hadnt been away from the project since the day hed taken that load of plutonium stolen first from the lizards and then from the germans off the hmsseanymph ever since then hed lived breathed eaten and slept atomic weapons and now here he was well east of denver miles and miles away from worrying about things like graphite purity and neutron absorption cross sections when hed taken college physics nobody had ever heard of neutrons and making sure you didnt vent radioactive steam into the atmosphere if you did and if the lizards noticed youd surely never get a second chanceand the united states would almost certainly lose the war but there were other ways to lose the war besides having a lizard atomic bomb come down on his head that was why he was out here to help keep one of those other ways from happening some vacation he muttered under his breath if you wanted a vacation general i hate to tell you but you signed up with the wrong outfit lieutenant general omar bradley said the grin on his long horsey face took any sting from his words he knew groves did a platoons worth of work all by his lonesome yes sir groves answered what youve shown me impressed the living daylights out of me ill tell you that i just hope it looks as tough to the lizards as it does to us you and me and the whole united states bradley answered if the lizards punch through these works and take denver were all in a lot of trouble if they get close enough to put your facility under artillery fire were in a lot of trouble our job is to make sure they dont and to spend the fewest possible lives making sure of that the people of denver have seen enough yes sir groves said again back in i saw newsreels of women and kids and old men marching out from moscow with shovels on their shoulders to dig tank traps and trenches to hold off the nazis i never dreamt then that the same thing would happen here in the states one day neither did i neither did anybody bradley said he looked tough and worn an impression strengthened by his missouri twang and by the m he carried in place of the usual officers sidearm hed been a crack shot ever since the days when he went hunting with his father and didnt let anyone forget it scuttlebutt had it that hed used the ml to good effect too in the first counterattack against the lizards in late we have more going for us than the red army did then bradley said we werent just shoving dirt around he waved to show what he meant continuing the maginot line isnt a patch on these works this is defense in depth the way the hindenburg line was in the last war he paused again this time to cough not that i saw the hindenburg line dammit but i did study the reports on it most thoroughly yes sir groves said for the third time hed heard that bradley was sensitive about not having gone over there during world war i and evidently the rumor machine had that one straight he took a step up onto the parapet and looked around the lizardsll stub their snouts if they run up against this no doubt about it bradleys voice went grim thats not anif worse luck its awhen we wont stop em short of our works not by the way theyve broken out of kansas and into colorado lamar had to be evacuated the other day you know yes id heard that groves said it had sent cold chills down his spine too looking at all this though i feel better than i did when the word came down what man could do to turn gently rising prairie into real defensive terrain man had done trenches and deep broad antitank ditches ringed denver to the east for miles around great belts of barbed wire would impede lizard infantry if not armor concrete pillboxes had been placed wherever the ground was suitable some of them held machine guns others provided aiming points for bazooka men along with the antitank ditches tall concrete teeth and stout steel posts were intended to channel lizard armor toward the men with the rockets that could destroy it if a tank tried to go over those obstacles instead of around them it would present its weaker belly armor to the antitank guns waiting for just that eventuality stretches of the prairie looked utterly innocent but were in fact sown with mines enough to make the lizards pay a heavy price for crossing them it all looks grand that it does bradley said i worry about three things though do we have enough men to put into the works to make them as effective as they ought to be do we have enough munitions to make the lizards say uncle if they strike us with everything theyve got and do we have enough food to keep our troops in the works day after day week after week the best answer i can up with for any of those isi hope so considering that any or all of them might beno thats a damn sight better than it might be groves said so it is but its not good enough bradley scratched his chin then turned to groves your facilities have taken proper precautions yes sir groves answered he was pretty sure bradley already knew that but even threestar generals sometimes needed reassuring as soon as the bombing in and around denver picked up we implemented our deception plan we lit bonfires by our most important buildings and under cover of the smoke we put up the painted canvas sheets that make them look like ruins from the air we havent had any strikes close by since so for now it looks like the plan has paid off good bradley said it had better pay off your facility is why well fight to the last man to hold denver and you know it as well as i do oh wed fight for it anywaygod knows we dont want the lizards stretching their hold all the way across the great plainsbut with the met lab here its not a town we want to have its a town we have to have yes sir i understand that groves said the physicists tell me well have another little toy ready inside of a couple of weeks well want to hold the lizards away from denver without using it i know but if it comes down to using it or losing the town i was hoping you would tell me something like that general bradley answered as you say well do everything we can to hold denver without resorting to nuclear weapons because the lizards do retaliate against our civilian population but if it comes down to a choice between losing denver and taking every step we can to keep it i know what the choice will be i hope it doesnt come to that groves said bradley nodded lizard planes screamed by antiaircraft guns hammered at them every once in a while the guns brought down a fighterbomber too but seldom enough that it wasnt much more than dumb luck bombs hit the american works the blasts boxed groves ears whatever that was they hit itll take a lot of pickandshovel work to set it right again omar bradley looked unhappy hardly seems fair to the poor devils who have to do all the hard work to see the fruits of their labors go up in smoke that way destroying is easier than building sir groves answeredthats why its easier to turn out a soldier than an engineer he thought he didnt say that out loud giving the people who worked for you the rough side of your tongue could sometimes spur them on to greater effort if you got your superior angry at you though he was liable to let you down when you needed him most groves pursed his lips and nodded thoughtfully in its own way that was engineering too ludmila gorbunova let her hand rest on the butt of her tokarev automatic pistol you are not using me in the proper fashion she told the leader of the guerrilla band a tough skinny pole who went by the name of casimir to make sure he couldnt misunderstand it she said it first in russian then in german and then in what she thought was polish he leered at her of course im not he said you still have your clothes on she yanked the pistol out of its holster pig she shouted idiot take your brain out of your pants and listen to me she clapped a hand to her foreheadbozhemoi if the lizards paraded a naked whore around hrubieszow theyd lure you and every one of your skirtchasing cockhounds out of the forest to be slaughtered instead of blowing up at her he said you are very beautiful when you are angry a line he must have stolen from a badly dubbed american film she almost shot him on the spotthis was what shed got for doing thatkulturny general von brockdorffahlefeldt a favor a trip to a band of partisans who didnt have the wits to clear all the trees out of their landing strip and who hadnt the first clue how to employ the personnel who for reasons often inscrutable to her nonetheless adhered to their cause comrade she said keeping things as simple as she could i am a pilot i have no working aircraft here she didnt bother pointing outwhat was the use that the partisans hadnt come up with a mechanic able to fix her poorkukuruznik which was to her the equivalent of failing kindergarten using me as a soldier gives me less to do than i might otherwise do you know of any other aircraft i might fly casimir reached up under his shirt and scratched his belly he was hairy as a monkeyand not much smarter than one eitherludmila thought she expected he wouldnt answer her and regretted losing her temperregretted it a little anyway as she would have regretted any piece of tactics that could have been better at last though he did reply i know of a band that either has or knows about or can get its hands on some sort of a german plane if we get you to it can you fly it i dont know she said if it flies i can probably fly it you dont sound like you know much after a moment she added about this airplane i mean what kind is it where is it is it in working order i dont know what it is i dont know if it is where that i know it is a long way from here north and west of warsaw not far from where the nazis are operating again these days if you want to travel to it this can probably be arranged she wondered if there was any such plane or if casimir merely wanted to be rid of her he was trying to send her farther away from therodina too did he want her gone because she was a russian there were a few russians in his band but they didnt strike her as ideal specimens of soviet manhood still if the plane was where he said it was she might accomplish something useful with it she was long since convinced she couldnt do that here khoroshoshe said briskly good what sort of guides and passwords will i need to get to this mysterious aircraft i will need some time to make arrangements casimir said they might go faster if you he stopped ludmila had swung up the pistol to point at his head he did have nerve his voice didnt waver as he admitted on the other hand they might not khorosholudmila said again and lowered the gun she hadnt taken off the safety but casimir didnt need to know that she wasnt even very angry at him he might not bekulturny but he did understandno when he stared down a gun barrel some mengeorg schultz immediately sprang to mindneeded much stronger hints than that maybe having a pistol pointed at his face convinced casimir that he really did want to be rid of ludmila two days later she and a pair of guidesa jew named avram and a pole called wladeslawheaded north and west in a beatup wagon pulled by a beatup donkey ludmila had wondered if she ought to get rid of her red air force gear but seeing what the pole and the jew wore put an end to that notion wladeslaw might have been a red army man himself though he carried a germangewehr on his back and avrams hooked nose and stringy graying beard looked particularly out of place under the brim of a coalscuttle helmet somewehrmacht man would never need again as the wagon rattled on through the modest highlands south of lublin she saw how common such mixtures of clothing were not just among partisans but for ordinary citizensassuming any such still existed in poland and every other man and about every third woman carried a rifle or submachine gun with only the tokarev on her hip ludmila began to feel underdressed she also got a closer look at the lizards than shed ever had before now a convoy of lorries rolling past and kicking up clouds of dust now tanks tearing up the roads even worse had those tanks been in the soviet union their machine guns would have made short work of a wagon and three armed people in it but they rumbled by eerily quiet without even pausing in pretty good russianhe and wladeslaw both spoke the languageavram said they dont know whether were with them or against them theyve learned not to take chances finding out too every time they make a mistake and shoot up people who had been their friends they turn a lot of people who were for them against them why are there so many willing traitors to mankind in poland ludmila asked the phrase from radio moscow sprang automatically to her lips only after shed said it did she wish shed been more tactful fortunately it didnt irk either wladeslaw or avram in fact they both started to laugh they both started to answer at the same time too with a flowery wave avram motioned for wladeslaw to go on the pole said after youve lived under the nazis for a while and under the reds for a while anything that isnt the nazis or the reds looks good to a lot of folks now theyd gone and insulted her or at least her government she said but i remember comrade stalins statement on the wireless the only reason the soviet union occupied the eastern half of poland was that the polish state was internally bankrupt the government had disintegrated and the ukrainians and belorussians in poland cousins to their soviet kindred were left to the mercy of fate the soviet union extricated the polish people from war and enabled them to lead a peaceful life until fascist aggression took its toll on us all thats what the wireless said is it avram said ludmila stuck out her chin and nodded stubbornly she was primed and ready for a fine bruising ideological debate but avram and wladeslaw didnt feel like arguing instead they howled laughter like a couple of witstruck wolves baying at the moon they pounded their fists down on their thighs and finally ended up embracing each other the donkey flicked its ears in annoyance at their untoward carryingon what have i said that was so funny ludmila inquired in tones of ice avram didnt answer directly instead he returned a question of his own could i teach you talmud in a few minutes she didnt know what talmud was but shook her head he said thats right to learn talmud youd have to learn a whole new way of looking at the world and think only in that waya new ideology if you want to put it that way he paused again this time she nodded he went on you already have an ideology but youre so used to it you dont even notice its there thats whats funny but my ideology is scientflic and correct ludmila said for some reason that started the jew and the pole on another spasm of laughter ludmila gave up with some people you simply could not have an intelligent discussion the land dropped down toward the valley of the vistula kaziemierz doly looked down on the river from high sandy banks overgrown with willows whose branches trailed in the water and cut by a good many ravines lovers come here in the springtime wladeslaw remarked ludmila sent him a suspicious look but he let it go at that so it probably hadnt been a suggestion some of the buildings around the marketplace were large and had probably been impressive when they were whole but several rounds of fighting had left most of them charred ruins a synagogue didnt look much better than any of the other wreckage but jews were going in and out other jewsarmed guardsstood watch outside ludmila caught avram glancing over at wladeslaw to see if he would say anything about that he didnt ludmila couldnt tell whether that pleased the jewish partisan or irked him what passed for polish politics was too complex for her to follow easily a ferryboat sent up a great cloud of softcoal fumes as it carried the wagon across the vistula the country was so flat it reminded ludmila of the endless plain surrounding kiev cottages with thatched roofs and with sunflowers and hollyhocks growing around them could have belonged to her homeland too that evening they stopped at a farmhouse by a pond ludmila didnt wonder how theyd found that particular house not only was it on the water the germans must have used it for target practice for it was ringed by old overgrown bomb craters some of them the deeper ones on the way to becoming ponds themselves as groundwater seeped up into them no one asked or gave names there ludmila understood that what you didnt know you couldnt tell the middleaged couple who worked the farm with their swarm of children put her in mind ofkulaks the prosperous peasants who in the soviet union had resisted giving up their property to join the glorious egalitarian collective farm movement and so had disappeared off the face of the earth when she was still a girl poland had not seen the same leveling the wife of the couple a plump pleasant woman who wore on her head a bright kerchief like a russianbabushka cooked up a great pot of what she calledbarszcz beet soup with sour cream which except for the caraway seeds stirred into it for flavor might have come from a russian kitchen along with it she served boiled cabbage potatoes and a spicy homemade sausage ludmila found delicious but avram wouldnt touch jew the woman muttered to her husband when avram was out of earshot they helped the partisans that didnt mean they loved all of them after supper avram and wladeslaw went out to sleep in the barn ludmila got the sofa in the parlor an honor she wouldnt have been sorry to decline as it was short and narrow and lumpy she tossed and turned and almost fell off a couple of times in the course of an uncomfortable evening toward sunset the next day they crossed the pilica river a tributary of the vistula over a rebuilt wooden bridge and came into warka wladeslaw waxed enthusiastic they make the best beer in poland here sure enough the air held the nutty tang of malt and hops the pole added pulaski was born in warka and who is pulaski ludmila asked wladeslaw let out a long resigned sigh they dont teach you much in those bolshevik schools do they as she bristled he went on he was a polish nobleman who tried to keep the prussians and the austrians and you russians from carving up our country he failed he sighed again we have a way of failing at such things then he went to america and helped the united states fight england he got killed there poor fellow he was still a young man ludmila had been on the point of callingor at least thinking ofpulaski as a reactionary holdover of the corrupt polish feudal regime but helping the revolutionary movement in the united states had surely been a progressive act the curious combination left her without an intellectual slot in which to pigeonhole pulaski an unsettling feeling this was the second time shed left the confines of the ussr on each trip her view of the world had shown itself to be imperfectly adequate no doubt a talmudic perspective would be even worseshe thought she consciously noticed what shed been hearing for a while a low distant rumble off to the north and west that cant be thunder she exclaimed the day was fine and bright and sunny with only a few puffy white clouds drifting slowly across the sky from west to east thunder of a sort avram answered but only of a sort thats lizard artillery going after the nazis or maybe german artillery going after the lizards its not going to be easy any more getting where were going one thing ive learned ludmila said is that its never easy getting where youre going avram plucked at his beard if you know that much maybe those bolshevik schools arent so bad after all okay listen up people because this is what were going to do rance auerbach said in the cool darkness of colorado night right now were somewhere between karval and punkin center a couple of the cavalry troopers gathered round him chuckled softly he did too yeah theyve got some great names for places round these parts before the sunset scouts spotted lizard outposts north and west of karval what we want to do is make em think theres a whole hell of a lot more than us between them and punkin center we do that we slow down this part of their drive on denver and thats the idea yeah but captain auerbach thereaint nothin but us between them and punkin center rachel hines said she looked around in the darkness at the shapes of their companions there aint that much left of us neither you know that and i know that auerbach said as long as the lizards dont know it everythings swell his companyor the survivors thereof plus the ragtag and bobtail of other broken units whod hooked up with themlaughed some more so did he to keep up morale it wasnt really funny when the lizards wanted to put on a blitzkrieg they put one on that made the nazis look like pikers since they started by pasting lamar from the air theyd ripped damn near halfway across colorado knocking out of their path everything that might have given them trouble auerbach was damned if he knew how anything could stop them before they hit the works outside of denver hed got orders to try though and so he would very likely hed die trying well that was part of the job lieutenant bill magruder said remember boys and girls the lizards have gadgets that let em see in the dark like cats wish they could you want to keep under cover use the fire from one group so theyll reveal their position and another group can attack em from a different direction they dont play fair they dont come close to playing fair if were going to beat em we have to play dirty too the cavalry wasnt going to beat em any which way auerbach knew that any of his troopers who didnt know it were fools as hitandrun raiders though they still might accomplish something useful lets mount up he said and headed for his own horse the rest of the company was dim shadows jangling harness the occasional cough from a man or snort from an animal he didnt know this territory well and worried about blundering into the lizard pickets before he knew they were there if that happened he was liable to get his whole command chewed up without doing the cause a lick of good or the lizards any harm but a couple of the men who rode along were farmers from these parts they werent in uniform had they been going up against a human foe that could have got them shot if they were captured the lizards didnt draw those distinctions though and the farmers in bib overalls knew the country as intimately as they knew their wives bodies one of them a fellow named andy osborne said we split here auerbach took it on faith that he knew wherehere was some of the company rode off under magruders command auerbachand osbornetook the rest closer to karval after a while osborne said if we dont dismount now theyre liable to spot us horseholders auerbach said he chose them by lot before every raid nobody admitted to wanting the job which held you out of the fighting while your comrades were mixing it up with lizards but it kept you safe toowell safer anyhowso you might crave it without having the nerve to say so out loud picking holders at random seemed the only fair way we got a couple o little ravines here osborne said and if were lucky we can sneak right on past the lizards without them ever knowin were around till we open up we manage that we can hit karval pretty damn hard yeah somebody said an eager whisper in the night they had a mortar a caliber machine gun and a couple of bazooka launchers with plenty of the little rockets they shot trying to kill lizard tanks in the darkness was a badodds game but one of the things theyd found out was that bazookas did a hell of a job of smashing up buildings which werent armored and didnt travel over the landscape on their own get close enough to a lizard bivouac and who could say what you might do the mortar crew slipped off on their own a couple of troopers with tommy guns along to give them fire support they didnt have to get as close to karval as the machine gunners and the bazooka boys did auerbach slapped osborne on the shoulder to signal him to guide them down the ravine that came closest to the little town along with the crews who served their fancy weapons he and the rest of the men crouched low as they hustled along off to the north somewhere smallarms fire wentpoppoppop it sounded like firecrackers on the fourth of july and the flares that lit up the night sky could have been fireworks too but fireworks commonly brought cheers not the muffled curses that came from the troopers spotted em too soon somebody said and theyll be lookin extra hard for us too rachel hines added with gloomy certainty as if to underscore her words a flare mounted skyward from the low hilltop where the lizard pickets were posted thats a good sign not a bad one auerbach said they cant spy us with their funny gadgets so theyre trying out the old mark one eyeball he hoped he was right the troopers scuttled along down osbornes wash the flare fell faded died in the north a mortar opened up that half of the company wasnt as close to karval as it should have been but it was doing what it couldcrump crump if the bombs werent landing in the little flyspeck of a town they werent missing by much either then auerbach heard motor vehicles moving around inside karval his mouth went dry expecting to find the lizards asleep at the switch didnt always pay off this heres the end of the wash andy osborne announced in a tone like doom now auerbach wished hed laid penny summers when he had the chance all his scruples had done was to give him fewer happy memories to hold fear at bay he didnt even know what had happened to penny shed been helping the wounded last hed seen her a day or so before a lizard armored column smashed lamar to bits theyd evacuated the injured as best they could with horsedrawn ambulanceshis states war ancestors would have sympathized with that ordeal penny was supposed to have gone out with them he hoped she had but he didnt know for sure okay boys he said out loud mortar crew went off to the left machine gun to the right and forward bazookas straight ahead good luck to everybody he went forward with the two bazooka crews theyd need all the fire support they could get and the ml on his back had more range than a tommy gun the lizard pickets behind them started firing troopers whod stayed back with the mortar crew engaged the lizards then another lizard machine gun chattered this one almost in auerbachs face he hadnt noticed the armored personnel carrier till it was nearly on top of him lizard engines were a lot quieter than the ones people built he stretched himself flat in the dirt as bullets spattered dust and pebbles all around but that machine gun gave away the position of the vehicle on which it was mounted one of the bazooka crew let fly at it the rocket left the launcher with a roar like a lion it trailed yellow fire as it shot toward the personnel carrier get the hell out of there auerbach yelled at the twoman crew if they missed the enemy would just have to trace the bazookas line of flight to know where they were they didnt miss a lizard tanks frontal armor laughed at the shapedcharge head of a bazooka round but not an armored personnel carrier flame spurted from the stricken vehicle lighting it up troopers with small arms opened up on it potting the lizard crew as they popped out of the escape hatches a moment later the deep stutter of the caliber machine gun added itself to the nighttime cacophony keep moving come on forward auerbach screamed we gotta hit em inside karval behind him his mortar crew started lobbing bombs at the hamlet he was rooting for one of them to start a fire to illuminate the area lots of the lizards were shooting back now and they had a much better idea where his men were than the other way around a nice cheery blaze would help level the playing field as if it were christmas he got his wish a clapboard false front in karval went up in yellow flames by the way it burned it had been standing and curing for a long time flames leaped to other false fronts along what had probably been the pintsized main drag their lurid buttery light revealed skittering lizards like demons in hell from more than a mile outside of town the heavy machine gun started blazing away at the targets the light showed you couldnt count on any one bullet hitting any one target at a range like that but when you threw a lot of bullets at a lot of targets you had to score some hits and when a caliber armorpiercing bullet hit a target of mere flesh and blood that target a nice bloodless word for a creature that thought and hurt like you went down and stayed down auerbach whooped like a red indian when another lizard armored personnel carrier brewed up then both bazooka crews started firing rockets almost at random into karval more fires sprouted mission accomplished he shouted though nobody could hear him not even himself the lizards had to figure they were getting hit by something like an armored brigade not a raggedy cavalry company the hammering of the guns hid the noise of the approaching helicopters till it was too late the first warning of them auerbach had was when they salvoed rockets at the bazooka crews it seemed the fourth of july all over again but this time the fireworks were going the wrong wayfrom air to ground that tortured ground seemed to erupt in miniature volcanoes blast grabbed auerbach picked him up and slammed him down again something wet ran into his mouthblood from his nose he discovered from the taste of iron and salt he wondered if his ears were bleeding too if hed been a little closer to one of those rocketsor maybe if hed been inhaling instead of exhalinghe might have had his lungs torn to bits inside him he staggered to his feet and shook his head like a stunned prizefighter trying to make his wits work the bazookas werent in operation any more the caliber machine gun turned its attention to the helicopters its like flew in army air force planes hed heard of machine guns bagging helicopters but the helicopters could shoot back too he watched their tracers walk forward and over the machinegun position it fell silent retreat auerbach yelled for anyone who could hear he looked around for his radioman there was the fellow not far awaydead with the radio on his back blown to smithereens well anybody who didnt have the sense to retreat when he was getting hit and couldnt hit back probably didnt deserve to live anyhow he wondered where andy osborne was the local could probably guide him back to the ravinealthough if helicopters started hitting you from above while you were in there it would be a death trap not a road to safety a couple of the lizard outposts were still firing too there werent any roads to safety not any more a shape in the nighthe swung his garand toward it before he realized it was a human being he waved toward the northwest showing it was time to head for home the trooper nodded and said yes sirweve got to get out of here as if from a great distance he heard rachel hines voice steering by the stars they trotted in the right direction more or less though he wondered how they were going to find the horses some of the troopers were holding then he wondered if it would matter those helicopters would chew the animals to dog food if they got there first they were heading that way too when the heavy machine gun started up behind them with the crew surely dead a couple of other men must have found it and started serving it they had to have scored some hits on the helicopters too for the lizard machines abandoned their course and swung back toward the caliber gun the makeshift crew played it smart as soon as the helicopters got close they stopped firing at themno sense running up a shoot me right here sign auerbach thought as he stumbled on through the darkness the lizard helicopters raked the area where the machine gun hid then started to leave as soon as they did the troopers opened up on them again they returned for another pass again when they paused the gunners on the ground showed they werent done yet one of the helicopters sounded ragged he dared hope the armorpiercing ammunition had done it some harm but it stayed in the air when the helicopters finished chewing up the landscape this time the machine gun didnt start up son of a bitch rachel hines said disgustedly she swore like a trooper half the time she didnt notice she was doing it then she said son of a bitch in an altogether different tone of voice the two hunting helicopters were swinging toward her and auerbach he wanted to hide but where could you hide from flying death that saw in the nightnowhere he thought and threw his m to his shoulder he didnt have much chance of damaging the machines but what he could do he wouldif youre going to go down go down swinging the machine guns in the noses of both helicopters opened up for a second or so he thought they were beautiful then something hit him a sledgehammer blow all at once his legs didnt want to hold him up he started to crumple but he didnt know whether he hit the ground or not a guard threw open the door to ussmaks tiny cell youout he said in the russki language which ussmak was perforce learning it shall be done ussmak said and came out he was always glad to get out of the cell which struck him as poorly designed had he been a tosevite he didnt think he would have been able to stand up or lie down at full length in it and for that matter since tosevites produced liquid as well as solid waste the straw in the cell would soon have become a stinking sodden mess for a big ugly ussmak did all his business over in one corner and wasnt too badly inconvenienced by the lack of plumbing fixtures the guard carried a submachine gun in one hand and a lantern in the other the lantern gave little light and smelled bad its odor reminded ussmak of cooking he wondered if it used some animal or plant product for fuel rather than the petroleum on which the tosevites ran their landcruisers and aircraft hed learned better than to ask such questions it just got him into deeper trouble and he was in quite enough already as the guard led him toward the interrogation chamber he called down mental curses on strahas empty headmay his spirit live an emperorless afterlife ussmak thought on the radio hed sounded so sure the big uglies showed civilized behavior toward males they captured well the mighty onetime shiplord straha didnt know everything there was to know that much ussmak had found out to his sorrow waiting in the interrogation chamber as usual were colonel lidov and gazzim ussmak sent the paintless interpreter a stare full of mixed sympathy and loathing if it hadnt been for gazzim the big uglies wouldnt have got so much from him so fast hed yielded the base in siberia intending to tell the males of the sssr everything he could to help them having committed treason he was going to wallow in it but lidov and the other males of the nkvd had assumed from the outset that he was an enemy bent on hiding things rather than an ally eager to reveal them the more theyd treated him that way the more theyd done to turn their mistake into truth maybe lidov was beginning to realize the error in his technique speaking without the translation of gazzim something he seldom did he said i greet you ussmak here on the table is something that may perhaps make your day pass more pleasantly he gestured toward the bowl full of brownish powder is that ginger superior sir ussmak asked he knew what it was his chemoreceptors could smell it across the room the russkis hadnt let him taste inhe didnt know how long it seemed like forever what he meant of course wasmay i have some the more he associated with the males of the nkvd the less saying what he meant seemed like a good idea but lidov was in an expansive mood today yes of course it is ginger he answered taste all you like ussmak wondered if the big ugly was trying to drug him with something other than the powdered herb he decided lidov couldnt be if lidov wanted to give him another drug he would go ahead and do it and that would be that ussmak went over to the table poured some ginger into the palm of his hand raised the hand to his mouth and tasted not only was it ginger it was lime cured the way the race liked it best ussmaks tongue flicked out again and again till every speck of the precious powder on his hands was gone the spicy taste filled not just his mouth but his brain after so long without the herb hit him hard his heart pounded his breath gusted in and out of his lung he felt bright and alert and strong and triumphant worth a thousand of the likes of boris lidov part of his mind warned him that feeling was a fraud an illusion hed watched males who couldnt remember that die confident their landcruisers could do anything and their big ugly opponents would not be able to hinder them in the slightest if you didnt kill yourself through such stupidity you learned to enjoy ginger without letting it enslave you but remembering that came hard hard in the middle of the exhilaration the drug brought boris lidovs little mouth widened into the gesture the tosevites used to show amiability go ahead he said taste more ussmak did not have to be invited twice the worst thing about ginger was the black slough of despond into which you fell when a taste wore off the first thing you wanted then was another taste usually you didnt have one but that bowl held enough ginger to keep a male happy fora long time ussmak cheerfully indulged again gazzim had one eye turret fixed on the bowl of powdered ginger the other on boris lidov every line of his scrawny body showed ussmak his terrible longing for the herb but he did not make the slightest move toward it ussmak knew the depths of a males craving gazzim had plainly sunk to those depths that he was too afraid to try to take a taste said frightening things about what the soviets had done to him ussmak was used to suppressing the effects ginger had on him but he hadnt tasted for a long time and hed just ingested a double dose of potent stuff the drug was stronger than his inhibitions no let us now give this poor addled male something to make him happy for a change he said and held the bowl of ginger right under gazzims snout nyetboris lidov shouted angrily i dare not gazzim whispered but his tongue was more powerful than he was it leaped into the bowl again and again and again as if trying to make up for lost time by cramming a dozen tastes into one no i tell you lidov said again this time in the language of the race he added an emphatic cough for good measure when neither ussmak nor gazzim took the slightest notice of him he strode forward and knocked the bowl out of ussmaks hands it shattered on the floor a brownish cloud of ginger fogged the air gazzim hurled himself at the male from the nkvd rending him with teeth and claws lidov let out a bubbling shriek and reeled away blood spurting from several wounds he threw up one arm to protect his face with the other hand he grabbed for the pistol he wore on his belt ussmak leaped at him grabbing his right arm with both hands the big ugly was hideously strong but his soft scaleless skin left him vulnerable ussmak felt his claws sink deep into tosevite flesh gazzim might have been a wild thing his jaws had a grip on lidovs throat as if he was going to feed on the male from the nkvd along with the smell of the spilled ginger ussmaks chemoreceptors filled with the acrid tang of tosevite blood the combination brought him close to beasthood too lidovs shrieks grew fainter his hand relaxed on the grip of the pistol ussmak was the one who drew it out of its holster it felt heavy and awkward in his grip the door to the interrogation chamber opened hed expected that for some time but the big uglies were too primitive to have television cameras monitoring such places gazzim screamed and charged at the guard who stood in the doorway blood dripped from his claws and his snout even armed ussmak would not have wanted to stand against him not drugcrazed and insane as he was at that moment bozhemoithe tosevite shouted but he had extraordinary presence of mind he brought up his submachine gun and fired a quick burst just before gazzim got to him the male of the race crashed to the ground twitching he was surely dead but his body hadnt quite realized it yet ussmak tried to shoot at the guard though his chance of escape from this prison was essentially nil he was a soldier with a weapon in his hand the only problem was he couldnt make the weapon fire it had some kind of safety and he couldnt figure out what it was as he fumbled the muzzle of the big uglys submachine gun swung to cover him the pistol didnt even bear on the guard in disgust ussmak threw down the tosevite weapon which clattered on the floor he wondered dully if the guard would kill him out of hand rather to his surprise the fellow didnt the sound of gunfire in the prison had drawn other guards on the run one of them spoke a little of the language of the race hands high he yelled ussmak obeyed move back the tosevite said obediently ussmak stepped away from boris lidov who lay in a pool of his own bloodit looks the same as poor gazzims ussmak thought a couple of guards hurried over to the fallen soviet male they spoke back and forth in their own guttural tongue one of them looked toward ussmak like any big ugly he had to turn his whole flat face toward him dead he said in the language of the race what good would saying im sorry do especially when im not ussmak answered none of the guards seemed to understand that which was probably just as well they talked some more among themselves ussmak waited for one of them to raise his firearm and start shooting that didnt happen he remembered what intelligence had said of the males of the sssr that they stuck to their orders almost as carefully as did the race from what hed seen that seemed accurate without orders no one here was willing to take the responsibility for eliminating him finally the male who had led him to the interrogation chamber gestured with the muzzle of his weapon ussmak understood that gesture it meantcome along he came the guard led him back to his cell as if after a normal interrogation the door slammed behind him the lock clicked his mouth fell open in amusementif id known that was all that would happen if i killed lidov id have done it a long time ago but he didnt think it was going to be all oh no and as the ginger euphoria leaked out of him and aftertasting depression set in he wondered what the russkis would do with himto himnow he could think of all sorts of unpleasant possibilities and he was unpleasantly certain they could come up with even more liu han walked past thefa hua ssu the temple of buddhas glory and just west of it the wreckage of the peking tramway station she sighed wishing the tramway station were not in ruins peking sprawled over a large area the temple and the station were in the eastern part of the city a good manyli from her roominghouse not far from the station was porcelain mouth streettzu chi kou whose clay was famous she walked north up the street then turned off onto one of thehutungs pekings innumerable lanes and alleys that branched from it she was learning her way through the maze she had to double back and retrace her steps only once before she found thehsiao shih the small market another name for that market less often heard but always in the back of everyones mind was the thieves market from what liu han had been told not everything in the market was stolen goods some of the trash so loudly hawked had been legally acquired but was being sold here to create the illusion that the customer was getting a bargain brass plates cabbage chopsticks mahjongg tiles noodles medicine to cure you of the clap piglets and fresh pork peas and bean sprouts the noise was deafening only by peking standards could this be reckoned a small market in most cities it would have been the central emporium all by itself it seemed to liu han as big as the camp in which the little scaly devils had placed her after bringing her down from the airplane that never landed in the surging crowds she was just one among many anonymity suited her the kind of attention she got these days was not what she wanted a man selling fine porcelain cups that certainly looked as if they might have been stolen saw her pointed and rocked his hips back and forth she walked over to him with a large smile on her face he looked half eager half apprehensive she made her voice high and sweet like a singsong girls still smiling she said i hope it rots off i hope it shrinks back into your body so you cant find it even if youve tied a string around its tiny little end if you do find it i hope you never ever get it up he stared at her his mouth falling open then he reached under the table that held his wares by the time hed pulled out a knife liu han had a japanese pistol pointed at his midsection you dont want to try that she said you dont even want to think about trying that the man gaped foolishly eyes and mouth wide and round as those of the goldfish in their ornamental ponds not far away liu han turned her back and walked away as soon as a few people got between her and him he started screaming abuse at her she was tempted to go back and put a bullet in his belly but shooting every man in peking who mocked her would have wasted a lot of ammunition and her peasant upbringing made her hate the idea of waste a minute later another merchant recognized her he followed her with his eyes but didnt say anything by the standards shed grown used to that was a restrained response she paid him the compliment of ignoring him before i had only hsia shoutao to worry aboutshe thought bitterlythanks to the little scaly devils and their vile cinemas i have hundreds a great many men had watched her yield to the desires of bobby fiore and the other men aboard the airplane that never came down having seen that too many of them supposed she would be eager to yield to their desires the little devils had succeeded in making her notorious in peking someone patted her backside from behind she lashed out with a shoe and caught him in the shin he howled curses she didnt care notorious or not she refused to vanish into a hole the scaly devils had done their best to destroy her as an instrument of the peoples liberation army if they succeeded she would never see her daughter again she had no intention of letting them succeed they had made her an object of derision as theyd planned but they had also made her an object of sympathy women could tell that shed been coerced in some of the films the little devils had taken of her and the peoples liberation army had mounted an aggressive propaganda campaign to educate the people of peking men and women alike as to the circumstances in which shed found herself even some men were sympathetic to her now once or twice shed heard foreign devil christian missionaries talking in their bad chinese about martyrs at the time she hadnt understood the conceptwhat point to suffering when you didnt have to these days she was a martyr herself and exploiting the role for all it was worth she came to the little stall of a woman who was selling carp that looked like ugly goldfish she picked one up by the tail are these fish fresh she asked dubiously just caught this morning the woman answered why do you expect me to believe that liu han sniffed at the carp in grudging tones she said well maybe what do you want for them they haggled but had trouble coming to an agreement people watched them for a while then went back to their own concerns when they didnt prove very interesting lowering her voice the carp seller said i have the word you were looking for comrade i hoped you would liu han answered eagerly tell me the woman looked around her face nervous how you hear this must never be known she warned the little scaly devils have no idea my nephew understands their ugly language as well as he doesotherwise they would not talk so freely around him yes yes liu han said with an impatient gesture we have put many like that in among them we do not betray our sources sometimes we have even held off from making a move because the little scaly devils would have been able to figure out where we got the information so you may tell me and not worryand if you think i will pay your stinking price for your stinking fish you are a fool she added the last in a loud voice when a man walked by close enough to eavesdrop on their conversation why dont you go away then the carp seller shrilled a moment later she lowered her voice once more he says they will soon let the peoples liberation army know they are willing to resume talks on all subjects he is only a clerk remember he cannot tell you what all subjects means you will know that for yourself though wont you eh yes i think so liu han answered if the scaly devils meant what they said they would return to talking about giving her back her daughter the girl would be approaching two years old now by chinese reckoning one for the time shed spent in liu hans womb and the second for the time since her birth liu han wondered what she looked like and how ttomalss had been treating her one day before too long maybe shed find out all right ill buy it even if you are a thief as if in anger liu han slapped down coins and stalked away behind her angry facade she was smiling the carp seller was almost her own personal source of news she didnt think the woman knew many others from the peoples liberation army she would get credit for bringing news of impending negotiations to the central committee with luck that would probably be enough to ensure that she got her own seat on the committee nieh hoting would back her now she was sure of that and once she had her seat she would support niehs agendafor a while one of these days though she would have occasion to disagree with him when she did shed have backing of her own she wondered how nieh would take that would they be able to go on being lovers after they had political or ideological quarrels she didnt know of one thing she was sure she needed a lover less than she had before she was her own person now well able to face the world on her own two feet without requiring a mans support before the little scaly devils came she hadnt imagined such a thing possible she shook her head strange that all the suffering the little devils had put her through had led her not only to be independent but to think she ought to be independent without them she would have been one of the uncounted peasant widows in wartorn china trying to keep herself from starving and probably having to become a prostitute or a rich mans concubine to manage it she passed by a man selling the conical straw hats both men and women wore to keep the sun off their faces she had one back at the roominghouse when the little scaly devils first began showing their vile films of her shed worn the hat a lot with its front edge pulled low over her features she was hardly recognizable now though she walked through the streets andhutungs of peking bareheaded and unashamed a man leered at her as she left the small market beware of revolutionary justice she hissed the fellow fell back in confusion liu han walked on the little scaly devils had one of their movie machines playing on a streetcorner there bigger than life liu han rode astride bobby fiore her skin and his slick with sweat the main thing that struck her looking at her somewhat younger self was how well fed and well rested she seemed she shrugged she hadnt been committed to the revolutionary cause yet a man looked from the threedimensional image to her he pointed liu han pointed back at him as if her finger were the barrel of a gun he found something else to doand found it in a hurry liu han kept walking the little devils were still doing their best to discredit her but they were also coming back to the negotiating table and coming back to talk about all subjects as far as she was concerned that represented victory the year before the little scaly devils hadnt been so willing to talk the year before that they hadnt talked at all just swept all before them life was harder now for them than it had been and they were starting to see that it might grow harder yet she smiled she hoped it would new fish came into camp utterly confused utterly dismayed that amused david nussboym who having survived his first few weeks was no longer a new fish but azek amongzeks he was still reckoned a political rather than a thief but the guards and the nkvd men had stopped using on him the blandishments they aimed at so many communists caught in the web of thegulag youre still eager to help the party and the soviet state arent you then of course youll lie youll spy youll do whatever we say the words were subtler sweeter but that was what they meant to a polish jew the party and the soviet state were more attractive than hitlersreich but not much nussboym had taken to using broken russian and yiddish among his fellow prisoners and answering the guards only in polish too fast and slangy for them to understand thats good anton mikhailov said admiringly after yet another guard went off scratching his head at nussboym s replies keep it up and after a while theyll quit bothering you because theyll figure they wont be able to get any sense out of you anyway sense nussboym rolled his eyes if you crazy russians wanted sense you never would have started these camps in the first place you think so do you the otherzek answered try building socialism without the coal they get from the camps and the timber without the railroadszeks build and without the canals we dig why without camps the whole damn country would fall apart he sounded as if he took a perverse pride in being part of such a vital and socially signflicant enterprise maybe it should fall apart then nussboym said these nkvd bastards work everybody the way the nazis work jews ive seen both now and there isnt much to choose between them he thought a moment no i take that back these are just labor camps you dont have the kind of assemblyline murder the nazis had started up just before the lizards got there why murder a man when you can work him to death mikhailov asked itswhats the word i want its inefficient thats what it is thiswhat we do hereyou call this efficient nussboym exclaimed you could train chimpanzees to do this the russian thief shook his head chimpanzees would fall over dead nussboym they couldnt make em stand it their hearts would break and theyd die they call em dumb animals but theyre smart enough to know when things are hopelessand thats more than you can say about people thats not what i meant nussboym said look what theyve got us doing now these barracks were making dont you bitch about this work mikhailov said rudzutak was damn lucky to get it for our gang its a hell of a lot easier than going out to the forest and chopping down trees in the snow this way you go back to your bunk half dead not all the way im not arguing about that nussboym said impatiently sometimes he wondered if he was a oneeyed man in the country of the blind have you paid any attention to what were building though mikhailov looked around and shrugged its a barracks its going up according to plan the guards havent said boo as long as theyre happy i dont care if they wanted me to make herring boats i wouldnt complain about that either id make herring boats nussboym threw down his hammer in exasperation would you make herring boats that didnt hold herring careful with that his partner warned you break a tool and the guards will give you a stomping whether they can talk to you or not they figure everybody understands a boot in the ribs and theyre mostly right would i make herring boats that didnt hold herring sure if thats what they told me to do you think im the one to tell em theyre wrong do i look crazy that sort of keepyourheaddownanddowhatyouretold attitude had existed in the lodz ghetto it didnt just exist in thegulags it dominated nussboym felt like yelling but the emperor has no clothes instead he picked up the hammer and drove a couple of nails into the frame of the bunk bed on which he and mikhailov were working he hit the nails as hard as he could trying to relieve some of his frustration that way it didnt work as he reached down into the bucket for another nail he asked how would you like to sleep in these bunks were making i dont like sleeping in the bunks weve got now mikhailov answered give me a broad wholl say yes though and i dont care where you put me ill manage fine thank you very much he drove a nail himself a broad nussboym hesitated i hadnt thought of that his fellowzek stared at him in pity then youre a fool arent you they go and run up these new barracks they put enough barbed wire between them and the ones we sleep in to keep the nazis from crossing the border and i hear were supposed to get a trainload of special prisoners before long do i have to draw you a picture chum i hadnt heard about the special prisoners coming in nussboym said he knew a lot of the gossip on the camp grapevine went right by him because his russian really wasnt very good well they are mikhailov said well be lucky even to catch a glimpse of em the guards though theyll get fucked and sucked till they cant stand up straight the stinking sons of bitches the cooks too and the clerksanybody with pull youre just a regularzek though forget it nussboym hadnt thought about women since he ended up in soviet hands no that wasnt true he hadnt thought about them in any concrete way simply because he figured he wouldnt see any for a long long time nownow he said even for women these bunks are awfully small and awfully close together so the guards climb in and do it sideways instead of on top mikhailov said so what it doesnt matter to them they dont care what the broads think and youre a stubborn kike you know that i know that nussboym said by the others tone it was almost a compliment all right well get it done the way they tell us to and if there are women here we dont have to admit we made this stuff for them now youre talking the otherzek said the work gang met its norms for the day which meant it got fednot extravagantly but almost enough to keep body and soul together after his bread and soup nussboym stopped worrying about his belly for a little while it had enough in it that it was no longer sounding an internal airraid siren he knew that klaxon would start up again all too soon but had learned in lodz to cherish these brief moments of satiety a lot of the otherzeks had that same feeling they sat around on their bunks waiting for the order to blow out the lamps when that came they would fall at once into a deep exhausted sleep meanwhile they gossiped or read the propaganda sheets the camp muckymucks sometimes passed out those generated plenty of new gossip most of it sardonic or ribald or repaired trousers and jackets their heads bent close to the work so they could see what they were doing in the dim light somewhere off in the distance a train whistle howled low and mournful nussboym barely noticed it a few minutes later it came again this time unmistakably closer anton mikhailov sprang to his feet everybody stared at this unwonted display of energy the special prisoners thezek exclaimed instantly the barracks were in an uproar many of the prisoners hadnt seen a woman in years let alone been close to one the odds that they would be close to one now were slim the barest possibility though was plenty to remind them they were men going outside between supper and lightsout wasnt forbidden though the weather was still chilly enough that it had been an uncommon practice now dozens ofzeks trooped out of the barracks nussboym among them the other buildings were emptying too guards yelled trying to keep the prisoners in some kind of order they had little luck like iron filings drawn to a magnet the men made a beeline for the wire that separated their encampment from the new one the barracks there were only half done as no one knew better than nussboym but that from everything hed heard was a typical piece of soviet inefficiency look someone said with a reverent sigh theyve put up a canopy to keep the poor darlings from getting the sun on their faces and then they have them come in at night somebody else added if that isnt thegulag i dont know what is the train pulled to a stop a few minutes later iron wheels screaming as they slid along the track nkvd men with submachine guns and lanterns hurried up to the stolypin cars that had carried the prisoners when the doors opened the first people off the cars were more guards the hell with them mikhailov said we dont want to see their ugly mugs we know all about what those bastards look like where are the broads the way the guards were shouting and screaming at the prisoners to come out and hurry up about it set thezeks laughing fit to burst among themselves better be careful dears or theyll send you to the front and then youll really be sorry someone called in shrill falsetto a head appeared at the doorway to one of the stolypin cars the prisoners breath went out in one long anticipatory sigh then what was left of it went out again this time in dozens of gasps of astonishment a lizard jumped out of the car and skittered toward the barracks then another and another and another david nussboym stared at them as avidly as if they were women he spoke their language he wondered if anyone else in the whole camp did ix mutt daniels eyed the boat with something less than enthusiasm damn he said feelingly when they said they werent shippin us back to chicago from elgin i reckoned they couldnt do no worse to us than what we seen there shows how blame much i know dont it you got that right lieutenant sergeant herman muldoon said this whole mission the way they talk about it its a deeply regret telegram just waitin to happen or it would be i mean if they still bothered sending those telegrams any more that will be enough of that gentlemen captain stan szymanski said they tapped us on the shoulder for this job and we are going to do it yes sir mutt said the unspoken corollary to szymanskis comment wasor die trying which struck mutt as likely if it struck szymanski as likely too he didnt let on maybe he was a good actor that was part of being a good officer same as it was for being a good manager or maybe szymanski didnt really believe not down deep that his own personal private self could ever stop existing if szymanski was thirty yet mutt figured he was the king of england mutt was getting close to sixty the possibility of his own imminent extinction felt only too real even before the lizards came too many of the friends hed had since the turn of the century and before had up and dropped dead on him from heart disease or cancer or tb throw bullets and shell fragments into the mix and a fellow got the idea he was living on borrowed time well have the advantage of surprise szymanski said of course we willmutt thoughtthe lizardsll be surprisedhell theyll be amazedwe could be so stupid he couldnt say that out loud worse luck captain szymanski pulled a muchfolded piece of paper out of his pocket lets have a look at the map he said daniels and muldoon crowded close the map wasnt anything fancy from the army corps of engineers mutt recognized it at once it had come from a rand mcnally road atlas the same kind of map bus drivers had used to get his minorleague teams from one little town to the next hed used them himself when the drivers got lost which they did with depressing regularity szymanski pointed the lizards are holding the territory on the eastern side of the illinois river here havana right on the eastern bank where the spoon flows into the illinois is the key to their position along this stretch of the river and theyve got one of their prison camps right outside of town our objective is breaking in there and getting some of those people out if we can do it here maybe well be able to do it down at cairo and even in st louis if were going to win this war we have to break their grip on the mississippi sir lets us worry about doin this here little one right mutt said we manage that then the brass can start thinkin big herman muldoon nodded vigorously after a moment so did szymanski that makes sense he said ive been promised that well have one hell of a diversion laid on when we go tonight i dont mean just the stuff on the spoon river either we already know about that its part of the basic plan but thisll be something special i know that much even if they havent told me what itll be air support muldoon asked his voice eager when they have some they dont want to talk about it in case somebody gets nabbed and spills his guts i dont know and what i dont know i cant tell you szymanski answered if you want to make like that proves your point go ahead dont go telling the troops thats what it is though because if it turns out not to be their morale will suffer got it yes sir muldoon said mutt nodded if there wasnt any air support or some kind of pretty juicy diversion a lot more than their morale would suffer he didnt say anything about that szymanski was still a kid but he wasnt a fool he could figure things out for himself any more questions szymanski asked mutt didnt say anything neither did muldoon the captain folded up the map again and stuck it back in his pocket okay then we wait for nightfall and we do it he got up and went off to brief his other platoon he makes it sound easy mutt said he peered out through the screen of willow branches that hung down into the water andhe devoutly hopedkept the lizards on the other side of the illinois from figuring out what the americans were up to ducks quacked on the far side of the river the marshes over there were a national wildlife refuge mutt wished he could row across with a shotgun instead of the tommy gun he was toting there had been an observation post over there on top of a steel tower a hundred feet high that had given the game wardens a dandy view of poachers these days it would have given the lizards a dandy view of the surrounding countryside but it had been blown up in one round or another of the fighting over central illinois troops were scattered up and down the river to escape detection if possible and to seem like routine patrols if they were spotted mutt and muldoon made the rounds telling the men what szymanski had told them it wasnt fresh news theyd been getting ready for this mission quite a while now telling them one more time what they were supposed to do wasnt going to hurt though more times than he could count mutt had seen a ballplayer swing when hed got the bunt sign or take when the hit and run was on somebody was still likely to foul up some way or other even after a last goround mutt had long since given up expecting perfection in men or their plans twilight fell then darkness in the water a fish leaped and fell back with a splash back when mutt had gone through this country in his minorleague playing days theyd taken more fish out of the illinois than from any other river save the columbia it wasnt like that now not with so many factories pouring filth into the water but you could still do all right with a rod and reel or even with a pole and a string and a hook mutt looked down at his watch the softly glowing numbers and hands told him it was a quarter to ten into the boats he whispered and quietly god damn it or were dead meat before we even get goin at exactly ten oclock by his watch he and the rest of the company started rowing down the illinois toward havana the oars seemed to make a dreadful racket as they dipped into the water and splashed out again but no lizard machine guns opened up on the far side of the river mutt sighed with relief hed been afraid they were heading into a trap right from the start at artillery and mortars and machine guns opened up on havana from the west and south right on time mutt said in the sudden chaos noise from the boats mattered a lot less the lizards reacted promptly with artillery of their own and with smallarms fire daniels tried to gauge whether they were shifting troops from the camp which was north of havana to meet the noisy obvious threat the americans were showing them for his sake he hoped they were a hot yellow glow sprang up in the southwest and swiftly spread toward havana mutt wanted to whoop with glee but had the good sense to keep his voice down they really went and did it boys they lit off the spoon river how many gallons of gas and oil did they pour into it before they lit a match somebody in the boat said how long could that stuff keep a tank running or a plane i dunno mutt answered i figure theyre usin it against the enemy this way too an if it rattles the lizards so much that they forget to shoot at me i aint gonna complain now come on boys we gotta pull like bastards get across the illinois before the spoon runs into it we dont manage thathe let out a wheezy chuckleour goose is cooked little tongues of flame drifting on the water were already at the junction of the rivers and starting to flow down the illinois more floating fire followed the lizards didnt run gunboats along the river or anything like that so the fire wasnt likely to do them any real harm but it did draw their attention toward the spoon and the territory west of itand away from the boats sliding down the illinois toward havana from the north come on pull hard come on come mutt tumbled off his seat in the middle of a word when the boat ran hard aground he came up laughing if you made a fool of yourself in front of your men you had to admit it he jumped out onto the riverbank mud squelched under his boots lets go break our boys outta stir he looked away from the burning spoon river to let his eyes adapt to the darkness that black shape there wasnt forest the forest around it had been cut down he waved an arm to urge his men after him and trotted toward the lizards prison camp not too far away sergeant muldoon was warning spread out you dumb bastards you want em to go picking you off the easy way the prison camp was designed more to keep people in than to keep them out nothing prevented the americans from drawing close to the main gate which lay on the northern side mutt in fact was beginning to think they could march on in when a couple of lizards did open up on them from a little guardhouse grenades and submachinegun fire quickly suppressed the opposition come on hurry up mutt yelled all the same if those scaly sons of bitches had a radio were gonna get company up here pretty damn quick soldiers with wire cutters attacked the razor wire of the gateway from inside the camp menand womenroused by the gunfire mutt hoped nobody or at least not too many people had stopped stray bullets crowded up to the gate as soon as there was a pathway out of the camp for them they started pouring forth captain szymanski shouted anybody who wants to go back to fighting the lizards full time come with us lord knows youll be welcome otherwise folks scatter as best you can we can use guerrillas too and a lot of people round about here will give you shelter and share what theyve got good luck to you god bless you sir a man called more echoed that some people stuck close to their rescuers others melted away into the night firing picked up off to the south and rapidly started getting closer skirmish line forward mutt called we gotta hold em off as long as we can give people a chance to get away no sooner were the words out of his mouth than what sounded like a hell of a big bomb landed right next to the advancing lizards he looked around wildly he hadnt heard any airplanes in the neighborhood he still didnt as a matter of fact but a long rumble of cloven air came from the sky then slowly faded it was as if the explosive or whatever it was had arrived before word of its coming thats got to be an american longrange rocket bomb captain szymanski said whatever it was the lizards werent steaming forward now the way they had been a few minutes later another one of those rocket bombs went off this one by the sound of it a couple of miles away from any of the fighting around havana the missiles didnt seem to be what youd call accurate they could have come down here as easily as on the lizardsbut try stopping them daniels thoughtgo ahead and try in the darkness he found szymanski sir i think its about time to get the hell out of here we stay around tryin to do more than we can a lot of usll end up dead youre probably right lieutenant the company commander said no youre certainly right he raised his voice back to the river men piling into one of the boatsnow crowded almost to sinking with rescued prisonersfelt very good to mutt getting back across the illinois though made him sweat big drops if a lizard helicopter came chattering by overhead just now there wouldnt only be fire on the water thered be blood in it too everybody understood that the men at the oars pulled like maniacs as they got over to the west bank of the river stumbling out of the boat and away mutt wondered if sam yeager had made the acquaintance of these fancy rockets he also wondered as he had ever since theyd separated outside chicago whether sam was still alive to have met them what with all the funny pulp magazines hed always read hed be in better shape to make sense of this crazy new world than damn near anybody else not that anything makes sense any more daniels muttered and set about getting his men under cover a coalfired generator chugged down in the basement of dover college david goldfarb felt the throbbing in his bones he could hear it too but didnt unless he made a conscious effort to do so as long as it went on lightbulbs shone wireless sets played radar worked and he could pretend the world was as it had been back before the lizards came when he remarked on that basil roundbush said in my humble opinionhe was about as humble as the pope was jewish but at least he knew itplaying those games doesnt much help as soon as we leave the laboratory the real world rudely steps up and kicks us in the teeth too right it does goldfarb said even with every spare square inch of the island growing wheat and potatoes and mangelwurzels heaven only knows how were going to feed everyone oh indeed roundbushs mustache fluffed as he blew air out through it rations were dreary enough when we were just fighting the jerries its worse nowand the yanks these days havent the wherewithal to ship their surpluses over to us for that matter they havent got surpluses any more either from all ive heard goldfarb grunted and nodded then he took a video platterthe name that seemed to have stuck for the shimmering disks on which the lizards stored sounds and picturesand fed it into the captured machine that played it what have you got there roundbush asked i wont know till i hit the switch that makes it play goldfarb answered i think they just dumped every video platter they could find into a crate and sent them all here we get a few that are actually useful to us and we get to label the ones that arent and ship them on to people for whom they might come in handy bloody inefficient way of doing things roundbush grumbled but he mooched over to see what the platter would yield you never could tell the british had captured a lot of them in the process of driving the lizards off their island some were entertainments some seemed to contain payrolls and such and some were the lizard equivalent of manuals those were the real prizes goldfarb flicked the switch unlike the valves human electronics used lizard gadgets didnt need a minute or two to warm up before they started working the screen showed the image of a lizard tank having faced such beasts on the ground goldfarb had a wholesome respect for them nonetheless they werent what he was after he watched for a couple of minutes to confirm that the video platter was indeed a tank maintenance manual then shut it off and made the player spit out the platter after hed done that he wrapped it in a sheet of paper on which be scribbled its subject he picked up another one and fed it into the machine it showed scenes of a city on the lizards home planetwhether it was a travelogue or a drama he couldnt tell i hear some of these have been found with blue movies on them roundbush remarked as goldfarb removed the video platter and labeled with its possible categories the paper he used to wrap it good heavens who cares goldfarb said watching lizards rut wouldnt getmy juices flowing i tell you that you misunderstand old chap roundbush answered i mean blue movies of our own kind of people theres this one chinese woman im told who shows up in a lot of them and also in one where shes having a baby why do the lizards care about that goldfarb said we must be as ugly to them as they are to us id bet its a rumor the brass started to give us a reason to keep sifting through these bloody things roundbush laughed i hadnt thought of that and i shouldnt be the least bit surprised if you were right how many more platters do you plan to go through this session oh perhaps another six or eight goldfarb said after a moments thought then ill have wasted enough time on them for a while and i can go back to making little futile lunges at the innards of the radar set there he pointed to the array of electronic components spread out over his workbench in what he hoped was a logical sensible arrangement the first three video platters held nothing of any earthly use to himnothing of any earthly use to anybody earthly he thought two of them were nothing but endless columns of lizard chicken scratches most likely the mechanized equivalent of a divisions worth of paybooks the third showed a lizard spaceship and some weird creatures who werent lizards goldfarb wondered if it was fact or the alien version of buck rogers or flash gordon tworeelers maybe some boffin would be able to figure it out he couldnt he took out the platter and stuck in another one as soon as it started to play basil roundbush let out a whoop and thumped him on the back there on the screen stood a lizard in mediumfancy body paint disassembling a jet engine that lay on a large table in front of him engines were roundbushs speciality not his own but he watched with the raf officer for a while even without understanding the lizards language he learned a lot from the platter roundbush was frantically scribbling notes as he watched if only group captain hipple could see this he muttered several times weve been saying that for a long time now goldfarb answered unhappily i dont think its going to happen he kept watching the video platter some of the animation and trick photography the lizard instructor used to get his point across far outdistanced anything the disney people had done insnow white orfantasia he wondered how theyd managed several of the effects however they did it they took it as much for granted as he didor rather as he hadwhen he flicked a wall switch to make light come out of a ceiling fixture when the instructional film was over roundbush shook himself as if he were a dog emerging from a chilly stream we definitely need to keep that one he said would be nice if we had the services of a lizard prisoner too so we could find out what the blighter was actually saying that business with the turbine blades for instancewas he telling the technicians to fiddle with them or not to mess about with them under any circumstances i dont know goldfarb said we ought to find out though and not by experimenting if we can help it he made the player spit out the video platter wrapped it and labeled it and set it on a pile separate from the others that done he glanced at his wristwatch good heavens has it got round to seven oclock already that it has roundbush answered seeing as weve been here for something on the close order of thirteen hours id say weve earned the chance to knock off too how say you id like to see what the rest of these platters are first goldfarb said after that ill worry about things like food such devotion to duty roundbush said chuckling among the things like food youll be worrying about unless im much mistaken would be a pint or two at the white horse inn goldfarb wondered whether his ears were hot enough to glow on their own if he turned out the lights he tried to keep his voice casual as he answered now that you mention it yes dont be embarrassed old man now roundbush laughed out loud believe me im jealous of you that naomi of yours is a lovely girl and she thinks the sun rises and sets on you too he poked goldfarb in the ribs we shant tell her any different what erno goldfarb said embarrassed still he fed the remaining video platters hed picked into the player one at a time he hoped none of them would prove to be about the care and feeding of radars he even hoped none of them would be blue movies featuring roundbushs probably legendary chinese woman he didnt tell his colleague that roundbush would have claimed someone was sprinkling saltpeter on his food he was in luck a couple of minutes watching was plenty to show him none of the platters was either relevant to his work or pornographic as the player ejected the last of them basil roundbush gently booted him in the backside go on old man ill keep the fires burning here and try not to burn down the building while im about it with england on double summer time the sun was still in the sky when goldfarb got outside he swung aboard his bicycle and pedaled north toward the white horse inn like a lot of establishments these days the pub had a bicycle guard outside to make sure the twowheelers didnt pedal off of their own accord while their owners were within inside torches blazed in wall sconces a hearty fire roared in the hearth since the place was packed with people that left it hot and smoky as it didnt have a generator chugging away though the blazes were necessary to give it light a couple of chickens roasted above the hearth fire their savory smell made spit rush into goldfarbs mouth he made his way toward the bar whatll it be dearie sylvia asked naomi was carrying a tray of mugs and glasses from table to table she spotted goldfarb through the crowd and waved to him he waved back then said to sylvia pint of bitter and are all the pieces from those birds spoken for yet he pointed toward the fireplace no not yet the redheaded barmaid answered which dyou fancylegs or breasts well i think id like a nice juicy thigh he answeredand then caught the double entendre sylvia laughed uproariously at the look on his face she poured him his beer he raised the pint pot to his mouth in a hurry not least to help mask himself youre blushing sylvia chortled i am not he said indignantly and even if i was youd have the devils own time proving it by firelight so i would so i would sylvia said laughing still she ran her tongue over her upper lip goldfarb was urgently remindedas he was intended to be remindedtheyd been lovers not that long before she might as well have been telling himsee what youre missing she said ill get you that chicken now when she headed toward the fireplace she put even more sway in her walk than she usually did naomi came over a minute later what were you two laughing about she asked to goldfarbs relief she sounded curious not suspicious he told her the truth if he hadnt sylvia would have naomi laughed too sylvia is very funny she said and then in a lower voice sometimes maybe too much for her own good whose own good sylvia asked returning with a steaming chicken leg on a plate has to be me i tell too many jokes for my own good likely i do by jesus but im not joking when i tell you that chickens going to cost you two quid goldfarb dug in his pocket for the banknotes prices had climbed dizzyingly high since the lizard invasion and his radarmans pay hadnt come close to keeping up even so there were times when the rations he got grew too boring to stand besides he said as he set the money on the bar what better have i got to spend it on me naomi answered had that been sylvia talking the response would have been frankly mercenary naomi didnt really care that he couldnt spend like an air vice marshal that was one of the things that made her seem wonderful to him she asked have you got more word of your cousin the one who did the wireless broadcasts for the lizards he shook his head my family found that he lived through the invasion that much i do know but not long after that he and his wife and their son might as well have dropped off the face of the earth nobody knows whats become of them somebody knows naomi said with conviction as goldfarb dug into the chicken leg no one may be talking but someone knows in this country people do not disappear for no reason sometimes i think you do not know how lucky you are that this is so i know goldfarb said and after a moment naomi nodded conceding the point he smiled at her even if crookedly whats the matter did you take me for an englishman again looking a little flustered she nodded once more he dropped into yiddish to say if we win the war and if i have children or maybe grandchildren theyll take that for granted me he shook his head if you have children or maybe grandchildren naomi began and then let it drop the war had loosened everyones standards but she still wasnt what youd call forward sometimes goldfarb regretted that very much sometimes he admired it tremendously tonight was one of those nights let me have another pint would you please he said sometimes quiet talkor what they could steal of it while she was also busy serving other customerswas as good as anything else maybe better he hadnt thought that with sylvia all hed wanted to do with her was to get her brassiere off and her panties down he scratched his head wondering where the difference was naomi brought him the bitter he took a pull then set the pot down must be love he said but she didnt hear him artillery was harassing the race in a push north from their florida base the big uglies were getting smart about moving their guns before counterbattery fire found them but they couldnt do much about attack from the air teerts had two pods of rockets mounted under his killercraft they were some of the simplest weapons in the arsenal of the race they werent even guided if you saturated an area with them that did the job and because they were so simple even tosevite factories could turn them out in large quantities the armorers loved them these days not least because they had plenty i have acquired the assigned target visually teerts reported back to his commanders i now begin the dive on it acceleration pressed him back in his seat the big uglies knew he was there antiaircraft shells burst around his killercraft many more he guessed were bursting behind him try as they would the tosevites rarely gave jet aircraft enough lead when they fired at them that helped keep the races pilots alive he fired a pod of the rockets a wave of fire seemed to leap from the killercraft toward the artillery positions the killercraft staggered slightly in the sky then steadied the autopilot pulled it out of the dive he swung it around so he could inspect the damage hed done if he hadnt done enough hed make another pass with the second rocket pod that wouldnt be necessary not today the target is destroyed he said in some satisfaction an antiaircraft gun was still popping away at him but that didnt much matter he went on request new target the voice that answered wasnt his usual flight controller after a moment he recognized it all the same it belonged to aaatos the male from intelligence flight leader teerts we have a bit of a problem whats gone wrong now teerts demanded what felt like an eternity in nipponese prisonsto say nothing of the ginger habit hed developed therehad left him with no patience for euphemism im glad youre airborne flight leader aaatos said apparently not wanting to give a straight answer do you remember our talk not so long ago in that grassy area not far from the runways teerts thought back i remember he said sudden suspicion blossomed in him youre not going to tell me the darkskinned big uglies have mutinied against us are you evidently i dont have to aaatos said unhappily you were correct at the time to distrust them i admit this for a male from intelligence to admit anything was an enormous concession their unit was placed in line against american big uglies and under cover of a masking firefight has allowed enemy tosevites to infiltrate give me the coordinates teerts told him i still have a good supply of munitions and adequate fuel as well i gather i am to assume any tosevites i see in the area are hostile to the race that is indeed the operative assumption aaatos agreed he paused then went on flight leader a question if i may you need not answer but i would be grateful if you did our estimates were that these darkskinned big uglies would serve us well and loyally in the role we had assigned to them these estimates were not casually made our experts ran computer simulations of a good many scenarios yet they proved inaccurate and your casual concern correct how do you account for this my impression is that our alleged experts have never had to learn what good liars the big uglies can be teerts answered they have also never been in a situation where from weakness they have to tell their interrogators exactly what those males most desire to hear i have again memories of his days in nipponese captivity surged to the surface his hand quivered on the killercrafts control column knowing the tosevites capacity for guile and also knowing the interrogators were apt to be getting bad data on which to base their fancy simulations i drew my own conclusions perhaps you would consider transferring to intelligence aaatos said such trenchant analyses would be of benefit to us flying a killercraft is also of benefit to the race teerts answered especially at a time such as this aaatos made no reply teerts wondered whether the male from intelligence was chastened or merely insulted he didnt much care the analysts had made foolish assumptions reasoned from them with undoubtedly flawless logic and ended up worse off than if theyd done nothing at all his mouth dropped open in a bitter laugh somehow that left him unsurprised smoke from burning forests and fields showed him he was nearing the site of the treasonaided american breakthrough he saw several blazing landcruisers of the races manufacture and more of the slower clumsier ones the big uglies used with those were advancing tosevites their upright gait and stiff motions making them unmistakable even as he roared past at high speed he loosed the second pod of rockets at the biggest concentration of big uglies he could find then gained altitude to come round for another pass at them the ground seemed to blaze with the little yellow flames of smallarms fire as survivors tried to bring him down no one had ever denied that the tosevites showed courage sometimes though courage was not enough teerts dove for another firing run pillars of greasy black smoke marked the pyres of hydrocarbonfueled vehicles his first barrage had done some good his fingerclaw stabbed the firing button at the top of the control column he hosed down the area with cannon fire till warning lights told him he was down to his last thirty rounds doctrine demanded that he leave off at that point in case he had to engage tosevite aircraft on his way back to base the itch take doctrine he muttered and kept firing until the cannon had no more ammunition to expend he checked his fuel gauge he was running low on hydrogen too adding everything together he wasnt much use on the battlefield any more he headed back to the air base to replenish fuel and munitions both if the tosevite breakthrough wasnt checked by the time he got that done theyd probably send him straight out again a male of the race drove the fuel truck up to his killercraft but two big uglies unreeled the hose and connected it to the couplings in the nose of his machine more big uglies loaded cannon shells into his killercraft and affixed fresh rocket pods to two of the hardpoints below the wings the tosevites sang as they worked music alien to his hearing diaphragms but deep and rhythmic and somehow very powerful they wore only leg coverings and shoes their darkskinned torsos glistened with cooling moisture under a sun that even teerts found comfortable he watched the big uglies warily males just like them had shown they were traitors how was he supposed to be sure these fellows hadnt say arranged a rocket so it would blow up in the pod rather than after it was launched he couldnt know not for certain not till he used those rockets there werent enough males of the race to do everything that needed doing if they didnt have help from the tosevites the war effort would likely fail if the big uglies ever fully realized that the war effort would also likely fail he did his best to push such thoughts out of his mind all the electronics said the killercraft was ready in every way flight leader teerts reporting he said i am prepared to return to combat instead of the clearance and fresh orders hed expected the air traffic control male said hold on flight leader we are generating something new for you stay on this frequency it shall be done teerts said wondering what sort of brainaddled fit had befallen his superiors now there was a job right in front of his snout that badly needed doing so why were they wasting their time and his trying to come up with something exotic since he evidently wasnt going straight back into action he dug out his vial of ginger from the space between the padding and the cockpit wall and had a good taste with the herb coursing through him he was ready to go out and slaughter big uglies even without his aircraft flight leader teerts the traffic control males voice boomed in the audio button taped to teerts hearing diaphragm you are hereby detached from duty at this florida air base and ordered to report to our forward base in the region known to the local tosevites as kansas there to assist the race in its attack on the center bearing the local name denver flight instructions are being downloaded to your piloting computer as we speak you will also require a drop tank of hydrogen this will be provided to you sure enough a new truck came rolling up to teerts killercraft a couple of males got out lowered the dropletshaped tank onto a wheeled cart with a winch and hooked it up under the belly of the killercraft as he listened to their clattering he was heartily glad the race didnt entrust that job to big ugly hirelings the potential for disaster was much too high he let out a puzzled hiss the tosevites had scored a breakthrough on this front he knew perfectly well that his bombardment hadnt halted them singlehandedly yet the base commander was sending him away to serve on another front did that mean the race was overwhelmingly confident of stopping the big uglies here or that the attack onwhat was the name of the place denver the trafficcontrol male had called it stood in desperate need of help he couldnt very well ask but hed find out he checked the computer sure enough it had the course information for the flight to kansas a good thing too because he didnt know where on this land mass the region was the technicians finished installing the drop tank they got back into their truck it sped away flight leader teerts you are cleared for takeoff the traffic control male said report to the kansas forward base it shall be done teerts gave the engine power and taxied down the runway toward the end whenever george bagnall went into the gloom of thekrom at pskov these days he felt his own spirits sinking into darkness too he wished aleksandr german had never mentioned the possibility of sending him ken embry and jerome jones back to england before hed resigned himself to going on here in this godforsaken corner of the soviet union but with even the slightest chance of getting home again he found both the place and the work he did here ever more unbearable inside thekrom german sentries came to attention stiff as rigor mortis their russian opposite numbers most of them in baggy civilian clothes rather than uniforms that had been laundered too many times didnt look as smart but the submachine guns they carried would chew a man to pieces in short order bagnall went up the stairs to lieutenant general kurt chills headquarters the stairwell was almost black neither occasional slit windows nor tallow lamps right out of the fourteenth century did much to show him where to put his feet every time he got up to the first floor he thanked his lucky stars he hadnt broken his neck he found embry up there ahead of him shooting the breeze with captain hans dolger chills adjutant as far as bagnall could tell dolger didnt much fancy englishmen but he made a point of being correct and polite as arguments in pskov had a way of being settled with bullets as often as with words politeness was a rarity worth noting dolger looked up when bagnall came inguten tag he said for a moment i thought you might be one of the partisan brigadiers but i know that was foolish of me as well expect the sun to set in the east as a russian to show up when he is scheduled i think being lateor at least not worrying about being on timeis built into the russian language bagnall answered in german hed done german in school but had learned what russian he had since coming to pskov he found it fascinating and frustrating in almost equal measure it has a verb form for doing something continuously and a verb form for doing something once but pinning down the momentright now is anything but easy this is true dolger said it makes matters more difficult even if russian had the full complement of tenses of a civilized language however i am of the opinion that our comrades the partisan brigadiers would be late anyhow simply because that is in their nature a lot of germans in pskov from what bagnall had seen had stopped automatically thinking of russians asuntermenschen captain dolger was not among their number aleksandr german arrived twenty minutes late nikolai vasiliev twenty minutes after him neither man showed concern or even awareness of a problem with the brigadiers in front of him captain dolger was a model of military punctilio no matter what he said about them behind their backs bagnall gave him points for that he embodied some of the same traits as were found in a good butler kurt chill grunted when the russians and the englishmen who were supposed to lubricate sovietgerman relations entered his chamber by the scraps of paper that littered his desk hed had plenty to keep him busy while he waited the meeting was the usual wrangle vasiliev and aleksandr german wanted chill to commit morewehrmacht men to frontline fighting chill wanted to hold them in reserve to meet breakthroughs because they were more mobile and more heavily armed than their soviet counterparts it was almost like a chess opening for some time each side knew the moves the other was likely to make and knew how to counter them this time grudgingly urged along by bagnall and embry kurt chill made concessions good good nikolai vasiliev rumbled down deep in his chest sounding like a bear waking up after a long winters nap you englishmen you have some use i am glad you think so bagnall said though he wasnt particularly glad if vasiliev thought them useful here aleksandr german probably did too and if aleksandr german thought them useful here would he help them get back to england as hed hinted he might lieutenant general chill looked disgusted with the world i still maintain that expending your strategic reserve will sooner or later leave you without necessary resources for a crisis but we shall hope this particular use does not create that difficulty his glance flicked to bagnall and embry you are dismissed gentlemen hed added that last word no doubt to irk the partisan brigadiers to whomgentlemen should have beencomrades bagnall refused to concern himself with fine points of language he got up from his seat and quickly headed for the door any chance to get out of the gloom of thekrom was worth taking ken embry followed him without hesitation outside the bright sunshine made bagnall blink during the winter the sun seemed to have gone away for good now it stayed in the sky more and more until when summer came it would hardly seem to leave the pskova river had running water in it again the ice was all melted the land burgeonedfor a little while in the marketplace not far from thekrom thebabushkas sat and gossiped among themselves and displayed for sale or trade eggs and pork and matches and paper and all sorts of things that should by rights long since have vanished from pskov bagnall wondered how they came by them hed even asked a couple of times but the womens faces grew closed and impassive and they pretended not to understand himnone of your business they said without saying a word over on the edge of the city a few scattered gunshots broke out all through the marketplace heads came up in alarm oh bloody hell bagnall exclaimed are the nazis and bolshies hammering at each other again that had happened too often already in pskov gunshots came closer to the marketplace so did a low roar that put bagnall in mind of one of the lizards jet fighters but seemed only a few feet off the ground a long lean whitepainted shape darted through the market square dodged around the church of the archangel michael and the cathedral of the trinity and slammed into thekrom the explosion knocked bagnall off his feet but not before he saw another white dart follow the course of its predecessor and hit thekrom the second blast knocked embry down beside him flying bombs the pilot bawled in his ear he heard embry as if from very far away after the two blasts his ears seemed wrapped in thick cotton batting embry went on they havent bothered with thekrom in a long time they must have found a traitor to let them know our headquarters was there a russian angry at having to serve alongside the nazis awehrmacht man captured when trying to help red army troops he hated worse than any lizard bagnall didnt know he knew he never would know in the end it didnt matter however it had happened the damage was done he staggered to his feet and ran back toward the fortress that had been the core around which the town of pskov grew the great gray stones had been proof against arrows and muskets against high explosives precisely aimed they were useless or maybe worse than useless when they toppled they crushed those whom blast alone might have spared during the blitzand how long ago that seemed unreinforced brick buildings in london had been death traps for the same reason smoke began rising from the wreckage the walls of thekrom were stone but so much inside was wood and every lamp in there was a fire that would spread given fuel the lamps had been given fuel all right the screams and groans of the wounded reached bagnalls ears stunned though they were he saw a hand sticking up between two blocks of stone grunting he and embry shoved one of those stones aside blood clung to the base of it and dripped the german soldier whod been crushed under there would never need help again men and women russians and germans came running to rescue their comrades a few more alert than the rest carried stout timbers to lever heavy stones off injured men bagnall lent the strength of his back and arms to one such gang a stone went over with a crash the fellow groaning beneath it had a ruined leg but might live they found aleksandr german his left hand was crushed between two stones but past that he hardly seemed hurt a red smear beneath a nearby stone the size of a motorcar was all that was left of kurt chill and nikolai vasiliev flames started peeping out between stones the little crackling noise they made was in and of itself a jolly sound but one that brought horror with it soldiers trapped in the rubble shrieked as fire found them before rescuers could smoke grew ever thicker choking bagnall making his eyes run and his lungs burn as if theyd caught fire themselves it was as if he was working inside a woodburning stove every so often too he smelled roasting meat sickenedfor he knew what meat that washe struggled harder than ever to save as much as many as he could not enough not enough hand pumps brought water from the river onto the fire but could not hold it at bay the flames drove the rescuers away from those they would save drove them back in defeat bagnall stared at ken embry in exhausted dismay the pilots face was haggard and black with soot save for a few clean tracks carved by sweat he had a burn on one cheek and a cut under the other eye bagnall was sure he looked no better himself what the devil do we do now he said his mouth was full of smoke as if hed had three packs of cigarettes all at once when he spat to get rid of some of it his saliva came out dark dark brown the german commandant dead one of the russian brigadiers with him the other one wounded embry wiped his forehead with the back of his hand since one was as filthy as the other neither changed color wearily the pilot answered damned if i know pick up the pieces and go on as best we can i suppose what else is there to do nothing i can think of bagnall said but oh to be in england in the springtime that dream was gone smashed as terribly as aleksandr germans hand what was left was the ruins of pskov embry s answer was the best choice they had it was still pretty lousy air raid sirens screamed like the souls in the hell polish catholic priests took such delight in describing moishe russie hadnt believed in eternal punishments of that sort now after enduring air raids in warsaw and london and wherever in palestine this was he wondered if hell wasnt real after all the door to his cell opened the hardfaced guard hed learned to loathe stood in the doorway the fellow had a sten gun in each hand even for him that much weaponry struck moishe as excessive then to russies amazement the guard handed him one of the weapons here take it he said impatiently youre being liberated as if to emphasize the point he pulled a couple of magazines from his belt and gave them to russie too by their weight they were full treat em like you would a woman the guard advised they get bent up especially at the top and they wont feed right what do you mean im being liberated moishe demanded almost indignantly events had got ahead of him even with a weapon in his hands he felt anything but safe would they let him out of his cell let him walk round the corner and then riddle him with bullets the nazis had played tricks like that the guard exhaled in exasperation dont be stupid russie the lizards invaded palestine without cutting any deals with us looks like theyre going to win here too so were making sure they see were on the right sidewere giving the british all the trouble they want all the trouble we can but we dont have a deal over you with the lizards either if they ask for you when the fightings done we dont want to be in a place where we have to say yes or no you arent ours we dont have to you get it now in a crazy sort of way moishe did get it the jewish underground could have kept him while denying to the lizards they were doing so but that exposed them to the risk of being found out my family he asked id have taken you to them by now if you hadnt started banging your gums the guard told him he squawked indignant protest which the other jew ignored turning his back and giving moishe the choice of following or staying where he was he followed he went down hallways hed never seen before up till now theyd always brought rivka or reuven to him not the other way around turning a corner he almost ran into menachem begin the underground leader saidnu you were right russie the lizards arent to be trusted well deal with them as best we can and then well make their lives miserable how does that sound ive heard worse moishe said but ive also heard better you should have stood with the british against the lizards from the beginning and gone down with them for they will go down no thank you begin started to head down the hall wait moishe called after him before you turn me loose at least tell me where i am the underground leader and the toughlooking guard both started to laugh thats right you never did find out menachem begin said now it doesnt hurt us for you to know youre in jerusalem russie not far from the one wall of the temple thats still left standing after an awkward half wave he hurried away on whatever his own mission was jerusalem moishe stood staring for a moment the guard vanished round a corner before he noticed his charge wasnt coming after him he stuck his head and upper body back into sight and waved impatiently as if awakening from a dream moishe started moving again the guard took a key from his belt and used it to unlock a door like any other door what do you want rivka exclaimed her voice sharp with alarm then she saw moishe behind the guard who was both taller and broader than he whats going on she asked in an entirely different tone of voice she got a condensed version of the story the guard had given moishe he didnt know how much of it she believed he didnt know how much of it he believed himself although the submachine gun he carried was a potent argument for there being some truth to it come on the guard said youre getting out of here right now give us some money rivka said moishe shook his head in chagrin he hadnt even thought of that evidently the guard had he reached into a trouser pocket and pulled out a roll of bills that would have made a man rich before the war and now might keep him eating till he found work moishe handed the roll to rivka as the guard snorted he bent to hug reuven do you know where we are he asked his son palestine of course reuven answered scornfully as if wondering what was wrong with him not just palestinejerusalem moishe said the guard snorted again this time at reuvens wideeyed wonder he said out you go now the lot of you the strides with which he led them toward the street had made no concessions to the boys short legs moishe grabbed reuvens hand to help his son keep up how strangehe thoughtto be holding reuven with one hand and a sten gun in the other hed wanted to fight the lizards ever since they twisted his words in poland he had fought them with medics kit and with wireless broadcasts now he had a gun mordechai anielewicz had convinced him that was not his best weapon but it was better than nothing here the guard slid back a bar from the front doors the doors and the bar looked as if they could withstand anything short of a tank running into them the guard grunted as he pushed the stout portals open wide enough for moishe and his family to squeeze through as soon as they were out on the street he said good luck and closed the doors behind them the scrape of the bar sliding back into place behind them sounded very final moishe looked around to be in jerusalem without looking aroundthat seemed a sin what he saw was chaos hed seen that before in warsaw london hadnt shown him as much the british had been under attack from the sky long before he got there and had learned to cope as best they could and in any case they were far more phlegmatic than poles or jews or arabs the russies walked a couple of blocks then someone shouted at them get off the street you fools not until he was running for a doorway did moishe realize the yell had been in english not yiddish or hebrew a khakiclad soldier ignoring his own advice fired at the lizard planes overhead he cant knock them down papa reuven said seriously his brief life had made him an expert on air raids doesnt he know that he knows it moishe answered hes trying anyhow because he is brave bombs crashed down not too close the war had honed moishes ears too he heard sharp whistling in the sky then more explosions the wall against which he was leaning shook those arent bombs papa reuven exclaimedyes he was a connoisseur of such things thats artillery youre right again moishe said if the lizards were landing artillery in jerusalem they couldnt be far away he wanted to flee the city but how and where would he go a new set of shells landed these nearer to him fragments hissed through the air what had been a house was suddenly transformed into a pile of rubble an arab woman with veil and headcloth and robes covering her down to her toes emerged from the building next door to it running for new shelter like a beetle when the stone under which it huddles is disturbed a shell landed in the street only a few meters from her after that she didnt run she lay and writhed and screamed shes hurt bad reuven said in that alarmingly knowing way of his moishe ran out to do what he could for her without medicines without instruments he knew how little that would be be careful rivka called after him he nodded but laughed a little under his breath as if he could be careful now that was up to the shells not to him blood pooled under the woman she wailed in arabic which moishe didnt understand he told her he was a doctormedical student didnt pack enough punchusing german yiddish polish and english she didnt follow any of them when he tried to tear her robe to bandage a wound high up in her leg she fought him as if she thought he was going to rape her right there maybe she did think that an arab man came up what you do jew he asked in bad hebrew then in worse english im a doctor i try to help her moishe also spoke in both languages the man turned his words into rapidfire arabic halfway through the woman stopped struggling it wasnt because she acquiesced moishe grabbed for her wrist he found no pulse when he let her arm drop the arab man knew what that meantlnshallah he said and then in english the will of god good you try to help jew doctor with a nod he walked away shaking his head russie went back to his family now too late for the poor woman the lizard bombardment was easing staying close to the sides of buildings in case it picked up again moishe led his wife and son through the streets of jerusalem he didnt know just what he was looking for he would have taken a way out of the city a good shelter or a glimpse of the wailing wall before he got any of those a spatter of smallarms fire broke out no more than a few hundred meters away are the lizards here rivka exclaimed i dont think so moishe answered i think its the jewish underground rising against the british oyrivka and reuven said it together moishe nodded mournfully the shootingrifles submachine guns machine guns the occasionalpop of a mortarspread like wildfire fanning out in every direction inside a couple of minutes the russies were flat on their bellies in another doorway as bullets pinged and ricocheted all around several british soldiers in tin hats and khaki tunics and shorts dashed up the street one of them spotted moishe and his family he pointed his rifle at them and screamed dont move or youre dead you jew bastards that was when moishe remembered the submachine gun that lay on the ground beside himso much for taking up arms he thought take the gun he told the englishman you have us the soldier called permission to take prisoners sir that didnt mean anything to russie for a moment then it sank in if the man didnt get that permission he was going to shoot them and go on about his business moishe got ready to reach for the sten gun if he was going to go down hed go down fighting but a fellow with a second lieutenants single pips on his shoulder boards said yes take them back to the detention center if we start murdering theirs theyll slaughter ours the buggers he sounded weary and bitter beyond measure moishe hoped rivka hadnt followed what he said the british soldier darted forward to grab the submachine gun on your feet he said when moishe rose the soldier plucked the spare magazines from the waistband of his trousers hands high those hands come down youre deadyou the skirt the brat anybody moishe said that in yiddish so he was sure his wife and son got it march the englishman barked they marched the soldier led them into what looked as if it had been a market square now barbed wire and machinegun positions all around turned it into a prisoner camp to one side was a tall wall of large stones that looked to have been in place forever atop that wall stood a mosque whose golden dome was marred by a shell hole moishe realized what that wall had to be just as the british soldier herded him and his family into the barbedwire cage there they stayed the only sanitary arrangements were slop buckets by the barbed wire some people had blankets most didnt toward noon the guards distributed bread and cheese the portions were bigger than those hed known in the warsaw ghetto but not much water barrels had a common dipper he scowled at that it would make disease spread faster he and his family spent two miserable chilly nights sleeping huddled together on bare ground artillery shells fell all around some alarmingly close had any landed inside the barbedwire perimeter the slaughter would have been gruesome on the morning of the third day bigger explosions rocked jerusalem the british are pulling out exclaimed someone who sounded as if he knew what he was talking about theyre blowing up what they cant take with them moishe didnt know whether the fellow was right not then but before long the guards deserted their posts taking machine guns with them they hadnt been gone more than a few minutes before other men carrying guns entered the square fighters from the jewish underground the prisoners cheered themselves hoarse as their comrades released them from confinement but with the jews came lizards moishe stiffened wasnt that one there by the gate zolraag and at the same time as he recognized the lizard zolraag recognized him zolraag hissed in excitement we want this one he said and added an emphatic cough progress at last atvar said a pleasant breeze blew off the sea toward him he walked along the northern shore of the little triangular peninsula that separated egypt from palestine the warmth the sand the stones put him in mind of home it was very pleasant countryand yet hed had to come here by helicopter for the big uglies didnt bother with roads leading away from their railroad kirel paced beside him for a while without speaking perhaps the shiplord was also thinking of the world hed left behind for the sake of the greater glory of the emperor a couple of feathered flying creatures glided past the two males they were nothing like the leatherwinged fliers with which atvar had been familiar before coming to tosev and reminded him this was an alien world males and females hatched here after the colonization fleet arrived would find these tosevite animals normal unexceptional he didnt think he would ever grow used to them he didnt think he would ever grow used to big uglies either that didnt keep him from hoping to conquer their world in spite of everything progress he repeated the most important centers of palestine are in our hands the drive against denver advances most satisfactorily on the whole and we may yet triumph for kirel not to respond then would have implied he thought the fleetlord mistaken a male implied that at his peril these days and so kirel said truth in those areas we do advance that unfortunately reminded atvar of the many areas where the race still did not advance of poland where the deutsche were being troublesome in the extreme of china where holding the cities and roads left the countryside a sea of rebellionand where even control over the cities sometimes proved illusory of the sssr where gains in the west were counterbalanced by soviet advances in siberia of the central united states where missiles were making starships vulnerable of india where big uglies werent fighting much but showed a willingness to die rather than yielding to the commands of the race he hadnt come here to think about places like those and resolutely shoved them to the back of his mind even with the ugly flying creatures to remind him it wasnt quite home it was a place to relax enjoy decentbetter than decentweather and make the best of things resolutely sticking to that best he said we also have the agitator moishe russie in custody at last and his mate and their hatchling we can either control him through them or take vengeance upon him for the manifold troubles he has caused us this is also progress truth again exalted fleetlord kirel hesitated then went on before punishing him as he deserves it might be worthwhile to interrogate him to learn exactly why he turned against us after his initial cooperation despite all his subsequent propaganda this has never been completely clear i want him punished atvar said treason against the race is the inexpiable crime that wasnt strictly true not on tosev the race maintained polite relations with big uglies who had turned on it and then professed friendship once more antagonizing them for good would have caused more trouble than it solved but conditions on tosev created ambiguity and doubts in a great many areas why should that one be any different atvar had stated the letter of the law kirel said punished he shall surely be exalted fleetlordbut all in good time let us first learn all we can from him are we big uglies to act precipitately and destroy an opportunity without first learning if we can exploit it we shall be attempting to govern the tosevites for thousands of years to come what we learn from russie may give us a clue as to how to do it better ah atvar said now my chemoreceptors also detect the scent yes perhaps that could be beneficial as you say he is in our hands so punishment while certain need not be swift indeed most likely he will view our exploitation of him as punishment in its own right this world does its best to make me hasty i must remember now and again to resist x mordechai anielewicz had company as he approached the meeting with the nazis a squad of jews with submachine guns and rifles he wasnt supposed to bring along that kind of company but hed long since stopped worrying about what he was supposed to do he did what needed doing he waved his support squad vanished among the trees if anything went wrong at the meeting the germans would pay a couple of years before jewish fighters wouldnt have been so smooth about moving in the woods theyd had practice since anielewicz walked up the trail toward the clearing where he was supposed to confer with the nazis and see what heinrich jager had up his sleeveor what he said he had up his sleeve since that talk with the pole who called himself tadeusz anielewicz was leery about believing anything the german might tell him on the other hand he would have been leery about believing jager without talking to tadeusz too as hed been instructed he paused before entering the clearing and whistled the first few bars of beethovens fifth he found that a curious choice for the germans since those bars made a morse vforvictory the symbol of the antinazi underground before the lizards came but when somebody whistled back he advanced up the forest track and out into the open space there stood jager and beside him a tail broadshouldered man with a scar on his face and a glint in his eye the scar made the big mans expression hard to read mordechai couldnt tell if that was a friendly grin or a nasty one the german had on a privates tunic but if he was a private anielewicz was a priest jager said good day and offered his hand mordechai took it jager had always dealt fairly with him the german panzer colonel said anielewicz here is colonel otto skorzeny whos given the lizards more trouble than any ten men you could name mordechai kicked himself for not recognizing skorzeny the german propaganda machine had pumped out plenty of material about him if hed done a quarter of what gobbels claimed he was indeed a hero on the hoof now he stuck out his hand and boomed good to meet you anielewicz from what jager says you two are old friends we know each other yesstandartenfuhrer mordechai shook hands but deliberately used skorzenys ss rank rather than thewehrmacht equivalent jager had giveni know what you are so whatskorzenys eyes answered insolently he said isnt that sweet how do you feel about giving the lizards a boot in the balls they havent got them or you it doesnt much matter to me anielewicz kept his voice light casual skorzeny impressed him more than hed expected the man didnt seem to give a damn whether he lived or died mordechai had seen that before but never coupled with so much relentless energy if skorzeny died hed make sure he had a lot of choice company he studied anielewicz too doing his best to intimidate him with his presence mordechai stared back if the ss man wanted to try something hed be sorry he didnt try he laughed instead all right jew lets do business ive got a little toy for the lizards and i could use some help getting it right into the middle of lodz where itll do the most good sounds interesting mordechai said so what is this toy tell me about it skorzeny set a finger by the side of his nose and winked its the biggest goddamn ginger bomb you ever did see thats what not just the powdered stuff mind you but an aerosol thatll get all over everything in a huge area and keep the lizards too drugged up to get into it for a long time he leaned forward a little and lowered his voice weve tested it on lizard prisoners and its the straight goods itll drive em out of their skulls i bet it will anielewicz answeredsure it will if hes telling the truth is he if you were a mouse would you let a cat carry cheese down into your hole but if skorzeny was lying he didnt show it at all and if by some odd chance he was telling the truth the ginger bomb would wreak all the havoc he said it would mordechai could easily imagine the lizards battling one another in the streets because they were too full of ginger to think straight or even to do much thinking at all he wanted to believe skorzeny without jagers obscure warning he thought he would have believed skorzeny something about the ss man made you want to go in the direction he was pushing anielewicz had enough of that gift himself to recognize it in othersand skorzeny had a big dose anielewicz decided to prod a little to see what lay behind the bluff hearty facade why the devil should i trust you he demanded when has the ss ever meant anything but trouble for jews the ss means trouble for all enemies of thereich pride rang in skorzeny s voice in his own way he wasor seemedhonest anielewicz didnt know whether he preferred that or the hypocrisy hed been expecting skorzeny went on who now is the most dangerous enemy of thereich you kikes he shook his head of course not the lizards are the most dangerous we worry about them first and the rest of the shit later before the lizards came the soviet union had been the most dangerous enemy of thereich that hadnt stopped the nazis from building extermination camps in poland diverting resources they could have used to fight the bolsheviks anielewicz said all right suppose you drive the lizards away from lodz and warsaw what happens to us jews then skorzeny spread his big hands and shrugged i dont make policy i just kill people amazing that his grin could be disarming after he said something like that but it was you dont want to be around us though and we dont want you around so maybe we could ship you somewhere who knows to madagascar maybe they were talking about that before the lizards came but we didnt exactly own the seas now that twisted grin was wry or maybe even to palestine like i say who the hell knows he was glib he was convincing he was all the more frightening on account of that why use this thing in lodz mordechai asked why not at the front two reasons skorzeny answered first you get a lot more enemies in one place at concentration areas in the rear and second a lot of lizards at the front have some protection against gas warfare and that keeps the ginger out too he chuckled ginger is gas warfarehappy gas but gas anielewicz turned to heinrich jager what do you think of this will it work if it was up to you would you do it jagers face didnt show much but jagers face from what mordechai had seen seldom showed much he half regretted his words he was putting on the spot the nearest thing he had to a friend and ally in thewehrmacht jager coughed then said ive been on more missions with colonel skorzeny than i care to remember skorzeny laughed out loud at that ignoring him jager went on ive never seen him fail when he sets himself a goal if he says this will do the job youd better listen to him oh im listening anielewicz said he gave his attention back to otto skorzeny wellherr standartenfuhrer what will you do if i tell you we dont want anything to do with this will you try to get it into lodz anyhow aber naturlichskorzenys austrian accent made him sound like an aristocrat fromfin de siecle vienna rather than a nazi thug we dont give up easily well do this with you or without you it would be easier with you maybe and you jews can put yourselves in our good graces by going along since were going to win the war and rule poland doesnt that strike you as a good idea come on collaborate with usskorzeny wasnt subtle mordechai wondered if he had it in him to be subtle he sighed since you put it that way skorzeny slapped him on the back hard enough to make him stagger ha i knew you were a smart jew i noise from the woods made him break off anielewicz quickly figured out what it was so you brought some friends along to the meeting too they must have bumped up against mine i said you were a smart jew didnt i skorzeny answered how soon can we get this moving i dont like waiting around with my thumb up my arse let me get back to lodz and make the arrangements to bring in your little package mordechai said i know how to get in touch with colonel jager here and he probably knows how to get in touch with you yes probably jagers voice was dry good enough skorzeny said just dont take too damn long thats all i have to tell you remember with you or without you this is going to happen those lizards will be sorry about the day they crawled out of their eggs youll hear from me soon mordechai promised he didnt want skorzeny doing whatever he had in mind all by himself the ss man was altogether too likely to succeed at it whatever it was it might make the lizards sorry but anielewicz wouldnt have bet the jews would care for it either he whistled loudly a cue for his men to head toward lodz then nodded to jager and skorzeny and left the clearing he was very thoughtful all the way back down there how far do we trust the germans he asked back at the fire station on lutomierska street how farcan we trust the germans especially when one of them has told us not to timeo danaos et donas ferentesbertha fleishman said mordechai nodded hed had a secular education with latin a good part of it for those who didnt know their virgil bertha translated i fear the greeks even bearing gifts thats it exactly solomon gruver said the fireman was a battered bluntfaced fellow who looked like a prizefighter and had been a sergeant in the polish army in hed managed to conceal that from the nazis who probably would have liquidated him for it it made him enormously useful to the jewish underground unlike most of its members he hadnt had to learn matters military from scratch he tugged at his bushy graystreaked beard sometimes i think nussboym had the right idea after all better to live under the lizards than with these nazimamzrim cracking the whip either way we get the short end of the stick mordechai said heads bobbed up and down along the length of the table with the nazis its just us who get the short end but its bloody short with the lizards everybody gets it but maybe not so bad as the germans give it to us he chuckled ruefully some bargain isnt it so what do we do gruver demanded this wasnt a military matter or not strictly so he let others leadsometimes made others leadin policy decisions then weighed in with his own opinion but was oddly shy about taking the lead himself everybody looked at anielewicz partly that was because hed met the germans partly because people were used to looking at him he said i dont think we have any choice but to take the thing from skorzeny that way we have some control over it no matter what it ends up being the trojan horse bertha fleishman suggested mordechai nodded thats right thats just what its liable to be but skorzeny said hed do it with us or without us i believe him wed be making a big mistake if we ever took that man less than seriously well take it now well do our best to find out what it is and go from there otherwise hed find some other way to sneak it into lodz without our knowing you really think he could do that gruver asked i have talked with this man i would not put anything past him mordechai answered the only way we have a chance of getting away with this is pretending were a pack ofschlemiels who believe everything he says maybe then hell trust us to do his dirty work for him and not look inside the trojan horse and if it is the worlds biggest ginger bomb as he says somebody asked then we have a lot of lizards getting into a kingsized brawl right in the middle of lodz mordechai saidalevai omayn thats all we have tttoma the tosevite hatchling said triumphantly and looked right at ttomalss its mobile face twisted into an expression that indicated pleasure yes i am ttomalss the psychologist agreed the hatchling had no control over its excretions but it was learning to talk the big uglies were a peculiar species indeed as far as ttomalss was concerned tttoma the hatchling repeated and added an emphatic cough for good measure ttomalss wondered whether it really was putting stress on his name or just reproducing another wordlike sound it knew yes i am ttomalss he said again if big uglies acquired language in a way at all similar to that which hatchlings of the race used hearing things over and over would help it learn it was already showing itself to be a good deal more precocious than hatchlings of the race as far as talking went however it learned words it learned them rapidly but its coordination or rather lack of same set it apart from hatchlings still wet with the juices of their eggs he started to repeat his name once more but the communicator squawked for attention he went over to it and saw ppevel staring out of the screen superior sir he said as he turned on the video so ppevel could see him in turn how may i serve you superior sir the assistant administrator for the eastern section of the main continental mass wasted no time with polite small talk he said prepare the hatchling that came from the body of the tosevite called liu han for immediate return to the surface of tosev ttomalss had known for some time that that blow might come he still could not prevent a hiss of pain superior sir i must appeal he said the hatchling is at the point of beginning to acquire language to abandon the project involving it would be to cast aside knowledge that can be obtained in no other way violating principles of scientflic investigation the race has traditionally employed regardless of circumstances he knew no stronger argument than that tradition and tosev increasingly prove immiscible ppevel replied i repeat prepare the hatchling for immediate return to tosev superior sir it shall be done ttomalss said miserably obedience was a principle the race had traditionally followed too even so he went on i do protest your decision and requesthe couldnt demand not when ppevel outranked himthat you tell me why you made it i will give you my reasonsor rather my reason the assistant administrator answered it is very simple the peoples liberation army is making life in china unbearable for the race their most recent outrage which took place just the other day involved the detonation of several largecaliber artillery shells and produced losses larger than we can afford to absorb the males of the peoples liberation armyand the one angry female whose hatchling you now havehave pledged to diminish such activities in exchange for the return of this hatchling the bargain strikes me as being worth making the female liu han is still high in the councils of this bandit grouping ttomalss said glumly he had been so certain his plan to disgrace the female would succeed it had fit perfectly with what he thought he knew of big ugly psychology but ppevel said yes she is and still insistent on the return of the hatchling it has become a political liability to us returning it to the tosevite female liu han may transform that liability into a propaganda victory and will have the effect of reducing military pressure on our forces in peking therefore for the third time ready the hatchling for immediate return to tosev it shall be done ttomalss said sadly ppevel didnt hear that hed already broken the connection no doubt so he wouldnt have to listen to any further objections from ttomalss that was rude ttomalss unfortunately for him was in no position to do anything about it except resent it he had to assume that when ppevel saidimmediate he meant it he made sure the tosevite hatchling had dry wrappings for its excretory orflices and made sure those wrappings were snug around the hatchlings legs and midsection the trip down would be in free fall the last thing he wanted was bodily waste floating around in the shuttlecraft the pilot wouldnt be delighted if that happened either he wished he could do something about the hatchlings mouth big uglies in free fall had been known to suffer reverse peristalsis as if they were expelling poisonous material they had swallowed the race did not suffer similar symptoms ttomalss packed several clean waste cloths just in case hed need them while he worked the hatchling cheerfully babbled on the sounds it made these days were as close to the ones the race used as it could come with its somewhat different vocal apparatus ttomalss let out another hissing sigh he would have to start over with a new hatchling and it would be years before he could learn all he wanted about tosevite language acquisition tessrek stopped in the doorway he didnt undo the gate ttomalss had rigged to keep the hatchling from wandering the corridor but jeered over it youll finally be getting rid of that horrible thing i hear i wont be sorry to seeand scentthe last of it let me tell you ppevel wouldnt have called tessrek directly he might well have called the male who supervised both tessrek and ttomalss though to make sure his orders were obeyed that would have been all he needed to get rumors flying ttomalss said go tend to your own research and may it be treated as cavalierly as mine has tessrek let his mouth fall open in a derisive laugh my research unlike yours is productive so i have no fear of its being curtailed he did leave then and just as well or ttomalss might have thrown something at him only a little later a male in the red and silver body paint of a shuttlecraft pilot gave the gateway a dubious look with one eye turret he speared ttomalss with the other saying is the big ugly ready to travel researcher his tone warnedit had better be it is ttomalss said grudgingly he examined the other males body paint again and added even more grudgingly superior sir good the shuttlecraft pilot said i am heddosh by the way he gave ttomalss his name as if convinced the researcher should already have known it ttomalss scooped up the tosevite hatchling that wasnt as easy as it had been when the creature was newly emerged from the body of the female liu han it was much bigger now and weighed much more ttomalss had to put down the bag of supplies he had with him so he could open the gate at which point the hatchling nearly wriggled out of his arms heddosh emitted a derisive snort ttomalss glared at him he had no idea of the difficulties involved in keeping this hatchling of another species alive and healthy being taken to the shuttlecraft fascinated the hatchling several times on the journey it saw something new and said thissometimes with the interrogative cough sometimes without it speaks heddosh said in surprise yes it does ttomalss answered coldly it would learn to speak more if i were allowed to continue my experiment too now the hatchling would have to acquire the horrible sounds of chinese rather than the races elegant precise and to ttomalss beautiful language the clanging noises the shuttlecraft airlock doors made frightened the hatchling which clung tightly to ttomalss he soothed it as best he could all the while trying to look on the bright side of things the only bright side he found was that until he could obtain another newly emerged big ugly hatchling he would get enough sleep for a while more clangings signaled the shuttlecrafts freeing itself from the starship to which it had been attached with centrifugal force no longer giving a simulacrum of gravity the shuttlecraft went into free fall to ttomalss relief the hatchling showed no perceptible distress it seemed to find the sensation interesting perhaps even pleasant data showed that the female liu han had had the same reaction ttomalss wondered if it was hereditary there was a longterm research project he thought maybe someone could start it after the conquest was safe and secure he wondered if the day would ever come when the conquest was safe and secure hed never imagined the race making concessions to the tosevites in negotiations as ppevel was in yielding the hatchling to them once you started making concessions where would you stop that was a chilling thought when you got down to it the shuttlecrafts rocket engine began to roar acceleration shoved ttomalss back into his couch and the hatchling against him it squalled in fright he comforted it again even though its weight pressing on him made him far from comfortable the hatchling had calmed before acceleration ended and squealed with delight when free fall returned ttomalss wondered if the big ugly female liu han could have done as well with the hatchling even if shed kept it since it emerged from her body he had his doubts when otto skorzeny came back to the panzer encampment he was grinning from ear to ear brush the canary feathers off your chin heinrich jager told him the ss man actually did make brushing motions at his face in spite of everything jager laughed whatever else you could say about him skorzeny had style the trouble was there was so much else to say off it went skorzeny boomed the jews ate the story up like gumdrops poor damned fools they brought up their own wagon to carry the present and they promised theyd sneak it past the lizards i figure they can do that probably better than i could and once they do jager tipped back his head and slid his index finger across his throat chuckling skorzeny nodded when is the timer set for jager asked day after tomorrow skorzeny answered thatll give em plenty of time to get the bomb back to lodz poor stupid bastards he shook his head perhaps even in genuine sympathy i wonder if anybodys ever done such a good job of committing suicide before masada jager said dredging the name up from the longvanished days before the first world war when hed wanted to be a biblical archaeologist he saw it meant nothing to skorzeny and explained the whole garrison killed one another off instead of surrendering to the romans therell be more of em done in now the ss man said a lot more jajager answered absently he still couldnt tell whether skorzeny hated jews on his own hook or because hed got orders to hate them in the end what did it matter hed go after them with the same genial ferocity either way had the message got through to anielewicz jager had been wondering about that ever since the meeting he skorzeny and the jewish fighting leader had had in the forest anielewicz hadnt tipped his hand then had he got the message and then not believed it had he got it believed it and then been unable to convince his fellow jews it was true no way to be sure not from here jager shook his head hed have a way to tell soon enough if the jews in lodz were snuffed out like so many candles day after tomorrow he could figure somebody down there had decided he was lying skorzeny had an animal alertness to him whats up he asked seeing jagers head go back and forth nothing really the panzer colonel hoped his voice sounded casual thinking about the surprise theyll have in lodzfor a little while anyhow for a little while is right skorzeny said stupid sheep youd think theyd know better than to trust a german but no they walked right into it he bleated sardonically and the lambs blood will go up on the doorposts of all the houses jager stared he hadnt imagined skorzeny as a man who knew his scripture the ssstandartenfuhrer chuckled again thefuhrer will have his revenge on the jews and who knows we may even kill a few lizards too wed better jager answered you go and rip the heart out of the human sector of lodz and theres nothing to keep the scaly sons of bitches from staging out of it any more they could hit the bases of our penetrations north and south of the city and cut us right off thats too steep a price for thefuhrers revenge you ask me nobody asked you and thefuhrer doesnt think so skorzeny said he told me as much himselfhe wants those jews dead how am i supposed to argue with that jager said the answer was simple he couldnt so hed set himself up to circumvent a personal order from thefuhrer had he well if anyone ever found out what hed done he was a dead man anyhow they couldnt kill him any deaderno but they can take longer getting you dead he thought uneasily he threw himself flat on the ground almost before he consciously heard the shells whistling in from out of the east skorzeny sprawled there beside him hands up to cover the back of his neck somewhere not far away a wounded man was screaming the bombardment went on for about fifteen minutes then let up jager scrambled to his feet weve got to move camp now he shouted they know where we are we were lucky that timefar as i could tell that was all ordinary ammunition coming none of their special delights that spit mines all over the place so people and panzers dont dare go anywhere theyre short of those little beauties by all the signs but they will use em if they think they can make a profit we wont let em hed hardly finished speaking before the first panzer engines rumbled into life he was proud of his men most of them were veterans whod been through everything the russians and the british and the lizards could throw at them they understood what needed doing and took care of it with a minimum of fuss and bother skorzeny was a genius raider but he couldnt run a regiment like this jager had his own talents and they were not to be sneezed at while the regiment was shifting its base he didnt have to think about the horror waiting to happen in lodz growing closer with every tick of a timer skorzeny was right the jews were fools to trust any german now the question was which german had they been fools enough to trust the next day he was too busy to worry about it a lizard counterattack drove the german forces west six or eight kilometers panzers in the regiment went from machinery to burnt and twisted scrap metal a couple from the fire of lizard panzer cannon the rest because of the antipanzer rockets the lizard infantry carried the only lizard panzer killed was taken out by awehrmacht private in a tree who dropped a molotov cocktail down into the turret through the open cupola when the panzer clattered by below him that happened toward sunset and seemed to halt the lizards push all by itself they didnt like losing panzers these days we have to do better he told his men as they ate black bread and sausage that night we got flank targets but we werent hitting them cant make many mistakes like that not unless we want to get buried here butherr oberst somebody said when they move they can move so damned fast theyre by us before we have a chance to react good thing we had defense in depth or they would have cracked us wide open somebody else said jager nodded pleased at the way the troops were hashing things out for themselves that was how german soldiers were supposed to operate they werent just ignorant peasants who followed orders without thinking about them as red army men did they had brains and imaginations and used them he was about to curl up in his bedroll under his panther when skorzeny showed up in camp the ss man was toting a jug of vodka hed found god only knew where and passed it around so everybody got a nip it wasnt good vodkathe taste put jager in mind of stale kerosenebut it was better than no vodka think theyre going to hit us again in the morning skorzeny asked wont know for certain till then jager answered but if i had to guess id say no theyd have kept pressing harder after it got dark if that was what they had in mind these days they push when they think theyve found a weakness but they ease up when we show strength they cant afford the kind of losses they get when they go up against a strongpoint skorzeny said shrewdly i think youre right jager glanced over at the ss man in the darkness we could have used that nerve gas here at the front ahh youd say that even if things were quiet skorzeny retorted its doing what its supposed to be doing right where it is he grunted i want your wireless people to be alert for any intercepts they pick up about that too if the lizards dont burn up the airwaves ill eat my hat thats fine jager yawned enormously right now im alert for sleep you want to crawl in under here safest place you can be if they start shelling again i know damn well you snore but i suppose i can live with it skorzeny laughed gunther grillparzer said hes not the only one who snoressir betrayed by his own gunner jager settled in for the night spatters of smallarms fire woke him a couple of times they picked up at dawn but as hed predicted the lizards were more interested in consolidating what theyd gained the day before than in pushing on against stiffening resistance otto skorzeny hadnt been kidding when he said he wanted the wireless men to stay alert he made sure they did hanging around them and regaling them with what seemed like an endless stream of dirty stories most of them were good dirty stories too and some were even new to jager whod thought hed heard every story of that sort ever invented as morning gave way to afternoon skorzenys temper began to wear thin he paced through the camp kicking up dirt and sending spring flowers flying damn it we should have intercepted something from the jews or the lizards in lodz by now he stormed maybe theyre all dead jager suggested the notion horrflied him but might ease skorzenys mind but the big ss man shook his head too much to hope for somebody always lives through these things by one kind of fool luck or another jager thought of max the foulmouthed jew whod lived through babi yar skorzeny was right he went on with a muttered no somethings gone south somewhere you think the timer didnt work the way it should have jager asked i suppose it is possible skorzeny allowed but fry me for aschnitzel if i ever heard of one of them failing before they arent just foolproof theyre idiotproof and the gadget had a backup we send out a goody like that we want to make sure it works as advertised he chuckled thats what people who dont like us so well call german efficiency eh no the only way that bomb could have failed would have been what jager said though he had an idea as to what as you say if it had a backup timer it was going to go off the only way that bomb could have failed skorzeny repeated musingly his gray eyes went very wide the only way that bomb could have failed would have been for that stinking little kike to pull the wool over my eyes and dip me in shit if he didnt do it he clapped a hand to his forehead the bastard the fucker the nerve of him next time i see him ill cut off his balls one at a time then to jagers amazement he started to laugh he played me for a sucker i didnt think any man alive could do that id like to shake his handafterhes castrated not before you thinkstupid kike and you take it for granted and this is what it gets you jesus christ also a jewjager thought but he didnt say it instead he asked what now if the jews in lodz know what it isand if they do or guess its thanks to me and how do i feel about that theyve got their hands on something they can use against us dont i know it skorzeny sounded disgusted maybe with the jews maybe with himself he wasnt used to failing then he brightened for a moment he looked like his old devilish self maybe we can plaster the place with rockets and longrange artillery hope to blow up the damned thing that way at least deny the jews the use of it he made an unhappy clucking noise its bloody long odds though too true jager said as if sympathetically those rockets pack a decent punch but you cant tell for sure whether theyll hit the right town let alone the right street i wish we had some of the toys the lizards know how to make skorzeny said still discontented with the world they dont just hit the right street theyll pick a room for you hell theyll fly into a closet if thats what you want he scratched at his chin well one way or another those jews are going to pay and when they do ill be the one who collects he sounded very sure of himself off in the next room at the army and navy general hospital in hot springs there were so many car batteries that theyd had to reinforce the floor to take the weight among the lizard gadgets they powered was the radio set taken from the shuttlecraft that had brought straha down to earth when he defected to the united states now he and sam yeager sat in front of that radio flipping from one frequency to another in an effort to monitor the lizards signals and find out what the race was up to right now they werent picking up much anywhere straha had the leisure to turn to yeager and ask how many of our males do you have engaged in the practice of espionage and signal gathering numbers who knows sam answered if he had known he wouldnt have told straha one of the things hed had drilled into him was that you didnt tell anybody human or lizard anything he didnt have to know but a lot of them a lot of the time not many of us big uglieshe used the lizards nickname for mankind unselfconsciouslyspeak your language well enough to follow without help from one of you you sam yeager i think you could succeed at this straha said which made sam feel damn good he thought he could have gained even more fluency in the lizards language if he hadnt also had to spend time with robert goddard on the other hand he would have learned more about rockets if he hadnt had to spend time with straha and the other lizard pows and he would have learned more about his baby son if he hadnt been in the army that would have kept barbara happier too he worried about not seeing her enough there werent enough hours in a day in a year in a lifetime to do all the things he wanted to do that was true all the time but trying to keep up during a war rubbed your nose in it straha touched the frequencyadvance toggle the lizard numbers in the display showed that the radio was now monitoring a frequency a tenth of a megacycle higher or rather something that worked out to be about an eighth of a megacyclethe lizards naturally used their own units rather than those of mankind a males voice came out of the speaker yeager leaned forward and listened intently the lizard was apparently in a rear area and complaining about rockets falling nearby and disrupting resupply efforts for the troops pushing toward denver thats good news sam said scribbling notes truth straha agreed your ventures into uncharted technology are paying a handsome profit for your species if the race were so innovative tosev would long since have been conqueredprovided the race had not blown itself to radioactive dust in innovative frenzy you think thats what we would have done if you hadnt invaded sam asked it is certainly one of the higher probabilities straha said and yeager was hardpressed to disagree with him the exshiplord flipped to a new frequency the lizard talking now sounded angry as all getout he is ordering the dismissal demotion and transfer of a local commander in a region called illinois straha said yeager nodded the lizard went on where is this illinois place sam showed him on a map he was listening too something about letting a pack of prisoners escape or get rescued or something the fellow whos cursing him is really doing quite a job isnt he if said snouttosnout telling a male that someone shit in his egg before it hatched is guaranteed to start a fight straha said i believe it sam listened to the radio some more theyre moving that incompetent officer toupstate new york he wrote it down thats worth knowing with luck well be able to take advantage of his weaknesses over there too truth straha said again this time in bemused tones you big uglies aggressively exploit the intelligence you gather and you gather great quantities of it do you do this in your own conflicts as well dont know yeager answered ive never been in a war before and im only a little fellow in this one he thought back to his ballplaying days and to all the signs he and his teammates had stolen mutt daniels was a genius at that kind of thing he wondered howand ifmutt was doing these days straha shifted to yet another frequency an excitedsounding lizard was relaying a long involved message ah that is most interesting straha said when he was done i didnt follow all of it sam confessed embarrassed at having to say that after straha had praised his grasp of the lizards tongue something about ginger and calculator fraud whatever that is not calculator fraudcomputer fraud straha said i do not blame you for not understanding completely you big uglies while technically far more advanced than you have any business being as yet have no real grasp of the potential of computing machines maybe not yeager said sounds like we dont have any grasp of how to commit crimes with them either strahas mouth dropped open in amusement committing the crime is easy males in the payroll section diverted payments to ginger purveyors into accounts of which only they and the purveyorsand of course the computerswere aware since no one else knew these accounts existed no one not party to the secret could access them the computers would not announce their presence it was in essence a perfect scheme we have a saying that theres no such thing as a perfect crime yeager remarked what went wrong with this one straha laughed again nothing is accidentproof a male in the accounting section who was not part of the miscreants scheme was investigating a legitimate account but he made a mistake in entering the number of that account and found himself looking at one of the concealed ones he recognized it at once for what it was and notflied his superiors who began a larger investigation many males will find themselves in difficulties because of it hope you wont be angry if i tell you that doesnt make me too unhappy sam said who would have thought the race would turn out to have drug fiends makes you seem almost humanno offense i shall endeavor to take none straha replied with dignity yeager kept his face straight straha was getting pretty good at interpreting human expressions and he didnt want the lizard to see how funny he thought that was he said i wonder if we have any way to use the news maybe make some of your people think males who arent ginger tasters really are something like that anyhow you have an evilly twisted mind sam yeager straha said thank you sam answered which made straha first jerk both eye turrets toward him and then start to laugh as he understood it was a joke yeager went on you might talk with some of our propaganda people maybe ask if they want you to broadcast about it who knows what kind of trouble you might stir up who indeed straha said i shall do that it wasnt quiteit shall be done the lizards equivalent foryes sir but it was more deference than sam had ever got from straha before little by little he was earning respect when his shift was done he started to go upstairs to see barbara and jonathan but ran into ristin and ullhass in the hospital lobby those two lizard pows were old buddies hed captured them back in the summer of when the lizard invasion was new and looked irresistible by now they seemed well on the way to becoming americans and wore their official us prisonerofwar redwhiteandblue body paint with considerable pride theyd also picked up pretty good english over the last couple of years hey sam ristin said in that language baseball this afternoon yes ullhass echoed baseball he added an emphatic cough maybe laternot now sam said to which both lizards responded with steamwhistle noises of disappointment with their fast skittery movements they made surprisingly good middle infielders and had taken to the game well their small size and forwardsloping posture gave them a strike zone about the size of a postage stamp too so they were good leadoff menwell leadoff maleseven if they seldom hit the ball hard good weather for a game ristin said doing his best to tempt sam a lot of soldiers played ball when they were off duty but ristin and ullhass were the only lizards who joined in with yeagers endless years of bushleague experience everybody was glad to see him out there and people had put up with his lizard pals for his sake now ullhass and ristin were starting to get noticed for the way they played not for their scaly hides maybe later sam repeated now i want to see my wife and son if you dont mind too much the lizards sighed in resignation they knew families mattered to tosevites but it didnt feel real to them any more than yeager understood in his gut how much their precious emperor meant to them he headed for the stairs ristin and ullhass started practicing phantom double plays ristin who mostly played second had a hell of a fast pivot up on the fourth floor jonathan was telling the world in no uncertain terms that he didnt care for something or other it had done to him listening to him yowl sam was glad the lizards who lived up there werent around to hear the racket it sometimes drove him a little squirrely and he was a human being the crying stopped very suddenly sam knew what that meant barbara had given the baby her breast sam smiled as he opened the door to their room he was fond of his wifes breasts too and figured the kid took after his old man barbara looked up from the chair in which she was nursing jonathan she didnt seem as badly beat up as she had just after he was born but she wasnt what youd call perky either hello honey she said shut the door quietly would you he may fall asleep hes certainly been fussing as if he was tired sam noted the precise grammar there as he often did when his wife talked he sometimes envied her fancy education hed left high school to play ball though an insatiable curiosity had kept him reading this and finding out little fragmented pieces of that ever since barbara never complained about his lack of formal schooling but it bothered him anyhow sure enough jonathan did go to sleep the kid was growing he took up more room in the cradle now than he had when he was first born as soon as sam saw he would stay down after barbara put him in there he touched her on the arm and said i got a present for you hon well really its a present for both of us but you can go first with it ive been saving it all morning long so i figure i can last a little longer the buildup intrigued her whatdo you have she breathed its not anything fancy he warned not a diamond not a convertible they both laughed not quite comfortably it would be a long time if ever before you could start thinking about driving a convertible he dug in his pocket and pulled out a new corncob pipe and a leather pouch of tobacco then handed them to her with a flourish here you go she stared as if she couldnt believe her eyes where did you get them this colored guy came around early this morning selling em sam answered hes from up in the northern part of the state where they grow some tobacco cost me fifty bucks but what the heck i dont have a whole lot of things to spend money on so why not its all right with me its better than all right with me as a matter of fact barbara stuck the empty pipe in her mouth i never smoked one of these before i probably look like a southern granny babe you always look good to me yeager said barbaras expression softened keeping your wife happy was definitely worth doingespecially when you meant every word you said he tapped at the tobacco pouch with his index finger you want me to load the pipe for you would you please she said so he did he had a zippo fueled now not by lighter fluid but by moonshine he had no idea how hed keep it going when he ran out of flints but that hadnt happened yet he flicked the wheel with his thumb a pale almost invisible alcohol flame sprang into being he held it over the bowl of the pipe barbaras cheeks hollowed as she inhaled careful sam warned pipe tobaccos a lot stronger than what you get in cigarettes and her eyes crossed she coughed like somebody in the last throes of consumption you havent smoked much of anything lately he finished unnecessarily no kidding her voice was a raspy wheeze remember that bit intom sawyer first pipesive lost my knife something like that i know just how tom felt that stuff isstrong let me try sam said and took the pipe from her he drew on it cautiously he knew about pipe tobacco and knew what any tobacco could do to you when you hadnt smoked for a while even taking all that into account barbara was right what smoldered in that pipe was strong as the devil it might have been cured and mellowed for fifteen maybe even twenty minutessmoking it felt like scraping coarse sandpaper over his tongue and the inside of his mouth spit flooded from every salivary gland he owned including a few he hadnt known were there he felt dizzy almost woozy for a secondand he knew enough not to draw much smoke down into his lungs he coughed a couple of times himself wowie here give it back to me barbara said she made another much more circumspect try then exhaled god that is to tobacco what bathtub gin was to the real stuff youre too young to know about bathtub gin he said severely memories of some pounding headaches came back to haunt him he puffed on the pipe again himself it wasnt a bad comparison barbara giggled one of my favorite uncles was a parttime bootlegger i had quite a highschool graduation partyfrom what i remember of it anyway she took the pipe back from sam im going to need a while to get used to this again yeah well probably be there just about when that pouch goes empty he agreed god knows when that colored fellow will come through town again if he ever does they smoked the bowl empty then filled it again the room grew thick with smoke sams eyes watered he felt loose and easy the way he had after a cigarette in the good old days that he also felt slightly nauseated and his mouth like raw meat was only a detail as far as he was concerned thats good barbara said meditatively and punctuated her words with another set of coughs she waved those aside worth it i think so too sam started to laugh know what we remind me of when barbara shook her head he answered his own question were like a couple of lizards with their tongues in the ginger jar thats terrible barbara exclaimed then she thought it over itis terrible but you may be right it is kind of like a drugtobacco i mean you bet it is i tried quitting a couple of times when i was playing balldidnt like what it was doing to my wind i couldnt do it id get all nervous and twitchy and i dont know what when you cant get any its not so bad you dont have a choice but stick tobacco in front of us every day and well go back to it sure enough barbara sucked on the pipe again she made a wry face ginger tastes better thats for certain yeah i think so toonow sam said but if im smoking all the time i wont think so for long you know when you get down to it coffee tastes pretty bad too or we wouldnt have to fix it up with cream and sugar but i like what coffee used to do for me when we had it so did i barbara said wistfully she pointed toward the cradle with him waking up whenever he feels like it i could really use some coffee these days were a bunch of drug fiends all right no doubt about it yeager took the pipe from her and sucked in smoke now that hed had some it wasnt so bad he wondered whether he ought to hope that negro would come around with moreor for him to stay away the partisan leader a fat pole who gave his name as ignacy stared at ludmila gorbunovayou are a pilot he said in fluent but skeptical german ludmila stared back almost at sight she had doubts about ignacy for one thing almost the only way you could stay fat these days was by exploiting the vast majority who were thin sometimes to the point of emaciation for another his name sounded so much likenazi that just hearing it made her nervous also in german she answered yes i am a pilotyou are a guerrilla commander im afraid so he said there hasnt been much call for piano teachers the past few years ludmila stared again this time for a different reasonthis had been a member of the petty bourgeoisie hed certainly managed to shed his class trappings from poorly shaved jowls to twin bandoliers worn crisscross on his chest to battered boots he looked like a man whod been a bandit all his life and sprang from a long line of bandits she had trouble imagining him going through chopinetudes with bored young students beside her avram looked down at his scarred hands wladeslaw looked up to the top of the linden tree under which they stood neither of the partisans whod accompanied her from near lublin said anything theyd done their job by getting her here now it was up to her you have here an airplane she asked deciding not to hold ignacys looks name or class against him business was business if the great stalin could make a pact with the fascist hitler she could do her best to deal with a schmeissertoting piano teacher we have an airplane he agreed maybe he was trying to overcome distrust of her as a socialist and a russian for he went on with a detailed explanation it landed here in this area when the lizards were booting out the germans we dont think anything was wrong with it except that it was out of fuel we have fuel now and we have a new battery which holds a charge we have also drained the oil and the hydraulic fluid and have replaced both this all sounds good ludmila said what sort of airplane is it her guess would have been an me shed never before flown a hot fighteror what had been a hot fighter till the lizards came she suspected it would be a merry life but a short one the lizards had hacked messerschmitts and their opposite numbers from the red air force out of the sky with hideous ease in the early days of their invasion but ignacy answered its a fieseler he saw that didnt mean anything to ludmila so he added they call it astorch a stork the nickname didnt help ludmila said i think it would be better if you let me see the aircraft than if you talk about it yes he said and put his hands out in front of him as if on an imaginary keyboard he had been a piano teacher sure enough come with me the aircraft was about three kilometers from ignacys encampment those three kilometers of rough trail like most of the landscape hereabouts showed how heavy the local fighting had been the ground was cratered chunks of metal and burnedout hulks lay everywhere and she passed a good many hastily dug graves most marked with crosses some with stars of david and some just left alone she pointed at one of those who lies under there a lizard yes ignacy said again the priests so far as i know have not yet decided whether lizards have souls ludmila didnt know how to answer that so she kept quiet she didnt think she had a soul not in the sense ignacy meant the things people too ignorant to grasp the truths of dialectical materialism could find over which to worry themselves she wondered where the alleged fieseler was hiding theyd passed only a couple of buildings and those had been too battered to conceal a motorcar let alone an airplane ignacy led her up a small rise he said were right on top of it now his voice showed considerable pride right on top of what ludmila asked as he led her down the other side of the rise he took her around to a third sideand then realization sank inbozhemoi you built a platform with the aircraft under it that wasmaskirovka even the soviets would have viewed with respect ignacy heard the admiration in her voice so we did he said it seemed the best way of concealing it we had available to that she could only nod theyd done as much work as the red air force had outside pskov and they couldnt even fly the airplane they were hiding the partisan leader pulled a candle out of one of the pockets of thewehrmacht tunic he was wearing it will be dark in there with the earth and the timer and the nets blocking away the light she sent ignacy a suspicious look shed had trouble from men when they got her alone in a dark place she touched the butt of her tokarev dont try anything foolish she advised him if i tried nothing foolish would i be a partisan he asked ludmila frowned but held her peace stooping ignacy held up an edge of the camouflage netting ludmila crawled under it she in turn held it up so the polish guerrilla could follow her the space under the camouflaged platform was too large for a single candle to do much to illuminate it ignacy walked over to the aircraft hidden there ludmila followed him when the faint glow showed her what the aircraft was her eyes got wide oh one of these she breathed you know it ignacy asked you can fly it i know of it she answered i dont know yet whether i can fly it i hope i can i will tell you so much the fieselerstorch was a highwing monoplane not much bigger than one of her belovedkukuruzniks and not much faster either but if akukuruznik was a cart horse astorch was a trained lipizzan it could take off and land in next to no room at all flying into a light breeze it could hover in one place almost like a lizard helicopter ludmila took the candle from ignacy and walked around the plane fascinatedly studying the huge flaps elevators and ailerons that let it do its tricks from what shed heard not everystorch was armed but this one carried two machine guns one under the body one in back of the pilot for an observer to fire she set her foot in the mounting stirrup opened the pilotside door and climbed up into the cockpit so much of it was glass that although it was enclosed she had a much better allaround view than she did in the open cabin of akukuruznik she wondered how shed like flying without the slipstream blasting her in the face then she brought the candle up to the instrument panel and studied it in amazement so many dials so many gauges how were you supposed to do any flying if you tried to keep track of all of them at once everything was finished to a much higher standard than she was used to shed seen that before with german equipment the nazis made their machines as if they were fine watches the soviet approach contrariwise was to turn out as many tanks and planes and guns as possible if they were crude so what they were going to get destroyed anyhow you can fly it ignacy repeated as ludmila rather reluctantly descended from the cabin yes i really think i can ludmila answered the candle was burning low she and ignacy started back out toward the netting under which they would leave she glanced back at thestorch hoping to be a rider worthy of her steed soviet artillery boomed south of moscow flinging shells toward lizard positions distantly the reports reverberated even in the kremlin listening to them iosef stalin made a sour face the lizards grow bolder vyacheslav mikhailovich he said vyacheslav molotov did not care for the implication behind the wordsits your fault stalin seemed to be saying as soon as we can produce another explosivemetal bomb iosef vissarionovich we shall remind them we deserve respect he answered yes but when will that be stalin demanded these so called scientists have been telling me lies all along and if they dont move faster they will regret itand so will you so will the entire soviet union comrade general secretary molotov said stalin always thought everyone lied to him a lot of the time people did simply because they were too afraid to tell him the truth molotov had tried to tell him that after using the bomb made from the lizards explosive metal the ussr would not be able to make anymore for a long time to come he hadnt wanted to listen he seldom wanted to listen molotov went on it seems however that we shall soon have more of these weapons i have heard this promise before stalin said i grow weary of itwhen exactly will the new bombs appear in our arsenal the first by summer molotov answered that made stalin sit up and take notice as hed thought it would he continued work at thekolkhoz has made remarkable progress lately im happy to report yes lavrenti pavlovich tells me the same i am glad to hear it stalin said his expression hooded i will be gladder to hear it if it turns out to be true it will molotov saidit had better but now he began to believe that it wouldand so evidently did beria getting that american tokolkhoz had proved a master stroke his presence and his ideas proved sometimes painfully just how far behind that of the capitalist west the soviet nuclear research program had been he took for granted both theory and engineering practice toward which kurchatov flerov and their colleagues were only beginning to grope but with his knowledge the soviet program was finally advancing at a decent pace i am glad to hear we shall have these weapons stalin repeated glad for your sake vyacheslav mikhailovich i serve the soviet union molotov said he picked up the glass of vodka in front of him knocked it back and filled it again from the bottle that stood beside it he knew what stalin meant if the workers and peasants of the soviet union did not soon have an explosivemetal bomb they would soon have a new foreign commissar he would get the blame for the failure not stalins georgian crony beria stalin was not allergic to scribbling the initials vmn on the case files of those marked for liquidation any more than molotov had been when we have our second bomb comrade general secretary molotov said resolutely not thinking about what would happento the ussr and to himif they didnt have it i recommend that we use it at once stalin puffed on his pipe sending up unreadable smoke signals with the first bomb you advised against using it why now the change of mind because when we used the first we had no second with which to back it and i feared that would become obvious molotov answered now though by using the new bomb we not only prove we do have it but also give the promise of producing many more after it more nasty smoke rose there is method in this stalin said with a slow nod not only does it serve warning on the lizards it also warns the hitlerites we are not to be trifled with and it sends the same signal to the americans not bad vyacheslav mikhailovich first priority as you say is the lizards molotov stuck strictly to the business at hand he had not let stalin see his fear at the threat hed received though the general secretary surely knew it was there he did not show his relief either again sham or not stalin could hardly be ignorant of it he played his subordinates emotions as if they were violin strings and set one man against another like an orchestra conductor developing and exploiting opposing themes now stalin said in remembering the first priority we must also remember it is not the only one after the lizards make peace with therodina he stopped and puffed meditatively on the pipe molotov was used to listening for subtle nuances in the general secretarys speech after the lizards make peace iosef vissarionovich not after the lizards are defeated or exterminated or driven from this world comrade foreign commissar for your ears only i do not think this within our power stalin said we shall use the bombif the scientists deign to give it to us we shall destroy whatever concentration of lizards we can with it they in turn will destroy one of our cities this is the exchange they make we cannot win at this rate our goal now must be to convince the aliens they cannot win either but face only ruin if the war goes on under these circumstances what terms do you intend to seek molotov askedhow long do you intend to honor them also came to mind but he did not have the nerve to put that question to stalin the general secretary was ruthlessly pragmatic hed wrung every bit of advantage he could from his pact with hitler the one thing he hadnt expected there was hitlers outdoing him in ruthlessness and striking first any peace with the lizards was liable to be similarly temporary i want them out of the ussr stalin said beyond the frontiers of june past that everything is negotiable let the fascists and capitalists dicker for their own countries if they fail i shall not lift a finger to help them they would not help me as you know molotov nodded first in agreement to that and then in slow consideration of the general secretarys reasoning it fit with what stalin had done in the past rather than trying to foment world revolution as the trotskyites urged stalin had concentrated on building socialism in one country now he would take the same approach toward building independent human power the lizards are imperialists molotov said can they be made to accept something less than their full planned scope of conquest this is my principal concern iosef vissarionovich we can make the soviet union not worth their having by stalins tone he was prepared to do exactly what he said molotov did not think the general secretary was bluffing he had the will to do such a thing if he was given the ability the physicists were giving him that ability could the lizard fleetlord match the general secretarys driving will the only humans molotov had met who came up to that standard were lenin churchill and hitler could atvar come up to it stalin was betting the fate of his country that the alien could not molotov would have been more confident had stalin not so disastrously misjudged hitler heand the ussrhad come close to perishing from that mistake if he made a similar one against a foe with explosivemetal bombs neither he the soviet union nor marxismleninism would survive how to tell stalin of his misgivings molotov drained the second glass of vodka he could find no way xi out to the front again if it hadnt been for the honor of the thing brigadier general leslie groves would have greatly preferred to stay back at the university of denver and tend to his knitting which is to say making sure atomic bombs got made and the lizards werent any the wiser but when the general commanding the front ordered you to get your fanny out there that was what you did omar bradley in a newstyle pot helmet with three gold stars painted on it pointed from his observation post out toward the fighting line and said general were hurting them theres no two ways about that theyre paying for every inch of ground they takepaying more than they can afford if our intelligence estimates are even close to being right were hurting them as i said but they keep taking inches and we cant afford that at all do you understand what im saying yes sir groves answered we are going to have to use a nuclear device to stop them or two or three or as many as we have or as many as it takes bradley said they must not break into denver that right now is our sine qua non yes sir groves repeated at the moment he had one count it one atomic bomb ready for use he would not have any more for several weeks bradley was supposed to know as much in case he didnt groves proceeded to spell it out in large red letters bradley nodded i do understand that general i just dont like it well the first one will have to rock them back on their heels enough to buy us time to get the next built thats all there is to it a flight of american planes long hoarded against desperate need roared by at treetop height the p kittyhawks had ferocious shark mouths painted on their radiator cowlings wing machine guns blazing they shot up the lizards frontline positions one of them took out an enemy helicopter which crashed in flames briefed against heroics that would get them killed the pilots quickly turned for the run home two exploded in midair in quick succession the second with a blast louder than the other racket on the battlefield the rest made it back into americanheld territory nice to see the lizards on the receiving end for a change instead of dishing it out groves said bradley nodded i hope those pilots can get down get out of their planes and get under cover before any lizard rockets follow them home he had a reputation for being a soldiers general for thinking of his men first groves felt a vague twinge of conscience that he hadnt done the same as if to show how the job should be done a lizard fighter dove on the american lines like a swooping eagle instead of talons it used two pods full of rockets to rend its foes menand a few womenwith red crosses in white circles on helmets and armbands ran forward to take the wounded back to aid stations the lizards dont shoot at medics on purpose do they groves said theyre better at playing by the rules than the japs were you cant say things like that any more japan is on our side now a dry tone and a raised eyebrow warned that bradley did not intend to be taken altogether seriously another lizard fighter pounded the american positions this one close enough to groves and bradley that both men dove into a dugout to escape bomb fragments and cannon fire groves spat out mud that wasnt the taste of war he got in his usual theater of operations he wasnt used to looking down at himself and seeing a filthy uniform either bradley took it all in stride although he wasnt used to real live combat himself as calmly as if he were still standing upright he said well want to site the bomb in an area where the lizards are concentrating troops and materiel in fact well do our best to create such an area the tricky part will be doing it so the lizards dont notice what were up to till too late you tell me where you want it sir and ill get it there for you groves promised doing his best to match bradleys aplomb thats how i earn my salary after all no one has anything but praise for the way youve handled your project general bradley said when general marshallsecretary marshall i should say his second hat takes precedencesent me here to conduct the defense of denver he spoke very highly of you and of the cooperation i could expect from you i havent been disappointed either praise from george marshall was praise indeed groves said we can get the bomb up to the front either by truck with reinforced suspension or by horsedrawn wagon which is slower but might be less conspicuous if we have to i suppose we can send it up in pieces and assemble it where well set it off the beast is five feet wide and more than ten feet long so it comes in a hell of a big crate mm ill have to think about that bradley said right now im inclined to vote against it if i understand correctly if we lose any of the important parts we could have all the rest and the thing still wouldnt work is that right yes sir groves answered if you try to start a jeep without a carburetor youd better hope youre not going farther than someplace you can walk bradley had dirt all over his face which made his grin seem brighter and more cheerful than it was fair enough he said well do everything we can to keep from having to use itweve got a counterattack laid on for the kiowa area a little bit south of here for which i have some hope the lizards had trouble on the plains southeast of denver and they still havent fully reorganized in that sector we may hurt them he shrugged or on the other hand we may just force them to concentrate and become more vulnerable to the bomb we wont know till we try groves brushed clinging dirt from his shirtfront and the knees of his trousers ill cooperate in any way you require sir the words didnt come easy hed grown used to being the biggest military fish in the pond in denver but he could no more have defended it from the lizards than bradley could have ramrodded the metallurgical laboratory project bradley waved for his adjutant a freshfaced captain george take general groves back to the university of denver hell be awaiting our orders there and prepared to respond to the situation however it develops yes sir george looked alarmingly clean and well pressed as if mud knew better than to stick to him or his clothes he saluted then turned to groves if youll come with me sir he had a jeep waiting groves had hoped he would his office was most of a days ride away by horseback and he was so heavy that neither he nor most horses enjoyed the process of equitation he glanced skyward several times on the way back though the lizards made a point of shooting at motor vehicles and those who rode in them he managed to return to the university campus unpunctured for which he was duly grateful that evening a great rumble of gunfire came from the southeast with flashes lighting the horizon like distant lightning groves went up to the roof of the science building for a better view but still could not see much he hoped the barrage meant the army was giving the lizards hell and not the other way around the next morning an aide woke him before the sun rose sir general bradley on the telephone for you groves yawned rubbed his eyes ran his hands through his hair and scratched at his unruly mustache which was tickling his nose by the time hed picked up the telephone perhaps fortyfive seconds after hed been awakened he sounded competent and coherent even if he didnt feel that way yet groves here good morning general bradley said through static that came from the telephone rather than from groves fuzzy brainor so he hoped anyhow you remember that package we were discussing yesterday it looks like were going to need it delivered what felt like a jolt of electricity ran up groves spine all at once he wasnt sleepy any more yes sir he said as i told you were ready ahhwill you want it all in one piece or shall i send it by installments one piece would be sooner wouldnt it without waiting for an answer bradley went on youd better deliver it that way well want to open it as soon as we can yes sir ill get right on it groves said and hung up he threw off his pajamas and started scrambling into his uniform begrudging even that little time wasted when groves said hed get right on something he didnt mess around he bulled past his aide without agood morning and headed for the reprocessing plant where the latest atomic bomb was stored soon enough part of colorado would go into the fire liu hans heart pounded as she approached the little scaly devils pavilion that so marred the beauty of the island in the midst of the lake in the forbidden city turning to nieh hoting she said at last we have a real victory against the little devils nieh glanced over to her you have a victory you mean it matters little in the peoples fight against imperialist aggression except in the propaganda advantages we can wring from it ihave a victory liu han conceded she didnt look back at nieh as far as she could see he put ideology and social struggle even ahead of love whether between a man and a woman or between a mother and a child a lot of the members of the central committee felt the same way liu han sometimes wondered if they were really human beings or perhaps little scaly devils doing their best to impersonate people but not quite grasping what made them work nieh said i hope you will not let your personal triumph blind you to the importance of the cause you also serve he might have less in the way of feelings than an ordinary personor might just keep those feelings under tighter reinbut he was far from stupid a little scaly devil pointed his automatic rifle at the approaching humans in fair chinese he said you will enter the tent you will let us see you bring no concealed weapons with you you will pass through this machine here he pointed to the device liu han had gone through it once before nieh hoting many times neither of them had ever tried sneaking armaments through nieh had intelligence that the machine made a positively demonic racket if it did detect anything dangerous so far the peoples liberation army hadnt found a way to fool it liu han suspected that would come sooner or later some very clever people worked for the communist cause the machine kept quiet beyond it another armed little devil said pass on his words were almost unintelligible but no one could mistake the gesture he made with the barrel of the gun inside the tent the little scaly devil called ppevel sat behind the table at which liu han had seen him before beside him sat another male with much plainer body paint his interpreter ppevel spoke in his own hissing popping language the interpreter turned his words into chinese you are to be seated he pointed to the overstuffed chairs in front of nieh and liu han they were different from the ones that had been there on liu hans last visit and perhaps implied higher status for the envoys of the peoples liberation army liu han noticed that only peripherally she had hoped to see ttomalss sitting at the table with ppevel and had hoped even more to see her daughter she wondered what the baby would look like with her for a mother and the foreign devil bobby fiore for a father then a really horrible thought struck her if the little devils wanted to substitute another baby of the right age and type for the one she had borne how would she know the answer to that was simple and revolting she wouldnt not with any certainty she muttered an inaudible prayer to the amida buddha that such a thought had not occurred to the devils nieh hoting she knew had no more use for the amida buddha than for any other god or demon and did not think anyone else should either liu han shrugged that was his ideology she did not discern certain truth in it ppevel spoke again the interpreter translated we will return this hatchling to the female as a token of our willingness to give in exchange for getting we expect in return a halt to your guerrilla attacks here in peking of half a year is this the agreement he added an interrogative cough no nieh hoting answered angrily the agreement is for three months onlya quarter year liu hans heart sank would she lose her daughter again for the sake of a quarter of a year ppevel and the interpreter went back and forth in their own tongue then the interpreter said you will please pardon me a quarter of a year for you people is the correct agreement this is half a year for my people very well nieh said we are agreed then bring out the girl child you stole as part of your systematic exploitation of this oppressed woman he pointed to liu han and though we did not agree i tell you that you should apologize to her for the treatment she suffered at your hands and also for the propaganda campaign of vilflication you recently conducted against her in an effort to keep from returning the smallest victim of your injustice the interpreter translated that for ppevel the little devil with the fancy body paint spoke a single short sentence by way of reply ending it with an emphatic cough the interpreter said there is no agreement for the apology so there shall be no apology its all right liu han said softly to nieh i dont care about the apology i just want my baby back he raised an eyebrow and didnt say anything she realized he hadnt made his demand for the apology for her sake or at least not for her sake alone he was working for the cause trying to win a moral advantage over the scaly devils as he would have done over the japanese or the kuomintang clique ppevel turned both his eye turrets away from the human beings back toward an opening that led to the rear part of the large tent he spoke in his own language liu hans hands knotted into fistsshe caught ttomalss name ppevel repeated himself ttomalss came out he was carrying liu hans daughter for a moment she couldnt see what the baby looked likeher eyes blurred with tears give her to me she said softly the rage shed expected to feel on confronting the little devil whod stolen her child simply wasnt there seeing the little girl had dissolved it it shall be done ttomalss answered in his own language a phrase she understood then he switched to chinese my opinion is that returning this hatchling to you is an error that it would have served a far more useful purpose as a link between your kind and mine that said he angrily thrust the baby out at liu han my opinion is that you would serve a more useful purpose as night soil than you do now she snarled the rage wasnt gone after all merely suppressed she snatched her daughter away from the scaly devil now for the first time she took a good look at the little girl her daughter was not quite the same color as a purely chinese baby would have been her skin was a little lighter a little ruddier her face was a little longer a little more forwardthrusting too with a narrow chin that reminded liu han of bobby fiores and laid to rest any fears that the little devils had switched children on her the babys eyes had the proper shape they werent round and staring like those of a foreign devil welcome back to your home little one liu han crooned hugging her daughter tightly to her welcome back to your mother the baby began to cry it looked not to her but to ttomalss and tried to get away from her to go back to him that look was like a knife in her heart the sounds her daughter made were not like those of chinese nor even like those of the foreign devil language bobby fiore had spoken they were the hisses and pops of the little scaly devils hateful speech among them was an unmistakable emphatic cough ttomalss spoke with what sounded like spiteful satisfaction as you see the hatchling is now used to the company of males of the race not to your kind such language as it has learned is our language its habits are our habits it looks like a big ugly yes but its thoughts are those of the race liu han wished she had somehow smuggled a weapon into the tent she would cheerfully have slain ttomalss for what hed done to her daughter the baby kept twisting in her arms trying to get away trying to go back to the slavery with ttomalss that was all it had ever known its cries dinned in her ears nieh hoting said what has been done can be undone we shall reeducate the child as a proper human being this will take time and patience but it can be done and it shall be done he spoke the phrase in chinese it shall be done liu han used the little devils language throwing the words in ttomalss face and adding an emphatic cough of her own for good measure her daughter stared up at her eyes wide with wonder at hearing her use words it understood maybe it would be all right after all liu han thought when shed first met bobby fiore the only words theyd had in common had been a handful from the speech of the little scaly devils theyd managed and theyd gone on to learn fair amounts of each others languages and babies picked up words at an astonishing rate once they began to talk nieh was rightbefore long with luck her daughter would pick up chinese and would become a proper human being rather than an imitation scaly devil for now shed use whatever words she could to make the baby accept her all good now she said in the little devils language all good she grunted out another emphatic cough to show how good having her daughter back was again the little girl gaped in astonishment she gulped and sniffed and then made a noise that sounded like an interrogative cough she might have been saying is itreally liu han answered with one more emphatic cough suddenly like the sun coming out from behind rain clouds her daughter smiled at her she began to cry and wondered what the baby would make of that ready for takeoff teerts reported a moment later the air traffic control male gave him permission to depart his killercraft roared down the runway and flung itself into the sky he was glad hed climbed quickly for an antiaircraft gun not far west of the kansas air base threw several shells at him the race had been in nominal control of the area for some time but the big uglies kept smuggling in weapons portable on the backs of their males or beasts and made trouble with them it wasnt so bad here as hed heard it was in the sssr but it wasnt a holiday either he radioed the approximate position of the antiaircraft gun back to the air base well tend to it the traffic control male promised so they wouldeventually teerts had seen that before by the time they got around to sending out planes or helicopters or infantrymales the gun wouldnt be there any more but it would pop up again before long somewhere not far away nothing he could do about that he flew west toward the fighting outside of denver now that hed carried out several missions against the tosevite lines outside the city he understood why his superiors had transferred him from the florida front to this one the big uglies here had fortflied their positions even more strongly than the nipponese had outside harbin in manchukuo they had more antiaircraft guns here too he didnt like thinking about that hed been shot down outside harbin and still shuddered to remember nipponese captivity the americans were said to treat captives better than the nipponese did but teerts was not inclined to trust the mercies of any tosevites not if he could help it before long he spied the mountains that ridged the spine of this landmass like the dorsal shields of aneruti back on home rising higher than any of the peaks were the clouds of smoke and dust from the fighting he contacted forward air control for guidance to the targets that most urgently needed hitting we are having success near the hamlet known to the tosevites as kiowa the assault they launched in that area has failed and they are ripe for a counterattack the male gave teerts targeting coordinates adding if we break through here we may be able to roll up their line strike them hard flight leader it shall be done teerts said and swung his killercraft in the direction ordered for rance auerbach the war was over for a while there hed thought he was over hed wished he was with a bullet in the chest and another in the leg rachel hines had tried to drag him back to the american lines after he was hit he remembered coming to in the middle of that a memory he wouldnt have kept if hed had any choice in the matter then the lizards sallying out of karval against the cavalry raiders hed led got close he remembered blood bubbling from his nose and mouth as hed croakedhed tried to yellfor rachel to get the hell out of there hed figured he was done for anyhow and why should they get her too the one good memory he had from that dreadful time was the kiss on the cheek shed given him not an attention he would have wanted from most cavalry troopers he hoped shed got away he didnt know whether she had or not his lights had gone out again right about then next thing he knew he was in karval which was a hell of a mess after the shelling the americans had given it a harassedlooking human doctor was sprinkling sulfa powder into the wound in his thigh while a lizard who had red crosses in white circles added to his lizardly body paint watched with twoeyeturreted fascination auerbach had tried to raise his right arm to let the docand the lizard who looked to be a doctor tooknow he was among those present that was when he noticed the needle stuck in his vein and the tubing that led up to the plasma bottle a young woman was holding the motion was feeble but the girl noticed it and exclaimed hed been too woozy to notice her face which was masked anyhow but he recognized her voice hed lost rachel hines but now hed found penny summers you understand me the human doctor had asked when hed managed a quarterinchs worth of nod the fellow had gone on just in case youre wondering youre a pow and so am i if it werent for the lizards odds are youd be dead they know more about asepsis than well learn in a lifetime i think youre gonna make it youll walk again tooafter a while at that moment walking hadnt been the biggest thing on his mind breathing had seemed plenty hard enough now that the lizard armor had moved out of karval the aliens were using it as a center for wounded prisoners theyd taken pretty soon the few battered buildings left in town werent enough to hold everybody theyd run up tents of a briliant and hideous orange one to a patient auerbach had been in one for several days now he didnt see the doctor as often as he had at first lizards came by to look him over several times a day so did human nurses penny summers as often as any and maybe more often than most the first couple of times he needed it he found the bedpan mortifyingly embarrassing after that he stopped worrying about it it wasnt as if he had a choice howd they get you he asked penny his voice was a croaking whisper he hardly had breath enough to blow out a match she shrugged we were evacuating wounded out of lamar when the lizards were comin in you know how that wasthey didnt just come in they rolled right on through they scooped us up like a kid netting sunfish but they let us go on takin care of hurt people and thats what ive been doin ever since okay he said nodding yeah they seem to play by the rules pretty much anyhow he paused to get some more air then asked hows the war going cant hardly tell she answered aint no people around here with radios none i know about anyways ill say this much thoughthey been shippin a whole lot o pows back here lately thats liable to mean theyre winning isnt it liable to yeah he said he wanted to cough but held what little breath he had till the urge went away hed coughed once or twice already and it felt as if his chest was going to rip to pieces when he could speak again he went on do you know what kind of casualties theyre taking she shook her head no way for me to tell they ship their own wounded back somewheres else ah he said then shook his headcarefully because that pulled at the stitches that were holding him together boris karloff might have had more when he played infrankenstein but not a whole lot darned if i know why im even bothering to ask its going to be a long time before im able to worry about that kind of stuff he said it that way to keep from thinking it would never matter to him again if his chest healed if his leg healed hed eventually go to a real pow camp and maybe there however many months away that was he could start planning how to escape if his chest healed but his leg didnt he wouldnt be going anywherenowhere fast anyhow if his leg healed but his chest didnt well in that case theyd stick a lily in his hand and plant him penny looked at him looked down at the shiny stuffit was like thick cellophane but a lot tougherthe lizards had used to cover the dirt on which theyd set up the tent then back at him again in a low voice she said bet you wish now you would have laid me when you had the chance he laughed panted laughed again you really want to know ive been wishing that ever since the lizards bombed lamar but look at me his left arm worked more or less he gestured with it not much i can do about that now so why worry about it no you cant thats so pennys eyes kindled she knelt beside the governmentissue cot on which he was lying and flipped back the blanket but i can she laughed as she took him in hand and bent over him if i hear anybody comin ill make like i was givin you the bedpan he gasped when her mouth came down on him he didnt know whether hed rise he didnt know whether he wanted to rise suddenly he understood how a woman had to feel when the guy she was with decided he was going to screw her then and there and she was too drunk to do anything about it rise he did in spite of everything pennys head bobbed up and down he gasped again and then again he wondered if he was going to have enough air in him to come no matter how good it felt and her lips and teasing tongue felt as goodwell almost as goodas getting shot up felt bad she closed her hand around his shaft down below her busy mouth and squeezed him hard not more than two heartbeats later he shuddered and exploded for a moment purple spots swam before his eyes then the inside of the tent filled with light so clear and brilliant it seemed to be the lizard fighterbomber broke off its attack run and began to gain altitude omar bradley scratched at the little bandage on his nose hed had a boil there lanced a couple of days before im glad were doing this with a radio signal to back up the wire he said lay you seven to two the bombs and rockets broke the link my old man always told me never bet when i was liable to lose leslie groves answered no flies on him not a one bradley agreed youve got the buttons right there general one of them had better work you want to do the honors and push them you bet i do groves said ive been building these damn things for a hell of a long time now about time i get to find out what theyre like when they go off one of the ignition devices had an insulated wire coming out of it the other one didnt groves broad right thumb came down on one red button his left on the other take that you scaleless eggaddled stiffjointed things teerts cried as his rockets turned a stretch of tosevite defenses into an oven where the meat would be diced and ground as it was roasted the races landcruisers were snouting forward even as he bombarded the big uglies the tosevites had made a mistake this timetheyd made their attack with inadequate resources and not shifted over to the defensive fast enough when they ran out of steam the races commanders whod learned alertness since coming to tosev were making them pay for it there wasnt even much in the way of antiaircraft fire in this sector the big uglies had probably had a lot of guns overrun when the races counterattack went in as teerts began to climb back into the sky so he could return to the kansas air base and rearm his killercraft he decided he hadnt had such an easy mission since the early days of the conquest well before the nipponese captured him sudden impossible swelling glare made the nictitating membranes slide over his eyes in a futile effort to protect them the killercraft spun and flipped and twisted in the air violently unstable in all three axes the controls would not answer no matter what teerts did no he shouted nottwice he stabbed a thumb toward the ejector button the killercraft smashed into a hillside just before he reached it real penny summers pulled back from him gulping and choking a little too she took a long deep breath then said what the dickens do you suppose that is you mean you see it too auerbach said in his ruined voice his heart was racing like a thoroughbred on kentucky derby day sure do penny flipped the blanket up over him again like somebody fired up a new sun right outside the tent she looked around fading now though yeah the preternatural glow had lasted only a few seconds when auerbach first saw it hed wondered if it was a sign he was going to cash in his chips right then and there it would have been a hell of a way to go but he was glad he was still around what do you suppose it was before she answered penny scrubbed at her chin with a corner of the blanket then she said couldnt begin to guess probably some damn lizard thing though yeah auerbach said again he cocked his head to one side there was some sort of commotion out in the streets of the growing tent city of wounded he heard lizards calling and shouting to one another sounding like nothing so much as boilers with bad seams whatever it was theyre sure excited about it will you look at that leslie groves said softly craning his neck back to look up and up and up at the cloud whose top now spreading out like the canopy of an umbrella towered far higher into the sky than any of the rockies he shook his head in awe and wonder the lizard fighter plane burning not far away normally cause for a celebration now wasnt worth noticing will you justlook at that id heard what they were like general bradley answered ive been through the ruins of washington so i know what they can do but i never imagined the blast itself until youve seen it he didnt go on he didnt need to go on and heard it groves added they were some miles back toward denver the one thing you didnt want to be was too close to an atomic bomb when it went off even so the roar of the blast had sounded like the end of the world and the earth had jumped beneath groves feet wind tore past then quickly stilled i hope we pulled all our men back far enough so the blast didnt harm them bradley said hard to gauge that when we dont have enough experience with these weapons yes sir groves said and then well were learning more all the time and i expect well know quite a lot before this war is through im very much afraid youre right general bradley said scowling now we have to see where and how the lizards will reply the price weve paid to stop this drive is a city given over to the fire i pray it will prove a good bargain in the end so do i sir groves replied but if we dont hold denver we cant hang on to the rest of the usa so i tell myself bradley said it lets me fall asleep at night he paused his features grew so grim and taut groves was easily able to imagine what hed look like if he lived to eighty it lets me fall asleep he repeated but it doesnt let me stay that way atvar had been used to getting bad news up in his chamber aboard theth emperor hetto or in the bannerships command center receiving it in this tosevite room more or less adapted for the comfort of the race was somehow harder the furnishings and electronics were familiar the design of the windows the tosevite cityscape he saw through them the very size of the chamberreminding him why the race called tosevitesbig ugliesall shouted at him that this was not his world that he did not belong here outside denver is it he said dully and stared at the damage estimates coming up on the computer screen the numbers were still preliminary but they didnt look good the americans fighting ferociously from prepared positions had already taken a heavy toll on his males and now just when he thought his forces had achieved a breakthroughexalted fleetlord they tricked us kirel said they conducted an attack in that sector but so clumsily that they used themselves up in the process leaving inadequate force to hold the line there when the local commander sought to exploit what he perceived as a blunder it was a blunder indeed it was atvar said it was a blunder on our part they are subtle the big uglies full of guile and deceit they did not simply pull back and invite us forward as they have with past nuclear weapons we have warned our males against that but no they executed what seemed a legitimate if foolish tactical maneuverand deceived us again truth kirel said his voice as worn and filled with pain as that of the fleetlord how shall we avenge ourselves now destroying their cities does not seem to deter the big uglies from employing the nuclear weapons they build do you suggest a change in policy shiplord atvar asked that could have been a very dangerous question one all but ordering kirel to deny hed suggested any such thing it wasnt not the way the fleetlord phrased it he meant it seriously even so kirels voice was cautious as he answered exalted fleetlord perhaps we might be wiser to respond in kind and destroy tosevite military formations in the field against us this may have more effect than our present policy of devastating civilian centers and could hardly have less that does appear to be truth atvar called up a situation map of the fighting in the united states that let him banish the damage reports from the computer screen if not from his mind he pointed to the narrow peninsula stabbing out into the water in the southeastern region of the notempire here this florida place is made for such exploitation not only is the fighting on a confined front where nuclear weapons can be particularly effective striking the big uglies in this area will also let us avenge ourselves on the darkskinned tosevites who treacherously feigned allegiance to us may i exalted fleetlord kirel asked approaching the computer at atvars gesture of permission he shifted the image to a more detailed map of the fighting front in florida he pointed here between this town called orlando and the smaller one named can it really be apopka his mouth fell open in surprised amusement so did atvars in the language of the raceapopka meant to create a bad smell the fleetlord leaned forward to examine the map that does seem to be what the characters say doesnt it and yes that is a likely spot for retaliation truth kirel pointed to the dispositions on the map the americans have concentrated a good deal of armor hereabouts let the bomb fall where you indicatedafter our males withdraw just a bit too obviously perhaps we can lure the tosevites with one of their own tricks exalted fleetlord it shall be done kirel said nieh hoting was glad the little scaly devils had finally stopped showing their pornographic films of liu han they hadnt succeeded in destroying her usefulness to the cause of the peoples liberation army and after theyd returned her daughter to her there wasnt much point in continuing to portray her as a slut if anything shed gained prestige from their attacks on her that had partly been niehs doing through his showing how the films exposed not liu hans character but the little scaly devils vicious exploitation of her when they had her in a situation where her only choice was to submit that proposition had proved persuasive to the people of peking the central committee however had been less impressed oh theyd gone along with niehs arguments because it redounded to their advantage to do soand indeed liu han had gained prestige there too but they couldnt forget that she had been photographed in positions far beyond merely compromising since they couldnt blame her for that they looked askance at nieh for taking up with a woman who had done such things not fair nieh muttered under his breath the complaints went unnoticed in thehutung down which he made his way what with gossiping women squealing children yapping dogs vendors crying the virtues of their nostrums and fried vegetables and musicians hoping for coins anything less than machinegun fire would have drawn scant attention and even machinegun fire provided it wasnt too close went unremarked in peking these days nieh came out onto theliu li chang the street of the glazed tile factory it would have been a pleasant place to pass time had he had more leisure for it was full of shops selling old books and other curios though hed been born in the dying days of the chinese empire and though hed been thoroughly indoctrinated in marxistleninist thought he still maintained more respect for antiquarian scholarship than he sometimes realized now though instead of going into one of those booksellers establishments he paused at the little devils outdoor cinema device in front of it instead of leering at liu han as she let some mans potent pestle penetrate her the crowd gaped at what looked like the mother of all explosions the smooth chinese narrator for the newsreelthe same running dog who had so lovingly described liu hans degradationsaid thus does the race destroy those who oppose it this blast took place in the american province called florida after the foolish foreign devils provoked the merciful servants of the empire beyond measure let it serve as a warning to all those who dare to offend our masters here in china from the fiery cloud of the bomb blast itself the scene shifted to the devastation it wrought a tanks cannon sagged down as if it were a candle that had drooped from being too close to the fire some of the ground looked as if the heat of the bomb had baked it into glass charred corpses lay everywhere some of the charred chunks of meat were not yet corpses for they wriggled and moaned and cried out in their unintelligible language i wouldnt want that happening to me exclaimed an old man with a few long white whiskers sprouting from his chin it happened to the little scaly devils too nieh hoting said the americans used a bomb just like this one against them this is the scaly devils retaliation but people can make these bombs too he was glad of that even if the americans were capitalists foreign devils can make these bombs maybe if what you say is true the old man answered but can we chinese do this he paused a moment to let the obvious answer sink in then went on since we cant we had better do what the little devils say here eh several people nodded nieh glared at them and at the old man the little devils have never used that kind of bomb here or even threatened to he said and if we dont resist them theyll rule us the same way the japanese didwith fear and savagery is that what we want the little scaly devils theyll leave you alone if you leave them alone the old man said nieh resolved to find out who he was and arrange for his elimination he was obviously a collaborator and a troublemaker a couple of people nodded again but a woman spoke up what about that poor girl the one they made do all those horrible things in front of their cameras what had she done to them beforehand the old man stared at her he opened his mouth like a little devil laughing but had far fewer teeth than the imperialist aggressors from the stars while the fellow was still groping for a reply nieh hoting headed back toward the roominghouse where he lived when he got there he found hsia shoutao sitting in the downstairs dining room drinking tea with a pretty singsong girl whose green silk dress was slit to show an expanse of golden thigh hsia looked up and nodded to him without the least trace of embarrassment his selfcriticism had not included any vows of celibacy only a pledge to keep from bothering women who showed they were not interested in him for the singsong girl the transaction would be purely commercial nieh frowned anyhow his aide had a way of letting pledges slip a fingers breadth at a time nieh had other things on his mind at the moment though he trudged upstairs to the room hed been sharing with liu hanand lately with her daughter at last redeemed from the little scaly devils as he climbed the stairs he let out a small silent sigh that wasnt yet working out as well as liu han had imagined it would in niehs experience few things in life did he had not found a good way to tell that to liu han he tried the door it was locked he rapped on it whos there liu han called warily from within she hadnt casually opened the door since the day hsia shoutao tried to rape her but when she heard niehs voice she lifted the bar let him in and stepped into his arms for a quick embrace you look tired he said what she looked was haggard and harassed he didnt think he ought to say that to her instead he pointed to her daughter who sat over in a corner playing with a strawstuffed doll made of cloth how is liu mei this afternoon to his surprise and dismay liu han started to cry i gave birth to her and she is still frightened of me its as if she thinks she ought to be a little scaly devil not a human being liu mei started to pull some of the stuffing out of the doll which was far from new dont do that liu han said her daughter took no notice of her then she spoke a word in the little devils language and added one of their coughs the little girl stopped what she was doing wearily liu han turned to nieh you see she understands their tongue not chinese she cannot even make the right sounds for chinese what can i do with her how can i raise her when she is like this patience nieh hoting said you must remember patience the dialectic proves communism will triumph but says nothing with certainty as to when the little scaly devils know nothing of the dialectic but their long history gives them patience they had liu mei her whole life and did their best to make her into one of them you have had her only a few days you must not expect her to change overnight for you i know thathere liu han tapped a finger against her forehead but my heart breaks every time she flinches from me as if i were a monster and whenever i have to speak to her in a language i learned because i was a slave as i said you are not viewing this rationally nieh answered one reason you are not viewing it rationally is that you are not getting enough sleep liu mei may not be a human child in every way but she wakes up in the night like one he yawned i am tired too liu han hadnt asked him to help take care of the baby that she might had never occurred to him caring for a child was womens work in some ways nieh took women and their place as much for granted as hsia shoutao did so did liu han in some ways she said i wish i had an easier time comforting her i am not what she wants she makes that quite plain her mouth twisted into a thin bitter line what she wants is that little devil ttomalss he did this to her he should be made to pay for it nothing we can do about that not unless we learn hes come down to the surface of the world again nieh said not even the peoples liberation army can reach into one of the scaly devils ships high in the sky the little devils are patient liu han said in a musing tone of voice he will not stay up in his ship forever he will come down to steal another baby to try to turn it into a little scaly devil when he does nieh hoting would not have wanted her to look at him that way i think you are right he said but he may not do that in china the world is a larger place than we commonly think if he comes he will come to china liu han spoke with the assurance of a man he speaks chinese i do not think he speaks any other human language if he robs some poor woman he will rob one from china nieh spread his hands this is logical i must say what do you want us to do about it punish him she answered at once i will bring the matter before the central committee and get official approval for it the central committee will not approve of an act of personal vengeance he warned her getting agreement to put the rescue of your child on the negotiation agenda was difficult enough but this i think the motion will be approved liu han said steadily i do not intend to present it as a matter of personal vengeance but as a symbol that the little devils oppression of mankind is not to be tolerated present it however you like nieh replied it is still personal vengeance i am sorry liu han but i do not feel able to give you my own support in this matter i have spent too much political capital for liu mei already i will present the motion anyhow liu han told him i have discussed it with several committee members i think it will pass whether you support it or not he stared at her theyd worked well together in bed and out but hed always been the dominant partner and why not hed been an army chief of staff before the little scaly devils came and turned everything topsyturvy and shed been nothing but a peasant woman and an example of the scaly devils oppression everything she was in the revolutionary struggle she was because of him hed brought her onto the central committee to give him more support how could she turn against him by the look in her eye shed gained the backing she needed to get her motion adopted shed done that quietly behind his back hsia shoutao hadnt got wind of it either youre good he said in genuine admiration youre very good yes i am she said matteroffactly to herself as much as to him then her expression softened a little thank you for putting me in a place where ive had the chance to show i could be shewas very good she was even letting him down easy making sure he didnt stay angry at her and she was doing it as a man would with words rather than using her body to win the point he didnt think it was because she didnt fancy him any more it was just another way for her to show him what she could do he smiled at her she looked back in wary surprise the two of us will go far if we stick together he said she thought about that then nodded only later did he wonder whether he would be guiding her down his track or she guiding him down hers the train groaned to a stop ussmak had never ridden on such a hideous conveyance in all his life back on home rail transport was fast smooth and nearly silent thanks to magnetic levitation trains never actually touched the rails over which they traveled it wasnt like that here he felt every crosstie every rail joint that jounced the train as it slowly chugged along his landcruiser had had a smoother more pleasant ride on the worst broken terrain than the train did in its own roadbed he let out a soft sad hissing sigh if id had my wits about me i never would have sunk my teeth into that lidov creature ah wellthats what ginger does to a male one of the other males jammed into the compartment with him a riflemale named oyyag said at least you got to bite one of the stinking big uglies most of us just got squeezed dry and used up a chorus of agreement rose from the others to them ussmak was a hero of sorts precisely because hed managed to strike a blow against the sssr even after the local big uglies got him in their claws it was an honor he could have done without the tosevites knew why he was on this train too and treated him worse because of it as oyyag had said the soviets had simply run out of questions to put to most of the captive males not ussmak though two big uglies carrying automatic weapons opened the door to the compartment out out they bawled in the russkis ugly language that was a word ussmak had learned he hadnt learned many but some of his fellows had been captive for a long time they translated for those who like him were newcaught and innocent out he went the corridor was chilly the tosevites pressed back against the outer wall making sure no males could come close and attack them nobody was foolhardy enough to try no one who had any experience in the sssr could doubt that the big uglies would cheerfully shoot any male who gave them the least bit of trouble the outer door at the far end of the railroad car was open ussmak made for it he was used to being jammed into close quarters with many of his fellow maleshed been a landcruiser crewmale after allbut a little open space was welcome now and then too maybe theyll feed us better here than they did on the train he said hopefully silence one of the weapontoting guards bawled in the russki language hed learned that command too he shut up if the corridor had been chilly it was downright cold outside ussmak rapidly swiveled his eye turrets wondering what sort of place this would be it was certainly different from the battered city of moskva where hed been brought after yielding up his base to the males of the sssr hed got to see some on that journey but hed been a collaborator then not a prisoner dark green tosevite trees grew in great profusion all around the open area where the train had halted he opened his mouth a crack to let his tongue drink in their scent it was tangy and spicy and almost put him in mind of ginger he wished he had a tasteanything to take his mind off his predicament he wouldnt try to attack these big ugly guards well he didnt think he would anyhow the big uglies shouts and gestures sent him and his comrades in misery skittering through a gateway in a fence made of many strands of the fanged stuff tosevites used in place of razor wire and toward some rough buildings of new raw timber not far away other more weathered buildings lay farther off separated from these by more wire with fangs big uglies in stained and faded coverings stared toward him and his companions from the grounds around those old buildings ussmak didnt have much chance to look at them guards yelled and waved some more to show him which way to go some held automatic weapons too others controlled snarling animals with mouths full of big sharp yellow teeth ussmak had seen those tosevite beasts before hed had one with an explosive charge strapped to its back run under his landcruiser blow itself up and blow a track off the armored fighting vehicle if the big uglies could train them to do that he was sure they could train them to run over and bite males of the race who got out of line too he didnt get out of line literally or figuratively along with the rest of the males from the train he went into the building to which hed been steered he gave it the same swift eyeswiveling inspection hed used on the terrain surrounding it compared to the box in which hed been stored in the moskva prison compared to the packed compartment in which hed ridden from that prison to this place it was spacious and luxurious compared to any other living quarters even the miserable tosevite barracks hed had to inhabit in besancon it gave squalor a new synonym there was a small open space in the center of this barracks with a metal contraption in the middle of it a guard used an iron poker to open a door on the device then flung some black stones into the fire inside it only when he saw the fire did ussmak realize the thing was supposed to be a stove surrounding it were row on row of bunks five and six spaces high built to a size that conformed to the dimensions of the race not those of the big uglies as males hurried to get spaces of their own the impression of roominess the barracks had given disappeared they would be desperately crowded in here too a guard shouted something at ussmak he didnt know exactly what it meant but he got moving which seemed to satisfy the big ugly he claimed a thirdtier bunk in the second row of frames away from the stove that was as close as he could get he hoped it would be close enough having served in siberia he had an awed respect for the extremes tosevite weather could produce the bunks sleeping platform was of bare boards with a single smelly blanketprobably woven from the hairs of some native beast he thought with distastein case that joke of a stove did not put out enough warmth that struck ussmak as likely next to nothing the tosevites did worked the way it was supposed to except when intended to inflict suffering then they managed fine oyyag scrambled up into the bunk above his what will they do with us superior sir he asked i dont know either ussmak answered as a former landcruiser driver he did outrank the riflemale but even males of the race whose body paint was fancier than his often awarded him that honorific salute now that they were captives together none of them had ever led a mutiny or commanded a base after overcoming legitimate authority what they dont know is how much i wish i hadnt done itussmak thought sadlyand how much more i wish i hadnt yielded the base up to soviet troops once it was in my claws wishes did as much good as they usually did the barracks quickly filled with males as soon as the last new arrivals found bunksbunks so far away from the stove that ussmak pitied them when night cameanother male and two big uglies came into the doorway and stood there waiting to be noticed as they were the barracks slowly quieted ussmak studied the newcomers with interest the male of the race carried himself like someone who was someone though his body paint had been faded and abraded till little remained by which to judge his rank the tosevites with him presented an interesting contrast one wore the type of cloth wrappings typical of the guards who had oppressed ussmak ever since he went into captivity the other though had the ragged accouterments of the males who had watched from the far side of the fangedwire fence as ussmak and his colleagues arrived hed also let the hair grow out on his face which to ussmak made him look even more scruffy than tosevites normally did the male spoke i am fsseffel once i was an infantry combat vehicle band commander now i am headmale of race barracks one he paused the big ugly with the fuzz on his face spoke in the russki language to the one who wore the officialstyle cloth wrappingsinterpreter ussmak realized he got the idea that a big ugly who understood his language might be a useful fellow with whom to become acquainted fsseffel resumed males of the race you are here to labor for the males of the sssr this will henceforth be your sole function he paused to let that sink in and for translation then went on how well you work how much you produce will determine how well you are fed thats barbarous oyyag whispered to ussmak you expect big uglies to behave like civilized beings ussmak whispered back then he waved oyyag to silence fsseffel was still talking you will now choose for yourselves a headmale for this race barracks three this male will be your interface with the russki males of the peoples commissariat for the interior the tosevite organization responsible for administration of this camp he paused again to let the interpreter speak to the big ugly from the nkvd choose wisely i urge you he tacked an emphatic cough onto that if you do not make a selection one will be made for you more or less at random race barracks two had this happen results have been unsatisfactory i urge against such a course ussmak wondered what sort of unsatisfactory results fsseffel had in mind all sorts of nasty possibilities occurred to him starvation torture executions he hadnt thought in terms like those before the mutiny his frame of reference had changed since then and not for the better oyyag startled him by shouting ussmak a moment later half the males in the barracks were calling his name they wanted him for headmale he realized with something less than delight that would bring him into constant contact with the big uglies which was the last thing he wanted he saw no good way to escape though the big ugly with the hairy face said let the male called ussmak come forward and be recognized he was as fluent in the language of the race as any tosevite ussmak had heard when ussmak got down from his bunk and walked over to the door the big ugly said i greet you ussmak we will be working with each other in days to come i am david nussboym i greet you david nussboym ussmak said although he would rather not have made the tosevites acquaintance the breeze still brought the alien stink of cairo to the scent receptors on atvars tongue but it was a fine mild breeze and the fleetlord was more prepared to tolerate tosevite stinks now that he had succeeded in dealing the big uglies a heavy blow he called up the florida situation map on one of the computers installed in his tosevite lodging weve broken the americans here he told kirel pointing to the map the bomb created a gap and weve poured through it now they flee before us as they did in the early days of the conquest our possession of the peninsula seems assured truth exalted fleetlord kirel said but then tempered that by adding a pity the conquest does not proceed elsewhere as it did in the early days atvar did not care to dwell on that unless forcibly reminded of it after the americans exploded their own nuclear device outside denver the races attack there had bogged down it had already proved more expensive than calculations predicted as attacks against big ugly strongpoints had a way of doing the bomb had broken the southern prong of the attack and weakened the center and north as well because the local commander had shifted forces southward to help exploit what had looked like an opening an opening it had beenthe opening of a trap kirel said exalted fleetlord what are we to make of this latest communication from the sssr its leadership is certainly arrogant enough demanding that we quit its territory as a precondition for peace that isthat must bea loud bluff atvar replied the only nuclear weapon the sssr was able to fabricate came from plutonium stolen from us that the notempire has failed to produce another indicates to our technical analysts its inability to do so inform the big ugly called molotov and his master the great stalingreat compared to what the fleetlord added with a derisive snort that the sssr is in no position to make demands of us that it cannot enforce on the battlefield it shall be done kirel said atvar warmed to the subject in fact the success of our retaliatory bomb once more makes me wonder if we should not employ these weapons more widely than we have in the past not in the sssr surely exalted fleetlord kirel said in some alarm the broad expanse of land there is vulnerable to widespread radioactive pollution and would otherwise be highly satisfactory for agriculture and herding for our colonists in purely military terms this would be a much more highly satisfactory campaign if we could ignore the requirements of the colonization fleet atvar answered resentfully he sighed unfortunately we cannot were it not for the colonization fleet this conquest fleet would have no point the analysts agree with you largescale nuclear bombing of the sssr however tempting it would be to rid this planet of the emperormurdering clique now governing that notempire would create more longterm damage than the military advantage we would gain could offset i have also studied these analyses kirel said which raised atvars suspicions was kirel trying to prepare himself to wear a fleetlords body paint but he hadnt done anything about which atvar could take exception so the fleetlord waited for him to go on he did they state that there are certain areas where nuclear weapons may successfully be employed in an offensive role without undue damage to the planet atvars suspicion diminished not least because kirel had agreed with him he said if we do employ nuclear weapons on our own behalf rather than as retaliation for tosevite outrages we will also make ourselves appear less predictable and more dangerous to the big uglies this may have a political effect out of proportion to the actual military power we employ again exalted fleetlord this is truth kirel said letting the big uglies know we too can be unpredictable may prove as you say a matter of considerable importance for us that is a vital point atvar agreed we cannot predict the actions of the big uglies even with all the electronics at our disposal while they limited as they are in such matters often anticipate what we intend to do with results all too frequently embarrassing for us finding kirel in accord with him atvar blanked the map of florida and summoned another from the computer to take its place this large islandor perhaps it is a small continent but let the planetologists have the final say therelying to the southeast of the main continental mass had huge tracts of land ideally suited for settlement by the race and little used by the big uglies most of whose habitations cling to the damper eastern coast yet from those bases they continually stage annoying raids on us all conventional efforts to suppress these raids have proved useless this might prove the ideal site for nuclear intervention well said exalted fleetlord kirel answered if we do strike those areas with nuclear weapons most of the radioactive fallout they produce will be blown out to sea and seas the size of those here on tosev undoubtedly can accommodate such with far less damage than the land this planet has altogether too much sea in proportion to its land area atvar agreed the planetologists will spend centuries accounting for what makes it so different from home and the worlds of the rabotevs and hallessi let them worry about such things kirel said our job is to make certain they have the opportunityto worry now you have spoken well shiplord atvar said and kirel stretched out from the rather nervous posture he usually assumed around the fleetlord atvar realized he had not given his chief subordinate much in the way of praise lately that was an error on his part if they did not work well together the progress of the conquest would be impededand too many things had already impeded the progress of the conquest atvar hissed out a sigh had i any conception of the magnitude of the task involved in suppressing resistance on an industrialized world without destroying it in the process i would have thought long and hard before accepting command kirel didnt answer right away had atvar declined the position he most likely would have been appointed fleetlord how much did he want to taste the job atvar had never been certain of that which made his dealings with the shiplord of the conquest fleets bannership edgier than they might have been kirel had never shown himself to be disloyal but when the shiplord did speak he dealt with the tactical situation under discussion not with atvars latest remark exalted fleetlord shall we then prepare to use nuclear weapons against these major tosevite settlements on the island or continent or whatever it may be he leaned forward to read the toponyms on the map so as to avoid any possible mistakes against sydney and melbourne i mean atvar leaned forward too to check the sites for himself yes those are the ones begin preparations as expeditiously as possible exalted fleetlord it shall be done xii as prisons went the one moishe russie and his wife and son now inhabited wasnt bad it even outdid the villa where the jewish underground in palestine had incarcerated them here in what had been a fine hotel he and his family got plenty of food and enjoyed both electricity and hot and cold running water if not for bars on the windows and armed lizard guards outside the door the suite would have been luxurious despite bars the windows drew moishe he stared in endless fascination out across cairo at the nile and beyond it the pyramids i never thought we would be like joseph and come to egypt out of palestine he said who will be our moses and lead us out again reuven asked moishe felt a burst of pride the boy was still so young but already not just learning the great stories of the torah but applying them to his own life he wished he had a better answer to give his son than i dont know but he didnt want to lie to reuven either rivka had a question much more to the point what will they do to us now i dont know that either moishe said he wished rivka and reuven hadnt come with him after zolraag recognized him in the jerusalem prison camp far too late now to do anything but wish though but he was vulnerable through them even back in warsaw the lizards had threatened them to try to make him do what they wanted his familys convenient disappearance had scotched that there it wouldnt here hed been ready to let himself be killed rather than obey the lizards but letting his wife and son sufferthat was something else again a key turned in the lock out in the hall moishes heart beat faster it was halfway between breakfast and lunchtime not a usual hour for the lizards to bother him the door opened zolraag came in the former provincelord of poland was wearing more ornate body paint now than either of the times when moishe had seen him in palestine he hadnt returned to the almost rococo splendor of his ornamentation back in his warsaw days but he was gaining on it he stuck out his tongue in moishes direction then reeled it back in you will come with me immediately he said in fair german turningsofort into a long menacing hiss it shall be done moishe answered in the language of the race he hugged rivka and kissed reuven on the forehead not knowing whether he would see them again zolraag allowed that but made small impatient noises like a thick pot of stew coming to a boil when moishe came over to him the lizard rapped on the inner surface of the door the knob there had been removed zolraag used a sequence of knocks different from any the lizards had employed before presumably to keep the russies from learning a code breaking out and causing trouble not for the first time moishe wished he and his family were as dangerous as the lizards believed they were out in the hallway four males pointed automatic weapons at his midsection zolraag gestured for him to walk toward the stairwell two of the lizard guards followed both of them too far back to let him whirl and try to seize their riflesas if he would have beenmeshuggeh enough to try zolraag ordered him into a mechanical combat vehicle the guards got into it too one of them slammed the rear doors shut behind him the clang of metal striking metal had a dreadfully final sound zolraag spoke a single word into what looked like a microphone at the front of the troop compartment go the combat vehicle clattered through the streets moishe got only a limited view through the machines firing ports it was one of the least pleasurable journeys of his life in any number of ways the seat on which he awkwardly tried to perch was made for a male of the race not someone his size his backside didnt fit it while his knees came up under his chin it was hot in there too hotter even than outside the lizards basked in the heat russie wondered if hed pass out before they got where they were going he glimpsed a marketplace that dwarfed any hed seen in palestine through the fighting vehicles armor plate he heard people jeering and cursing at the lizardsthat at least is what he thought they were doing though he knew not a word of arabic but if anything so gutturally incandescent wasnt cursing it should have been whatever it was zolraag ignored it a few minutes later the vehicle stopped one of moishes guards opened the doors at the rearjude heraus zolraag said which made the hair stand up on the back of russies neck theyd brought him to another hotel the lizards had fortified this one like the maginot line when moishe looked around he saw enough razor wire aliens with automatic weapons and panzers and combat vehicles to hold off rommelsafrika korps and the british whod fought him not that the nazis or the british were going concerns in north africa these days he didnt get much time for sightseeing zolraag said come the guards pointed their weapons at him and he perforce came the hotel lobby had ceiling fans they werent turning the electric lights were on so moishe decided the fans were off because the lizards wanted them off the lift worked too in fact it purred upward more silently and smoothly than any on which moishe had ever ridden he didnt know whether it had always been like that or the lizards had improved it after they conquered cairo it was at the moment the least of his worries when the lift doors opened he found himself on the sixth floor the topmost one out zolraag said and moishe obeyed again zolraag led him along the hallway to a suite of rooms that made the one where the russies were confined seem prisonlike indeed a lizard who wore strange body paintthe right side fairly plain the left fancier than any moishe had seen till nowspoke with zolraag at the doorway then ducked back into the suite he returned a moment later bring in the big ugly he said it shall be done adjutant to the fleetlord zolraag answered they spoke their own language but moishe managed to follow it the fleetlord he said and was proud that despite his surprise hed remembered to add an interrogative cough the lizards ignored him even so he hadnt even thought the fleetlord was on the face of the earth atvars body paint was like that of pshings left side only all over other than that he looked like a lizard to russie he was able to tell one of the aliens from another but only after hed known him for a while zolraag said exalted fleetlord i present to you the tosevite moishe russie who is at last returned to our custody i greet you superior sir moishe said as politely as he could no point in insulting the chief lizard over anything inconsequential he turned out to be wrong even so i greet youexalted fleetlord zolraag said sharply moishe repeated the phrase this time with the right honorific that is better zolraag told him atvar meanwhile was studying him from head to toe eye turrets swinging up and down independently of each other in the unnerving way lizards had the fleetlord spoke in his own language too fast for moishe to stay with him seeing that zolraag translated his words into german the exalted fleetlord wants to know if you are now satisfied as to the overwhelming power of the race the word he used to translaterace into german wasvolk that raised moishes hackles all over again the nazis had usedvolk for their own ends he had to bring himself back under conscious control before answering tell the fleetlord i am not if the race had overwhelming power this war would have been over a long time ago he wondered if that would anger atvar he hoped not he had to be careful about what he said much less for his own sake than for rivkas and reuvens to his relief atvars mouth fell open the lizards sharp little teeth and long forked tongue were not delightful sights in and of themselves but they meant the fleetlord was amused rather than annoyed truth atvar said a word russie knew he nodded to show he understood atvar went on in the lizards speech again too quickly for moishe to keep up zolraag translated once more the exalted fleetlord has learned from me among others that you opposed having the jews rise on our behalf when we entered palestine why did you do this when you supported us against the germans in poland two reasons moishe said first i know better now than i did then that you plan to rule all of mankind forever and i cannot support that second the germans in poland were slaughtering jews as you know the british in palestine were doing no such thing some of the jews who back you there had escaped from germany or from poland you seem more dangerous to me than the british do zolraag translated that into the lizards hisses and pops and squeaks atvar spoke again this time slowly aiming his words directly at moishe these other males who escaped do not think as you do why is this moishe did his best to answer in the language of the race other males see short i look for long in long race worse british better to show how strongly he believed that he ended with an emphatic cough it is good that you think of the long term few big uglies do atvar said it may even be that from the point of view of a big ugly who does not wish to come under the rule of the race you are right he paused and turned both eye turrets toward moishes face this will not help you though the lizards had replaced the humanmade furniture in the suite with their own gear it made the room in which russie stood appear even larger than it really was one of the many devices with blank glass screens lit up suddenly showing a lizards face the lizards voice came out of the machine tooa telephone with a cinema attachment moishe thought by the way atvars adjutant jerked at whatever the message was he might have stuck his tongue into a live electrical socket he turned one eye turret back toward atvar and said exalted fleetlord not now pshing atvar replied with very human impatience but the adjutantpshingkept talking atvar hissed something russie didnt understand and whirled away from him toward the screen as he did so the lizards face disappeared from it to be replaced by a great mushroomshaped cloud rising into the sky moishe gasped in horror hed seen one of those clouds on his way to palestine rising over what had been rome the sound he made seemed to remind atvar he was there the fleetlord turned one eye turret toward zolraag for a moment and snapped get him out of here it shall be done exalted fleetlord zolraag said he turned to russie go now the exalted fleetlord has more important things with which to concern himself at the moment than one insignificant big ugly moishe went he said nothing until the infantry combat vehicle that had brought him to atvars headquarters started back toward the hotel in which he was imprisoned then he asked where did that atomic bomb explode zolraag let out a hiss that made him sound like an unhappy samovar so you recognized it did you the place is part of this province of egypt i gather it has two names in your sloppy tosevite fashion it is called both el iskandariya and alexandria do you know either of these names someone bombed alexandria moishe exclaimedvay iz mir who how you of the race control all this country dont you i thought we did zolraag answered evidently not yes who we do not know the british taking revenge for what we did to australia we did notdo notbelieve them to have weapons of this sort could they have borrowed one from the americans he sounded as if he meant the question seriously moishe made haste to reply i have no idea superior sir no zolraag said yet you broadcast for the british we must investigate further ice ran up russies back the lizard went on the deutsche fighting us as best they could we do not knowbut when we learn which big uglies did this they will pay a great price something zolraag had said got through to moishe slower than it should have australia superior sir what happened in australia we destroyed two cities to secure our conquests there the former polish provincelord answered with chilling indifference before returning to a previous question how we do not know that either we detected no airplanes no missiles no boats moving over the water we do not believe the bomb could have been smuggled in by land either we would have found it in our searches of cargo not over water not by air not on land moishe said that doesnt leave much did someone dig a tunnel and set the bombunder alexandria zolraag made more horrifiedteakettle noises then burst out you tosevites have not the technology to accomplish this that was when he figured out russie had been offering a jest however feeble not funnyreb moishe he said and used an emphatic cough to show how unfunny it was nobody had called moishereb since hed left warsaw then hed thought the lizards had come in answer to his prayer to make the nazis leave off persecuting the jews in the ghetto theyd established people had gained hope from that now he saw that the lizards while they didnt hate jews in particular were more dangerous for the rest of the world than the nazis had dreamt of being two australian cities destroyed without provocation no matter how sweltering the air inside the armored fighting vehicle he shivered heinrich jager peered down into the panthers engine compartment fuelpump gasket again he growled god in heaven how long does it take for them to get the fabrication right gunther grillparzer pointed to the lot number stenciled in white paint on the black rubber gasket this is an old one sir he said probably dates back to the first couple of months production run that did little to console jager were damned lucky the engine didnt catch fire when it failed whoever shipped it out to us ought to be horsewhipped ahh give the dumb bastard a noodle and put somebody else in his job grillparzer said using ss slang for a bullet in the back of the neck hed probably picked that up from otto skorzeny he probably wasnt joking either jager knew how things worked in german factories these days with so many german men at the front a lot of people doing production work were jews russians frenchmen and other slave laborers subject to just that kind of punishment if they made the slightest mistake is the replacement a new one jager demanded grillparzer checked the lot number yes sir he answered we slap that in there it shouldnt give us any trouble tillthe next time anyhow on that optimistic note he grabbed a screwdriver and attacked the fuel pump off in the distance a flight of rockets screamed away toward the lizard lines jager winced at the horrible noise hed been on the receiving end of stalinorgan concertos when the red army lobbedkatyushas at thewehrmacht before the lizards came if you wanted to tear up a whole lot of ground in a hurry rockets were the way to do it they didnt bother skorzeny at all someone will be catching hell he said cheerfully then lowering his voice so only jager could hear he went on almost as good as the pasting we gave alexandria ah that was us was it jager said just as softly skorzenyheard things the radio hasnt claimed it for thereich the radio bloody well isnt going to claim it for thereich either the ss man answered if we take credit for it one of our towns goes right off the map cologne maybe or frankfurt or vienna may happen anyway but were not going to brag and help it along not when we can keep quiet and smile mysteriously if you know what i mean maybe his smile was intended to be mysterious but it ended up looking raffish jager asked do you know how we did it thats a mystery to me as a matter of fact i do but im not supposed to tell skorzeny said jager picked a branch up off the ground and made as if to hit him with it skorzeny chuckled shit i never have been any good at doing what im supposed to you know you cant fit one of those bombs on a plane or a rocket right oh yes jager said remember i got involved in that project deeper than i wanted to you mad bastard that was your fault too if i hadnt been on that raid with you that snatched the explosive mend from the lizards youd have stayed a soviet puppet and youd probably be dead by now skorzeny broke in if the lizards didnt get you the bolsheviks would have but thats neither here nor there we didnt put it on a freighter either the way we did when we blasted rome hard to fool the lizards the same way twice jager walked along thinking hard he scratched the side of his jaw he needed a shave he had a straight razor but scraping his face without shaving soap hurt more than it was worth at length he said we couldnt have sent it in overland insane even to think about it that leavesnothing i can see nothing the lizards can see either skorzeny grinned an evil grin theyd be tearing their hair if they had any but i know something they dont know he almost chanted the words as if he were a little boy taunting the other children on the schoolyard he thumped his finger off jagers chest i know something you dont know too thats all right jager said i know im going to boot you in the arse if you dont spill it how did we burn the library at alexandria like most classical allusions that one sailed past skorzeny he answered the main question though i know we have a new kind of uboat thats what i know damned if i know how but it can do kilometers submerged every centimeter of the way god in heaven jager said in genuine awe if the lizards hadnt come wed have swept the atlantic clean with boats like that he scratched his jaw again visualizing a map of the eastern mediterranean it must have sailed fromcrete skorzenys blunt features registered a curious blend of respect and disappointment arent you the clever chap he said yes from crete to alexandria you can sail underwateras long as you understand you wont sail back mm yes there is that jager did some more muffing you couldnt tell the whole crewthered be a mutiny but you could find a man you could rely on to press the button or flip the switch or whatever he had to do he took off his black service cap in respect for the courage of that man has to be how they did it all right skorzeny agreed one thinghed never know what hit him jager thought of the fireball hed seen going up east of breslau the one that had stalled the lizards attack on the town he tried to imagine being at the center of that fireball youre right he said you might as well drop a man into the sun thats what it would be like sure enough the ss man said he walked along beside jager whistling tunelessly between his teeth after half a dozen paces or so he asked ever so casually your jewish chums down in lodz send any messages back to you they gloating that they got the better of me i havent heard a word from them jager answered truthfully i wouldnt be surprised if theyd stopped trusting germans altogether after that bill of goods you tried selling them and there he thought was a fine euphemism for a nervegas bomb if you couldnt speak straight out about the things you did maybe you shouldnt have done them in pointed tones he went on they are still keeping the lizards from using lodz as a staging point against us in spite of everything goody for them skorzeny said with a fine sardonic sneer he thumped jager on the back hard enough that he almost went headlong into the trunk of a birch tree not so long from now that wont matter either no apprehension trickled down jagers spine skorzenydid hear things are they going to order us to try to reduce the town im not sure we can do itand even if we manage street fightingll play hob with our armor skorzeny laughed loud and long from up in that birch tree a squirrel chattered indignantly no theyre not going to stick your dick in the sausage machine jager he said how do i put it if we can give the lizards a present in alexandria we can give them and the jews one in lodz jager was a lutheran he wished hed grown up catholic crossing himself would have been a comfort there could be no mistaking what skorzeny meant how will you get it into lodz he asked genuinely curious the jews will never trust youtrust usagain theyre liable to have warned the poles too god if they know whats in that bomb of yours theyre liable to have warned the lizards fuck the lizards fuck the poles and fuck the jews too skorzeny said i wont take anybodys help with this one when the package gets here ill deliver it personally you have to work david nussboym said in the language of the lizards he used an emphatic cough if you dont work theyll starve you or theyll just kill you as if to underscore his words men with submachine guns surrounded alien prisoner barracks number the lizards in the barracks hissed and squeaked and muttered among themselves their spokesman the male called ussmak answered so what for what they feed us the work is impossibly hard we starve anyhow if they kill us quickly it will all be over our spirits will join those of emperors departed and we will be at peace he cast down his eyes so did the rest of the lizards who listened to the talk nussboym had seen lizards in lodz do likewise when they spoke of their sovereign they believed in the spirits of emperors past as passionately as ultraorthodox jews in god or good communists in the dictatorship of the proletariat they were also right about the rations they got none of that mattered much to nussboym if he didnt get these lizards working again out hed go to the timbercutting detail hed escaped when they arrived the rations human woodchoppers got were made for slow starvation too what can the camp administrators do that would put you back to work he asked ussmak he was ready to make extravagant promises whether the nkvd men who ran the camp would keep them was another matter but once the lizards again got into the habit of working theyd keep at it at lot of lizards were naive and trusting by human standards ussmak proved he wasnt one of those they can leave they can die he answered his mouth dropping open in a laugh surely sardonic truth several males echoed from their crowded bunks fsseffels gang is working as ordered nussboym said trying another tack they are meeting norms in all areas he didnt know whether that last bit was true or not but ussmak had no way to contest it contact between his barracks hall and the one where fsseffel was headman had been cut off as soon as the males here began their strike because fsseffel is a fool do not think i am a fool too ussmak replied we will not be worked to death we will not be starved to death until we believe we will not be overworked or underfed we will not do anything nussboym glanced out toward the nkvd guards they could come in here drag a few of you outside and shoot you he warned yes they could ussmak agreed they would not get much work from the males they shot though he laughed again i shall take your words to the commandant nussboym said he meant that for a warning too but did not think ussmak was impressed the lizard seemed to him to have more depths of bitterness than any male of the race nussboym had known in poland he might almost have been a human being in poland of course the race had kept prisoners males had not been prisoners there when ussmak declined to answer nussboym left the barracks any luck one of the guards called to him in russian he shook his head he did not like the scowl on the guards face he also did not like going back to the hodgepodge of polish russian and yiddish he used to communicate with his fellow humans here in the camp making himself understood was sometimes easier in the lizards language the leader of the guards who surrounded the barracks was a gloomy captain named marchenko comrade captain i need to speak with colonel skriabin nussboym said maybe you do marchenko had some kind of accentukrainian nussboym thoughtthat made him even harder to understand than most russians but does he need to speak to you from him that passed for wit after a moment scowling still he nodded all right pass back into the old camp the camp administrative offices were better built better heated and far less crowded than thezeks barracks half the people working there werezeks though clerks and orderlies and what have you it was far softer work than knocking down pines and birches in the woods that was certain his fellow prisoners eyed nussboym with glances half conspiratorial half suspicious in a way he was one of them but his precise status wasnt yet clear and might prove too high to suit a lot of them the speed with which he won access to skriabin prompted mutters among the file cabinets what news nussboym the nkvd colonel asked nussboym was not important enough to rate first name and patronymic from the short dapper little man on the other hand skriabin understood polish which meant nussboym didnt have to mumble along in his ugly makeshift jargon comrade colonel the lizards remain stubborn he said in polish as long as skriabin called him by his surname he couldnt address the colonel as gleb nikolaievich may i state an opinion as to why this is so go ahead skriabin said nussboym wasnt sure just how smart he was shrewd yes of that there could be no doubt but how much real intelligence underlay that mental agility was a different question now he leaned back in his chair steepled his fingers and gave nussboym either his complete attention or a good facsimile of it their reasons i think are essentially religious and irrational nussboym said and for that reason all the more likely to be deeply and sincerely held he explained about the emperorworship that suffused the race finishing they may be willing to martyr themselves to join with emperors gone by skriabin closed his eyes for a little while nussboym wondered if the nkvd man had listened at all or if he would start to snore at any moment then all at once skriabin laughed startling him you are wrong he said we can get them back to workand with ease i am sorry comrade colonel but i do not see how nussboym didnt like having to admit incapacity of any sort the nkvd was only too likely to assume that if he didnt know one thing he didnt know anything and so to dispense with his services he knew things like that happened but colonel skriabin seemed amused not angry perhaps you are naive and innocent perhaps you are merely ignorant either one would account for your blindness here is what you will tell this ussmak who thinks we cannot persuade him to do what the workers and peasants of the soviet union require of him he spoke for some little while then asked now do you see i do nussboym said with respect grudging but nonetheless real either skriabin was very shrewd or genuinely clever he got no chance to think about which for the nkvd man said now march back there this instant and show that lizard he cannot set his naked will against the historical dialectic impelling the soviet union ahead to victory i shall go comrade colonel nussboym said he had his own opinions about the historical dialectic but skriabin hadnt asked him about them with luck skriabin wouldnt captain marchenko glowered at nussboym when he returned it didnt faze him marchenko glowered at everyone all the time nussboym went into the barracks full of striking lizards if you do not go back to work some of you will be killed he warned colonel skriabin is fierce and determined we are not afraid ussmak said if you kill us the spirits of emperors past will watch over us will they david nussboym asked colonel skriabin tells me many of you males here are mutineers who murdered your own officers even those who did not have surely given secrets of the race to the soviet union why would the emperors want anything to do with your spirits appalled silence crashed down inside the rebellious barracks then the lizards started talking among themselves in low voices mostly too fast for nussboym to follow he got the drift though that was something the lizards might have thought privately but bad never dared speak aloud he gave skriabin credit for understanding the way the aliens minds worked at last ussmak said you big uglies go straight for the killing shot dont you i have not abandoned the empire not in my spirit but the emperors may have abandoned me this is truth dare i take the chance of finding out darewe take the chance of finding out he turned to the prisoners and put the question to them in poland the lizards had derisively called democracysnoutcounting here they were using something uncommonly like it to hash the matter out for themselves nussboym didnt say anything about that he stood waiting till they were done arguing and tried to follow the debate as best he could we will work ussmak said he sounded dull and defeated we do need more food though and he hesitated then decided to go on if you can get us the herb ginger it would help us through these long boring days i will put your requests to colonel skriabin nussboym promised he didnt think the lizards were likely to get more food nobody except the nkvd men their trusties and the cooks got enough to eat ginger was another story if it drugged them effectively they might get it he walked out of the barracks well captain marchenko barked at him the strike is over he answered in polish then added a german word to make sure the nkvd man got itkaputt marchenko nodded he still looked unhappy with the world but he didnt look like a man about to hose down the neighborhood with his submachine gun as he often did he waved nussboym back toward the original camp as he returned he saw ivan fyodorov limping back into camp accompanied by a guard the right leg of fyodorovs trousers was red with blood his axe must have slipped out there in the woods ivan are you all right nussboym called fyodorov looked at him shrugged then looked away nussboyms cheeks flamed this wasnt the first time since hed become interpreter for the lizards that hed got the cold shoulder from the men of his former work gang they made it all too clear he wasnt one of them any more he hadnt been asked to rat on them or anything of the sort but they treated him with the same mistrustful respect they gave any of the otherzeks who went out of their way to work with the camp administration im just being realistiche told himself in poland the lizards had been the power to propitiate and hed propitiated them only a fool would have thought the germans a better choice well god had never been shy about turning out fools in carload lots that was how hed ended up here after all no matter where a man was he had to land on his feet he was even serving mankind by helping the nkvd get the most from the lizards he reported what they wanted to colonel skriabin skriabin only grunted nussboym wondered why he felt so lonely for the first time since george bagnall had had the displeasure of making his acquaintance georg schultz had kitted himself out in full german uniform rather than the motley mix of nazi and bolshevik gear he usually wore standing in the doorway of the house bagnall ken embry and jerome jones shared he looked large and mean and menacing he sounded menacing too you damned englishmen you had better clear out of pleskau while you have the chance he gave the german version of the name of the russian town you dont clear out now dont bet anyone will let you next week you understand what im saying embry and jones came up behind bagnall as if by chance the pilot casually held a mauser while the radarman bore a soviet ppsh submachine gun we understand you bagnall said do you understand us schultz spat in the mud by the doorway try and do some people a favor and this is the thanks i get bagnall looked at embry embry looked at jones jones looked at bagnall they all started to laugh why the devil would you want to do us a favor bagnall demanded far as i can tell you want to see us dead me especially jones added i am not responsible for the fair tatianas affections or for the shifts thereof he spoke as he might have of blizzards or earthquakes or other ineluctable forces of nature if youre dead she cant yank your trousers downthats so schultz said but if youre gone she cant yank your trousers down either one way or another you arent going to be around long i already told you that you can clear out or you can end up deadand youd better figure out quick which one you aim to do whos going to kill us bagnall said you he let his eyes flick back to his companions good luck dont be adummkopf schultz advised him in real fighting you three would just bewhat do they say collateral damage thats it nobody would know you were dead till you started to stink and theres going to be real fighting sure as hell were going to set this town to rights is what were going to do colonel schindler says bagnall began and then stopped lieutenant general chills secondincommand made most of the right noises about maintaining sovietgerman cooperation but bagnall had got the impression he was just making noise chill had thought working with the russians the best way to defend pskov against the lizards if schindler didnt ah see youre not so stupid after all schultz said nodding in sardonic approval if somebody draws you a picture you can tell whats on it very good he clicked his heels as if to an officer of his own forces why shouldnt we go off to brigadier german with news like this ken embry demanded you couldnt stop us he made as if to point his rifle at schultz what you think the russians are blind and deaf and dumb like you schultz threw back his head and laughed we fooled em good in they wont ever let us do that again doesnt matter he rocked back on his heels the picture of arrogant confidence we would have whipped em if the lizards hadnt come and well whip em here in pleskau too the first part of that claim was inherently unprovable however much he didnt care for it bagnall thought the second part likely to be true the soviet forces in and around pskov were expartisans they had rifles machine guns grenades a few mortars the nazis had all that plus real artillery and some armor though bagnall wasnt sure how much petrol they had for it if it came to open war thewehrmacht would win bagnall didnt say anything about that instead he asked do you think youre going to be able to keep the fair tatianadie schone tatianait was almost a homeric epithet for the sniperas a pet i wouldnt want to fall asleep beside her afterwards let me tell you a frown settled on schultzs face like a rain cloud plainly he hadnt thought that far ahead in action he probably let his officers do his thinking for him after a moment though the cloud blew away she knows strength tatiana when the forces of thereich have shown themselves stronger than the bolsheviks when i have shown myself stronger than she is he puffed out his chest and looked manly and imposing the three raf men looked at one another again by their expressions embry and jones were having as much trouble holding in laughter as bagnall was tatiana pirogova had been fighting the germans since the war started and only reluctantly went over to fighting the lizards after they landed if schultz thought a nazi win in pskov would awe her into thinking him a germanubermensch he was in for disappointmentprobably painful possibly lethal disappointment but how could you tell him that the answer was simple you couldnt before bagnall even started to figure out what to say schultz spoke first you have your warning do with it what you willguten tag he did a smart aboutturn and clumped away now that spring was truly here he wore german infantry boots in place of the russian felt ones everyone regardless of politics used during the winter bagnall shut the door then turned to his fellow englishmen well what the devil are we supposed to do aboutthat i think the first thing we do no matter what schultz said is to go pay a visit to aleksandr german jerome jones said knowing the germans dont love you is rather different from knowing they aim to kick you in the ballocks one day soon yes but after that embry said i dont much care to scuttle out of here but im damned if ill fight for the nazis and im not dead keen on laying my life on the line for the bolshies either that summed up bagnalls feelings so well he nodded instead of adding a comment of his own along those lines what he did say was jones is right wed best learn what germanhe put the hardg in thereknows about what the germanssoftg are up to he got a rifle of his own before going out on the streets of pskov embry and jones carried their weapons so did most of the men and a lot of the women in town nazis and red russians put him in mind of cowboys and red indians this game though was liable to be bloodier they went through the marketplace to the east of the ruins of thekrom bagnall didnt like what he saw there only a handful ofbabushkas sat behind the tables not the joking gossiping throngs that had filled the square even through the winter the goods the old women set out for sale were shabby too as if they didnt want to show anything too fine for fear of having it stolen aleksandr german made his headquarters across the street from the church of sts peter and paul at the buoy on ulitsa vorovskogo north of thekrom the red army soldiers who guarded the building gave the englishmen suspicious looks but let them through to see the commander the fierce red mustache german wore had given him the appearance of a pirate now with his face thin and pale and drawn the mustache seemed pasted on like misplaced theatrical makeup an enormous bandage still padded his crushed hand bagnall was amazed the surgeons hadnt simply amputated it he couldnt imagine the ruined member ever giving the partisan brigadier as much use as he could have got from a hook he and jerome jones took turns telling german of georg schultzs warning when they were through the soviet partisan officer held up his good hand yes i do know about this he said in the yiddish that came more naturally to him than did russian the nazi is probably rightthe fascists and we will be fighting again before long which does no one but the lizards any good bagnall observed aleksandr german shrugged it doesnt even do them much good he said they arent going to come north and take pskov not now theyre not theyve pulled most of their forces off this front to fight the germans in poland we were fighting the fascists before the lizards came and well be fighting them after the lizards go no reason we shouldnt fight them while the lizards are here too i dont think youll win bagnall said german shrugged again then we fade back into the woods and become the forest republic once more we may not hold the town but the nazis will not hold the countryside he sounded very sure of himself doesnt seem to leave much place for us jerome jones said in russian thanks to his university studies he preferred that language to german with bagnall it was the other way around it does not leave much place for you aleksandr german agreed he sighed i had thought to try to get you out of here now i shall not have the chance but i urge you to leave before we and the nazis start fighting among ourselves again you did all you could to keep that from happening up until now but colonel schindler is a less reasonable man than his late predecessorand as i say the threat from the lizards is less now so we have not got that to distract us from each other make for the baltic while you still can will you write us a safeconduct ken embry asked him yes certainly the partisan brigadier said at once you should get one from schindler too his face twisted you are englishmen after all and so deserve fair treatment under the laws of war if you were russians he shook his head the other thing you need to remember is how little good a safeconduct ours or schindlers may do for you if someone shoots at you from five hundred meters you will not be able to present it to him though that was true it was not a topic on which bagnall cared to dwell aleksandr german found a scrap of paper dipped a pen into a bottle that smelled more of berry juice than of ink and scribbled rapidly he handed the document to bagnall who still read cyrillic script only haltingly bagnall passed it to jerome jones jones skimmed through it and nodded good luck aleksandr german said i wish i had something more than that to offer you but even it is in short supply here these days the three englishmen were somber when they left the partisan brigadier do you think we ought to get alaissezpasser from schindler embry asked my guess is that we neednt bother bagnall answered the germans around here are all soldiers and all know who we are that isnt true of the russians not by a long chalk our piece of paper may keep some peasants from slitting our throats one night while were asleep in their haystack or of course it may not embry said not wanting his reputation for cynicism to suffer still i suppose were better off with it pity we didnt bring all our food and ammunition along bagnall said we could have started off straightaway instead of having to go back to the house its not that far back jones said and after we recover the gear i suggest we stay not upon the honor of our going when both sides tell you youd better hop it youre a fool if you dont listen and except where the fair tatiana is concernedhe grinned ruefullymrs jones raised no fools youll be free of her at last bagnall reminded him so will i he said and then dammit a captain with a set of decorations as impressive as basil roundbushs rapped on the door frame of david goldfarbs laboratory at dover college hullo he said i have a present for you chaps he turned and let out some grunts and hisses that sounded rather as if he were doing his best to choke to death more funny noises came back at him then a lizard walked into the room its turreted eyes going every which way goldfarbs first reaction was to grab for a pistol unfortunately he wasnt wearing one roundbush was and had it out with commendable speed no need for that the muchdecorated captain said mzepps is quite tame and so am i donald mather at your service after his first instant of surprise basil roundbush had taken a good look at mathers uniform the pistol went back into its holster hes sas david he said i expect he can protect us from a lizard or two dozen he sounded more serious than he normally would have while making such a crack goldfarb took a second look at mather and concluded roundbushwas serious the captain was a handsome chap in a blond chiselfeatured way and seemed affable enough but something about his eyes warned that getting on his wrong side would be a mistakequite likely a fatal mistake and he hadnt won those medals for keeping the barracks clean and tidy either sir what will we do withmzepps did you say he asked mzepps yes mather answered pronouncing eachp separately i expect he might be useful to you hes a radar technician you see ill stay around to interpret till the two of you understand each other well enough then ill be on my merry way he does speak a little english now but hes far from fluent a radar technician basil roundbush said softly oh david you are a lucky sod you know that dont you that peach of a girl now a lizard of your very own to play with he rounded on mather you dont happen to have a jetengine specialist concealed anywhere about your person do you we have this lovely video platter here on how to service their bloody engines and knowing what the words mean would help us understand the pictures captain mather actually did look up his sleeve nothing here im afraid the dispassionate tone of the reply only made it more absurd mzepps spoke up in the lizards hissing language mather listened to him then said he tells me he was kept with a couple of jetengine men er lizards back inwell you dont need to know that where he was before they like it where they are he says why was that mzepps he repeated the question in the lizards speech listened to the answer laughed and reported back they like it because the bloke theyre working with is hardly bigger than they are hullo whats got into you two goldfarb and roundbush had both let out yelps of delight goldfarb explained that has to be group captain hipple we both thought hed bought his plot when the lizards jumped on bruntingthorpe with both feet first word weve had hes alive ah that is a good show mather said he snapped his fingers and pointed at goldfarb something i was supposed to tell you and i nearly forgot he looked angry at himself he wasnt supposed to forget things youre cousin to that russie chap arent you without waiting for goldfarbs startled nod he went on yes of course you are i ought to let you know that not so very long ago i put him and his family on a boat bound for palestine on orders of my superiors did you goldfarb said tonelessly thank you for telling me sir other than that he shook his head i got them out of poland so the lizards wouldnt do their worst to him and now hes back in another country theyve overrun have you heard any word of him since he got there im afraid not mather answered ive not even heardthat he got there you know how security is he seemed faintly embarrassed i daresay i shouldnt have told you what i just did but bloods thicker than water what yes goldfarb gnawed on his lower lip better to know i suppose he wasnt sure he meant what he said he felt helpless but then mather might as easily have brought news that moishe and rivka and reuven had been killed in a lizard air raid on london there was still hope clinging to it he said well we havent much choice but to get on with it have we right you are mather said and goldfarb gathered hed made a favorable impression the sas man went on only way to keep from going mad is to carry on how very britishgoldfarb thought half ruefully half in admiration lets find out what mzepps knows about radars and what he can tell us about the sets weve captured from his chums before that first days work with the lizard prisoner was done he learned as much in some areas as he had in months of patientand sometimes not so patienttrial and error mzepps gave him the key to the colorcoding system the lizards used for their wires and electrical components far more elaborate and more informative than the one with which goldfarb had grown up the lizard also proved a deft technician showing the raf radarman a dozen quick tricks maybe more that made assembling disassembling and troubleshooting radars easier but when it came to actually repairing the sets he was less help through mather goldfarb asked him what do you do when this unit goes bad he pointed to the gadgetry that controlled the radar wavelength he didnt know how it did that but more cut and try had convinced him it did mzepps said you remove the module and replace it with one in good working order he reached into the radar see it snaps in and out like this very easy it was very easy from an accessibility standpoint the lizards sets beat what the raf made all hollow the lizards designed them so they not only worked but were also convenient to service a lot of good engineering had gone into that british engineers had just got to the point of being able to design radars that worked every time he looked at the cats cradle of wires and resistors and capacitors and the rest of the electronics that made up the guts of an raf set goldfarb was reminded that they hadnt yet concerned themselves with convenience but mzepps hadnt quite grasped what hed meant i see how you replace it yes but suppose you havent got a replacement for the whole unit suppose you want to repair the part in it thats gone bad how do you diagnose which part that is and how do you fix it captain mather put the revised question to the lizard no can do mzepps said in english he went on in his own language mather had to stop and ask more questions a couple of times at last he gave goldfarb the gist he says it really cant be done old man thats a unitary assembly if one part of it goes the whole units buggered for fair mzepps added something else mather translated again the idea is that it shouldnt break down to start with if he cant fix it when it breaks what the devil good is he goldfarb said as far as he was concerned you had no business mucking about with electronics without some notion of the theory behind the way the machines workedand if you understood the theory you were halfway to being able to juryrig a fix when something went wrong and something would go wrong after a moment he realized he wasnt quite fair plenty of people ran motorcars without knowing more about how they worked than where to put in the petrol and how to patch a punctured inner tube still he wouldnt have wanted one of those people on his team if he were driving a race car mzepps might have been thinking along with him through captain mather the lizard said the task of a technician is to know which unit is ailing we cannot manufacture components for our sets on this planet anyhow your technology is too primitive we have to use what we brought with us goldfarb imagined a victorian expeditionary force stranded in darkest africa the british soldiers could cut a great swath through the nativesas long as their ammunition held out their maxim guns didnt break some highly machined part their horses didnt start dying of sleeping sickness and they didnt come down with malaria or yaws or whatever you came down with in darkest africa sure as hell youd come down with something if that victorian army was stuck there without hope of rescue he turned to donald mather do you know sir this is the first bit of sympathy ive ever felt for the lizards dont waste it mather advised him theyd waste precious little on you and thats the gods truth theyre a nasty set of foes which only means we shall have to be nasty in return gas these bombs if were not to go under we must seize what spares we can that was inarguably true even so goldfarb didnt think mather took his point he glanced over at the sas man no mather didnt look to be the sort whod appreciate argument by historical analogy or any suchpilpul not that hed know that word either ask mzepps what hell do when he and his scaly chums run out of spares goldfarb said by then well be beaten mather said after the lizard was done with his noises thats still their propaganda line in spite of the thrashing they took when they came over here cant expect them to go about saying theyre doomed i suppose goldfarb allowed but if our charming prisoner there still thinks were going to be trounced why is he being so cooperative here hes helping grease the skids for his own people why not just name rank and pay number theres an interesting question mather made steamengine noises at mzepps goldfarb doubted he came up with many interesting questions on his own not ones unrelated to the immediate task at hand the lizard prisoner replied at some length and with some heat mather gave goldfarb the essence of it he says we are his captors so we have become his superiors the lizards obey their superiors the way papists obey the pope only rather more so goldfarb didnt know how well or even if catholics obeyed the pope he didnt point out his ignorance to mather the sas man was liable to have other aversions including one to jews if he did he didnt let it interfere with the way he did his job goldfarb was willing to settle for that the world being as it was these days it was more than you could count on getting what sort of treatment does he get he asked mather pointing to mzepps after hes done here where does he go how does he spend his time weve brought several lizards into dover to work with you boffins mather replied that in itself surprised goldfarb who was used to thinking of people like fred hipple as boffins not to having the label applied to himself he supposed that to a combat soldier like mather anyone who fought the war with slide rule and soldering iron rather than sten gun and hand grenade counted as an intellectual sort his bemusement made him miss part of the sas mans next sentence billeted them at a cinema house that was worthless otherwise with so little electricity in town they get the same rations our troops do but poor devils goldfarb said with deep feeling isnt that against the geneva convention being purposely cruel to prisoners i mean mather chuckled i shouldnt wonder i was going to say they get more meat and fish than we do which isnt hard i know signs are they need it in their diet so do i basil roundbush said plaintively from across the room oh so do i cant you see me pining away for want of sirloin he let out a theatrical groan captain mather rolled his eyes and tried to carry on the ones who want it we give ginger mzepps hasnt got that habit they talk among themselves some of them have taken up cards and dice and even chess those cant be games anything like what theyre used to goldfarb said they have dice mzepps tell me the others i suppose help fill up the time we dont let them have any of their own amusements cant most of those are electricno youd say electronic what devices of one sort or another and who knows but what they might build some sort of wireless from them mm thats so goldfarb glanced over at mzepps is he happy ill ask him mather did then laughed are you crazy he says mzepps spoke some more mather went on he says hes alive and fed and not being tortured and all thats more than he expected when he was captured he may not be dancing in the daisies but hes got no kick coming fair enough goldfarb said and went back to work sergeant herman muldoon peered out through a glassless secondstory window of the wood house across quincy illinois down toward the mississippi at the base of the bluffs that there he declared is one hell of a river this is a hell of a place too mutt daniels said yeah the windows are blown to smithereens but the house itself dont hardly look no different than the way it did last time i was in this town back about nineteen and seven they made the joint to last all right muldoon agreed you set stone blocks in lead they aint goin anyplace bein shaped like a stop sign dont hurt neither i guess more chance to deflect a shell less chance to stop one square he paused what were you doin here in lieutenant you dont mind my askin playin ballwhat else mutt answered i started out number two catcher for the quincy gems in the iowa state leaguemy first time ever in yankee country and lord was i lonesome number one catcherhis name was ruddock charlie ruddockhe broke his thumb second week in may i hit for a month after that and the grays harbor grays out in washington state bought my contract the northwestern league was class b two notches up from quincy but i was kinda sorry to leave just the same how come muldoon asked you aint the kind of guy to turn down a promotion lieutenant and i bet you never was daniels laughed softly he looked out toward the mississippi too itwas a big river here but not a patch on what it would be when it got down to his home state which shared its name it hadnt had the missouri or the ohio or the tennessee or the red or a zillion other rivers join it not yet only a quarter of him was thinking about the mississippi though the rest looked not so much across quincy as across almost two thirds of a lifetime more to himself than to herman muldoon he said there was this pretty little girl with curly hair just the color o ripe corn her name was addie strasheim an i can see the little dimple in her cheek plain as if it was yesterday she was a sweetie addie was ida stayed here all season likely tell i woulda married her if i coulda talked her pa into it you get the chance you oughta go lookin for her muldoon said town aint been fought over too bad and this dont look like the kind of place where a whole bunch of people pull up stakes and head for the big city you know muldoon for a pretty smart guy you can be a naturalborn damn fool mutt said his sergeant grinned back at him not in the least put out slowly again half to himself daniels went on i was twentyone then she was maybe eighteen dont think i was the first boy who ever kissed her but i reckon there couldnt have been more than a couple ahead of me shes alive now shes got old same as me same as you same as everybody id sooner think of her like she was sweet as a peach pie he sighed hell id sooner think of me like i was a kid who thought a kiss was somethin special not a guy standin in line for a fast fuck worlds a nasty place muldoon said you live in it it wears you down after a while war makes it worse but its pretty bad any old way aint that the sad and sorry truth mutt said here muldoon took his canteen off his belt and held it out to mutt good for what ails you yeah nobody had ever offered mutt water with a promise like that he unscrewed the lid raised the canteen to his lips and took a swig what came out was clear as water but kicked like a mule hed had raw corn likker a time or three but this stuff made some of the other moonshine hed poured down feel like jack daniels by comparison he swallowed coughed a couple of times and handed the canteen back to muldoon good thing i aint got me no cigarettes i light a match and breathe in i figure id explode wouldnt surprise me one damn bit the sergeant said with a chuckle he looked at his watch we better grab some sack time while we can we start earnin our pay again at midnight daniels sighed yeah i know an if this goes just right we push the lizards back a quarter of a mile down the mississippi at that rate we can have the whole damn river open about three weeks before judgment day once he got the complaints out of his system he rolled himself up in a blanket and fell asleep in a minute and a half tops as he was dozing off he figured captain szymanski would have to kick him awake because he was down for the count but he woke up in good time without the help of the company commanders boot mosquitoes made sure of that they came through the glassless windows of the wood house buzzing like a flight of fighter planes and they didnt chew him up a whole lot less than getting strafed would have he slapped at his hands and his face he wasnt showing any other bare skin but that was plenty for the mosquitoes come morning hed look like raw meat then he remembered the mission come morning he was liable tobe raw meat muldoon was awake too they went downstairs together a couple of oldtimers still hanging on in a young mans world a young mans game back when he was a kid fighting to hook onto a bigleague job even for a little while hed resentedhed almost hatedold geezers who hung on and hung on and wouldnt quit and give the new guys a chance now he was a geezer himself when quitting meant going out feet first you were less inclined to do it than when all you lost was your job captain szymanski was already down there in the big hall telling the dogfaces what they were going to do and how theyd do it they were supposed to know but you didnt get anywhere taking brains for granted szymanski finished listen to your lieutenant and your sergeant theyll get you through that made mutt feel pretty good more mosquitoes buzzed outside crickets chirped a few spring peepers peeped though most of them had already had their season the night was warm and muggy the platoon tramped south toward the lizards forward positions boots clunked on pavement then struck dirt and grass more quietly a couple of scouts halted the advancing americans just north of marblehead the hamlet next down the river from quincy dig in mutt whispered through the sticky darkness entrenching tools were already biting into dirt daniels missed the elaborate trench networks of the first world war but fighting nowadays moved too fast to make those practical in most places even a foxhole quickly scraped out of the dirt was mighty nice to have sometimes though he tugged back the cuff of his sleeve to look at his watch a quarter to twelve the glowing hands said he held it up to his ear yes it was ticking he would have guessed it a couple of hours later than that and something gone wrong with the attack time flies when youre havin fun he muttered no sooner had he lowered his arm than artillery opened up off to the east of quincy shells started slamming into marblehead some landing no more than a couple of hundred yards south of where he crouched nothing had gone wrong after all hed just been too keyed up to keep track of time lets go he shouted when his watch told him it was time the barrage shifted at the same moment plastering the southern half of marblehead instead of the northern part lizard artillery was busy too but mostly with counterbattery fire mutt was glad the lizards were shelling the american guns not him over here a scout yelled weve got paths cut through their wire the lizards used stuff that was like nothing so much as a long skinny doubleedged razor blade as far as he was concerned it was even nastier than barbed wire the plan had said there would be paths but what the plan said didnt always have a lot to do with reality lizards in marblehead opened up on the americans as they were coming through the wire no matter how many traps you set you wouldnt get all the rats no matter how you shelled a place you wouldnt clear out all the fighters mutt had been on the receiving end of barrages a lot worse than this one hed expected opposition and here it was he blazed away with his tommy gun then threw himself flat behind the overturned hulk of an old model a mike wheeler the platoon bar man hosed down the town with his browning automatic rifle daniels wished for dracula szabo the bar man in his old platoon dracula would have got right up there nosetosnout with the lizards before he let em have it his platoons attack developed the lizard position the companys other platoon moved on the town from the east a couple of minutes later they knew where the enemy was holed up and winkled the aliens out house by house some lizards surrendered some fled some died one of their medics and a couple of human corpsmen worked side by side on casualties a little fightmutt thought wearily a few men killedeven fewer lizards by the look of things marblehead hadnt been heavily garrisoned a few of the locals started sticking their heads out of whatever shelters theyd made to protect themselves from pieces of metal flying around with hostile intent not too bad herman muldoon said he pointed west toward the mississippi another stretch of river liberated well clear all the lizards out a lot sooner than three weeks before judgment day like you said yeah daniels agreed mebbe six weeks muldoon laughed just as if mutt had been kidding xiii liu han turned and saw liu mei pickup a bayonet nieh hoting had been careless enough to leave on the floor no liu han shouted put it down she hurried across the room to take the edged weapon away from her little daughter before she got there liu mei had dropped the bayonet the baby stared up at her with wide eyes she started to scold liu mei then stopped her daughter had obeyed her when she yelled in chinese she hadnt had to speak the little scaly devils language or use an emphatic cough to make the baby understand her she scooped up liu mei and squeezed her tight liu mei didnt scream and squawk and try to get away as she had when liu han first got her back from ttomalss little by little her daughter was becoming used to being a human being among other human beings not a counterfeit little devil liu mei pointed to the bayonet this she asked in the little devils tongue complete with interrogative cough this is a bayonet liu han answered in chinese she repeated the key word bayonet liu mei made a noise that might have been intended forbayonet though it also sounded like a noise a scaly devil might have made the baby pointed in the general direction of the bayonet again let out another interrogative cough and said this once more liu han needed a moment to realize that in spite of the cough the question itself had been in chinese this is a bayonet she said again then she hugged liu mei and gave her a big kiss on the forehead liu mei hadnt known what to make of kisses when liu han got her back which struck liu han as desperately sad her daughter was getting the idea now a kiss meant youd done something pleasing the baby laughed in reply liu mei laughed but seldom smiled no one had smiled at her when she was tiny the scaly devils faces didnt work that way that saddened liu han too she wondered if she would ever be able to make it up to liu mei she paused and sniffed then despite the babys protestsliu mei whatever else you could say about her wasnt shy about squawkingput a fresh cloth around her loins after cleaning the night soil from them something goes through you she told her daughter is it enough are you getting enough to eat the baby made squealing noises that might have meant anything or nothing liu mei was old for a wet nurse now and liu hans breasts of course were empty of milk because her child had been stolen from her so young but liu mei did not approve of the rice powder and overcooked noodles and soups and bits of pork and chicken liu han tried to feed her ttomalss must have been feeding you from tins liu han said darkly her mood only got angrier when liu mei looked alert and happy at hearing the familiar name of the little scaly devil liu han had eaten food from tins too when the little devils kept her prisoner aboard the airplane that never came down most of those tins had been stolen from bobby fiores america or other countries that ate similar kinds of foods she had loathed them almost without exception they were preferable to starving to death but not as far as she was concerned greatly preferable but they were what liu mei had known just as the scaly devils were the company she had known the baby thought the food of china which seemed only right and proper to liu han tasted and smelled peculiar and ate it with the same reluctance liu han had felt in eating canned hash and other horrors foreigndevil food could still be found in peking though most of it was under the control of rich followers of the kuomintangs counterrevolutionary clique or those who served as the scaly devils running dogsnot that those two groups were inseparable nieh hoting had offered to get some by hook or by crook so liu mei could have what she was used to liu han had declined when he first made the offer and every time since she suspectedactually she more than suspected she was sureone reason hed made his proposal was to help keep the baby quiet through the night she had a certain amount of sympathy with that and certainly had nothing against a full nights sleep but she was dedicated to the idea of turning liu mei back into a proper chinese child as fast as she could shed had that thought many times since she got her baby back now though she stared down at liu mei in a new way almost as if shed never seen the child before her program was the opposite of the one ttomalss had had in mind hed been as intent on making liu mei into a scaly devil as liu han was on turning her daughter back into an ordinary proper person but both the little devil and liu han herself were treating liu mei as if she were nothing more than a blank banner on which they could draw characters of their own choosing wasnt a baby supposed to be something besides that nieh wouldnt have thought so as far as nieh was concerned babies were small vessels to be filled with revolutionary spirit liu han snorted nieh was probably annoyed that liu mei wasnt yet planning bombings of her own and didnt wear a little red star on the front of her overalls well that was niehs problem not liu hans or the babys over a brazier in a corner of the room liu han had a pot ofkao kan mienerh dry cake powder liu mei liked that better than the other common variety of powdered ricelao mi mienerh or old rice flour she didnt like either one of them very much though liu han went over and took the lid off the pot she stuck in her forefinger and took it out smeared with a warm sticky glob of the dry cake powder when she brought the stuff over to liu mei the baby opened her mouth and sucked the powdered rice off the finger maybe liu mei was getting used to proper sorts of food after all maybe she was just so hungry that anything even vaguely edible tasted good to her right now liu han understood how that might be from her own desperate times aboard the airplane that never came down shed eaten grayishgreen tinned peas that reminded her of nothing so much as boiled dust perhaps in the same spirit of resignation liu mei now took several blobs ofkao kan mienerh from liu hans finger and didnt fuss once isnt that good liu han crooned she thought the dry cake powder had very little flavor of any sort but babies didnt like strongly flavored food so grandmothers said anyhow and if they didnt know who did liu mei looked up at liu han and let out an emphatic cough liu han stared at her daughter was she really saying she liked the dry cake powder today liu han couldnt think of anything else that cough might mean although her daughter had still expressed herself in the fashion of a little scaly devil shed done it to approve of something not only earthly but chinese mama liu mei said and then used another emphatic cough liu han thought she would melt into a little puddle of drycakeflour mush right there on the floor of her room nieh hoting had been right little by little she was winning her daughter back from the scaly devils mordechai anielewicz looked at his companions in the room above the fire station on lutomierska street well now we have it he said what do we do with it we ought to give it back to the nazis solomon gruver rumbled they tried to kill us with it only fair we should return the favor david nussboym would have said we should give it to the lizards bertha fleishman said and not the way solomon meant but as a true gift yes and because he kept saying things like that we said goodbye to him gruver answered we dont need any more of such foolishness just a miracle we managed to get that hideous stuff out of the casing and into our own sealed bottles without killing anybody doing it anielewicz said a miracle and a couple of those antidote kits thewehrmacht men sold us for when their own people started feeling the gas in spite of the masks and the protective clothes they were wearing he shook his head the nazis are much too good at making things like that theyre much too good at giving them to us too bertha fleishman said before their rockets would send over a few kilos of nerve gas at a time with a big bursting charge to spread it around but this we salvaged more than a tonne from that bomb and they were going to have us place it so it hurt us worst the rockets could come down almost anywhere solomon gruvers laugh was anything but pleasant i bet that skorzeny pitched a fit when he found out he couldnt play us for suckers the way he thought he could he probably did mordechai agreed but dont think hes done for good because we fooled him once i never thought themamzer would live up to the nonsense gobbels puts out on the wireless but he does that is a man to be taken seriously no matter what if we dont keep an eye on him all the time hell do something dreadful to us even if we do he may yet thank god for your friend the other german bertha said now anielewicz laugheduncomfortably i dont think hes my friend exactly i dont think im his friend either but i let him live and i let him carry that explosive metal back to germany and so i dont know what it is maybe its just a stiffnecked sense of honor and hes paying back a debt there can be decent germans solomon gruver said reluctantly that almost set mordechai laughing again if he had started the laugh would have carried an edge of hysteria he could imagine some plump monocled nazi functionary using that precise tone of voice to admitthere can be decent jews i still wonder if i should have killed him mordechai said the nazis would have had a much harder time building their bombs without that metal and god knows the world would be a better place without them but the world wouldnt be a better place with the lizards overrunning it and here we are still stuck in the middle between them bertha fleishman said if the lizards win everyone loses if the nazis win we lose well hurt them before we go anielewicz said theyve helped us do it too if they should come back we wont let them treat us the way they did before not now never again what was the last desire of my life before the lizards came has been fulfilled jewish selfdefense is a fact how tenuous a fact it was came to be shown a moment later when a jewish fighter named leon zelkowitz walked into the room where they were talking and said theres an order service district leader down at the entrance who wants to talk with you mordechai anielewicz made a sour face such an honor the order service in the jewish district of lodz still reported to mordechai chaim rumkowski who had been eldest of the jews under the nazis and was still eldest of the jews under the lizards most of the time the order service prudently pretended the jewish fighters did not exist that the lizards puppet police came looking for him nowhe needed to find out what it meant he got up and slung a mauscr over his shoulder the order service officer still wore his naziissue trench coat and kepi he wore his naziissue armband too red and white with a blackmagen david on it the white triangle inside the star of david showed his rank he carried a billy club on his belt against a rifle that was nothing much you wanted me anielewicz was ten or twelve centimeters taller than the district leader and used his height to stare coldly down at the other man i the order service man coughed he was chunky and palefaced with a black mustache that looked as if a moth had landed on his upper lip he tried again im oskar birkenfeld anielewicz i have orders to take you to bunim do you anielewicz had expected a meeting with rumkowski or some of his henchmen to be summoned instead to meet with the chief lizard in lodz something out of the ordinary was going on he wondered if he should have this birkenfeld seized and drop out of sight himself hed made plans to do that at need was the need here temporizing he said does he give me a safeconduct pledge to and from the meeting yes yes the order service man said impatiently anielewicz nodded his face thoughtful the lizards were perhaps better than human beings about keeping those pledges all right ill come birkenfeld turned in what looked like glad relief maybe hed expected mordechai to refuse and also expected to catch it from his own superiors he started away with his shoulders back and a spring in his step for all the world as if he were on a mission of his own rather than a puppet of puppets sad and amused at the same time anielewicz followed him the lizards had moved into the former german administrative offices in the bialut market squareonly too fitting anielewicz thought rumkowski s offices were in the next building over his buggy with its germanmade placard proclaiming him eldest of the jews sat in front of it but mordechai got only a glimpse of the buggy for lizard guards came forward to take charge of him district leader birkenfeld hastily disappeared your rifle a lizard said to anielewicz in hissing polish he handed over the weapon the lizard took it come bunims office reminded mordechai of zolraags back in warsaw it was full of fascinating but often incomprehensible gadgets even the ones whose purpose the jewish fighting leader could grasp worked on incomprehensible principles when the guard brought him into the office for instance a sheet of paper was silently issuing from a squarish box made of bakelite or something very much like it the paper was covered with the squiggles of the lizards written language it had to have been printed inside the box as he watched a blank sheet went inside it came out with printing on it how without any sound save the hum of a small electric motor he was curious enough to ask the guard it is askelkwank machine the lizard answered is no word forskelkwank in this speech anielewicz shrugged incomprehensible the machine would remain bunim turned one eye turret toward him the regional subadministratorthe lizards used titles as impressively vague as any the nazis had inventedspoke fairly fluent german in that language he said you are the jew anielewicz the jew leading jewish fighters i am that jew mordechai said he wondered how angry the lizards still were at him for helping moishe russie escape their clutches if that was why bunim had summoned him maybe he shouldnt have admitted his name but the way hed been summoned argued against it the lizards didnt seem to want to seize him but to talk with him bunims other eye turret twisted in its socket till the lizard looked at him with both eyes a sign of full attention i have a warning to deliver to you and to your fighters a warning superior sir anielewicz asked we know more than you think bunim said we know you tosevites play ambiguousis that the word i want games with us and with the deutsche we know you have interfered with our war efforts here in lodz we know these things i tell you do not trouble yourself to deny them it is of no use mordechai did not deny them he stood silent waiting to see what the lizard would say next bunim let out a hissing sigh then went on you know also that we are stronger than you this i cannot deny anielewicz said with wry amusement yes truth we could crush you at any time but to do this we would have to divert resources and resources are scarce so we have tolerated you as nuisancesis this the word i want but no more soon we move males and machines again through lodz if you are interfering if you are nuisances you will pay this is the warning do you understand it oh yes i understand it anielewicz said do you understand how much trouble you will have all through poland from jews and poles both if you try to suppress us do you want nuisances as you call them all over the country we shall take this risk you are dismissed bunim said one eye turret swiveled to look out the window the other toward the sheets of paper that had emerged from the silent printing machine you come the lizard guard said in his bad polish anielewicz came when they got outside the building from which the lizards administered lodz the guard returned his rifle anielewicz went thoughtfully by the time he got back to the fire station on lutomierska street he was smiling the lizards were not good at reading humans expressions had they been they would not have liked his max kagan spoke in rapidfire english vyacheslav molotov had no idea what he was saying but it sounded hot then igor kurchatov translated the american physicist is upset with the ways we have chosen to extract plutonium from the improved atomic pile he helped us design kurchatovs tone was dry molotov got the idea he enjoyed delivering the americans complaints translating for kagan let him be insubordinate while avoiding responsibility for that insubordination at the moment kagan and kurchatov were both necessaryindeed indispensableto the war effort molotov had a long memory though one day not today he said if there is a quicker way to get the plutonium out of the rods than to use prisoners in that extraction process let him acquaint me with it and we shall use it if not not kurchatov spoke in english so did kagan again volubly kurchatov turned to molotov he says he never would have designed it that way had he known we would be using prisoners to remove the rods so we could reprocess them for plutonium he accuses you of several bloodthirsty practices i shall not bother to translate you enjoy hearing of them thoughkurchatov was not as good as he should have been at concealing what he thought have him answer my question molotov said is there a quicker way after more backandforth between the two physicists kurchatov said he says the united states uses machines and remotecontrol arms for these processes remind him we have no machines or remotecontrol arms kurchatov spoke kagan replied kurchatov translated he says to remind you the prisoners are dying from the radiation in which they work nichevomolotov answered indifferently we have plenty to replace them as needed the project will not run short of that i assure him by the way kagans swarthy face grew darker yet that was not the assurance hed wanted he demands to know why the prisoners are not at least provided with clothing to help protect them from the radiation kurchatov said we have little of such clothing as you know perfectly well igor ivanovich molotov said we have no time to produce it in the quantities we need we have no time for anything save manufacturing this bomb for that the great stalin would throw half the state into the firethough you need not tell kagan as much how long now till we have enough of this plutonium for the bomb three weeks comrade foreign commissar perhaps four kurchatov said thanks to the americans expertise results have improved dramatically a good thing toomolotov thought aloud he said make it three less time if you can and results are what counts here not method if kagan cannot grasp this he is a fool when kurchatov had translated that for kagan the american sprang to attention clicked his heels and stuck out his right arm in a salute hitler would have been proud to get comrade foreign commissar i do not think he is convinced kurchatov said dryly whether he is convinced or not i do not care molotov answered inside though where it didnt show he added an entry to the list he was compiling against kagan maybe when the war was over the sardonic physicist would not find it so easy to go home again but that was for later contemplation for now molotov said what matters is that he continue to cooperate do you see any risk his squeamishness will imperil his usefulness no comrade foreign commissar he is outspokenkurchatov coughed behind his hand kagan was a lot more a lot worse than outspokenbut he is also dedicated he will continue to work with us very well i rely on you to see that he doesyour head will go on the block if he doesnt molotov meant and kurchatov unlike kagan was not so naive as to be able to misunderstand the foreign commissar continued this center holds the future of the ussr in its hands if we can detonate one of these bombs soon and then produce more in short order we shall demonstrate to the alien imperialist aggressors that we can match their weapons and deal them such blows as would in the long run prove deadly to them certainly they can deliver such blows to us kurchatov replied our only hope for preservation is to be able to match them as you say this is the great stalins policy molotov agreed which also meant it was how things were going to be he is certain that once we have shown the lizards our capacity they will become more amenable to negotiations designed to facilitate their withdrawal from therodina the foreign commissar and the soviet physicist looked at each other while max kagan stared at the two of them in frustrated incomprehension molotov saw one thought behind kurchatovs eyes and suspected the physicist saw the same one behind his despite his reputation for wearing a mask of stone it was not the sort of thing even molotov could saythe great stalin had better be right ttomalss hiss carried a curious mixture of annoyance and enjoyment the air in this canton place was decently warm at least during tosev s long summers but so moist that the researcher felt as if he were swimming in it how do you keep fungus from forming in the cracks between your scales he asked his guide a junior psychological researcher named saltta superior sir sometimes you cant saltta answered if its one of our fungi the usual creams and aerosols do well enough in knocking it down but just as we can consume tosevite foods some tosevite fungi can consume us the big uglies are too ignorant to have any fungicides worthy of the name and our medications have not proved completely effective some of the afflicted males had to be transportedin quarantine conditions of courseto hospital ships for further treatment ttomalss tongue flicked out and wiggled in a gesture of disgust a great deal of tosev disgusted him he almost wished he could have been an infantrymale so he could have slaughtered big uglies instead of studying them he didnt like traveling through tosevite cities on foot he felt lost and tiny in the crowd of tosevites who surged through the streets all around him no matter how much the race learned about these noisy obnoxious creatures would they ever be able to civilize them and integrate them into the structure of the empire as theyd succeeded in doing with the rabotevs and hallessi he had his doubts if the race was going to succeed though theyd have to start with newhatched tosevites ones that werent set in their ways to learn the means by which big uglies might be controlled that was what hed been doing with the hatching that had come out of the female liu hans body until ppevel shortsightedly made him return it to her he hoped ppevel would come down with an incurable tosevite fungus infection so much time wasted so much data that would not be gathered now he was going to have to start all over with a new hatching it would be years before he learned anything worth having and for much of the first part of this experiment he would merely be repeating work hed already done he would also be repeating a pattern of sleep deprivation he would just as soon have avoided big ugly hatchlings emerged from the bodies of females in such a wretchedly undeveloped state that they hadnt the slightest idea about the difference between day and night and made a horrendous racket whenever they felt like it why that trait hadnt caused the species to become extinct in short order was beyond him here saltta said as they turned a corner we are coming to one of the main market squares of canton if the streets of the city were noisy the market was cacophony compounded chinese tosevites screamed out the virtues of their wares at hideous volume others potential customers screamed just as loud or maybe louder ridiculing the quality of the merchants stock in trade when they werent screaming and sometimes when they were they entertained themselves by belching spitting picking their teeth picking their snouts and digging fingers into the fleshflapped holes that served them for hearing diaphragms you want one of them yelled in the language of the race almost poking ttomalss in an eye turret with a length of leafy green vegetable no ttomalss said with an angry emphatic cough go away not in the least abashed the vegetable seller let out a series of the yipping barks the big uglies used for laughter along with vegetables the merchants in the market sold all sorts of tosevite life forms for food because refrigeration hereabouts ranged from rudimentary to nonexistent some of the creatures were still alive in jugs or glass jars full of seawater ttomalss stared at gelatinous things with a great many suckercovered legs the creatures stared back out of oddly wiselooking eyes other tosevite life forms had jointed shells and clawed legs ttomalss had eaten those and found them tasty and still others looked a lot like the swimming creatures in homes small seas one fellow had a box containing a great many legless scaly creatures that reminded ttomalss of the animals of his native world far more than did the hairy thinskinned life forms that dominated tosev after the usual loud haggling a big ugly bought one of those creatures the seller seized it with a pair of tongs and lifted it out then used a cleaver to chop off its head while the body was still writhing the merchant slit open the animals belly and scooped out the offal inside then he cut the body into fingerlong lengths dripped fat into a conical iron pan that sat above a charcoalburning brazier and began frying the meat for the customer all the while instead of watching what he was doing he kept his eyes on the two males of the race nervously ttomalss said to saltta he would sooner be doing that to us than to the animal that shares some of our attributes truth saltta said troth no doubt but these big uglies are still wild and ignorant only with the passage of generations will they come to see us as their proper overlords and the emperorhe lowered his eyes as did ttomalssas their sovereign and the solace of their spirits ttomalss wondered if the conquest of tosev could be accomplished even if it was accomplished he wondered if the tosevites could be civilized as the rabotevs and hallessi had been before them it was refreshing to hear a male still convinced of the races power and the rightness of the cause north of the market the streets were narrow and jumbled ttomalss wondered how saltta found his way through them the comfortable warmth was a little less here the big uglies for whom it was less comfortable built the upper stories of their homes and shops so close together that they kept most of tosev s light from reaching the street itself one building had armed males of the race standing guard around it ttomalss was glad to see them walking through these streets never failed to worry him the big uglies were sounpredictable was the kindest word that crossed his mind inside the building a tosevite female held a newly emerged hatching to one of the glands on her upper torso so it could ingest the nutrient fluid she secreted for it the arrangement revolted ttomalss it smacked of parasitism he needed all his scientific detachment to regard it with equanimity saltta said the female is being well compensated to yield up the hatching to us superior sir this should prevent any difficulties springing from the pair bonding that appears to develop between generations of tosevites good ttomalss said now he could get on with his experimental program in peaceand if snivelers like tessrek did not care for it too bad he switched to chinese to speak to the big ugly female nothing bad will happen to your hatching it will be well fed well cared for all its needs will be met do you understand do you agree he was getting ever more fluent he even remembered not to use interrogative coughs i understand the female said softly i agree but as she held out the hatching to ttomalss water dripped from the corners of her small immobile eyes ttomalss recognized that as a sign of insincerity he dismissed it as unimportant compensation was the medicine to heal that wound the hatchling wiggled almost bonelessly in ttomalss grasp and let out an annoying squawk the female turned her head away well done ttomalss said to saltta let us take the hatching back to our own establishment here then i shall remove it to my laboratory and then the research shall begin i may have been thwarted once but i shall not be thwarted twice to make sure he was not thwarted twice four guards accompanied him and saltta back toward the races base in the little island in the pearl river from there a helicopter would take him and the hatching to the shuttlecraft launch site not far awayand from there he would return to his starship saltta retraced in every particular the route by which he had come to the female big uglys residence just before he ttomalss and the guards reached the marketplace with the strange creatures in it they found their way forward blocked by an animaldrawn wagon as wide as the lane down which they were coming go back saltta shouted in chinese to the big ugly driving the wagon cant the big ugly shouted back too narrow to turn around you go back to the corner turn off and let me go by what the tosevite said was obviously true he couldnt turn around one of ttomalss eye turrets swiveled back to see how far he and his companions would have to retrace their steps it wasnt far we shall go back he said resignedly as they turned around gunfire opened up from two of the buildings that faced the street big uglies started screaming caught by surprise the guards crumpled in pools of blood one of them squeezed off an answering burst but then more bullets found him and he lay still several tosevites in ragged cloth wrappings burst out of the buildings they still carried the light automatic weapons with which theyd felled the guards some pointed those weapons at ttomalss others at saltta you come with us right now or you die one of them screamed we come ttomalss said not giving saltta any chance to disagree with him as soon as he got close enough to the big uglies one of them tore the tosevite hatching from his arms another shoved him into one of the buildings from which the raiders had emerged in the back it opened onto another of cantons narrow streets he was hustled along through so many of them so fast he soon lost any notion of where he was before long the big uglies split into two groups one with him the other with saltta they separated ttomalss was alone among the tosevites what will you do with me he asked fear making the words have to fight to come forth one of his captors twisted his mouth in the way tosevites did when they were amused because he was a student of the big uglies ttomalss recognized the smile as an unpleasant onenot that his current situation made pleasant smiles likely weve liberated the baby you kidnapped and now were going to give you to liu han the fellow answered ttomalss had only thought he was afraid before ignacy pointed to the barrel of the fieselerstorchs machine gun this is of no use to you he said of course its not ludmila gorbunova snapped irritated at the indirect way the polish partisan leader had of approaching things if im flying the aircraft by myself i cant fire it not unless my arms start stretching like an octopus its for the observer not the pilot not what i meant the pianoteacherturnedguerrillachief replied even if you carried an observer you could not fire it we removed the ammunition from it some time ago were very low on mm rounds which is a pity because we have a great many german weapons even if you had ammunition for it it wouldnt do you much good ludmila told him machinegun bullets wont bring down a lizard helicopter unless youre very lucky and the gun is wrongly placed for ground attack again not what i meant ignacy said we need more of this ammunition we have a little through the stores the lizards dole out to their puppets but only a little is redistributed sowe have made contact with thewehrmacht to the west if tomorrow night you can fly this plane to their lines they will put some hundreds of kilograms of cartridges into it when you return here you will be a great help in our continued resistance to the lizards what ludmila wanted to do with thestorch was hop into it and fly east till she came to sovietheld territory if she somehow got it back to pskov georg schultz could surely keep it running nazi though he was he knew machinery the way a jockey knew horses schultzs technical talents aside ludmila wanted little to do with thewehrmacht or with heading west comrades in aims though the germans were against the lizards her mind still shoutedenemies barbarians whenever she had to deal with them all of which unfortunately had nothing to do with military necessity i take it this means you have petrol for the engine she asked grasping at straws when ignacy nodded she sighed and said very well i will pick up your ammunition for you the germans will have some sort of landing strip prepared the fieseler wouldnt need much but putting down in the middle of nowhere at night wasnt something to anticipate cheerfully the dim light of the lantern ignacy held showed his nod you are to fly along a course of for about fifty kilometers a landing field will be shown by four red lamps you know what it means this flying a course of i know what it means yes ludmila assured him remember if you want your ammunition back youll also have to mark off a landing strip for my returnand youll have to hope the lizards dont knock me down while im in the air over their territory but thats not something you can do anything aboutits my worry ignacy nodded again we will mark the field with four white lamps i presume you will be flying back the same night unless something goes wrong yes ludmila answered that was a hairraising business but easier on the life expectancy than going airborne in broad daylight and letting any lizard who spotted you take his potshots good enough igancy said thewehrmacht will expect you to arrive about tomorrow night then she glared at him hed made all the arrangements with the nazis then come to her better he should have had her permission before he went off and talked with the germans well too late to worry about that now she also realized she was getting very used to operating on her own as opposed to being merely a part of a larger military machine she never would have had such resentments about obeying a superior in the red air force she would have done as she was told and never thought twice about it maybe it was that the polish partisans didnt strike her as being military enough to deserve her unquestioned obedience maybe it was that she felt she didnt really belong hereif her u hadnt cracked up if the idiot guerrillas near lublin hadnt forgotten an extremely basic rule about landing strips make sure there arent any trees in the middle of whats going to be my runway she warned ignacy he blinked then nodded for a third time she spent most of the next day making as sure as she could that thestorch was mechanically sound she was uneasily aware shed never be a mechanic of schultz class and also uneasily aware of how unfamiliar the aircraft was she tried to make up for ignorance and unfamiliarity with thoroughness and repetition before long shed learn how well shed done after dark the partisans took the netting away from one side of the enclosure concealing the light german plane they pushed thestorch out into the open ludmila knew she didnt have much room in which to take off the fieseler wasnt supposed to need much she hoped all the things shed heard about it were true she climbed up into the cockpit when her finger stabbed the starter button the argus engine came to life at once the prop spun blurred and seemed to disappear the guerrillas scattered ludmila released the brake gave thestorch full throttle and bounced toward two men holding candles who showed her where the trees started they grew closer alarmingly fast but when she pulled back on the stick thestorch hopped into the air as readily as one of its feathered namesakes her first reaction was relief at flying again at last then she realized that compared to what she was used to she had a hot plane on her hands now that argus engine generated more than twice the horsepower of a us shvetsov radial and thestorch didnt weigh anywhere near twice as much as akukuruznik she felt like a fighter pilot dont be stupid she muttered to herself good advice for a pilot under any circumstances in the fieselers enclosed cabin she could hear herself talk which had been all but impossible while she was flyingkukuruzniks she wasnt used to being airborne without having the slipstream blast her in the face either she stayed as low to the ground as she dared humanbuilt aircraft that got up much above a hundred meters had a way of reaching zero altitude much more rapidly than their pilots had intended flying behind the lines that worked well flying over them as she discovered now was another matter several lizards opened up on thestorch with automatic weapons the noise bullets made hitting aluminum was different from that which came when they penetrated fabric but when thestorch didnt tumble out of the sky she took fresh hope that its designers had known what they were doing then she passed the lizards line and over into germanheld poland a couple of nazis took potshots at her too she felt like hauling out her pistol and shooting back instead she peered through the night for a square of four red lanterns sweat that had nothing to do with a warm spring night sprang out on her face she was so low she might easily miss them if she couldnt spot them shed have to set down anywhere and then no guessing how long the germans would take to move the ammunition from their storage point to her aircraft or whether the lizards would notice thestorch and smash it on the ground before the ammo got to it now that she was flying over humanheld terrain she let herself gain a few more meters worth of altitude there off to the left not far her navigation hadnt been so bad after all she swung thestorch through a gentle bank and buzzed toward the marked strip as she got close to it she realized it seemed about the size of a postage stamp would she really be able to set thestorch down in such a tiny space shed have to try that was certain she eased off on the throttle and lowered the aircrafts huge flaps the extra resistance they gave her cut into her airspeed astonishingly fast maybe she could get thestorch down in one piece after all she leaned over and looked down through the cockpit glasshouse almost feeling for the ground the touchdown was amazingly gentle thestorchs landing gear had heavy springs to take up the shock of a hard descent when the descent wasnt hard you hardly knew you were on the ground ludmila killed the engine and tromped hard on the brake almost before she knew it she was stoppedand she still had fifteen or twenty meters of landing room to spare good that was good one of the men holding a lantern called to her as he approached the fieseler the light he carried showed his toothy grin where did a pack of ragtag partisans come up with such a sharp pilot at the same time as he was speaking another manan officer by his tonecalled to more men hidden in the darkness come on you lugs get those crates over here you think theyre going to move by themselves he sounded urgent and amused at the same time a good combination for getting the best from the soldiers under his command you germans always think youre the only ones who know anything about anything ludmila told thewehrmacht man with the lantern his mouth fell open shed heard that meant something among the lizards but for the life of her couldnt remember what she thought it was pretty funny though the german soldier turned around and exclaimed hey colonel would you believe it theyve got a girl flying this plane ive run into a woman pilot before the officer answered she was a very fine one as a matter of fact ludmila sat in the unfamiliar seat of thestorch her whole body seemed to have been dipped in crushed iceor was it fire she couldnt tell she stared at the instrument panelall the gauges hard against the zero pegs nowwithout seeing it she didnt realize shed dropped back into russian till the words were out of her mouth heinrich is that you mein gottthe officer said quietly out there in the cricketchirping darkness where she could not see him she thought that was his voice but she hadnt seen him for a year and a half and never for long at any one stretch after a moment he tried again ludmila what the hell is going on asked the soldier with the lantern ludmila got out of the fieselerstorch she needed to do that anyhow to make it easier for the germans to get the chests of ammunition into the aircraft but even as her feet thumped down onto the ground she felt she was flying far higher than any plane could safely go jager came up to her youre still alive he said almost severely the landing lamp didnt give enough light she couldnt see how he looked not really but now that she was looking at him memory filled in the details the light couldnt the way his eyes would have little lines crinkling at the corners the way one end of his mouth would quirk up when he was amused or just thinking hard the gray hair at his temples she took a step toward him at the same time as he was taking a step toward her that left them close enough to step into each others arms what thehell is going on the soldier with the lantern repeated ludmila ignored him jager his mouth insistent on hers gave no sign he even heard from out of the night a big deep german voice boomed well this is sweet isnt it ludmila ignored that interruption too jager didnt he ended the kiss sooner than he should have and turned toward the man who was coming upin the night no more than a large looming shadow in tones of military formality he saidherr standartenfuhrer i introduce to you lieutenant senior lieutenant ludmila broke in senior lieutenant ludmila gorbunova of the red air force ludmilathe formality broke down therethis isstandartenfuhrer otto skorzeny of thewaffen ss my accomplice now skorzeny interrupted you two are old friends i see he laughed uproariously at his own understatement jager you sneaky devil you keep all sorts of interesting things under your hat dont you its an irregular sort of war jager answered a little stiffly being old friends with a soviet flier was likely to be as destructive to awehrmacht mans careerand maybe to more than thatas having that sort of relationship with a german had been dangerous for ludmila but he didnt try to deny anything saying youve worked with the russians too skorzeny not sointimately the ss man laughed again but screw that too he chucked jager under the chin as if he were an indulgent uncle dont do anything i wouldnt enjoy whistling a tune that sounded as if it was probably salacious he strolled back into the night youwork with him ludmila asked its been known to happen jager admitted his voice dry how she said the question ludmila realized was far too broad but jager understood what she meant by it carefully he answered which made better sense than any reply shed expected mordechai anielewicz had long since resigned himself to wearing bits and pieces of german uniforms there were endless stocks of them in poland and they were tough and reasonably practical even if not so well suited to winter cold as the ones the russians made dressing head to foot inwehrmacht gear was something else again he discovered taking on the complete aspect of the nazi soldiers who had so brutalized poland gave him a thrill of superstitious dread no matter how secular he reckoned himself but it had to be done bunim had threatened reprisals against the jews if they tried to block lizard movements through lodz therefore the attack would have to come outside of town and would have to seem to come from german hands solomon gruver also decked out in german uniform nudged him he had greenery stuck onto his helmet with elastic bands and was almost invisible in the woods off to the side of the road they should hit the first mines soon he said in a low voice distorted by his gas mask mordechai nodded the mines were german too with casings of wood and glass to make them harder to detect a crew charged with repairing the highway had done just that among other things over this stretch of a couple of kilometers the lizards would have a very bumpy ride indeed as usual gruver looked gloomy this is going to cost us a lot of men no matter what he said and anielewicz nodded again doing favors for the germans was nothing he loved especially after what the germans had tried to do to the jews of lodz but this favor while it might help germans like heinrich jager wouldnt do skorzeny or the ss any good so anielewicz hoped he peered through the eye lenses of his own gas mask toward the roadway the air he breathed tasted flat and dead the mask made him look like some pigsnouted creature as alien as any lizard it was german toothe germans knew all about gas warfare and had been teaching it to the jews even before the lizards came whumpthe harsh explosion announced a mine going off sure enough a lizard lorry lay on its side in the roadway burning from the undergrowth to either side of the road machine guns opened up on it and on the vehicles behind it farther off a german mortar started lobbing bombs at the lizard convoy a couple of mechanized infantry combat vehicles charged off the road to deal with the raiders to anielewiczs intense glee they both hit mines almost at once one of them began to burn he fired at the lizards who emerged from it the other slewed sideways and stopped a track blown off the weapon with which anielewicz hoped to do the most damage though involved no high explosives whatever only catapults made with lengths of inner tube and waxsealed bottles full of an oily liquid as he and gruver had learned you could fling a bottle three hundred meters with old rubber like that and three hundred meters was plenty far enough from all sides bottles of captured nazi nerve gas rained down on the stalled head of the lizard column still more landed farther down its length once the head had stalled they didnt all break but a lot of them did lizards started dropping they werent wearing masks the stuff could nail you if it got on your skin too since they wore only body paint the lizards were also at a disadvantage therenot that ordinary clothing was any sure protection mordechai had heard that the germans made special rubberimpregnated uniforms for their troops who dealt with gas all the time he didnt know for certain whether it was true it sounded typically german in its thoroughness but wouldnt you stew like a chicken in a pot if you had to fight cooped up in a rubber uniform for more than an hour or two at a stretch what do we do now gruver asked pausing to shove another clip into hisgewehr as soon as weve thrown all the gas we brought we get out anielewicz answered the longer we hang around the better the chance the lizards will capture some of us and we dont want that gruver nodded if we can we have to bring our dead away too he said i dont know how smart the lizards are about these things but if theyre smart enough they can figure out were not really nazis there is that mordechai agreed the last time hed been reminded of the obvious difference zofia klopotowski had thought it was funny consequences springing from it would be a lot more serious here the catapultpropelled bottles of nerve gas had a couple of advantages over more conventional artillery neither muzzle flash nor noise gave away the positions of the launchers their crews kept flinging bottles till they were all gone after that the jewish fighters pulled away from the road their machine guns covering the retreat they had several rendezvous points in the area farms owned by poles they could trustpoles we hope we can trust mordechai thought as he neared one of them there they got back into more ordinary clothes and stashed weapons of greater firepower than rifles these days in poland you might as well have been naked as go out in public without a mauser on your shoulder mordechai slipped back into lodz from the west well away from the direction of the fighting it wasnt long past noon when he strolled into the fire station on lutomierska street bertha fleishman greeted him outside the building they say there was a nazi raid this morning just a couple of kilometers outside of town do they he answered gravely i hadnt heard though there was a lot of gunfire earlier in the day but then thats so about one day in three it must have been that whatshisnameskorzeny thats it bertha said who else would be crazy enough to stick his nose in the wasps nest while they were standing there talking the order police district leader whod taken anielewicz to bunim approached the fire station oskar birkenfeld still carried only a truncheon and so waited respectfully for the rifletoting anielewicz to notice him when mordechai did the man from the order police said bunim requires your presence again immediately does he anielewicz said whatever for hell tell you that birkenfeld answered sounding toughor as tough as he could when so badly outgunned anielewicz looked down his nose at him without saying anything the order service man wilted asking weakly will you come oh yes ill come though bunim and his puppets could stand to learn better manners mordechai said birkenfeld flushed angrily mordechai patted bertha fleishman on the shoulder ill see you later at his bialut market square offices burnm stared balefully at anielewicz what do you know of the deutsche who severely damaged our advancing column this morning not much he answered id just heard it was a nazi attack when your pet policeman came to fetch me you can ask him about it after i go he heard me get the news i think i shall ascertain this bunim said so you deny any role in the attack on the column am i a nazi anielewicz said bertha fleishman the woman i was talking with when birkenfeld found me thinks that skorzeny fellow might have had something to do with it i dont know that for a fact but ive heard talk hes here in poland somewhere maybe to the north of lodz if he could do the ss man a bad turn he would skorzeny bunim flipped out his tongue but did not waggle it back and forth a sign of interest among the lizards exterminating that one would be a whole clutch of eggs worth of ordinary tosevites like you truth superior sir mordechai said if bunim wanted to think he was bumbling and harmless that was fine with him the lizard said i shall investigate whether these rumors you report have any basis in fact if they do i shall bend every effort to destroying the troublesome male considerable status would accrue to me on success mordechai wondered whether that last was intended for him or if bunim was talking to himself i wish you good luck he said and despite having led the raid on that column moving north against the germans he meant what he told the lizard now were cooking with gas omar bradley said enthusiastically as he sat down in leslie groves office in the science building at the university of denver you said the next bomb wouldnt be long in coming and you meant it if i told lies about things like that youor somebodywould throw my fanny out of here and bring in a man who delivered on his promises groves answered he cocked his head to one side off in the distance artillery still rumbled denver did not look like falling though not now and you sir youve done a hell of a job defending this place ive had good help bradley said they both nodded pleased with each other bradley went on doesnt look like well have to use that second bomb anywhere near here we can try moving it someplace else where they need it worse yes sir one way or another well manage that groves said the rail lines going in and out of denver had taken a hell of a licking but there were ways break the thing down into pieces and it could go out on horsebackprovided all the riders got through to the place where you needed all the pieces i figure we will bradley agreed he started to reach into his breast pocket but arrested the motion halfway through all this time and i still cant get used to going without a smoke he let out a long weary exhalation that should be the least of my worriesodds are ill live longer because of it certainly seem longer anyhow groves said bradley chuckled but sobered in a hurry groves didnt blame him he too had bigger worries than tobacco he voiced the biggest one sir how long can we and the lizards keep going tit for tat after a while there wont be a lot of places left if we keep on trading them the way we have been i know bradley said his long face somber dammit general im just a soldier same as you i dont make policy i just carry it out best way i know how making it is president hulls job ill tell you what i told him though if you want to hear it hell yes i want to hear it groves answered if i understand what im supposed to be doing figuring out how to do it gets easier not everybody thinks that way bradley said a lot of people want to concentrate on their tree and forget about the forest but for whatever you think its worth my view is that the only fit use for the bombs we have is to make the lizards sit down at the table and talk seriously about ending this war any peace that lets us preserve our bare independence is worth making as far as im concerned our bare independence groves tasted the words not even all our territory thats a hard peace to ask for sir right now i think its the best we can hope to get considering the lizards original war aims even getting that much wont be easy bradley said thats why im so pleased with your efforts here without your bombs wed get licked even with them were getting licked groves said but we arent getting licked fast and we are making the lizards pay like the dickens for everything they get thats the idea bradley agreed they came here with resources they couldnt readily renew how many of them have they expended how many do they have left how many more can they afford to lose those are the questions sir groves saidthe questions oh no theres one other thats even more important bradley said groves raised an interrogative eyebrow bradley explained whetherwe have anything left by the timethey start scraping the bottom of the barrel groves grunted yes sir he said nuclear fire blossomed above a tosevite city seen from a reconnaissance satellite the view was beautiful from up at the topmost edges of the atmosphere you didnt get the details of what a bomb did to a city riding in a specially protected vehicle atvar had been through the ruins of el iskandariya hed seen firsthand what the big uglies bomb had done there it wasnt beautiful not even slightly kirel had not made that tour though of course he had viewed videos from that strike and others by both the race and the tosevites he said and so we retaliate with this copenhagen place where does it end exalted fleetlord shiplord i do not know where it ends or even if it ends atvar answered the psychologists recently brought me a translated volume of tosevite legends in the hope they would help mewould help the race as a wholebetter understand the foe the one that sticks in my mind tells of a tosevite male fighting an imaginary monster with many heads every time he cut one off two more grew to take its place that is the predicament in which we presently find ourselves i see what you are saying exalted fleetlord kirel said hitler the deutsch notemperor has been screaming over every radio frequency he can command about the vengeance he will wreak on us for what he calls the wanton destruction of a nordic city our semanticists are still analyzing the precise meaning of the termnordic i dont care what it means atvar snapped petulantly all i care about is carrying the conquest to a successful conclusion and i am no longer certain we shall be able to accomplish that kirel stared at him with both eyes he understood why even when things seemed grimmest he had refused to waver from faith in the ultimate success of the races mission he had he admitted to himself repeatedly been more optimistic than the situation warranted do you aim to abandon the effort then exalted fleetlord kirel asked his voice soft and cautious atvar understood that caution too if kirel didnt like the answer he got he was liable to foment an uprising against atvar as straha had done after the first tosevite nuclear explosion if kirel led such an uprising it was liable to succeed and so atvar also answered cautiously abandon it by no means but i begin to believe we may not be able to annex the entire land surface of this world without suffering unacceptable losses both to our own forces and to that surface we must think in terms of what the colonization fleet will find when it arrives here and conduct ourselves accordingly this may involve substantive discussions with the tosevite empires and notempires now resisting us kirel said atvar could not read the shiplords opinion of that he was not sure of his own opinion about it either even contemplating it was entering uncharted territory the plans with which the race had left home anticipated the complete conquest of tosev in a matter of days not four yearstwo of this planets slow turns around its starof grueling warfare with the result still very much in the balance maybe now the race would have to strike a new balance even if it wasnt one in the orders the emperor had conferred upon atvar before he went into cold sleep shiplord in the end it may come to that he said i still hope it does notour successes in florida among other places give me reason to continue to hopebut in the end it may and what have you to say to that kirel let out a soft wondering hiss only that tosev has changed us in ways we could never have predicted and that i do not care for change of any sort let alone change inflicted upon us under such stressful circumstances i do not care for change either atvar answered what sensible male would our civilization has endured for as long as it has precisely because we minimize the corrosive effect of wanton change but in your words i hear the very essence of the difference between us and the big uglies when we meet change we feel it is inflicted on us the tosevites reach out and seize it with both hands as if it were a sexual partner for which they have developed the monomaniacal passion they termlove as well as he could he reproduced the word from the tosevite language called english because it was widely spoken and even more widely broadcast the race had become more familiar with it than with most of the other tongues the big uglies used would pssafalu the conqueror have negotiated with the rabotevs kirel asked would hisstan the conqueror have negotiated with the hallessi what would their emperors have said if word reached them that our earlier conquests had not achieved the goals set for them what he was really asking was what the emperor would say when he learned the conquest of tosev might not be a complete conquest atvar said here speedoflight works with us whatever he says we shall not know about it until near the time when the colonization fleet arrives or perhaps even a few years after that truth kirel said until then we are autonomous autonomousin the language of the race carried overtones ofalone orisolated orcut off from civilization truth atvar said sadly well shiplord we shall have to make the best of it for ourselves and for the race as a whole of which we are and remain a part as you say exalted fleetlord kirel answered with so much going on in such strange surroundings at so frenetic a pace keeping that basic fact in mind is sometimes difficult is frequently difficult you mean atvar said even without the battles there are so many irritations here that psychological researcher the big uglies in china have kidnapped they state it is in reprisal for his studies of a newly hatched tosevite how can we do research on the big uglies if our males go in fear of having vengeance taken on them for every test they make it is a problem exalted fleetlord and i fear it will only grow worse kirel said since we received word of this kidnapping two males have already abandoned ongoing research projects on the surface of tosev one has taken his subjects up to an orbiting starship which is likely to skew his results the other has also gone aboard a starship but has terminated his project he states he is seeking a new challenge kirel waggled his eye turrets a gesture of irony i had not heard that atvar said angrily he should be strongly encouraged to return to his work if necessary by kicking him out the air lock of that ship kirels mouth fell open in a laugh it shall be done exalted fleetlord exalted fleetlord the image of pshing atvars adjutant suddenly filled one of the communicator screens in the fleetlords chamber it was the screen reserved for emergency reports atvar and kirel looked at each other as theyd just said the conquest of tosev was nothing but a series of emergencies atvar activated his own communications gear go ahead adjutant what has happened now he was amazed at how calmly he brought out the question when life was a series of emergencies each individual crisis seemed less enormous than it would have otherwise pshing said exalted fleetlord i regret the necessity of reporting a tosevite nuclear explosion by a riverside city bearing the native name saratov after a moment in which he swiveled one eye turret perhaps to check a map he added this strata is located within the notempire of the sssr damage is said to be considerable atvar and kirel looked at each other again this time in consternation they and their analysts had been confident the sssr had achieved its one nuclear detonation with radioactives stolen from the race and that its technology was too backwards to let it develop its own bombs as had deutschland and the united states once again the analysts had not known everything there was to know heavily atvar said i acknowledge receipt of the news adjutant i shall begin the selection process for a soviet site to be destroyed in retaliation and past thathe looked toward kirel for a third time mindful of the discussion theyd been havingwell past that right now i dont know what we shall do xiv the typewriter spat out machinegun bursts of letters clackclackclack clackclackclack clacketyclack the lineend bell dinged barbara yeager flicked the return lever the carriage moved with an oiled whir to let her type another line she stared in dissatisfaction at the one shed just finished that ribbon is getting too light to read any more she said i wish theyd scavenge some fresh ones not easy to come by anything these days sam yeager answered i hear tell one of our foraging parties got shot at the other day i heard something about that but not much barbara said was it the lizards sam shook his head nothing to do with the lizards it was foragers out from little rock after the same kinds of stuff our boys were theres less and less stuff left to find and we arent making much these days that doesnt go straight out the barrel of a gun i think itll get worse before it gets better too i know barbara said the way we get excited over little things now like that tobacco you bought she shook her head and i wonder how many people have starved because crops either didnt get planted or didnt get raised or couldnt get from the farm to a town lots sam said remember that little town in minnesota we went through on the way to denver they were already starting to slaughter their livestock because they couldnt bring in all the feed they had to haveand that was a year and a half ago and denvers going to go hungry now the lizards have tromped on the farms that were feeding it and wrecked the railroads too one more thing to put on their bill if we ever get around to giving it to them were lucky to be where we are barbara agreed it gets down to that were lucky to be anywhere yeah sam tapped a front tooth with a fingernail ive been lucky i havent broken a plate too he reached out and rapped on the wooden desk behind which barbara sat way things are now a dentist would have a heck of a time fixing my dentures if anything did break he shrugged one more thing to worry about weve got plenty barbara pointed to the sheet of paper in the typewriter id better get back to this report honey not that anybodyll be able to read it when im through she hesitated then went on is dr goddard all right sam when he gave me these notes to type up his voice was as faint and gray as the letters im getting from this ribbon sam wouldnt have put it that way but sam hadnt gone in for literature in college either slowly he answered ive noticed it for a while now myself hon i think its getting worse too i know he saw some of the docs here but i dont know what they told him i couldnt hardly ask and he didnt say anything he corrected himself i take that back he did say one thing weve gone far enough now that no one man matters much any more i dont like the sound of that barbara said now that i think about it i dont either sam said sort of sounds like a man writing his own whatdoyoucallitobituarydoesnt it barbara nodded sam went on thing is hes right pretty much everything weve done with rockets so far has come out of his headeither that or weve stolen it from the lizards or borrowed it from the nazis but we can go on without him now if we have to even if we wont go as fast or as straight barbara nodded again she patted the handwritten originals she was typing do you know what hes doing here hes trying to scale upthats the term he usesthe design for the rockets we have so theyll be big enough and powerful enough to carry an atomic bomb instead of tnt or whatever goes into them now yeah hes talked about that with me sam said the nazis have the same kind of project going too he thinks and theyre liable to be ahead of us i dont think they have a lizard who knows as much as vesstil but their people were making rockets a lot bigger than dr goddards before the lizards came were doing what we can thats all cant do more than that no barbara typed a few more sentences before she came to the end of a page she took it out and ran a fresh sheet into the typewriter instead of going back to the report she looked up at sam from under halflowered eyelids do you remember this is what i was doing back in chicago the first time we met you brought ullhass and ristin in to talk with dr burkett a lot of things have changed since then just a few sam allowed shed been married to jens larssen then though already shed feared he was dead otherwise she and sam never would have got together never would have had jonathan never would have done a whole lot of things he didnt know about literature or fancy talk he couldnt put into graceful words what he thought about all that what he did say was it was so long ago that when you asked me for a cigarette i had one to give you she smiled thats right not even two years but it seems like the middle ages doesnt it she wrinkled her nose at him im the one who feels middleaged these days but thats just on account of jonathan me im glad hes old enough now that you feel easy about letting the mammies take care of him during the day sam said it frees you up to do things like this makes you feel useful again too i know that was on your mind yes it was barbara said with a nod that wasnt altogether comfortable she lowered her voice i wish you wouldnt call the colored women that what mammies sam scratched his head its what they are i know that but it sounds so barbara groped for the word she wanted and being barbara found it so antebellum as if we were down on the plantation with the negroes singing spirituals and doing all the work and the kind masters sitting around drinking mint juleps as if they hadnt the slightest idea their whole social system was sick and wrongand so much of what was wrong then is still wrong now why else would the lizards have given guns to colored troops and expected them to fight against the united states they sure were wrong about that sam said yes some of the negroes mutinied barbara agreed but id bet not all of them did and the lizards wouldnt have tried it in the first place if they hadnt thought it would work the way they treat colored people down here do you remember some of the newsreels from before we got into the war the ones that showed happy ukrainian peasants greeting the nazis with flowers because they were liberating them from the communists uhhuh sam said they found out what that was worth pretty darn quick too didnt they thats not the point barbara insisted the point is that the negroes here could have greeted the lizards the same way a good many of them did sam held up a hand before she could rhetorically rend him i know what youre getting at hon the point is that so many of em didnt things down here would have been mighty tough if they had no two ways about it now you understand barbara said nodding she always sounded pleased when she said things like that pleased and a little surprised he might not have a fancy education but it was nice that he wasnt dumb he didnt think she knew she was using that tone of voice and he wasnt about to call her on it he was just glad he could come close to keeping up with her he said other side of the coin is whatever the reasons are these colored womeni wont call em mammies if you dont want me tothey cant do the job youre doing right now since theyare on our side shouldnt we give em jobs theycan do so the rest of us can get on with doing the things they cant that isnt just barbara said but she paused thoughtfully her fingernails clicked on the home keys of the typewriter enough to make the type bars move a little but not enough to make them hit the paper at last she said it may not be just but i suppose its practical then she did start typing again sam felt as if hed just laced a gamewinning double in the ninth he didnt often make barbara back up a step in any argument he set a fond hand on her shoulder she smiled up at him for a moment the clatter of the typewriter didnt stop liu han cradled the submachine gun in her arms as if it were liu mei she knew what she had to do with it if ttomalss got out of line point it in his direction and squeeze the trigger enough bullets would hit him to keep him from getting out of line again from what nieh hoting had told her the gun was of german manufacture the fascists sold it to the kuomintang from whom we liberated it hed said in the same way we shall liberate the whole world not only from the fascists and reactionaries but also from the alien aggressor imperialist scaly devils it sounded easy when you put it like that taking revenge on ttomalss had sounded easy too when shed proposed it to the central committee and indeed kidnapping him down in canton had proved easyas shed predicted he had returned to china to steal some other poor womans baby getting him up here to peking without letting the rest of the scaly devils rescue him hadnt been so easy but the peoples liberation army had managed it and now here he was confined in a hovel on ahutung not far from the roominghouse where liu hanand her daughterlived he was in essence hers to do with as she would how shed dreamed of that while she was in the hands of the little scaly devils now the dream was real she unlocked the door at the front of the hovel several of the people begging or selling in the alleyway were fellow travelers though even she was not sure which ones they would help keep ttomalss from escaping or anyone from rescuing him she closed the front door after her inside where no one could see it from the street was another stouter door she unlocked that one too and advanced into the dim room beyond it ttomalss whirled superior female he hissed in his own language then returned to chinese have you decided what my fate is to be maybe i should keep you here along time liu han said musingly and see how much people can learn from you little scaly devils that would be a good project dont you think ttomalss thatwould be a good project for you you would learn much ttomalss agreed for a moment liu han thought he had missed her irony then he went on but i do not think you will do it i think instead you will torment me to learn how much thirst you can stand how much hunger you can stand how much pain you can standthat would be aninteresting project dont you think ttomalss liu han purred the words as if she were a cat eyeing a mouse it would presently devourwhen it got a little hungrier than it was now shed hoped ttomalss would cringe and beg instead he stared at her with what from longer experience with the scaly devils than shed ever wanted she recognized as a mournful expression we of the race never treated you so when you were in our claws he said no liu han exclaimed now she stared at the little devil you didnt take my child from me and leave my heart to break the hatchling was not harmed in any wayon the contrary ttomalss replied and to our regret we did not fully understand the attachment between the generations among you tosevites this is one of the things we have learnedin part from you yourself he meant what he said liu han realized he didnt think he had been wantonly cruelwhich didnt mean he hadnt been cruel you scaly devils took me up in your airplane that never landed and then you made me into a whore up there liu han wanted to shoot him for that alone lie with this one you said or you do not eat then it was lie with that one and that one and that one and all the time you were watching and taking your films and you say you never did me any harm you must understand ttomalss said with us a mating is a mating in the season male and female find each other and after time the female lays the eggs to the rabotevsone race we rulea mating is a mating to the hallessianother race we rulea mating is a mating how do we know that to tosevites a mating is not just a mating we find out yes we find out because of what we do with people like you and the tosevite males we bring up to our ship before that we did not know we still have trouble believing you are as you are liu han studied him across a gap of incomprehension as wide as the separation between china and whatever weird place the little scaly devils called home for the first time she really grasped that ttomalss and the rest of the little devils had acted without malice they were trying to learn about people and went ahead and did that as best they knew how some of her fury melted somebut not all you exploited us she said using a word much in vogue in the propaganda of the peoples liberation army here it fit like a sandal made by a master shoemaker because we were weak because we could not fight back you took us and did whatever you wanted to us that is wrong and wicked dont you see it is what the stronger does with the weaker ttomalss said hunching himself down in a gesture the little devils used in place of a shrug he swung both eye turrets toward her now i am weak and you are strong you have caught me and brought me here and you say you will use me for experiments is this exploiting me or is it not is it wrong and wicked or is it not the little scaly devil was clever whatever liu han said he had an answer whatever she said he had a way of twisting her words against hershe wouldnt have minded listening to a debate between him and nieh hoting who was properly trained in the dialectic but liu han had one argument ttomalss could not overcome the submachine gun it is revenge she said ah ttomalss bowed his head may the spirits of emperors past look kindly upon my spirit he was waiting quietly for her to kill him shed seen war and its bloody aftermath of course shed had the idea for bombs that had killed and hurt and maimed any number of little scaly devilsthe more the better but she had never killed personally and at pointblank range it was she discovered not an easy thing to do angry at ttomalss for making her see him as a person of sorts rather than an ugly alien enemy angry at herself for what nieh would surely have construed as weakness she whirled and left the chamber she slammed the inner door after her made sure it was locked then closed and locked the outer door too she stamped back toward the roominghouse she didnt want to be away from liu mei a moment longer than absolutely necessary with every word of chinese the baby learned to understand and to say she defeated ttomalss all over again from behind her a man said here pretty sister ill give you five dollars mexreal silverif youll show me your body he jingled the coins suggestively his voice had a leer in it liu han whirled and pointed the submachine gun at his startled face ill show you this she snarled the man made a noise like a frightened duck he turned and fled sandals flapping as he dashed down thehutung wearily liu han kept on her way ttomalss was smaller than the human exploiters shed known she thought of yi min the apothecary whod taken advantage of her as ruthlessly as any of the men shed had the displeasure to meet in the airplane that never landed save only bobby fiore he was scalier he was uglier he wasor had beenmore powerful but was he at the bottom any worse i just dont know she said and sighed and kept on walking this is bloody awful country george bagnall said looking around he ken embry and jerome jones no longer had lake peipus and lake chud on their left hand as they had through the long slog north from pskov theyd paid a chunk of sausage to an old man with a rowboat to ferry them across the narva river now they were heading northwest toward the baltic coast the forests to the east of pskov were only a memory now everything was flat here so flat that bagnall marveled at the lakes and rivers staying in their beds and not spilling out over the landscape embry had the same thought someone might have taken an iron to this place he said someone did jones answered mother nature as a matter of fact in the last ice age the glaciers advanced past here for lord knows how many thousand years then finally went back they pressed down the ground like a man pressing a leaf under a board and a heavy rock i dont much care what did it bagnall said i dont fancy it and thats that its not just how flat it is either its the colorits off somehow all the greens that should be bright are sickly cant blame it on the sun either not when its in the sky practically twentyfour hours a day we arent very far above lake level embry said we cant be very far above sea level i wonder how far inland the salt has soaked that would do something to the plants i daresay theres a thought bagnall said always nice having an explanation for things ive no idea whether its the proper explanation mind you but any old port in a storm what speaking of which embry took out a map as best i can tell were about ten miles from the coast he pointed northwest that great plume of smoke over there i think is from the great industrial metropolis of kohtlajarve he spoke with palpable irony had it not been for the name of the place beside it he would have taken the dot on the map for a flyspeck must be something going on in whateveryoucallit jerome jones observed or the lizards wouldnt have pounded it so hard i dont think thats war damage ken embry said the volume of smoke is too steady weve seen it for the past day and a half and its hardly changed i think the germans or the russians or whoever controls the place have lighted off a big smudge to keep the lizards from looking down and seeing what theyre about whatever it is at the moment i dont much care bagnall said my question is are we likelier to get a boat if we saunter blithely into kohtlajarve or if we find some fishing village on the baltic nearby would we sooner deal with soldiers or peasants jones asked bagnall said if we try to deal with peasants and something goes wrong we can try to back away and deal with the soldiers if something goes wrong dealing with the soldiers though thats apt to be rather final his companions considered for the next few steps almost in unison they nodded embry said a point well taken george i feel rather biblical navigating by a pillar of smoke jerome jones said even if were steering clear of it rather than steering by it onward bagnall said adjusting his course more nearly due north so as to strike the baltic coast well east of kohtlajarve and whatever whoever was making there as he had been many times bagnall was struck by the vastness of the soviet landscape he supposed the siberian steppe would seem even more huge and empty but estonia had enough land and to spare sitting around not doing much it struck him as untidy the englishmen would walk past a farm with some recognizable fields around it but soon the fields would peter out and it would be justland again till the next farm that they were approaching the baltic coast didnt make the farms come any closer together bagnall began to wonder if theyd find a little fishing village when they got to the sea hardly anyone seemed to live in this part of the world one advantage of traveling at this time of year was that you could keep going as long as you had strength in you at around the latitude of leningrad the sun set for only a couple of hours each night as the summer solstice approached and never dipped far enough below the horizon for twilight to end even at midnight the northern sky glowed brightly and the whole landscape was suffused with milky light as ken embry said that evening its not nearly so ugly nowseems a bit like one of the less tony parts of fairyland dont you think distances were hard to judge in that shadowless almost sourceless light a farmhouse and barn that had seemed a mile away not two minutes before were now quite suddenly all but on top of them shall we beg shelter for the night bagnall said id sooner sleep in straw than unroll my blanket on ground thats sure to be damp they approached the farmhouse openly theyd needed to display aleksandr germans safeconduct only a couple of times despite their worries the peasants had on the whole been friendly enough but they were still a quarter of a mile from the farmhouse as best bagnall could judge when a man inside shouted something at them bagnall frowned thats not german did you understand it jones the radarman shook his head its not russian either id swear to that though i dont quite know what it is the shout came again as unintelligible as before i wonder if its estoman jones said in a musing voice i hadnt thought anyone spoke estonian the estonians included were friends bagnall shouted toward the house first in english then in german and last in russian had he known how to say it in estonian he would have done that too he took a couple of steps forward whoever was in the farmhouse wanted no uninvited guests a bullet cracked past above bagnalls head before he heard the report of the rifle whose flash hed seen at the window the range was by no means extreme maybe the strange light fooled the fellow in there into misjudging it though not an infantryman bagnall had done enough fighting on the ground to drop to that ground when someone started shooting at him so did ken embry they both screamed get down you fool at jones he stood gaping till another bullet whined past this one closer than the first then he too sprawled on his belly that second shot hadnt come from the farmhouse but from the barn both gunmen kept banging away too and a third shooter opened up from another window of the house what the devil did we start to walk in on bagnall said scuttling toward a bush that might conceal him from the hostile locals the annual meeting of the estonian we hate everyone who isnt us league shouldnt be a bit surprised embry answered from behind cover of his own if these are estonians they must have taken us for nazis or bolsheviks or similar lower forms of life do we shoot back at them id sooner retreat and go around bagnall said just then though two men carrying rifles ran out of the barn and toward some little trees not far away to the right he flicked the safety off his mauser i take it back if theyre going to hunt us they have to pay for the privilege he brought the german rifle with the awkward bolt up to his shoulder before he could fire three more men sprinted from the back of the farmhouse toward an outbuilding off to the left ken embry shot at one of them but the light was as tricky for him as it was for the estonians all three of them safely made it to the outbuilding they started shooting at the raf men a couple of bullets kicked up dirt much too close to bagnall for his liking bit of a sticky wicket what jerome jones drawled neither the hackneyed phrase nor the university accent disguised his concern bagnall was worried toobugger worried he told himselfim bloody petrifiedthere were too many estomans out there and they too obviously meant business the two men in the house and the one still in the barn kept shooting at the englishmen making them keep their heads down under cover of their fire and that of the fellow behind the outbuilding the two estonians in the trees scooted forward and farther to the right heading for some tall brush that would give them cover bagnall snapped off a couple of shots at them as they ran to no visible effect theyre going to flank us out he said in dismay then another rifle spoke from behind him and to his right one of the running men dropped his weapon and crashed to earth as if hed been sapped that unexpected rifle cracked again the second runner went down too with a cry of pain that floated over the flat grassy land he tried to crawl to cover but bagnall fired twice more at him one of the bullets must have hit for the fellow lay quiet and motionless after that one of the estonians behind the outbuilding popped up to shoot before he could the rifleman behind the raf men squeezed off another round the estoman crumpled he must have dropped his rifle for it fell where bagnall could see it we have a friend he said i wonder if hes russian or german he looked back over his shoulder but couldnt see anyone the man in the farmhouse whod fired firstor perhaps someone else using the same windowfired again at what seemed the same instant the marksman behind bagnall also fired an arm dangled limply from the window till it was dragged back inside whoever that is back there hes a bloody wonder embry said the estomans evidently thought the same thing one of them behind the outbuilding waved a white cloth we have a wounded man here he called in oddly accented german will you let us take him back to the house go ahead bagnall said after a moments hesitation will you let us back up and go around you we didnt want this fight in the first place you may do that the estonian answered maybe you are not who we thought you were maybe you should have found out about that before you tried blowing our heads off bagnall said go on now but remember we have you in our sightsand so does our friend back there still waving the cloth the estonian picked up his fallen comrades rifle and slung it on his back he and his hale companion dragged the wounded man toward the farmhouse by the limp way he hung in their arms he was badly hurt while they did that bagnall and his companions crawled backwards not fully trusting the truce to which theyd agreed but the estonians in the house and barn evidently wanted no more of them bagnall realized he was withdrawing in the direction of the rifleman whod bailed them out of that tight spot softly he calleddanke sehr and then to cover all basesspasebo nye za chtoyoure welcome came the answer hed guessed right the second time that wasnt what made his jaw drop foolishly though hed expected whatever answer he got to be baritone not creamy contralto jerome jones yelped like a puppy with its tail caught in a door tatiana he exclaimed and went on in russian what are you doing here never mind that now the sniper answered first we go around that house full of antisoviet reactionaries since you englishmen were foolish enough to give them quarter how do you know they arent antifascist patriots embry asked in a mixture of german and russian tatiana pirogova let out an annoyed snort they are estonians so they must be antisoviet she spoke as if stating a law of nature bagnall didnt feel inclined to quarrel with her not after what shed just done for them she didnt say anything else as she led the raf men on a long loop around the farmhouse it went slowly none of them dared stand while they might still be in rifle range the house and barn though remained as silent as if uninhabited bagnall wished they had been at last catwary tatiana got to her feet the englishmen followed her lead grunting with relief how did you come upon us at just the right moment bagnall asked her taking her rising as giving him leave to speak she shrugged i left two days after you you were not traveling very fast and sothere i was in half an hours timeless maybei would have hailed you if the shooting had not started what aboutgeorg schultz jerome jones askedhesitantly as if half fearing her reply she shrugged again with magnificent indifference woundedmaybe dead i hope dead but i am not sure he is strong she spoke with grudging respect but he thought he could do with me as he pleased he was wrong she patted the barrel of her telescopically sighted rifle to show how wrong he was what will you do now bagnall asked her get you safe to the sea she answered after that who knows go back and kill more germans around pskov i suppose thank you for coming this far to look after us bagnall said odd to think of tatiana pirogova sniper extraordinaire had he been inclined to doubt that which he wasnt the affair at the farmhouse would have proved her talents along those lines with a motherhen complex but she seemed to have one now he hesitated before continuing if we can lay hold of a boat youre welcomemore than welcometo come to england with us he wondered if shed get angry he often wondered that when he dealt with her instead she looked sad andmost unlike the tatiana he thought he knewconfused at last she said you go back to yourrodina your motherland so that is right for you but thisshe stamped a booted foot down on the sickly green grassthis is myrodina i will stay and fight for it the estonians shed shot had thought this particular stretch of ground was part of their motherland not hers the germans in kohtlajarve undoubtedly thought of it as an extension of theirvaterland all the same he took her point he nodded off toward the west toward the smoke that never stopped rising from kohtlajarve what do they make there that they have to keep it hidden from the lizards no matter what he asked they squeeze oil out of rocks in some way tatiana answered we have been doing that for years we and then the reactionary estonian separatists i suppose the fascists found the plants in working order or they may have repaired them bagnall nodded that made sense petroleum products were doubly precious these days any place the germans could get their hands on such they would come tatiana said dismissing the germans as a distraction she set off with a long swinging stride that was a distraction in itself and gave some justification to her claim the raf men traveled slowly they reached the baltic a couple of hours later it looked unimpressive gray water rolling up and back over mud even so jerome jones imitating xenophons men called outthalassa thalassa bagnall and embry both smiled recognizing the allusion tatiana shrugged it off maybe she thought it was english to her that tongue was as alien as greek perhaps half a mile to the west a little village squatted by the sea bagnall felt like cheering when he saw a couple of fishing boats pulled up onto the beach another despite the early hour was already out on the baltic dogs barked as the raf men and tatiana came into the village fishermen and their wives stepped out of doors to stare at them their expressions ranged from blank to hostile in german bagnall said we are three english fliers we have been trapped in russia for more than a year we want to go home can any of you sail us to finland we do not have much but we will give you what we can englishmen one of the fishermen said with the same strange accent the estonian fighters had had hostility melted i will take you a moment later someone else demanded the privilege didnt expect to be quarreled over embry murmured as the villagers hashed it out the fellow whod spoken first won the argument he ducked back into his home reemerging with boots and knitted wool cap then escorted them to his boat tatiana followed as the rap men were about to help drag the boat into the water she kissed each of them in turn the villagers muttered among themselves in incomprehensible estonian a couple of men guffawed that was understandable so were the loud sniffs from a couple of women youre certain you wont come with us bagnall said tatiana shook her head yet again she turned around and tramped south without looking back she knew what she intended to do and had to know the likely consequences of it come the fisherman said the raf men scrambled aboard with him the rest of the villagers finished pushing the boat into the sea he opened the fire door to the steam engine and started throwing in wood and peat and what looked like chunks of dried horse manure shaking his head he went on ought to burn coal cant get coal burn whatever i get we know a few verses to that song bagnall said the fisherman chuckled the boat had probably been slow burning its proper fuel it was slower now and the smoke that poured from its stack even less pleasant than the smudges from kohtlajarve but the engine ran the boat sailed barring the lizards strafing them from the air finland was less than a day away oh jager dear otto skorzeny said in scratchy falsetto heinrich jager looked up in surprise he hadnt heard skorzeny come up the ss man laughed at him stop mooning over that russian popsy of yours and pay attention i need something from you she isnt a popsy jager said skorzeny laughed louder the panzer colonel went on if she were a popsy i dont suppose id be mooning over her the half admission got through to skorzeny who nodded all right something to that but even if shes the madonna stop mooning over her you know our friends back home have sent us a present right hard not to know it jager agreed more of you damned ss men around than you can shake a stick at every stinking one of them with a schmeisser and a look in his eye that says hed just as soon shoot you as give you the time of day ill bet i even know what kind of present it is too he didnt say what kind of present he thought it was not because he believed he might be wrong but from automatic concern for security ill bet you do skorzeny said why shouldnt you youve known about this stuff as long as i have ever since those days outside kiev he said no more after that but it was plenty theyd stolen explosive metal from the lizards in the ukraine what are you going to do withit jager asked cautiously are you thick in the head skorzeny demanded im going to blow the kikes in lodz to hell and gone is what im going to do and their chums the lizards and all the poor damned poles in the wrong place at the wrong time he laughed again theres the story of poland in a sentencenicht wahr the poor damned poles in the wrong place at the wrong time i presume you have authorization for this jager said not presuming any such thing if anybody could lay hands on an atomic bomb for his own purposes otto skorzeny was the man but not this time skorzenys big head went up and down you bet your arse i do from thereichsfuhrerss and straight from the fuhrer himself both of em in my attache case you want to gape at fancy autographs never mind in a way jager was relievedif himmler and hitler had signed off on this at least skorzeny wasnt running wild or no wilder than usual at any rate stillstrikes me as a waste of a bomb theres nothing threatening coming out of lodz look what happened the last time the lizards even tried sending something up our way through the town it got here late and chewed up thanks to what happened down there oh yes the jews did us a hell of a favor skorzeny rolled his eyes when they hit the lizards the bastards all wore german uniforms so they didnt get blamed for itwe did i did in particular as a matter of fact the lizards bribed a couple of poles with scopesighted rifles to come up here and go skorzenyhunting to see if they could pay me back youre still here jager noted you noticed that did you skorzeny made as if to kiss him on the cheek youre such a clever boy and both the poles are dead too it took a whilewe know to the zloty how big their payoff was his smile showed teeth maybe he was remembering how the poles perished but then he looked grim lieutenantcolonel brockelmann is dead too unlucky son of a whore happened to be about my size one of the poles blew off the top of his head from behind at about a thousand meters damn fine shooting i must say i complimented the fellow on it as i handed him his trigger finger im sure he appreciated that jager said dryly associating with skorzeny had rubbed his nose in all the uglier parts of warfare the parts he hadnt had to think about as a panzer commander mass murder torture he hadnt signed up for those but they were part of the package whether hed signed up for them or not was destroying a city where the people were doing thereich more good than harm was their being jews reason enough was their having piqued skorzeny for not letting him destroy them on his first try reason enough hed have to think about thatand he couldnt waste too much time doing it either meanwhile he asked so what am i supposed to do about all this whats the favor you have in mind ive never been into lodz you know oh yes i know that skorzeny stretched like a tiger deciding he was too full to go hunting right now if you had been in lodz youd be talking with thesicherheitsdienst or thegestapo now not me ive talked with them before jager shrugged trying not to show the stab of alarm he felt i know that too skorzeny answered but they would be asking morepointed questions this time and using more pointed tools never mind all that i dont want you to go into lodz the tiger became more alert im not sure id trust you to go into lodz i want you to lay on a diversionary attack make the lizards look someplace else while i trundle on down the road with my band of elves and make like st nicholas cant do it tomorrow if thats what you have in mind jager answered promptlyand truthfully every time we fight it hurts us worse than the lizards a lot worse you know that were sort of putting things back together here right now bringing up new panzers new men getting somewhere closewell closerto establishment strength give me a week or ten days he expected skorzeny to blow up to demand action yesterday if not sooner but the ss man surprised himskorzeny spent a lot of time surprising himby nodding thats fine i still have some arrangements of my own to work out even for elves hauling in a bloody big crate takes a bit of planning ill let you know when i need you he thumped jager on the back now you can go back to thinking about your russian with her clothes off he walked away laughing till he wheezed what the devil was all that in aid of sir gunther grillparzer asked the devil indeed jager glanced toward the panzer gunner whose eyes followed skorzeny as if he were some cinema hero hes found some new reasons for getting a bunch of us killed gunther wunderbargrillparzer said with altogether unfeigned enthusiasm leaving jager to contemplate the vagaries of youth he came up with a twisted version of the book of ecclesiastes vagary of vagaries all is vagary it seemed as good a description of real life as the more accurate reading ah good to see you vyacheslav mikhailovich iosef stalin said as molotov entered his kremlin office and you comrade general secretary molotov answered stalin had a purr in his voice that molotov hadnt heard in a long time not since just after the previous soviet atomic bomb as best he could remember the last time hed heard it before that was when the red army threw the nazis back from the gates of moscow at the end of it meant stalin thought things were looking up for the time being i presume you have again conveyed to the lizards our nonnegotiable demand that they cease their aggression and immediately withdraw from the territory of the peaceloving soviet union stalin said perhaps they will pay more attention to this demand after saratov perhaps they will iosef vissarionovich molotov said neither of them mentioned magnitogorsk which had ceased to exist shortly after saratov was incinerated measured against the blow dealt the lizards the loss of any one city even an important industrial center like magnitogorsk was a small matter molotov went on at least they have not rejected the demand out of hand as they did when we made it on previous occasions if once we get them to the conference table we shall defeat them there stalin said not only does the dialectic predict this so does their behavior at all previous conferences they are too strong for us to drive them from the world altogether i fear but once we get them talking we shall free the soviet union and its workers and peasants of them i am given to understand they have also received withdrawal demands from the governments of the united states and germany molotov said as those are also powers possessing atomic weapons the lizards will have to hear them as seriously as they hear us yes stalin filled a pipe withmakhorka and puffed out a cloud of acrid smoke it is the end for britain you know were churchill not a capitalist exploiter i might have sympathy for him the british did a very great thing expelling the lizards from their island but what has it got them in the end nothing they could yet produce their own atomic weapons molotov said underestimating them does not pay as hitler found to his dismay stalin agreed for his part stalin had underestimated hitler but molotov did not point that out stalin sucked meditatively on the pipe for a little while before going on even if they make these bombs for themselves vyacheslav mikhailovich what good does it do them they have already saved their island without the bombs they cannot save their empire with them for they have no way of delivering them to africa or india those will stay in the lizards hands from this time forward a cogent point molotov admitted you endangered yourself if you underestimated stalins capacity he was always brutal he could be naive foolish shortsighted but when he was right as he often was he was so breathtakingly right as to make up for the rest he said if the german fascists persuade the lizards to withdraw from territory that had been under their occupation before the aliens invaded it will be interesting to see how many of those lands eagerly return to nazi control much of the land the fascists occupied was ours molotov said the lizards did us a favor by clearing them from so much of it naziheld pockets persisted in the north and near the romanian frontier and nazi bands one step up from guerrillas still ranged over much of what the germans had controlled but those were manageable problems unlike the deadly threats the fascists had posed and the lizards now did stalin sensed that too saying personally i would not be brokenhearted to see the lizards remain in poland with peace better them on our western border than the fascists having made a treaty they are more likely to adhere to it he had underestimated hitler once he would not do it twice molotov nodded vigorously here he agreed with his superior with the nazis rockets with their gas that paralyzes breathing with their explosivemetal bombs and with their fascist ideology they would make most unpleasant neighbors yes stalin puffed out more smoke his eyes narrowed he looked through molotov rather than at him it was not quite the hooded look he gave when mentally discarding a favorite consigning him to thegulag or worse he was just thinking hard after a while he said let us be flexible vyacheslav mikhailovich let us instead of demanding withdrawal before negotiations propose a ceasefire in place while negotiations go on perhaps this will work perhaps it will not if we are no longer subject to raids and bombings our industry and collective farms will have the chance to begin recovery shall we offer this proposal alone or shall we try to continue to maintain a human popular front against the alien imperialists molotov asked you may consult with the americans and germans before transmitting the proposal to the lizards stalin said with the air of a man granting a great boon you may for that matter consult with the british the japanese and the chinesethe small powers he added dismissing them with a wave of his hand if they are willing to make the lizards the same offer at the same time well and good we shall go forward together if they are unwilling we shall go forward anyway as you say comrade general secretary molotov was not sure this was the wisest course but imagining von ribbentrops face when he got the despatch announcing the new soviet policyand better yet imagining von ribbentrops face when he had to bring hitler the newscame close to making it all worthwhile i shall begin drafting the telegram at once heinrich jager was getting to be a pretty fair horseman the accomplishment filled him with less delight than it might have under other circumstances when you had to climb on a horse to go back and visit corps headquarters that mostly proved you didnt have enough petrol to keep your utility vehicles operational since thewehrmacht barely had enough petrol to keep its panzers operational the choice lay between visiting corps headquarters on a bay mare or on shanks mare riding beat the devil out of walking the road through the forest forked jager urged the mare south down the righthand fork that was not the direct route back to his regiment one of the good thingsone of the few good thingsabout riding a horse as opposed to avolkswagen was that you did it by yourself without a driver jager didnt want anyone to know he was turning down the righthand fork if anyone found out in fact he would soon be having intimate discussion with the ss the sd thegestapo theabwehr and any other security or intelligence service that could get its hands to say nothing of assorted blunt sharp heated and electrically conductive instruments on him why am i doing this he said in the middle of forest stillness broken only by the distant rumble of artillery the mare answered with a snort he felt like snorting himself he did know the answer partly the debt he felt to anielewicz personally partly that anielewicz and his jewish fighters had kept their side of the bargain theyd made with him and didnt deserve incineration partly the way his stomach knotted whenever he thought about what the forces of thereich had done to the jews of eastern europe before the lizards cameand were still doing to the jews remaining in the territory they controlled he remembered all too vividly the jewish and homosexual prisoners who worked on the atomic pile underschloss hohentubingen till they died which seldom took long was all that reason enough to violate his military oath the head of the ss and thefuhrer himself had authorized skorzeny to visit atomic fire upon lodz who was colonel heinrich jager to say they were wrong a man he said answering the question no one had asked aloud if i cant live with myself what good is anything else he sometimes wished he could turn off his mind could numb himself to everything that happened in war he knew a good many officers who were aware of the horrors thereich had committed in the east but who refused to think about them who sometimes even refused to admit they were aware of them then there was skorzeny who knew but didnt give a damn neither path suited jager he was neither an ostrich to stick his head in the sand nor a pharisee to pass by on the other side of the road and so here he was riding down this side of this road a submachine gun on his knee alert for lizard patrols german patrols polish brigands jewish brigands anyone at all the fewer people he saw the better he liked it his nerves jumped again when he came out of the forest into open farm country now he was visible for kilometers not just a few meters of course a lot of men got around on horseback these days and a lot of them were in uniform and carried weapons not all of those were soldiers by any means the times had turned poland as rough as the cinema made the america wild west out to be rougherthe cowboys didnt have machine guns or panzers his eyes swiveled back and forth he still didnt see anybody he rode on the farm wasnt far he could leave his message boot the mare up into a trot and be back with his regiment at the front only an hour or so later than he should have been given how erratic any sort of travel was these days no one would think twice over that here we go he said softly recognizing the wellkept little grove of apple trees ahead karol would pass the word to tadeusz tadeusz could get it to anielewicz and that would be that everything was quiet ahead too quiet the hair prickled up on the back of jagers neck no chickens ran in the yard no sheep bleated no pigs grunted for that matter no one was in the fields no toddlers played by the house like a lot of poles karol was raising a great brood of children you could always spot themor hear them anyhow not now though his horse snorted and sidestepped white showing around her eyes steady jager said and steady she was but something had spooked her she was walking forward yes but her nostrils still flared with every breath she took jager sniffed too at first he noted nothing out of the ordinary then he too smelled what was bothering the mare it wasnt much just a faint whiff of corruption as if ahausfrau hadnt got round to cooking a joint of beef until it had stayed in the icebox too long he knew he should have wheeled the horse around and ridden out of there at that first whiff of danger but the whiff argued that the danger wasnt there now it had come and gone probably a couple of days before jager rode the ever more restive mare up to the farmhouse and tied her to one of the posts holding up the front porch as he dismounted he flipped the change lever on his schmeisser to full automatic flies buzzed in and out through the front door which was slightly ajar jager kicked it open the sudden noise made the mare quiver and try to run jager bounded into the house the first two bodies lay in the kitchen one of karols daughters maybe seven years old had been shot executionstyle in the back of the neck his wife lay there too naked on her back she had a bullet hole between the eyes whoever had been here had probably raped her a few times or more than a few before theyd killed her biting his lip jager walked into the parlor several more children sprawled in death there the visitors had served one of them a little blond of about twelve whom jager remembered as always smiling the same way they had karols wife the black bread hed had for breakfast wanted to come back up he clamped his jaw and wouldnt let it the door to karols bedroom gaped wide like his wifes legs like his daughters jager walked in there on the bed lay karol he had not been slain neatly professionally dispassionately his killers had taken time and pains on their work karol had taken pain too some enormous amount of it before he was finally allowed to die jager turned away partly sickened partly afraid now he knew who had visited this farmhouse before him theyd signed their masterpiece so to speak on karols belly theyd burned in the ss runes with a redhot poker or something similar the next interesting question was how much had they asked him before they finally cut out his tongue he didnt know jagers namethe panzer colonel called himself joachim around herebut if hed described jager figuring out who he was wouldnt take the ss long whistling tunelessly jager went outside unhitched the mare and rode away where to ride troubled him should he flee for his life if he could get to lodz anielewicz and the jews would protect him that was loaded with irony thick enough to slice but it was also probably true in the end though instead of riding south he went north back toward his regiment karol and his family had been dead for days now if the ss did know about him they would have dropped on him by now and never mind the jews he still had the war against the lizards to fight when he did get back to the regimental encampment gunther grillparzer looked up from a game of skat and said you look a little green around the gills sir everything all right i must have drunk some bad water or something jager answered ive been jumping down off this miserable creaturehe patted the horses neckand squatting behind a bush about every five minutes all the way back from corps headquarters that accounted not only for his pallor but also for getting back here later than he should have the galloping shits are no fun at all sir the panzer gunner said sympathetically then he guffawed and pointed to jagers mare the galloping shits get it sir i made a joke without even noticing life is like that sometimes jager said grillparzer scratched his head jager just led away the horse hed ridden it a long way it needed seeing to grillparzer shrugged and went back to his card game nieh hoting and hsia shoutao passed the little scaly devils inspection and were allowed into the main part of the tent on the island in the lake at the heart of the forbidden city good of you to invite me here with you today he said instead of he stopped instead of your woman the one i tried to rapenieh completed the sentence perhaps not exactly as his aide would have aloud he answered liu mei has some sort of sickness the kind babies get liu han asked the central committee for permission to be relieved of this duty so she could care for the girl said permission having been granted hsia shoutao nodded women need to look after their brats its one of the things theyre good for theyre he stopped again again nieh hoting had no trouble coming up with a likely continuationtheyre also good for laying which causes the brats in the first place but hsia while he might have thought that hadnt come out and said it his reeducation however slowly it proceeded was advancing liu han has all sorts of interesting projects going on nieh said hsia shoutao nodded once more but did not ask him to amplify that where women were not involved hsia was plenty clever he would not allude to the whereabouts of the scaly devil ttomalss where other little devils might hear nieh had thought that by this time he would be delivering small pieces of ttomalss to the little devils one at a time it hadnt worked out that way the capture of the little devil whod stolen liu hans child had gone off as plannedbetter than plannedbut she hadnt yet taken the ferocious revenge she and nieh had anticipated he wondered why it wasnt as if shed become a christian or anything foolish like that a couple of chairs were the only articles of humanmade furniture inside the tent nieh and hsia sat down in them a moment later the little scaly devil named ppevel and his interpreter came out and seated themselves behind their worktable ppevel let loose with a volley of hisses and pops squeaks and coughs the interpreter turned them into pretty good chinese the assistant administrator eastern region main continental mass notes that one of you appears to be different from past sessions is it nieh hoting or liu han who is absent liu han is absent nieh answered the little devils had as much trouble telling people apart as he did with them ppevel spoke again we suspect a link between her and the disappearance of the researcher ttomalss your people and mine are at war nieh hoting answered we have honored the truce we gave in exchange for liu hans baby we were not required to do anything more than that suspect all you like you are arrogant ppevel said that coming from an imperialist exploiter of a little scaly devil almost made nieh hoting laugh out loud he didnt he was here on business he said we have learned that you scaly devils are seriously considering ceasefires without time limits for discussion of your withdrawal from the territory of the peaceloving soviet union and other states these requests are under discussion ppevel agreed through the interpreter they have nothing to do with you however we shall not withdraw from china under any circumstances nieh stared at him in dismay he had been ordered by mao tsetung himself to demand chinasand specifically the peoples liberation armysinclusion in such talks having the little scaly devils reject that out of hand before he could even propose it was a jolt it reminded nieh of the signs the european foreign devils had put up in their colonial parks no dogs or chinese allowed you shall regret this highhanded refusal he said when he could speak again what we have done to you is but a pinprick beside what we might do what you might do is a pinprick beside the damage from an explosivemetal bomb ppevel replied you have none we are strong enough to hold down this land no matter what you do we shall if you do well make your life a living hell hsia shoutao burst out hotly every time you step out on the street someone may shoot at you every time you get into one of your cars or trucks or tanks you may drive over a mine every time you travel between one city and another someone may have a mortar zeroed on the road every time you bring food into a city you may have to see if it is poisoned nieh wished his aide hadnt given the little devils such bald threats liu han would have known better she was as nieh had discovered to his own occasional discomfiture a master at biding her time till she was ready to attack a target full force but nieh did not disagree with the sentiments hsia had expressed ppevel remained unimpressed how is this different from what you are doing now he demanded we hold the centers of population we hold the roads between one of them and another using these we can control the countryside you can try nieh hoting told him that was the recipe the japanese had used in occupying northeastern china it was almost the only recipe you could use if you lacked the manpoweror even the devilpowerto occupy a land completely you will find the price higher than you can afford to pay we are a patient people ppevel answered in the end we shall wear you down you big uglies are too hasty for long campaigns nieh hoting was used to thinking of the europeans and japanese as hasty folk hopelessly out of their depth in dealing with china he was not used to being perceived as a blunt unsubtle barbarian himself pointing a finger at ppevel he said you will lose more fighters here in china than you would from an explosivemetal bomb you would do better to negotiate a peaceful withdrawal of your forces now than to see them destroyed piecemeal threats are easy to make ppevel said they are harder to carry out conquests are sometimes easy to make too nieh replied they are harder to keep if you stay here you will not be facing the peoples liberation army alone you know the kuomintang and the eastern devilsthe japanesewill struggle alongside us if the war takes a generation or longer we shall accept the necessity he was sure he spoke the truth about the kuomintang chiang kaishek had betrayed the chinese revolution but he was as wily a politician as any in the land even after the japanese invaded hed saved the bulk of his strength for the conflict against the peoples liberation army just as mao had conserved force to use against him each of them recognized the need for protracted war to gain his own objectives what the japanese would do was harder to calculate without a doubt though they hated the little scaly devils and would fight them ferociously even if without any great political acumen ppevel said as i told you before we are going to keep this land your threats we ignore your pinpricks we ignore we recognize only true force you are far too backward to build an explosivemetal bomb we have no need to fear you or anything you might do maybe we cannot build one hsia shoutao hissed but we have allies one of these bombs might yet appear in a chinese city this time nieh felt like patting hsia on the back that was exactly the right thing to say nieh knewhe did not think hsia didthat mao had sent stalin a message asking for the use of the first bomb the soviet union did not urgently require in its own defense the interpreter translated ppevel jerked in his chair as if hed sat on something sharp and pointed you are lying he said yet the interpreters chinese sounded uncertain and nieh did not think ppevel sounded confident either he wished after all that hed had liu han along she would have been better at gauging the little devils tone are we lying when we say we have allies nieh replied you know we are not the united states was allied with the kuomintang and the peoples liberation army against the japanese before you scaly devils came here the soviet union was allied with the peoples liberation army against the kuomintang both the usa and the ussr have explosivemetal bombs he thought the chances that one of those bombs would make its way to china were slim but he did not have to let ppevel know that the more likely the little devil reckoned it to be the better the bargain the peoples liberation army would get and hed rocked ppevel too he could see as much the highranking scaly devil and his interpreter went back and forth between themselves for a couple of minutes ppevel finally said i still do not altogether believe your words but i shall bring them to the attention of my superiors they will pass on to you their decision on whether to include you chinese in these talks for their own sake and for yours they had best not delay nieh said a monumental bluff if ever there was one they will decide in their own time not in yours ppevel answered nieh gave a mental shrug not all bluffs worked he recognized a delaying tactic when he saw one the little devils would discuss and discussand then say no ppevel went on the talks between us now are ended you are dismissed pending my superiors actions we are not your servants to be dismissed on your whim hsia shoutao said anger in his voice but the interpreter did not bother translating that he and ppevel retreated into the rear area of the enormous orange tent an armed little devil came into what nieh thought of as the conference chamber to make sure he and hsia departed in good time nieh was thoughtful and quiet till he and his aide left the forbidden city and returned to the raucous bustle of the rest of peking partly because he needed to mull over what ppevel had so arrogantly said partly because he feared the little scaly devils could listen if he discussed his conclusions with hsia shoutao anywhere close to their strongholds at last he said i fear we shall have to form a popular front with the kuomintang and maybe even with the japanese as well if we are to harass the little devils to the point where they decide staying in china is more trouble than its worth hsia looked disgusted we had a popular front with the kuomintang against the japanese it was just noise and speeches it didnt mean much in the war and it didnt keep the counterrevolutionaries from harassing us too or we them nieh said remembering certain exploits of his own maybe this popular front will be like that one but maybe not too can we truly afford the luxury of struggle among ourselves while we also combat the little scaly devils i have my doubts can we convince the kuomintang clique and the japanese to fight the common enemy instead of us and each other hsia retorted i have my doubts of that so do i nieh said worriedly but if we cannot we will lose this war who will come to our rescue then the soviet union they share our ideology but they have been badly mauled fighting first the germans and then the scaly devils no matter what we told ppevel i do not think the peoples liberation army will get an explosivemetal bomb from the ussr any time soon youre right there hsia said spitting in the gutter stalin kept the treaty he made with hitler till hitler attacked him if he makes one with the little scaly devils he will keep it too that leaves us fighting a long war all alone then we need a popular fronta true popular front nieh hoting said hsia shoutao spat again perhaps at the taste of the idea but in the end he nodded xv armorpiercing jager barked as the panthers turret traversednot so fast as he wished it would moveto bear on the lizards mechanized infantry combat vehicle he was hulldown behind a rise and well screened by bushes the lizards hadnt a clue his panzer was there armorpiercing gunther grillparzer echoed his face pressed up against the sight for the panthers long mm cannon karl mehler slapped the discardingsabot round into the breech of the gun nail em gunther the loader said grillparzer fired the panzers main armament to jager who stood head and shoulders out of the cupola the roar was like the end of the world he blinked at the glare of the meterlong tongue of flame that shot from the muzzle of the gun down inside the turret the brass shell casing fell to the floor of the panzer with a clang hit grillparzer shouted exultantly theyre burning theyd better be burningjager thought those discardingsabot rounds could punch through the side armor on a lizard panzer if they didnt wreck the more lightly protected combat vehicles they wouldnt be worth using fall back he said over the intercom to johannes drucker the driver already had the panther in reverse he backed down the rear slope of the rise and continued in reverse to the next preselected firing position this one covering the crestline to attack any lizard vehicles that pursued too aggressively other panzers of the regiment were also blasting away at any lizard targets they could find infantrymen lurked among trees and in ruined buildings waiting with their rocket launchers to assail lizard armor lizard foot soldiers had been doing that to german panzers since the invasion began having the wherewithal to return the compliment was enjoyable overhead artillery shells made freighttrain noises as they came down on the lizards thewehrmacht had pushed the line several kilometers eastward over the past couple of days the lizards didnt seem to have been looking for an attack north of lodz and jagers losses though still dreadful were lighter than they might have been i hope theyre good and bloody well diverted he muttered under his breath he hadnt been much better prepared to make the attack than the lizards were to receive it how well he succeeded was for all practical purposes irrelevant anyhow as long as the lizards paid full attention to him he was doing his job very quietly down to the south otto skorzeny was smuggling an atomic bomb into lodz jager didnt know just how the ss man and his chums were doing it he didnt want to know he didnt want them to do it either but he had no say about that he wondered if hed managed to get word into the city the fellow hed contacted didnt seem nearly so reliable as karol he was furtive and frightened half rabbit half weasel he was also alive however a good reason to prefer him to the late farmer gunther grillparzer made a disgusted noise they arent rushing up to skewer themselves on our guns the way they used to he said took em long enough to learn didnt it the british were quicker down in north africa hell even the russians were quicker and thats saying something off to the right a lizard antipanzer rocket got a panzer iv between concealed firing positions it brewed up flame spurting from every hatch and a perfect black smoke ring shooting out through the open cupola none of the five crewmen escaped then lizard artillery started landing around the german panzers jager considered that a signal to halt the attack for the day the lizards werent so prodigal in their use of the special shells that spat mines as they had been when the war was new but they did still throw them about from time to time he didnt care to lose half a companys worth of panzers to blown tracks the men were just as glad to bivouac as gunther grillparzer got a little cookflre going he turned to johannes drucker and asked ever get the feeling youve lived too long already dont talk like a dumbhead the driver answered you just had a goose walk over your grave thats all maybe youre right grillparzer said i hope so jesus though every time we fight the lizards i dont believe im going to come through in one piece otto skorzeny had a way of materializing out of thin air like a genie from thearabian nights youre a young man yet he said one piece a day shouldnt be enough to satisfy you i didnt expect to see you here so soon jager said as the panzer crewmen snickered hell dont give me thatyou didnt expect to see me at all skorzeny said with a laugh but i needed to give you the news and i couldnt very well put it on the wireless sohier steh ich here i stand he struck a pose perhaps meant to be clerical jager was hardpressed to imagine anyone who seemed less like martin luther the ss man nudged him they walked away from the cookflre and the big friendly bulk of the panther in a low voice skorzeny went on its in place i figured it had to be jager answered otherwise youd still be down in lodz but how the devil did you manage it we have our methods skorzeny said not sounding much like sherlock holmes either enough ginger for the lizards enough gold pieces for the poles he laughed some of them may even live to spend their lootbut not many merely being himself he was as frightening a man as jager had ever known when does it go off he asked when i get orders to touch it off skorzeny said now that its in place all my chums in the fancy black uniforms will go on home itll be my show and do you know what he waited for jager to shake his head before continuing im really looking forward to it too no he was never more frightening than when he sounded like skorzeny the rubble behind which mutt daniels sprawled had once been the chimney to a prosperous farmhouse about halfway between marblehead and fall creek illinois he glanced over to herman muldoon who was sprawled behind some more of those red bricks we dont go forward any way atall he said we dont clear the lizards off the mississippi till the weekafter judgment day yeah muldoon agreed mournfully they dont much want to be moved do they not hardly mutt said everything had gone fine till the us army tried to push south from marblehead theyd gone a couple of miles and stalled a double handful of shermans and a few older lees had supported the attack too a couple of the shermans were still running but the powers that be had got leery about putting them any place where the lizards could shoot at them in a way mutt understood that in another he didnt what point having tanks if you were afraid to use em over to his right behind the burnedout carcass of one of those lees a mortar team started lobbing bombs at the lizard lines a few hundred yards south of the farmhousewhump whwnp whwnp those little finned shells didnt have much in the way of range but they could throw a lot of explosive and steel fragments in a hurry the lizards wasted no time replying mutt hunkered down and dug himself into the ground with his entrenching tool those werent only mortar bombs whistling in the lizards were shooting real cannon too and probably from a range at which american guns couldnt reply under cover of that bombardment lizard infantry skittered forward when mutt heard the platoon bar start chattering he stuck his head up and blazed away with his tommy gun he didnt know whether any of the lizards got hit or not the bar might well nail em at those ranges but hed just be lucky if he wounded one of the aliens still they dove for cover and stopped advancing which was the point of shooting early and often havent seem em try to move up on us in a while muldoon yelled through the din me neither daniels said they been happy enough on the defensive for a while an you know somethin else i was pretty much happy to have em that way my own self yeah muldoon said a big shell landed close by a couple of seconds later showering both men with dirt and leaving them stunned and half deafened mutt glanced back into a foxhole about twenty yards away to make sure his radioman was still in one piece the kid was still moving and wasnt screaming so daniels figured nothing irreparable had happened to him he wondered if he was going to have to call for mustardgas shells to hold the lizards back he was about to yell to the radioman when the lizards barrage let up he peered suspiciously over the bricks what sort of trick were they trying to play did they think they could catch the americans all so deep in their holes that they wouldnt notice attackers till those attackers were in among them if they didnt know better than that after more than two years of hard fighting they damned well should have but the lizards having tried one advance werent pushing forward again smallarms fire from their side of the line had died away too made their point i guess mutt said under his breath hey lieutenant take a gander at that herman muldoon pointed out toward the lizards lines something white was waving on the end of a long stick they want a parley or somethin pick up their wounded mebbe daniels said i dickered that kind o deal with em once or twice wouldnt mind doin it again they make a truce they keep it for as long as they say theyre gonna he raised his voice hold fire boys im gonna go out there an parley with them scaly sons of bitches he turned to muldoon as the americans guns fell silent you got anything white herman still got a snotrag believe it or not muldoon pulled the handkerchief out of his pocket with no small pride not many dogfaces could match it these days it wasnt very white but mutt supposed it would do he looked around for something to fix it to when he didnt find anything he cussed for a couple of seconds and then stood up waving the hanky over his head the lizards didnt shoot at him he walked out into the debatable ground between the two forces a lizard holding his own flag of truce came toward him he hadnt gone very far before the radioman hollered lieutenant lieutenant daniels sir whatever it is logan its gonna have to wait mutt called back over his shoulder i got business here but sir mutt ignored the call and kept walking if he turned around and went back now the lizards were liable to figure hed changed his mind about the ceasefire and start shooting at him the alien with the white flag approached to within maybe ten feet of him then stopped so did mutt he nodded politely as a soldier he had nothing but respect for the lizards second lieutenant daniels us army he said you speak english yessss the lizard drew the word out into a long hiss but mutt had no trouble understanding himgood thing too he thought he didnt know word one of lizard talk the alien went on i am chook smallunit group leader conquest fleet of the race pleased to meet you chook our ranks match pretty much yess i think so also the lizard said i come to tell you there is ceasefire between conquest fleet of the race and your us army we can do that mutt agreed how long do you want the truce to last till nightfall say thatll give both sides plenty of time to bring in whoevers hurt and let us have a bit of a blowa little rest he added thinking the lizard was liable not to know slangafterwards too you not understand second lieutenant daniels chook said is ceasefire between conquest fleet of the race and your us army whole us army whole part of conquest fleet here declared by atvar fleetlord of conquest fleet agree by notemperor of your us army whatever him name be ceasefire in place for now not move forward not move back no set time to ending of ceasefire you hear second lieutenant daniels you understand yeah mutt answered absently jesus he didnt know the last time hed felt like this november maybe but hed been expecting that ceasefire this was a bolt from the blue he turned and hollered loud as he could logan sir the radiomans voice came back thin and tiny over a hundred fifty yards of ground we got a ceaselire with these lizards yes sir i was trying to tell you sir i just got the word when mutt turned back to chook the lizard had already given him the word he spoke formally to chook to make sure the alien knew he had it straight i hear you smallunit group leader chook i understand you too we got us a ceasefire in place here just like all over the us of a no time limit truth chook said this what we have this ceasefire not only for you is also for sssrmutt needed a second to figure out he meant russiaand for deutschland after going over there daniels got that one fast lordy mutt said in an awed voice you pile that all together its half the world pretty much he noticed something else too you made truces with the countries that bombed you back when you bombed em truth chook said again are we fools to waste ceasefire on empires we have beaten look at things from your end o the stick and i guess maybe you got a point mutt admitted he wondered what was going to happen to england chook hadnt said a thing about the limeys and mutt had admired them ever since hed seen them in action in france in the war that was supposed to end war well the lizards had tried invading them once and got a clout in the snout for their trouble maybe theyd learned a lesson chook said you are good fighters you big uglies i tell you that much it is truth we come to tosev this planet this worldwe think we will win and win fast we not win fast you fight good youre no slouches your own selves mutt half turned one of your boys he shot me right there he indicated his left nether cheek i am lucky i am not shot many males who are my friends they are shot chook said mutt nodded he knew about that every frontline soldier knew about that chook said we are fighters you and i mutt nodded again chook let loose with a hissing sigh then went on i think now one time now another time fighters of race fighters at the tips of the tongue of the fight these males more like big uglies at tips of tongue of fight than like other males far away you hear second lieutenant daniels you understand he made a funny coughing noise after each question smallunit group leader chook i hear you real good mutt said i understand you real good too what do you say when something is just right you say truth dont you that theres truth chook truth chook agreed he spoke into something not much bigger than a paperback book back at his line lizards started standing up and poking their noses out of coverhes got a radio right there with him mutt realizedand so do all his troops aint that a hell of a thing wish we could do the like he turned around and waved to his own men one by one they stood up too of them all herman muldoon was the last fellow to show himself mutt didnt blame him a bit hed been shot at so many times by now he probably had trouble believing this wasnt some sort of trick mutt would have too if he hadnt already been standing out here all vulnerable in case the lizards did aim to pull off something sneaky warily still holding weapons humans and lizards approached each other some of them tried to talk back and forth though chooks males knew a lot less english than he did and few americans had much in the way of lizard lingo that was okay you didnt need a whole lot of talking to get across the idea that you werent trying to kill anybody right now even if you had been a few minutes before mutt had seen that on truces in nomansland in france in only a few of his buddies had been able to talk with theboches but theyd got on well enough of course back then the yanks daniels remembered how irate hed been to find the french considering him a yankee andboches had swapped smokes and rations when they met hed traded rations only once as far as he was concerned it was a miracle the germans fought so damn hard on the slop they got to eat he didnt figure hed see anything like that here now the lizards didnt smoke and their rations were nastier than anything theboches had had but when he looked around he saw some of his guys trading something with the aliens what the devil did they nave that the lizards wanted chook was watching that too his eye turrets twisting every which way while his head hardly moved mutt wondered if hed stop this unofficial commerce instead after a minute or so he said you second lieutenant daniels have any of the fruit or small cakes with what you big uglies callginger in them a lighthulb went on in mutts head hed heard the lizards had a hell of a yen for the stuff fraid i dont smallunit group leader he said and itwas too badno telling what sort of interesting stuff a lizard might have to trade looks like some of my boys do though as he spoke he wondered why some of his boys were carrying around stuff with ginger in it the only answer that came to mind was that theyd already been doing some trading with the lizards on the sly any other time that would have made him furious when you looked at it after a ceasefire though how could you get excited about it yess truth chook said with an eager spring in his skittering stride he hurried off to find out what the americans did have for sale behind his back mutt daniels smiled fluffy white clouds floated lazily across a blue sky the sun was high and if not hot pleasantly warm it was a fine day for walking hand in hand with the girl youloved david goldfarb hadnt used the word with naomi kaplan not out loud but he thought it more and more often these days naomis thoughts on the other hand seemed focused on politics and war not love but you are in the raf she said indignantly how could you not know whether we have got a ceasefire with the lizards or have not got any such thing he laughed how could i not know nothing simpler they dont tell rue i dont need to know to do my job which is a good enough reason for not telling all i know is what i want to know ive not heard any lizard aircraftnor heardof any lizard aircraftover england since the ceasefire with the yanks the russians and the nazis then it is a ceasefire naomi insisted it must be a ceasefire goldfarb shrugged maybe it is and maybe its not i admit i dont know of any of our planes heading off to bomb the continent either but weve not done much of that lately anyhow the loss rate got too beastly high to bear maybe its one of those informal arrangements you dont hurt me and i shant hurt you but well not put anything in writing for fear of admitting were doing whatever it is were doingor not doing naomi frowned this is not right this is not proper this is not orderly at that moment she sounded very german goldfarb would sooner have bitten through his tongue than said so out loud she went on the lizards agreements with the other nations are formal and binding why not with us i told you i dont know anything for certain goldfarb said will you listen to my guess when she nodded he went on the americans the russians and the nazis have all used superbombs of the same type the lizards have weve not done that in their eyes maybe we dont deserve a truce because weve not done it but when they tried invading us they found we werent a walkover and so they leave us alone without saying theyre doing it this is possible i suppose naomi admitted after some serious thought but it is still not orderly maybe not he said no matter what it is though im glad not to hear the airraid sirens go off every day or twice a day or every hour on the hour he waited to see if naomi would say such an irregular schedule of raids was disorderly too instead she pointed to the bright red breast of a robin streaking through the air after a dragonfly thats the only kind of aircraft i want to see in the sky hmm goldfarb said i am partial to a nice flight of meteors but id be stretching things if i didnt say you had a point they walked on for a while not talking glad of each others company it was very quiet a bee buzzed from flower to flower in a field by the side of the road goldfarb noticed both the sound and the field without any vegetables growing in it it had to be one of the few such so close to dover apparently apropos of nothing in particular naomi remarked my father and mother like you david im glad he answered which was true enough had isaac and leah kaplan not liked him he wouldnt be out walking with their daughter now i like them too that was also true to a large degree he liked them about as well as a young man could like the parents of the girl he was courting they think you have a serious mind naomi went on do they goldfarb said a little more cautiously now if by seriousminded they meant he wouldnt try to seduce their daughter they didnt know him as well as they thought they did hed already tried that maybe they knew naomi though because it hadnt worked and yet he hadnt gone off in a huff because she wouldnt sleep with him did that make him seriousminded maybe it did he realized he had to say something more i think its good they dont worry about where im fromor where my mother and father are from i should say they think of you as an english jew naomi answered so do i as a matter of fact i suppose so i was born here goldfarb said he didnt think of himself as an english jew though not when his parents had fled here from warsaw on account of pogroms before the first world war german jews had a way of looking down their noses at their eastern european cousins if naomi met his parents it would be quite plain they werent what she thought of as english jews ifthoughtfully he went on my father and mother would like you too if i get leave and you can get a day off from the pub would you like to go up to london and meet them i would like that very much she replied then she cocked her head to one side and looked over at him how would you introduce me how would you like me to introduce you he asked but naomi shook her head that one wasnt for her to answerfair enough he thought he went on for another couple of paces before trying a slightly different question how would you like me to introduce you as my fiancee naomi stopped in her tracks her eyes went very wide you mean this she asked slowly goldfarb nodded though his stomach felt as it sometimes had up in a lancaster taking violent evasive action naomi said i would like this very much and stepped into his arms the kiss she gave him nailed his stomach firmly back in place though it made his head spin when one hand of his closed softly on her breast she didnt pull away instead she sighed and held him tighter emboldened he slid his other down from the small of her back to her right buttockand with a twirl as neat as a jitterbug dancers she twisted away from him soon she said not yet soon we tell my parents i meet your mother and fatherand my mother and father will want to do the same we find a rabbi to marry us then her eyes glittered and i tell you thisyou will not be the only one who is impatient all right he said maybe we ought to go tell your father and mother now he turned and started toward dover the faster he cleared obstacles out of the way the sooner she wouldnt use that little twirl his feet didnt seem to touch the ground all the way back to the city mordechai anielewiczs voice came out flat as the polish plain hard as stone i dont believe you youre lying fine whatever you say the polish farmer had been milking a cow when anielewicz found him he turned away from the jewish fighting leader and back to the business at handsiss siss siss jets of milk landed in the dented tin pail the cow tried to walk off stay here you stupid bitch the pole growled but see here mieczyslaw mordechai protested its impossible i tell you how could the nazis have smuggled an explosivemetal bomb into lodz without us or the lizards or the polish home army knowing about it i dont know anything about how mieczyslaw answered i hear tell theyve done it im supposed to tell you somebody stayed at lejbs house in hrubieszow does that mean anything to you maybe it does maybe it doesnt anielewicz said with as much equanimity as he could muster he didnt want the pole to know how shaken he was heinrich jager had stayed with a jew named lejb all right back when he was carrying explosive metal from the soviet union to germany the message had to be authentic then who else would know about that it wasnt even the sort of thing hed have been likely to mention in a report cautiously mordechai asked what else have you heard its somewhere in the ghetto mieczyslaw told him dont have any idea where so dont waste time asking hadnt been for the ceasefire all you kikesd probably be toasting your toes in hell by now i love you too mieczyslaw anielewicz said the pole chuckled not in the least put out mordechai kicked at the dirtgottenyu that man has balls the size of an elephant thechutzpah it takes to try something like thatand the luck you need to get away with it what man is that mieczyslaw asked mordechai didnt answer him he hardly heard him how had skorzeny sneaked an explosivemetal bomb past everybody and into lodz how had he got it into the jewish quarter how had he got out again afterwards all good questions the only trouble being that mordechai had answers for none of them one other question of course overrode all of thosewhere was the bomb he worried at it every step of the way back to lodz like a man worrying with his tongue at a piece of gristle stuck between two molars the gristle was still stuck when he strode into the fire station of lutomierska street solomon gruver was fiddling with the fire engines motor why the long face he asked looking up from his work he wasnt the only man in earshot the last thing anielewicz wanted to do was spread panic through the ghetto come on upstairs with me he said as casually as he could gruvers long face turned somber with his bushy eyebrows harsh features and thick graying beard he generally looked grim when he felt grim he looked as if his best friend had just died he put down his wrench and followed mordechai up to the room where the leaders of the jewish fighters commonly met on the stairwell he said quietly berthas up there she picked up something interestingwhat it is i dont knowand shes passing it along is whatever youve got something she can know about its something shed better know about anielewicz answered if we cant deal with it ourselves we may have to let rumkowskis gang oftukhuslekhers know it too and maybe even the lizards though thats the last thing i want to do oythose eyebrows of gruvers twitched whatever it is it must be bad no not bad mordechai said gruver gave him a quizzical look worse he explained as they got to the top of the stairs gruver grunted every time anielewicz lifted his foot off the worn linoleum of the floor he wondered if he would live to set it down again that was not in his hands not any more if otto skorzeny pushed a button or flicked a switch on a wireless transmitter he would cease to be probably so fast he wouldnt realize he was dead he laughed solomon gruver stared at him youre carrying news like this and you find something funny maybe anielewicz answered skorzeny had to be one frustrated ss man right this minute hed risked his life getting that bomb into lodz anielewicz whod despised him on sight knew how much courage that had taken but his timing was bad he couldnt touch it off now not without destroying the shiny new ceasefire between the lizards and thereich a couple of seriouslooking jewish men came out of the meeting room well take care of it one of them promised bertha fleishman thank you michael she said and started to follow them out she almost ran into anielewicz and gruver hello i didnt expect to see you two here mordechai ran into something interesting solomon gruver said what it is god knows because hes not talking he glanced over to mordechai not talking yet anyhow now i am anielewicz said he walked into the meeting room when gruver and bertha fleishman had followed him inside he closed the door and with a melodramatic touch locked it that made berthas eyebrows fly up as gruvers had before mordechai spoke for about ten minutes relaying as much as mieczyslaw had told him as he passed it on he realized how little it was when he was finished gruver looked at him and said i dont believe a word of it its just the damned nazis trying to pull our chains and make us run around like chickens in the fannyard he shook his head repeating i dont believe a word if it hadnt been this jager who sent us the message i wouldnt believe it either anielewicz said if it hadnt been for him you know the nervegas bomb would have done us in he turned to bertha what do you think as far as i can see whether its true or not doesnt matter she answered we have to act as if it is dont we we cant really afford to ignore it fehgruver said in disgust well waste all sorts of time and effort and what will we come up with nothing i tell you alevai omaynyoure right and theres nothing to find mordechai said but supposejust supposeyoure wrong and there is a bomb then what maybe we find it that would be good with a bomb of our own we could tell the lizards and nazis both where to head in maybe the lizards find it and use it as an excuse to blow up some city somewherelook what happened to copenhagen or maybe we dont find it and the lizards dont find it suppose the truce talks break down all skorzeny has to do is get on the wireless and solomon gruver grimaced all right you made your point damn you now all we have to do is try to find theverkakte thingif like i say its there to be found in the first place its somewhere here in our part of the city anielewicz said as he had before how could the ss man have got it here where would he have hidden it if he did how big is it bertha asked that will make a difference in where he might have put it it cant be small it cant be light anielewicz answered if it were the germans would load these bombs into airplanes or onto their rockets since they dont do that the bombs cant be something theyd leave behind a kettle in your kitchen that makes sense gruver admitted its one of the few things about this miserable business that does like you say it narrows down the places where the bomb is liable to be if there is a bomb he stubbornly refused to acknowledge that was anything more than anif around the factories bertha fleishman said thats one place to start one place yes gruver said a big one place dozens of factories here all through the ghetto straw boots cartridge casings rucksackswe were making all sorts of things for the nazis and were still making most of them for the lizards so where around the factories would you have us start id sooner not start with them anielewicz said as you say solomon theyre too big to know where to begin we may not have much time it probably depends on how soon the lizards and the nazis quarrel so wheres the likeliest place that ssmamzer would have hidden a big bomb from what you say about him would he have picked the likeliest place solomon gruver asked if he didnt were going to be in even more trouble than i already think we are mordechai answered but i think i hope i pray this time he didnt he couldnt have spent much time in lodz hed have wanted to hide this thing for a little while escape and then set it off it wouldnt have needed to stay hidden very long or be hidden very well but then the ceasefire came along and complicated his lifeand maybe saved ours if this isnt all a load ofdreck to make us spin our wheels gruver said if anielewicz admitted i know one other place we ought to check bertha fleishman said the cemetery and the ghetto field south of it gruver and anielewicz both looked at her the words hung in the air of the dingy meeting room if i were doing the job thatsjustwhere id put it mordechai exclaimed cant think of a better placequiet at night already plenty of holes in the ground especially in the ghetto field bertha said catching fire at a suggestion she had first made casually thats where so many mass graves are from when the sickness and starvation were so bad who would pay any special attention to one more hole in the ground there who would notice anybody coming to dig one more hole in the ground in the middle of the night solomon gruvers big head bobbed up and down yes if its anywhere thats where we need to start looking i agree mordechai said bertha thats wonderful if youre not right you deserve to be he frowned after he said that working it through to make sure hed really given her the compliment hed intended to his relief he decided he had she smiled back at him when she smiled she wasnt plain and anonymous any more she still wasnt pretty not in any ordinary sense of the word but her smile gave her an odd kind of beauty she quickly sobered well need to have fighters along not just diggers she said if we do find this hideous thing people are going to want to take it away from us as far as that goes lizards are people here youre right again anielewicz said draining the nerve gas out of the nazi bomb made us dangerous nuisances if we have this bomb we wont be nuisances well have real power not while it sits in a hole in the ground gruver said as long as its there the most we can do is blow ourselves up with our enemies thats better than masada but its not good its not good enough if we can get the bomb out and put it where we want it nowthats good for us anyhow yes mordechai breathed visions of might floated through his headhurting the lizards and getting the nazis blamed for it smuggling the bomb into germany and taking real revenge for what thereich had done to the jews of poland reality intervened as reality has a way of doing theres only the one bombif theres any bomb there at all we have to find it and we have to get it out of the ground if its thereyoure right on both counts solomonbefore we can even think about what to do with it if we go with half the fighters in the ghetto other people will know were after something even if they dont know what gruver said we dont want that do we find it first then see if we can get it out without raising a fuss if we cant he shrugged well walk through the cemetery and the ghetto field anielewicz declaredif he was commander here hewould command if we find something then we figure out what to do next and if we dont find anythinghe too shrugged wrylythen we figure out what to do next and when someone asks us what were doing there what do we tell him gruver asked he was good at finding problems not so good at solutions it was a good question anielewicz scratched his head they had to say something and something both innocuous and convincing bertha fleishman said we can tell people were looking for areas where no one is buried so we can dig in those places first in case we have to fight inside the city anielewicz chewed on that then nodded as did solomon gruver mordechai said its better than anything i could have come up with it might not even be a bad idea for us to do that one of these days though there are so many graves there id bet there isnt much open space to be had too many graves bertha said quietly both men nodded again the cemetery and the ghetto field next to it lay in the northeastern corner of the jewish district of lodz the fire station on lutomierska street was in the southwest two maybe two and a half kilometers away it started to drizzle as mordechai bertha and solomon gruver tramped across the ghetto anielewicz looked gratefully up at the heavens the rain would give them more privacy than they might have had otherwise a whitebearded rabbi chanted the burial service over a body wrapped in a sheet wood for coffins had long since become a luxury behind him amid a small crowd of mourners stood a stooped man with both hands pressed up to his face to hide his sobs was it his wife going into the increasingly muddy ground mordechai would never know he and his companions paced among the headstonessome straight some tilting drunkenlylooking for freshly turned earth some of the grass in the cemetery was knee high it had been poorly tended ever since the germans first took lodz almost five years before would it fit in an ordinary grave gruver asked pausing before one that couldnt have been more than a week old i dont know anielewicz answered he paused no maybe i do ive seen regular bombs the size of a man airplanes can carry those what the germans have has to be bigger were wasting our time here then the fireman said we should go down to the ghetto field where the mass graves are no bertha fleishman said where the bomb isthat doesnt have to look like a grave you know they could have made it seem as if theyd repaired the sewer pipes or something of that sort gruver scratched at his chin then finally nodded youre right an old man in a long black coat sat by one of the graves a battered fedora pulled down low over his face against the drizzle he closed the prayerbook hed been reading and put it in his pocket when mordechai and his friends went by the fellow nodded but did not speak a walk through the cemetery didnt show any new excavations of any sort bigger than ordinary graves gruver had an itoldyouso look in his eye as he mordechai and bertha headed south into the ghetto field grave markers got fewer there and many of them as solomon gruver had said marked many corpses thrown into one pit men women and children dead of typhus of tuberculosis of starvation perhaps of broken hearts grass grew on a lot of those mounds too things were not so desperate now with the nazis gone times had improved all the way up to hard and burials were by ones not by companies at a time bertha paused in front of one of the large interments the board that was all the marker the poor souls down there would ever get had fallen over when she stooped to straighten it she frowned whats this she said mordechai couldnt see what this was till he came close when he did he whistled softly under his breath a wire whose insulator was the color of old wood ran the length of the board held to it by a couple of nails pounded in and bent over the nails were rusted so they didnt stand out the wire stopped at the top of the memorial board but kept going from the bottom there it disappeared into the ground wireless aerial he muttered and yanked at it it didnt want to come out he pulled with all his strength the wire snapped sending him stumbling backwards he flailed his arms to keep from fallingsomethings under there that doesnt belong he said cant be solomon gruver rumbled the grounds not torn up the way it his voice trailed away he got down on his hands and knees heedless of what the wet grass would do to his trousers will you look at this he said in tones of wonder mordechai anielewicz got down beside him he whistled again the grass has been cut out in chunks of sod and then replaced he said running his hand along one of the joins if it had rained harder and melted the mud that would have been impossible to notice in genuine admiration anielewicz murmured they made a jigsaw puzzle and put it back together here when they were done wheres the dirt gruver demanded as if anielewicz had stolen it himself i dont care if they didnt bury the thing deep they were going to have some left overand they would have spilled it to either side of the grave as they were digging not if they set canvas down first and tossed the spoil onto that mordechai said gruver stared at him he went on you have no idea how thorough the nazis can be when they do something like this look at the way they camouflaged their antenna wire they dont take chances on having something this important spotted if the board hadnt fallen over bertha fleishman said in a dazed voice ill bet it was like that when the ss bastards got here anielewicz told her if you hadnt had the keen eyes to notice the aerial he made silent clapping motions and smiled at her she smiled back she really was quite extraordinary when she did that he thought wheres the dirt solomon gruver repeated intent on his own concerns and not noticing the byplay between his comrades what did they do with it they couldnt have put it all back you want me to guess mordechai asked at the firemans nod he went on if i were running the operation i would have loaded it onto the wagon they used to bring in the bomb and hauled it away throw canvas over it and nobody would think twice i think youre right i think thats just what they did bertha fleishman looked over to the detached wire the bomb cant go off now i dont think so he answered or anyhow they cant set it off by wireless now which is good enough for us if they hadnt needed the aerial they wouldnt have put it there thank god she said so gruver said sounding as if he still didnt believe it we have a bomb of our own now if we can figure out how to fire it anielewicz said if we can get it out of here without the lizards noticing if we can move it so that if god forbid we have to we can fire it without blowing ourselves right out of this world if we can do all that we have a bomb of our own now sweat burst from rance auerbachs forehead come on darling penny summers breathed you can do it i know you can you done it before remember come onbig strong man like you can do whatever he wants auerbach gathered himself gasped grunted and with an effort that took everything he had in him heaved himself upright on his crutches penny clapped her hands and kissed him on the cheek lord thats hard he said catching his breath maybe he was lightheaded maybe just too used to lying flat on his back but the ground seemed to quiver like pudding under him his arms werent strong either supporting so much of his weight with his armpits was anything but easy his wounded leg didnt touch the ground and wouldnt for a long time yet getting around with one leg and two crutches felt like using an unsteady photographic tripod instead of his proper equipment penny took a couple of steps back from him toward the opening of the lizards shelter tent come on over to me she said dont think i can yet auerbach answered this was only the third or fourth time hed tried the crutches starting to move on them was as hard as getting an old nashs motor to turn over on a snowy morning oh i bet you can penny ran her tongue across her lips shed gone from almost completely withdrawn to just as brazen with next to nothing in between when he had time to think auerbach wondered if they were two sides of the same coin he didnt have time to think right this second penny went on you come on over to me now and tonight ill what she said shed do would have sent a man hurt a lot worse than auerbach over to her in nothing flat maybe less he let himself fall forward hopped on his good leg brought the crutches up to help keep his balance straightened did it again and found himself by her side from outside the tent a dry voice said thats the best incentive for physical therapy ive ever heard auerbach almost fell down penny squeaked and turned the color of the beets that grew so widely in colorado by the way his own face heated auerbach was pretty sure he was the same color uh sir its not he began but then his tongue stumbled to a halt even more readily than his poor damaged carcass had the doctor stepped into the tent he was a young fellow a stranger not one of the lizards pow medicos he looked from auerbach to penny summers and back again look folks i dont care if it is or it isntnone of my business any which way if it makes you get up and walk soldier thats what matters to me he paused judiciously in my professional opinion an offer like that would make lazarus get up and walk penny blushed even redder than she had before auerbach had had more experience with army docs they did their level best to embarrass you and their level best was usually pretty damn good he said uhwho are you sir the doctor had gold oak leaves on his shoulder straps my names hayward smithson the doctor paused rance gave his own name and rank after a minute penny summers stammered out her name too her right one auerbach wouldnt have been surprised to hear her come up with an alias on the spot major smithson went on now that the ceasefires in place im down from denver inspecting the care the lizards have been giving to wounded prisoners i see youve got a set of governmentissue crutches there good yes sir auerbach said his voice was still weak and thin and raspy as all get out as if hed smoked about fifty packs of camels in the last hour and a half i got em day before yesterday they came in a week ago penny said but ranceuh captain auerbachhe wasnt able to do much in the way of moving around till just the other day auerbach waited for smithson to make a crack about pennys having done most of the moving before then but to his relief smithson had mercy maybe nailing her again would have been too much like shooting fish in a barrel instead the doctor said you took one in the chest and one in the leg eh and theyve pulled you through yes sir auerbach said theyve done their best by me the lizards and the people theyve got helping them sometimes ive felt kind of like a guinea pig but im here and on my pinswell on one pin anywayinstead of taking up space in the graveyard back of town more power to you captain smithson said he pulled a spiralbound notebook and a fountain pen out of his pocket and scribbled a note to himself i have to say ive been favorably impressed with what ive seen of the lizards facilities theyve done what they could for the men theyve captured theyve treated me okay auerbach said firsthand thats all i can tell you i got outside this tent yesterday for the very first time what about you miss uh summers major smithson asked captain auerbachs not the only patient youve nursed back to health i expect auerbach devoutly hoped he was the only patient penny had nursed back to health that particular way he didnt think she noticed the possible double entendre there and was just as well pleased she didnt seriously she answered oh no sir i get all over this encampment they do their best i really think so thats also the impression ive had smithson said nodding they do their bestbut i think theyre overwhelmed he sighed wearily i think the whole world is overwhelmed are therethat many wounded sir auerbach asked like i said i havent seen much outside of this tent except through the doorflap since they put me here and nobodys told me theres all that many wounded pows here in karval he sent penny a look that might have been accusing to the other nurses to the harassed human doctors to the lizards he was just another injured pow hed thought he meant something to her but smithson said its not just wounded soldiers captain its he shook his head and didnt try to explain instead he went on youve been upright a good while now why dont you come outside and have a look for yourself youll have a doctor at your elbow and who knows what miss summers will do for you or to you or with you after that penny blushed for a third time auerbach wished he could give the doctor a shot in the teeth for talking about a lady that way in front of her but he couldnt and he was curious about what was happening in the world beyond the tent and he had been standing here a while without keeling over okay sir lead on he said but dont lead too fast on account of im not going to win any races on these things hayward smithson and penny held the tent flaps open so he could come out and look around he advanced slowly when he got out into the sunshine he stood blinking for a moment dazzled by its brilliance and some of the tears that came to his eyes had nothing to do with the sun but with his own delight at being unconfined if only for a little while come along smithson said positioning himself to auerbachs left penny summers immediately put rance between her and the doctor a slow procession they made their way along the open track the lizards had left between the rows of tents sheltering wounded men maybe there werentthat many wounded men but it still made for a pretty fair tent city every so often auerbach heard a man moaning inside one of those domes of the bright orange slick stuff the lizards used once a doctor and nurse hurried into one a good ways away on the dead run that didnt look good not even slightly smithson clicked his tongue between his teeth the way hed been talking though half of denver might have been here and that didnt look to be so auerbach was puzzled till he came to the intersection of his lane with one that ran perpendicular to it he hadnt come so far before when you looked down that crossroad in one direction you saw what was left of the tiny town of karval in two words not much when you looked the other way you got a different picture he couldnt guess how many refugees inhabited the shantytown out beyond the lizards neat rows of tents its like a brandnew hooverville he said staring in disbelief its worse than a hooverville smithson said grimly most hoovervilles they had boxes and boards and sheet metal and what have you to build shacks with not much of that kind of stuff here in the middle of nowhere but people have come anyhow from miles and miles around ive watched that happen penny said nodding theres food and water here for prisoners so people come and try to get some when the lizards have anything left over they give a little thats moren people can get anywheres else so they keep comin lord auerbach said in his ruined voice its a wonder they havent tried coming into the tents and stealing what the lizards wouldnt give em remember that gunfire the other night penny asked a couple of em was tryin just that the lizards shot em down like they was dogs i dont reckon any more folksll try sneakin in where the lizards dont want em to sneaking up on the lizards isnt easy anyhow dr smithson said auerbach looked down at himself at the muchbattered excuse for a carcass hed be dragging around for the rest of his life matter of fact i found out about that sneaking away from ems not so easy either they have lizard doctors in denver looking out for their people that we caught penny asked yesits all part of the ceasefire smithson answered i almost wish i could have stayed in town to watch them work too if we dont keep fighting them theyre going to push our medicine forward a hundred years in the next ten or fifteen we have so much to learn he sighed but this is important work too we may even be able to set up a largescale prisoner exchange wounded men for wounded lizards that would be good auerbach said then he looked over at penny whose face bore a stricken expression she wasnt a wounded prisoner he turned his head back toward smithson would the lizards let noncombatants out i dont know the doctor answered i can understand why youd want to find out though if this comes offand there are no guaranteesill see what i can do for you hows that thank you sir auerbach said and penny nodded auerbachs gaze went toward the canvas tents and old wagons and shelters of brush housing the americans whod come to karval to beg for crumbs of the lizards largesse thinking about that brought home like a kick in the teeth what the war had done to the country he looked down at himself you know something im not so bad off after all the buzz of a humanbuilt airplane over cairo sent moishe russie hurrying to the windows of his hotelroom cell for a glimpse sure enough there it was painted lemon yellow as a mark of truce i wonder whos in that one he said to rivka youve said molotov is already here she answered so that leaves von ribbentropshe and her husband both donned expressions redolent of distasteand the american foreign minister whatever his name is marshall moishe said and they call him secretary of state for some reason he soaked up trivia valuable or not like a sponge the booklearning in medical school had come easy for him because of that had his interest lain elsewhere he would have made a formidableyeshivabucher he turned back to the window the yellow airplane was lower now coming in for a landing at the airfield east of town thats not a dakota marshall would fly in one of those i think so its probably a german plane rivka sighed if you see ribbentrop tell him every jew in the world wished akholeriyeh on him if he doesnt know that by now hes pretty stupid moishe said tell him anyway his wife said you get a chance like that you shouldnt waste it the drone of the motors faded out of hearing rivka laughed a little uneasily that used to be a sound you took for granted hearing it here hearing it nowits very strange moishe nodded when the truce talks started the lizards tried to insist on flying everyone here in their own planes i suppose they didnt want the nazisor anyone elsesending a plane full of bombs instead of diplomats atvar was very confused when the germans and the russians and the usa all said no the lizards havent really figured out what all negotiating as equals means theyve never had to do it before theyre used to dictating it shall be done rivka said in the aliens hissing language anyone who was around them long learned that phrase she dropped back into yiddish thats the way they think its about the only way they think i know moishe answered he made as if to pound his head against the walloy do i know through loudspeakers the muezzins called the faithful to prayer cairo slowed down for a little while another bright yellow airplane flew low over the city making for the airport that is a dakota rivka said coming up to stand by moishe somarshall is here too now so he is moishe answered he felt as if he were setting up a game of chess with a friend back in warsaw and had just put the last couple of pieces where they belonged now we see what happens next what will you tell atvar if he summons you to ask what you think of these people rivka asked moishe used a few clicks and pops himself the exalted fleetlord you mean besidesgeh in drerd rivka gave him a dangerous look one that meantstop trying to be funny he sighed and went on i dont know im not even sure why he keeps bringing me in to question me i wasnt rivka made urgent shushing motions moishe shut up hed started to say something likei wasnt anywhere near the caliber of those people rivka was right the lizards surely monitored everything he said if they hadnt figured out for themselves how small a fish he was no point telling them being thought more important than he was might improve both his treatment and his life expectancy and sure enough a couple of hours later zolraag walked into the hotel room and announced you are summoned to the quarters of the exalted fleetlord atvar you will come immediately it shall be done superior sir moishe answered the lizards certainly hadnt bothered learning to negotiate with him as an equal they told him where to go and what to do and he perforce did it the guards didnt seem quite so eager to shoot him if he so much as stumbled as they had when the lizards first brought him to cairo they still turned out for him full force though and transported him from hither to yon and back again in one of their armored personnel carriers as uncomfortable a mode of travel for a human being as any ever invented while they were on their way to atvars headquarters zolraag remarked your insights into the political strategies likely to be utilized are of interest to the exalted fleetlord having headed a notempire yourself you will be prepared to empathize with these other tosevite males thats certainly better than being shot moishe said gravely he was glad hed had practice holding his face straight yes hed headed up the jews of poland for a little while after the lizards came till he found he could no longer stand to obey them to imagine that that put him in the same class as hitler and hull and stalinwell if you could imagine that you had a vivid and wellstocked imagination from what hed gathered anything smaller than the entire surface of a planet was too small for the lizards to bother making what they reckoned subtle distinctions in size the distinctions were anything but subtle to him but hethank god was not a lizard atvar rounded on him as soon as he came into the machinestrewn suite the fleetlord occupied if we make an agreement with these males is it your judgment they will abide by it he demanded using zolraag to translate his words into polish and german this to a man whod watched poland carved up between germany and the ussr after theyd made their secret agreement and then watched them go to war against each other less than two years later in spite of the agreement still formally in force picking his words with care moishe answered they willso long as they see keeping the agreement as being in their interest the fleetlord made more mostly unintelligible noises again zolraag interpreted for him you are saying then that these tosevite males are altogether unreliable by any standard with which the lizard was familiar the answer to that had to beyes moishe didnt think putting it so baldly would help end the fighting he said you have much to offer that would be in their interest to accept if you and they can agree upon terms for your males leaving their countries for instance they would probably keep any agreements that would prevent the race from coming back as hed seen with zolraags efforts in warsaw the lizards had only the vaguest notions of diplomacy things that seemed obvious even to a human being who had no governmental experienceto moishe himself for instancesometimes struck the aliens with the force of revelation when they got the point and sometimes despite genuine effort they didnt get it as now atvar said but if we yield to the demands of these importunate tosevites we encourage them to believe they are our equals after a moment he added and if they believe themselves equal to us soon they will come to think they are superior that last comment reminded moishe the lizards werent fools they might be ignorant of the way one nation treated with another but they werent stupid ignoring the difference could be deadly dangerous carefully moishe said what you have already done should make it plain to them that they are not your superiors and what they have done to you should show you that you are not so much superior to them as you thought you were when you came to this world when neither side is superior isnt talking better than fighting after zolraag had translated what hed said atvar fixed russie with what certainly looked like a baleful stare the fleetlord said when we came to tosev we thought you big uglies would still be the spearflinging barbarians our probes of this planet had shown you to be we discovered very soon we were not so superior as we had thought we would be when we went into cold sleep it is the most unpleasant discovery the race has ever known he added an emphatic cough nothing stays the same here not for long moishe said some of the polish jews had tried to pretend time had stopped to live their lives as they had before the enlightenment and the industrial revolution blew across europe theyd even thought they were succeedingtill the nazis brought all the worst parts of the modern world to bear against them moishe had spoken with more than a little pride that wasnt what he touched off in the fleetlord atvar replied in considerable agitation this is what is wrong with you tosevitesyou are too changeable maybe we can make peace with you as you are now but will you be as you are now when the colonization fleet reaches this world it is to be doubted what will you be what will you want what will you know i have no answers to these questions exalted fleetlord moishe said quietly he thought of poland which had had a large army well trained to fight the sort of war fought on that frontier a generation before against thewehrmacht the poles had fought with utmost bravery and utmost futilityand had gone down to ignominious defeat in a couple of weeks while they werent looking the rules had changed i have no answers to these questions either atvar said unlike the polish army he at least sensed the possibility of change it frightened him even more than it had frightened the pious jews who tried to turn their backs on voltaire and darwin and marx edison and krupp and the wright brothers the fleetlord went on i have to be certain this world will be intact and ready for settlement by the males and females of the colonization fleet the question you must ask yourself exalted fleetlord moishe said is whether you would sooner have part of the world ready for settlement than all of it in ruins truth atvar said but there is also another question if we let you tosevites retain part of the land surface of this world on your own terms now for what will you use that base between now and the arrival of the colonization fleet do we end one war now but lay the eggs for another larger one later you are a tosevite yourself your people have done little but fight one war after another how do you view this moishe supposed he should have been grateful the fleetlord was using him for a sounding board rather than simply disposing of him hewas grateful but atvar had given him another essentially unanswerable question he said sometimes war does lead to war the last great war we fought thirty years ago now it started sowed the seeds for this one but a different peace might have kept the new war from happening might the fleetlord echoed unhappily i cannot affordmight i must have certainty and there is none on this world even you big uglies cannot come into concord here take this poland where you lived where zolraag was provincelord the deutsche claim it because they had it when the race came to tosev the sssr claims half of it because of an agreement they say the deutsche violated and the local tosevites claim it belongs to neither of these notempires but to them alone if we leave this poland place to whom shall we in justice restore it poland exalted fleetlord is a place i hope you do not leave moishe said even though you did everything you could to undermine our presence there atvar said you may have the egg moishe russie or you may have the hatchling you may not have both i understand that moishe said but poland is a special case all cases on tosev are specialjust ask the big uglies involved in them atvar answered one more reason to hate this world xvi vyacheslav molotov gulped down yet another glass of iced tea pausing halfway through to swallow a couple of salt tablets the heat of cairo was unbelievable enervating even deadly dangerous one of his aides an nkvd colonel named serov who spoke the lizards language as fluently as any human being in the soviet union had collapsed of heatstroke and was now recovering in an airconditioned hospital suite the english had set up to treat similarly afflicted folk of their own nation neither the semiramis hotel in which the soviet delegation and other human diplomats were staying nor shepheards in which the negotiations were being conducted enjoyed the benefits of airconditioning here the soviets kept enough fans going at all times to make paperweights mandatory to prevent a blizzard of documents from blowing around the suite even if it did move the air the fans blew remained hot no fans blew during the negotiations the lizards as molotov had discovered to his dismay when he was first flown up to one of their spaceships to discuss the war with their fleetlord reveled in heat before colonel serov was renderedhors de combat hed reported that the lizards here continually talked about how fine the weather wasalmost like their home they said as far as molotov was concerned they were welcome to it he reached in the drawer and pulled out a dark blue necktie as he fastened the collar button of his shirt he allowed himself a small martyred sigh here in cairo he envied the lizards their body paint knotting the tie he reflected that he still had an advantage over most of his colleagues his neck was thin which let air circulate under his shirt a lot of the soviets were beefy types with double chins and rolls of fat at their napes for them closed collar and cravat were even worse torment just for a moment he wondered how the ussrs lizard prisoners enjoyed the labor camps northeast of leningrad and up in the northern reaches of siberia he wondered how they would enjoy them come february as much as i enjoy cairo now he murmured checking in the dresser mirror to make sure the tie was straight satisfied he put on his hat and went downstairs to wait for the lizard vehicle that would take him to todays negotiating session his interpreter a birdlike little man named yakov donskoi was pacing about the hotel lobby he brightened on seeing molotov arrive good morning comrade foreign commissar he said with molotov here he had a set place to be and set things to do good morning yakov beniaminovich molotov answered and looked pointedly at his wristwatch the lizards were exactly at the appointed hour an armored personnel carrier pulled up in front of the hotel he kept expecting the lizards to be late and they never were donskoi said i have been down for some time von ribbentrop left about forty minutes ago marshall about twenty before that i do not know the lizards did not transport human diplomats together molotov supposed that was to keep them from conferring with one another the tactic had its advantages for them the humans didnt dare speak too freely among themselves at the hotel either the nkvd had swept molotovs room for listening devices he was sure thegestapo the oss and other intelligence agencies had done likewise for their principals quarters he was equally sure they hadnt found everything there was to find the lizards had too long a lead on humanity in that kind of technology he turned to donskoi tell the lizards it would bekulturny if they provided seats in this machine suitable to the shape of our fundaments donskoi addressed the lizard with the fanciest body paint not in his own language but in english the human tongue in which the talks were being conducted it was the native tongue of george marshall and anthony eden while von ribbentrop and shigenori togo were fluent in it eden and togo were not formal conference participants but the lizards had let them come and sit in the lizard replied to donskoi in english that sounded to molotov not much different from the aliens native tongue the interpreter however made sense of it that was his job he translated for molotov strukss says no he says we should be honored they deign to talk with us at all and that we have no business asking for anything more than they provide tell him he isnye kulturny molotov said tell him he is an ignorant barbarian that even the nazis whom i hate know more of diplomacy than his people that his superior will hear of his insolence tell him in just those words yakov beniaminovich donskoi spoke in english the lizard made horrible spluttering noises then spoke english himself donskoi said he says with the air of one granting a great concession he will see what arrangements can be made i take this to mean he will do as you say ochen khoroshomolotov said smugly in some ways the lizards were very much like his own people if you convinced one of them you had superior status he would grovel but he would ride roughshod over you if he thought himself of the higher rank the armored vehiclefar quieter and less odorous than its humanmade equivalent would have beenpulled to a stop in front of shepheards hotel where atvar made his headquarters molotov found it amusing and illuminating that the lizard should choose for his own the hotel that had had the highest status under the british colonialist regime he got out of the lizard personnel carrier with nothing but relief not only was the seat wrong for his backside it was even hotter in there than on the street strukss led him and yakov donskoi to the meeting room where the other human representatives sat sweltering as they waited for atvar to condescend to appear george marshall drank from a glass of iced tea and fanned himself with a palmfrond fan hed probably brought from home molotov wished hed thought to bring or acquire such a convenience himself marshalls uniform remained crisp starchy through donskoi molotov asked the egyptian servant hovering in the corner of the room for iced tea for himself the servant not surprisingly was fluent in english with a bow to molotovwho kept his face still despite despising such selfabnegationhe hurried away soon to return with a tall sweating glass molotov longed to press it to his cheek before he drank but refrained a fan was suitably decorous that was not atvar came in a few minutes later accompanied by a lizard in far less elaborate body paint his interpreter the human delegates rose and bowed the lizard interpreter spoke to them in english that seemed more fluent than that which strukss used yakov donskoi translated for molotov the fleetlord recognizes the courtesy and thanks us for it von ribbentrop muttered something in german a language donskoi also understood he says they should show us more courtesy now and they should have shown us more courtesy from the beginning like a lot of the things the nazi foreign minister said that was both true and useless von ribbentrop was on the heavyset side and with his tight collar and fair skin looked rather like a boiled ham with blue eyes as far as molotov was concerned he had the wits of a boiled ham too but the interests of the popular front kept him from saying so donskoi translated word for word as eden asked atvar am i to construe that my presence means the race extends the same ceasefire to great britain as to my cobelligerents who sit at this table with me the handsome englishmanchurchills alter egohad asked that question before without getting a straight answer for it now atvar spoke the lizard interpreter having already translated edens question turned the fleetlords reply into english the fleetlord says in his generosity the truce applies to you in your island it does not apply to any of the other lands of your empire across the seas from you and this island anthony eden though not bad at keeping his face straight was not in molotovs class the soviet foreign minister had no trouble seeing his anguish as stalin had predicted the british empire was dead having been pronounced so by a childsized greenbrown creature with sharp teeth and swiveling eye turretsin spite of your heroics the dialectic consigns you to the ashheap of history molotov thoughteven absent the lizards it would have happened soon george marshall said for us fleetlord the ceasefire is not enough we want you off our soil and we are prepared to hurt your people more if you dont leave of your own free will and be quick about it the germanreich expresses this same demand von ribbentrop declared sounding pompous even when molotov did not understand his words till they were translated sweating and blustering he went on thefuhrer insists on the full restoration of all territory under the benevolent dominion of thereich and its allied states including italy at the time of your peoples arrival from the depths of space as far as molotov was concerned no territory had been under thebenevolent dominion of thereich that however was not his primary concern before atvar could reply to von ribbentrop he spoke up sharply much of the territory claimed by the germans was illegally seized from the peaceloving workers and peasants of the soviet union to whom as comrade stalin the general secretary of the communist party of the ussr rightly requires it must be restored if you tosevites cannot settle where the boundaries of your empires and notempires lie why do you expect us to do it for you atvar demanded von ribbentrop turned to glare at molotov who looked back stonily the two of them might have been allied against the lizards but were not and would never be friends perhaps shigenori togo said this situation being so irregular both human states might agree to allow the race to continue to possess some territory between them serving as a buffer and aiding in the establishment and maintenance of peace all over our world subject to negotiation of the precise territory to be retained this may in principle be acceptable to the soviet union molotov said given the germans prowess not merely with explosivemetal bombs but also with nerve gas and longrange guided rockets stalin wanted a buffer between the soviet border and fascist germany since the race is already in poland no von ribbentrop interrupted angrily this is not acceptable to thereich we insist on a complete withdrawal and we will go back to war before we accept anything less so thefuhrer has declared thefuhrer has declared a great many things anthony eden said with relish the sudetenland is the last territorial claim i have to make in europe for instance that a declaration is made does not necessarily test its veracity when thefuhrer promises war he delivers von ribbentrop replied a better comeback than molotov had looked for from him george marshall coughed then said if we are throwing quotations around gentlemen let me give you one from ben franklin that fits the present circumstances we must all hang together or assuredly we shall all hang separately to molotov yakov donskoi murmured the translation then added the pun in english i cannot reproduce in russian never mind the pun molotov answered tell them for me that franklin is right and that marshall is right as well if we are to be a popular front against the lizards a popular front we must be which removes the pleasure of sniping at one another he waited till donskoi had rendered that into english then went on for the interpreters ears alone if i am to be deprived of the pleasure of telling von ribbentrop what i think of him i want no one else to enjoy itbut you need not translate that yes vyacheslav mikhailovich the interpreter said dutifully then he stared at the foreign commissar had molotov made a joke his face denied it but then molotovs face always denied everything ussmak lifted the axe swung it and felt the jar as the blade bit into the tree trunk hissing with effort he pulled it free then swung again at this rate felling the tree would take about forever and he would end up starving for no better reason than that he could not satisfy the quotas the big uglies of the sssr insisted on setting for males of the race those quotas were the same ones they set for their own kind before this ignominious captivity when ussmak had thought of the big uglies theugly part was uppermost in his mind now he realized how much thebig mattered all the tools the guards gave him and his fellow males were designed for their kind not his they were large and heavy and clumsy in his hands the males of the sssr did not care unending toil on not enough food was making prisoners die off one after another the guards did not care about that either a brief moments fury made ussmak take a savage hack at the tree we should have kept on refusing to work and made them kill us that way he said they mean for us to die anyhow truth said another male nearby you were our headmale why did you give in to the russkis if we had hung together we might have got them to do what we wanted more food for less work sounds good to me like ussmak he had lost so much flesh his skin hung loose on his bones i feared for our spirits ussmak said i was a fool our spirits will be lost here soon enough no matter what we do the other male paused a moment in his own workand a guard raised a submachine gun and growled a warning at him the guards didnt bother learning the language of the racethey expected you to understand them and woe betide you if you didnt the male picked up his axe again as he swung it he said we could try another work stoppage we could yes ussmak said but his voice sounded hollow even to himself the males of barracks three had tried once and failed they would never come together as a group enough to try again ussmak was morbidly certain of it thiswas what he had bought for mutiny against his superiors no matter how addled he had thought them even their worst was a hundred a thousand a million times better than the superiors for whom he now toiled had he known then what he knew nowhis mouth dropped open in a bitter laugh that was what old males always told young ones just embarking on their lives ussmak wasnt old not even counting the time hed spent in cold sleep traveling to tosev but he had a hardwon store of bitter knowledge acquired too late work the guard snapped in his own language he didnt add an emphatic cough it was as if hed only made a suggestion ignoring that suggestion though might cost you your life ussmak hammered away at the tree trunk chips flew but the tree refused to fall if he didnt chop it down they were liable to leave him out here all day the star tosev stayed in the sky almost all the time here at this season of the tosevite year but still could not warm the air much past cool he hit two more solid strokes the tree tottered then toppled with a crash ussmak felt like cheering if the males quickly sawed the trunk into the sections the guards required they might yet gainalmostenough to eat emboldened he used his halting russki to ask the guard ceasefire truth is the rumor had reached the camp with a fresh batch of big ugly prisoners maybe the guard would feel well enough inclined to him for having cut down the tree to give him a straight answer and so it proved the big ugly saidda he took some crumbled leaves from a pouch he wore on his belt rolled them in apiece of paper lighted one end and sucked in smoke at the other the practice struck ussmak as corrosive to the lung it couldnt possibly have been so pleasant so enjoyable as say tasting ginger we go free ussmak asked the tosevite prisoners said that could happen as part of a ceasefire they knew far more about such things than ussmak did all he could do was hope chtothe guard said what you gofree he paused to suck more smoke and to blow it out in a harsh white cloud then he paused again this time to make the barking noises big uglies used for laughter free yougavno ussmak knew that meant some sort of bodily waste but not how it applied to his question the guard proceeded to make it perfectly brutally clear you go freenyet never he laughed louder the tosevite equivalent of laughing wider as if to reject the very idea he leveled his submachine gun at ussmak now work ussmak worked when at last the guards suffered the males of the race to return to their barracks he trudged back with dragging stride half exhaustion half despair he knew that was dangerous hed already seen males whod lost hope give up and die in short order but knowing something was dangerous was different from being able to keep from doing it they had made their work norm for the day the ration of bread and salted sea creature the big uglies doled out was not enough to keep them going through another day of grinding toil but it was what they got ussmak toppled into his hard comfortless bunk as soon as he had eaten sleep dropped over him like a thick smothering black curtain he knew he would not be fully recovered when the males were routed out come morning tomorrow would be just the same as today had been maybe a little worse not likely to be any better so would the day after that and the day after that and the day afterthat free once more the guards barking laughter seemed to reverberate from his heating diaphragms as sleep overcame him he thought how sweet never waking up would be ludmila gorbunova looked to the west not in the hopes of catching a glimpse of the evening star in any case venus was lost in the skirts of the sun but longingly nonetheless from right beside her elbow a voice said you would fly another mission into thewehrmacht lines in a moment wouldnt you she jumped she hadnt heard ignacy come up she also felt no small anger and embarrassment wearing her heart on her sleeve was the last thing she wanted to do especially when it was given to a nazi panzer colonela germanpanzer colonel she thought correcting herself that sounded better to herand besides could any man who called a medal hed won hitlers fried egg be a dedicated fascist she doubted it though she knew her objectivity was suspect you do not answer me ignacy said she wanted to pretend the guerrilla leader hadnt spoken but she couldnt very well do that besides since his russian was better than anyone elses hereabouts ignoring him would cut her off from the person to whom she could most readily speak so she replied with something that was true but not responsive what i want does not much matter with the ceasefire in place between the germans and the lizards i will have no occasion to fly over there will i if the germans have any sense they will not do anything to make the lizards lose patience with them and start fighting again if the germans had any sense would they be germans ignacy returned ludmila would not have cared to take piano lessons from such a cynical man perhaps the war had revealed to him his true calling after pausing a moment to let the jab sink in he went on the germans will i think encourage unrest in the parts of poland they do not control do you really ludmila embarrassed herself all over again by how eager she sounded ignacy smiled it was not altogether pleasant that curl of lips not in a plump face in a land full of thin ones not when it didnt quite light up his eyes she hadnt told him anything of her meeting with jager as far as she was concerned that was her business and nobody elses but whether shed told him or not he seemed to have drawn his own conclusions most of them disconcertingly accurate he said as a matter of fact i am trying to arrangeever so discreetly of courseto get my hands on some german antitank rockets would you be interested in transporting those if i succeed i will do whatever is required to bring victory to the workers and peasants of poland against the alien imperialists ludmila answered sometimes taking refuge in the rhetoric shed learned from childhood was comforting using it also gave her more chance to think she said are you certain flying those rockets in would be the best way to get them moving them along back roads and paths might be easier and safer ignacy shook his head the lizards have been patrolling rear areas much more aggressively than they did when they fought major battles along the front also the nazis do not want anyone capturing antitank rockets that could be shown to have entered poland after the ceasefire began that might give the lizards the excuse they need to end the truce but if you flew the rockets back here without having them noticed on the ground we could use them as we like who could prove when we acquired them i see ludmila said slowly and she did the nazis had an interest in playing it close to the vest while ignacy she suspected didnt know how to play it any other way and what happens if i am shot down trying to deliver the rockets to you i shall miss both you and the aircraft the guerrilla leader answered she gave him a dirty look he stared back his face bland and blank she got the idea he wouldnt miss her much even if she did give him an air force of sorts she wondered if he wanted to get her airborne to be rid of her but soon decided that was foolish he could pick many more direct ways of disposing of her ones that didnt involve the precious fieselerstorch the nod he gave her was almost a bow a bourgeois affectation hed preserved even here in a setting most emphatically proletarian be assured i shall let you know the instant i have word that this plan goes forward that i have persuaded the german authorities here there is no danger to it and now i leave you to enjoy the beauties of the sunset itwas beautiful even if she bridled at the way he said that crimson and orange and brilliant gold filled the sky drifting clouds seemed to be aflame and yet though the colors were those of fire and blood they didnt make her think of war instead she wondered what she ought to be doing when in a few short hours the sun rose again where was her life going tomorrow and next month and next year she felt torn in two part of her wanted to go back to the soviet union in any way she could the pull of therodina was strong but she also wondered what would become of her if she returned her dossier already had to be suspect because she was known to have associated with heinrich jager could she justify going off to a foreign countrya country under occupation by the lizards and the nazisat the behest of a german general shed been in poland for months too without making any effort to come back till now if the nkvd happened to be in a suspicious mood as the nkvd so often happened to be the nasty skinny face of colonel boris lidov flashed in front of her mind theyd ship her to agulag without a second thought the other half of her wanted to run to jager not away from him she recognized the impracticalities there too the nazis had thegestapo instead of the nkvd they wouldnt just be looking at jager through a magnifying glass either theyd rake her over the coals too maybe more savagely than the peoples commissariat for the interior would she tried to imagine what happened to nazis who fell into the nkvds hands that same sort of shuddersome treatment had to await soviet citizens in the grip of thegestapo realistically she couldnt go east as realistically she couldnt go west either that left staying where she was also an unpalatable choice ignacy was hardly the sort of leader shed follow into battle with a song on her ups though if she did she thought wryly shed better sing in tune as she stood and thought and watched gold faded out of the sky now the horizon was orange with crimson creeping down the dome of heaven toward it some of the clouds off in the east were just floating dumplings not fire incarnate night was coming ludmila sighed what id really like she said though nothing and no one was likely to pay her any heed is to go off somewheremaybe by myself maybe if he wants with heinrichand forget this whole war and that it ever started she laughed and while im wishing for that why dont i wish for the moon from out of the sky too ttomalss paced back and forth on the concrete floor of his cell his toeclaws clicked over the hard rough surface he wondered how long he would take to wear a groove in the floor or maybe even wear through it so he could dig a hole in the dirt below and escape that depended on how thick the concrete was of course if the tosevites had put down only a thin layer of the stuff he shouldnt need more than oh three or four lifetimes not much light came in through the small narrow windows of the cell those windows were set too high for him to see out through them and too high for any big ugly to see in he had been told that if he raised an outcry he would be shot without a chance to explain or make amends he believed the warning it was very much in character for the tosevites hed tried to keep track of days by scratching tally marks in the wall it hadnt worked hed forgotten a day or thought he had and then scratched two marks instead of one the next morning only to decide afterwards that maybe he hadnt forgotten after all which rendered his makeshift calendar inaccurate and therefore useless all he knew now was that hed been here forever sensory deprivation he said if no one outside could hear him he was allowed to talk to himself yes sensory deprivation that is the experiment the accursed female liu han has in mind for me how long can i experience nothing and still keep my wits unaddled i do not know i hope i do not find out was a slow descent into madness watching yourself take each step down the road preferable to being quickly killed he didnt know that either he was even beginning to wonder whether he would have preferred to suffer the physical torment against which the big uglies proving their barbarity had no scruples if thinking youd sooner be tortured wasnt a step on the road to madness what was he wished hed never gone into cold sleep aboard a starship wished hed never seen tosev wished hed never turned his eye turrets toward liu han wished hed never watched the hatchling emerge all slimy and bloody and disgusting from the genital opening between her legs and wishedoh how he wished hed never taken that hatchling to see what he could learn from it those wishes werent going to come to fruition either he cherished them all the same no one could deny they were utterly rational and sensible the products of a mind fully in touch with reality he heard a sharp metallic click and felt the building in which he was confined vibrate ever so slightly he heard footfalls in the chamber outside his door and heard the outer door to the building close someone fumbled at the lock that confined him it opened too with a click different from that of the one on the outer door with a squeak of hinges that needed oil the inner door swung open ttomalss all but quivered with joy at the prospect of seeing speaking with anyone even a big ugly superiorfemale he said when he recognized liu han she did not answer right away she carried a submachine gun in one hand and her hatchling on her other hip ttomalss had trouble knowing the hatchling was the creature he had studied when the little tosevite had been his hed put no cloths on it except the necessary ones around its middle that kept its wastes from splashing indiscriminately all over his laboratory area nownow liu han had decked the hatching in shiny cloth of several bright colors the hatchling also wore bits of ribbon tied in its black hair the adornment struck ttomalss as foolish and unnecessary all hed ever done was make sure the hair was clean and untangled why bother with anything more the hatchling looked at him for some time did it remember he had no way to know his research had been interrupted before he could learn such thingsand in any case he couldnt be sure how long hed been imprisoned here mama the hatchling saidin chinese without an interrogative cough a small hand went out to point toward ttomalss this again it spoke in the tosevite language without any hint it had begun to learn that of the race this is a little scaly devil liu han answered also in chinese she repeated herself little scaly devil little scaly devil the hatchling echoed the words were not pronounced perfectly but even ttomalss whose own chinese was far from perfect had no trouble understanding them good liu han said and twisted her rubbery face into the expression big uglies used to convey amiability the hatching did not give that expression back it hadnt done that so much in the latter part of the time when ttomalss had had it perhaps because it had had no models to imitate liu hans grimace left her features liu mei hardly smiles she said for this i blame you ttomalss realized the female had given the hatchling a name reminiscent of her ownfamily relationships are critical among tosevites he reminded himself becoming for a moment a researcher once more not a captive then he saw liu han was waiting for his reply relying on the patience of a big ugly waiting with a submachine gun did not do he said it maybe so superior female perhaps the hatchling needed a pattern for this expression i cannot smile so i could not be that pattern we do not learn these things until we encounter them you should not have had to learn them liu han answered you should not have taken liu mei from me in the first place superior female i wish i had not taken the hatchling ttomalss said and backed that with an emphatic cough the hatchlingliumei he reminded himselfstirred in liu hans arms as if reminded of something it had once known ttomalss went on i cannot undo what i did though it is too late for that it is too late for many things liu han said and he thought she meant to kill him on the spot then liu mei wiggled again liu han looked down at the small tosevite that had come from her body but it is not too late for all things do you see how liu mei is becoming a proper human person wearing proper human clothes speaking proper human language i see that yes ttomalss answered she is very he didnt know how to sayadaptable in chinese and cast around for a way to get across what he meant when the way she lives changes she changes with it very fast tosevite adaptability had addled the race ever since the conquest fleet came to tosev ttomalss saw no reason to be surprised at one more example even in the gloomy little cell liu hans eyes glittered do you remember when you gave me back my baby you gloated because you had raised it as a little scaly devil and it would not become a proper human being that is what you said i seem to have been wrong ttomalss said i wish i had never said any such thing we of the race are always finding out we do not know as much about you tosevites as we thought we did that is one of the reasons i took the hatchling to try to learn more one of the things you have learned is that you should not have done it liu han snapped truth ttomalss exclaimed and used another emphatic cough i brought liu mei here to show you how wrong you were liu han said you little scaly devils you do not like to be wrong her tone was mocking ttomalss had learned enough of the way tosevites spoke to be sure of that she went on mocking still you were not patient enough you did not think enough about what would happen when liu mei was among proper human beings for a while truth ttomalss said again this time quietly what a fool he had been to scoff at liu han without regard for possible consequences as the race had so often with the big uglies as a whole he had underestimated her and as the race had he was paying for it i will tell you something else liu han saidif it wasnt going to be sensory deprivation apparently she would do everything she could to make him feel dreadful you scaly devils have had to agree to talks of peace with several nations of human beings because you were being so badly hurt in the fighting i do not believe you ttomalss said she was his only source of information herewhy shouldnt she tell all sorts of outrageous lies to break his morale i do not care what you believe it is the truth even so liu han answered her indifference made him wonder if perhaps hed been wrongbut it might have been intended to do that she continued you little devils still go on oppressing china before too much time has passed you will learn this too is a mistake you have made a great many mistakes here and all over the world it may be so ttomalss admitted but i make no mistakes here he lifted a foot and brought it down on the concrete floor when i can do nothing i can make no mistakes liu han let out several barks of tosevite laughter in that case you will stay a perfect male for a long time liu mei started to fuss liu han jiggled the hatchling back and forth calming it more readily than ttomalss had ever managed i wanted to show you how very wrong you were think of that as part of your punishment you are more clever than i ever thought ttomalss said bitterly was it worse to contemplate nothing or his own stupidity he did not know not yet here in this cell he expected he would have plenty of time to find out tell this to the other little devilsif i ever let you go liu han said she backed out of the chamber keeping him covered with the submachine gun till she had shut the door the click of the lock closing over the hasp had a dreadfully final sound a moment later he heard her close the outer door too he stared after her if she ever let him go he realized she had told him that precisely to have it prey on his mind would she wouldnt she could he persuade her if he could how worrying about it would addle his mind but how could he keep from worrying about it she wasmuch more clever than hed ever thought sam yeager stood on first base after cracking a single to left in a seat in back of the firstbase dugout barbara clapped her hands nice poke said the first baseman a stocky corporal named grabowski but then you played ball didnt you pro ball i mean years and years sam answered id be doing it yet if the lizards hadnt come ive got full dentures top and bottom so the army wouldnt touch me till everything went to hell in a handbasket yeah ive heard other guys say the same kind of thing grabowski answered nodding but youre used to playing in a fancy park like this is what i was getting at yeager hadnt thought of ban johnson field as a fancy park it was just a ballyard like hundreds of other minorleague parks hed been through covered grandstand bleachers out in back of left and right advertisements pasted on the boards of the outfield fencesfaded peeling tattered advertisements now because nobody in hot springs was advertising much of anything these days grabowski went on hell for me this is like what the polo grounds must feel like city parksre as hot a ball as i ever played all depends on how you look at things sam said crackthe guy up behind him hit a bouncer to short sam lit out for second full tilt in a pickup game like this you couldnt be sure the shortstop would make the play but he did he shoveled the ball to second smooth as you please ristin who was playing second base brushed the bag with one foot then got it between him and the oncoming yeager the lizard dropped down sidearm for the throw to first giving sam the choice between sliding and taking the ball right between the eyes sam hit the dirt the ball thumped into grabowskis mitt when the gi whod hit the grounder was still a stride from the bag yer out yelled the dogface making like an ump yeager got up and brushed off his chinos pretty double play he told ristin before he trotted off the field cant turn em any better than that i thank you superior sir ristin answered in his own language this is a good game you tosevites play when sam got back to the bench he grabbed for a towel and wiped his sweaty face you played ball in hot springs in summertime you might as well have playedin the hot springs yeager sergeant sam yeager somebody called from the stands it didnt sound like somebody from the crowdif you called three four dozen people a crowd it sounded like somebody looking for him he stuck his head out of the dugout yeah what is it a fellow with a first lieutenants silver bar on each shoulder said sergeant i have orders to fetch you back to the hospital right away yes sir sam said glad the lieutenant wasnt getting shirty about the casual way hed answered let me get out of my spikes and into street shoes he did that in a hurry telling his teammates youll have to find somebody else for left now he took off his baseball cap and stuck his service cap on his head he wished his pants werent dirty but he couldnt do anything about that now shall i come too barbara asked as he climbed up into the stands and headed toward the lieutenant she shifted jonathan from her lap to her shoulder and started to get up but yeager shook his head you may as well stay hon he answered they wouldnt be looking for me like this if they didnt have some kind of duty in mind he saw the officer had his hands on his hips a bad sign i better get moving he said and did just that they went back to the army and navy general hospital at a fast walk that was close to a trot ban johnson field was in whittington park out at the west end of whittington avenue they went past the old catholic school on whittington down past bathhouse row on central and over reserve to the hospital whats gone wrong anyhow yeager asked as they went inside the lieutenant didnt answer but hustled him along to the offices reserved for top brass sam didnt like that he wondered if he was in trouble and if he was how much trouble he was in the farther down the row of fancy offices they got the bigger he figured the trouble might be a door with a frosted glass windowpane had a cardboard sign taped to it base commandants office yeager gulped he couldnt help it hawkins sir the lieutenant said saluting a captain sitting at a desk full of papers reporting with sergeant yeager as ordered thank you hawkins the captain got up from his desk ill tell major general donovan hes here he ducked into the office behind the antechamber when he emerged a moment later he held the door open go on in sergeant yes sir yeager wished to high heaven the lieutenant had given him a chance to clean up a little before he presented himself to a twostar general even if they did call donovan wild bill he wasnt likely to appreciate sweat and grime and an aroma that clearly announced yeager had been running around in hot muggy weather no help for that now though sam walked through the door which the adjutant closed behind him saluting he said sergeant samuel yeager sir reporting as ordered at ease sergeant donovan said as he returned the salute he was a fit sixty more or less with blue eyes and the map of ireland on his face he had a couple of cans worth of fruit salad on his chest one of those ribbons was blue with white stars yeagers eyes widened slightly you didnt pick up a congressional medal of honor for playing jacks before he got over that surprise donovan gave him another one saying in fluent lizard talk i greet you tosevite male who so well understands the males of the race i greet you superior sir yeager answered automatically using the same language he dropped back into english to continue i didnt know you knew their lingo sir im supposed to know everything thats my job donovan answered without the slightest hint he was joking he made a wry face cant be done of course its still my job which is why i sent for you sir yeager saidi dont know from nothin donovan shuffled through papers on his desk when he found the one he wanted he peered at it through the bottoms of his bifocals you were transferred here from denver along with your wife and the two lizards ullhass and ristin that right without waiting for yeagers answer he went on that was before you started making an infielder out of ristin hey uh yes sir sam said maybe donovandid know everything okay the general said you were attached to that denver project for a good long while werent you even when they were back in chicago that right this time he did let sam nod before continuing which means you probably know more about atomic bombs than anybody else in arkansas that right i dont know aboutthat sir yeager said im no physicist or anything like that uh sir am i allowed to talk about this stuff with you they worked real hard on keeping it a secret youre not only allowed to youre ordered toby me donovan answered but im glad to see you concerned with security sergeant because im going to tell you something you are absolutely forbidden to mention outside this room except as i may later direct have you got that yes sir sam said by the way the base commandant spoke hed get a blindfold if he messed that one up nobodyd bother wasting a cigarette on him okay donovan repeated by now youre probably wondering what the hell is going on and why i dragged you in here that right no answer seemed necessary donovan charged ahead reasons real simplewe just got one of these atomic bombs delivered here and i want to know as much about it as i can find out heresir sam stared thats what i told you it set out from denver before the ceasefire was announced and after that it just kept going makes sense when you think about it hey thing must have come on one devil of a roundabout route to get here at all they werent about to stop it halfway leave it somewhere in nomansland for the lizards to find if they got lucky its our baby now okay sir i see that i guess yeager answered but didnt some people from denver come with it people who know all about it they did like hell donovan said security againyou dont want people like that captured thing came with typed instructions on how to arm it a timer and a radio transmitter thats it orders boiled down to get it to a target back away run like hell and fire when ready gridley donovan would have been just about starting to shave when that spanishamerican war slang entered the language sam hadnt heard anybody use it for years he said ill tell you whatever i can sir but like i said beforeuh as i said before which was what he got for being married to barbara i dont know everything there is to know and as i told you sergeant thatsmy job not yours so talk donovan leaned forward in his chair ready to listen intently sam told him everything he knew about the theory and practice of atomic bombs some of that was gleaned from science articles in the regrettedastounding from the days before the lizards came more came from what he remembered of interpreting for enrico fermi and the other metallurgical laboratory physicists and from what hed picked up while they talked among themselves donovan took no notes at first that irked yeager then he realized the general didnt want to put anything in writing anywhere that told him how seriously donovan was taking the whole business when he ran down donovan nodded thoughtfully and said okay sergeant thanks very much that clears up one of my major worries i dont have to worry about the damn thing going off under my feet any more than i do with any other piece of ordnance i didntthink so but with a weapon that new and that powerful i wasnt what youd call eager to risk my neck on what might have been my own misunderstanding that makes sense to me sir yeager agreed okay next question youre in the rocket business too with goddard can we load this thing on a rocket and shoot it where we want it to go it weighs ten tons give or take a little no sir sam answered at once next rocket we make thatll throw one tonll be the first dr goddards working on ways to scale up what weve got but his voice trailed away but hes sick and who knows how long hell last donovan finished for him and who knows how long itll take to build a big rocket even if it gets designed hey okay any chance of making atomic bombs small enough to go on the rockets we have thatd be the other way to solve the problem i plain dont know sir if it can be done i bet theyre working on it back in denver but i have no idea whether they can do it or not okay sergeant thats a good answer donovan said if i told you how many people try to make like bigshots and pretend they know more than they dowell hell i dont need to burden you with that youre dismissed if i need to pick your brain some more about this miserable infernal device ill call you again i hope i dont i hope you dont too sam said thatd mean the ceasefire broke down he saluted and left donovans office the major general hadnt gigged him about his uniform after allpretty good fellow he thought the german major at the port of kristiansand shuffled through an enormous box of file cards bagnall george he said pulling one out your pay number please bagnall rattled it off in english then repeated it more slowly in german dankesaid the majorhis name was kapellmeister though he had a singularly unmusical voice now flight engineer bagnall have you violated in any way the parole you furnished to lieutenantcolonel hocker in paris year before last have you that is taken up arms against the germanreich in pursuance of the war existing between germany and england prior to the coming of the lizards speak only the truth i have the answer before me no i have not bagnall answered he almost believed kapellmeister that a nazi officer in an outoftheway norwegian town could at the pull of a card come up with the name of the man to whom hed given that parole or even the fact that hed given such a parole struck him as teutonic efficiency run mad apparently satisfied the german scribbled something on the card and stuck it back in the file then he went through the same rigmarole with ken embry having done that he pulled out several more cards and rattled off the names on themthe names of the lancaster crewmen with whom embry and bagnall had formerly servedat jerome jones before asking which of the above are you none of the above sir jones replied and gave his own name and pay number major kapellmeister went through his file every third englishman is named jones he muttered after a couple of minutes he looked up i do not find a jones to match you however very well before you may proceed to england you must sign a parole agreeing not to oppose the germanreich in arms at any further time if you are captured while you violate or after you have violated the terms of the parole it will go hard for you do you understand i understand what you said jones answered i dont understand why you said it arent we allies against the lizards there is at present a ceasefire between thereich and the lizards kapellmeister answered his smile was unpleasant there may eventually be a peace at that time our relations with your country will have to be defined would you not agree the three englishmen looked at one another bagnall hadnt thought about what the ceasefire might mean in purely human terms by their expressions neither had embry or jones the more you looked at things the more complicated they got jones asked if i dont sign the parole what happens you will be treated as a prisoner of war with all courtesies and privileges extended to such prisoners the german major said jones looked unhappier yet those courtesies and privileges were mighty thin on the ground give me the bloody pen he said and scrawled his name on the card kapellmeister handed him danke schonmajor kapellmeister said when he returned card and pen for now as you rightly point out we are allies and you have been treated as such thus far is this not so jones had to nod as did bagnall and embry the journey across german ally finland sweden neutral but ever so polite to german wishes and germanheld norway had been fast efficient and as pleasant as such a journey could be in times of hardship as kapellmeister disposed of the card bagnall had a vision of copies of it making journeys of their own to every hamlet where nazi soldiers and nazi bureaucrats stood guard if jerome jones ever stepped off the straight and narrow anywhere thereich held sway he was in trouble once the parole was in his hands and in his precious file box though the major went from testy to affable you are free now to board the freighterharald hardrada you are fortunate in fact loading of the ship is nearly complete and soon it will sail for dover been a long time since weve seen dover bagnall said then he asked do the lizards make a habit of shooting up ships bound for england they havent got a formal ceasefire with us after all kapellmeister shook his head it is not so the informal truce they have with england appears to prevent them from doing this the three englishmen left his office and walked down to the dock where theharald hardrada lay berthed the docks smelled of salt and fish and coal smoke german guards stood at the base of the gangplank one of them ran back to kapellmeister to check whether the raf men were to be allowed aboard he came back waving his hand and the rest of the guards stood aside the inefficiency the germans showed there made bagnall feel better about the world he had to share with his comrades a cabin so small it lacked only a coat of red paint to double as a telephone box but that didnt bother him after so long away from england he would cheerfully have hung himself on a hatrack to get home that didnt mean he wanted to spend much time in the cabin though he went back out on deck as soon as hed pitched his meager belongings on a bunk uniformed germans were rolling small sealed metal drums up the gangplank when the first one got to theharald hardrada one of the soldiers tipped it onto its flat end it was neatly stencilednorsk hydro vemork whats in there bagnall asked pointing by now his german was fluent enough that for a few words or a few sentences at a time he could be mistaken for a native speaker though not one from his listeners home region whatever that happened to be the fellow in the coalscuttle helmet grinned at him water he answered if you dont want to tell me then just dont say bagnall grumbled the german laughed at him and set the next barrel identically stenciled on its end beside the first irked bagnall stomped away his feet clanging on the steel plates of the deck the nazi damn him laughed louder he and his comrades stowed away the barrels somewhere down in the cargo hold where bagnall didnt have to look at them he told the story to embry and jones both of whom chaffed him without mercy for letting a german get the better of him thick black coal smoke poured from the stack of theharald hardrada as it pulled out of kristiansand harbor for the journey across the north sea to england even if bagnall was going home it was a voyage he could have done without hed never been airsick not in the worst evasive maneuvers but the continual pounding of big waves against the freighters hull sent him springing for the rail more than once his comrades didnt twit him for that they were right there beside him so were some of the sailors that made him feel if not better at least more resigned to his fate misery loves company had a lot of truth to it lizard jets flew over the freighter a couple of times so high that their vapor trails were easier to see than the aircraft themselves theharald hardrada had ackack guns mounted at bow and stern along with everyone else aboard bagnall knew they were essentially useless against lizard planes but the lizards did not come down for a closer look or on a strafing run ceasefires formal and otherwise held bagnall had spied several cloudbanks off to the west identifying each in turn as england he was seeing with a landlubbers eye and one half blinded by hope before long the clouds would shift and destroy his illusion then at last he caught sight of something out there that did not move or dissolve yes that is the english coast a sailor answered when he asked its beautiful bagnall said the estonian coast had gained beauty because he was sailing away from it this one did so because he was approaching actually the two landscapes looked pretty much alike low flat land slowly rising up from a sullen sea then off in the distance he spotted the towers of dover castle right down by the ocean that made the homecoming feel real in a way it hadnt before he turned to embry and jones who stood beside him i wonder if daphne and sylvia are still at the white horse inn can but hope ken embry said amen jones echoed would be nice to have a lady friend who wouldnt just as soon shoot you down as look at you let alone sleep with you his sigh was full of nostalgia i remember there are women like that though its been so long im beginning to forget a tug came out to help nudge theharald hardrada up against a pier in a surprisingly crowded harbor as soon as shed been made fast in her berth with lines fore and aft as soon as the gangplank snaked across to the dock a horde of tweedy englishmen with the unmistakable look of boffins swarmed aboard at a dead run and besieged every uniformed german they could find with a single question sometimes in english sometimes in german where is it wheres what bagnall asked one of the men hearing an undoubtedly british voice the fellow answered without hesitation why the water of course bagnall scratched his head one of the cooks ladled soup into david nussboyms bowl he sank the ladle all the way down to the bottom of the big iron pot it came out full of cabbage leaves and bits of fish the ration loaf he handed nussboym was full weight or even a trifle over it was still black bread coarse and hard to chew but it was warm from the oven and smelled good his tea was made from local roots and leaves and berries but the glass the cook gave him had plenty of sugar so it was palatable enough and he had plenty of room in which to eat clerks and interpreters and other politicals got fed ahead of the common run ofzek nussboym recalled with distaste the mob scenes in which hed had to defend with his elbows the space in which he was sitting and recalled a couple of times when hed been elbowed off a bench and onto the planks of the floor he dug in with every mouthful of soup wellbeing flowed through him it was almost as if he could feel himself being nourished he sipped at his tea savoring every morsel of dissolved sugar that flowed over his tongue when your belly was full life looked goodfor a while nudavid aronovich how do you like talking with the lizards asked moisei apfelbaum colonel skriabins chief clerk he spoke in yiddish to nussboym but used his name and patronymic anyhow which would have been an affectation anywhere in the ussr but seemed particularly absurd in thegulag where patronymics fell by the wayside even in russian nevertheless nussboym imitated his style compared to freedom moisei solomonovich it is not so much compared to chopping logs in the woods he did not go on he did not have to go on apfelbaum nodded he was a skinny little middleaged fellow with eyes that looked enormous behind steelrimmed spectacles freedom you do not need to worry about not here thegulag has worse things than logging believe me a man could be unlucky enough to dig a canal one can be unlucky as i say or one can be clever good to be clever dont you think i suppose so nussboym answered the clerks and cooks and trusties who made thegulag functionfor the whole system would have fallen apart in days if not hours had the nkvd had to do all the workwere better company in many ways than thezeks of the labor gang to which hed formerly been attached even if a lot of them were dedicated communistsplus royaliste que le roi ran through his mind for they upheld the principles of marx and engels and lenin after other men espousing those same principles had sent them here they were for the most part educated men men with whom he had far more in common than the common criminals who were the dominant force in his work gang he did easier work now he got more food for it he should have beenwell not happy youd have to bemeshuggeh to be happy hereas contented as he could be in the context of thegulag hed always been a man who believed in getting along with authority whatever authority happened to be the polish government the nazis the lizards now the nkvd but when thezeks with whom hed formerly worked were shambling out to the forest for another day of toil the looks they gave him chilled his bloodmene mene tekel upharsin floated up from his days at thechederthou art weighed in the balance and art found wanting he felt guilty for having it easier than his former comrades although he knew intellectually that interpreting for the lizards made a far greater contribution to the war effort than knocking down yet another pine or birch you are not a communist apfelbaum said studying him through those greatly magnified eyes nussboym shook his head admitting it the clerk said yet you remain an idealist maybe i do nussboym said he wanted to addwhat business is it of yours he kept his mouth shut though he was not such a fool as to insult a man who had such easy intimate access to the camp commandant the calluses on his hands were starting to soften but he knew how easily he could once more grow accustomed to the feel of axehandle and saw grip this will not necessarily work to your advantage apfelbaum said nussboym shrugged if everything worked to my advantage would i be here apfelbaum paused to sip at his glass of ersatz tea then smiled his smile was charming so much so that nussboym distrusted it at sight the clerk said again i remind you that there are worse things than what you have now you have not even been required to denounce any of the men of your old gang have you no thank god nussboym said he hurriedly added not that i ever heard any of them say anything that deserved denunciation after that he devoted himself to his bowl of soup to his relief apfelbaum did not press him further but he was not altogether surprised when two days later colonel skriabin summoned him to his office and said nussboym we have heard a rumor that concerns us i wonder if you can tell me whether there is any truth to it if it concerns the lizards comrade colonel i will do everything in my power nussboym said hoping to deflect the evil moment he had no luck perhaps he had not really expected to have any luck skriabin said unfortunately it does not it is reported to us that the prisoner ivan fyodorov has on more than one occasion uttered antisoviet and seditious sentiments since coming to this camp you knew this man fyodorov i believe he waited for nussboym to nod before going on can there be any truth to this rumor nussboym tried to make a joke of it comrade colonel can you name me even onezek who hasnot said something antisoviet at one time or another that is not the issue skriabin said the issue is discipline and examples now i repeat myself have you ever heard the prisoner fyodorov utter antisoviet and seditious sentiments answer yes or no he spoke in polish and kept his tone light and seemingly friendly but he was as inexorable as a rabbi forcing ayeshivabucher through the explication of a difficult portion of the talmud i dont really remember nussboym said whenno was a lie andyes was trouble what were you supposed to dotemporize was all that came to mind but you said everyone said such things skriabin reminded him you must know whether the man fyodorov was a part of everyone or an exception damn you moisei solomonovichnussboym thought aloud he said maybe he was but maybe he wasnt too as i told you i have trouble remembering who said what when i have never noticed this trouble when you speak of the lizards colonel skriabin said you are always most accurate and precise he thrust a typewritten sheet of paper across the desk to nussboym here just sign this and all will be as it should nussboym stared at the sheet in dismay he could make out some spoken russian because many of the words were close to their polish equivalents staring at characters from a different alphabet was something else again what does it say he asked suspiciously that on a couple of occasions you did hear the prisoner ivan fyodorov utter antisoviet sentiments nothing more skriabin held out a pen to him he took it but did not sign on the line helpfully provided colonel skriabin looked sorrowful and i had such hope for you david aronovich his voice tolled out nussboyms name and patronymic like a mourning bell with a couple of quick jerks that had almost nothing to do with his brain nussboym signed the denunciation and shoved it back at skriabin he realized he should have shouted at skriabin the second the nkvd man tried to get him to betray fyodorov but if youd always believed in getting along with authority you didnt think of such things till that first fateful second had passed and then it was too late skriabin took the paper and locked it in his desk nussboym got another full bowl of soup at supper that night he ate every drop of it and every drop tasted like ashes in his mouth xvii atvar wished he had acquired the habit of tasting ginger he needed something anything to fortify himself before going in to resume dickering with a chamber full of argumentative big uglies turning both eye turrets toward kirel he said if we are to have peace with the tosevites it appears we shall have to make the most of the concessions upon which they originally insisted truth kirel said in a melancholy voice they are certainly the most indefatigable argufiers the race has ever encountered that they are atvar twisted his body in distaste even the ones with whom we need not conduct actual negotiationsthe british and the nipponesego on with their unending quibbles while two chinese factions both insist they deserve to be here though neither seems willing to admit the other does madness what of the deutsche exalted fleetlord kirel asked of all the tosevite empires and notempires theirs seems to be presenting the race with the greatest number of difficulties i admire your gift for understatement atvar said acidly the envoy from deutschland seems dim even for a tosevite the notemperor he serves is by all appearances as addled as an unfertilized egg left half a year in the sunor do you know a better way to interpret his alternating threats and cajolery without waiting for an answer the fleetlord went on and yet of all these tosevite empires and notempires the deutsche may well be the most technologically advanced can you unravel this paradox for me tosev is a world full of paradoxes kirel replied among so many one more loses its capacity to surprise this is also a truth atvar let out a weary hissing sigh one or another of them is liable to prove a calamity i fear i admit i do not know which one though and very much wish i did pshing spoke up exalted fleetlord the time appointed for continuation of these discussions with the tosevites is now upon us thank you adjutant atvar said though he felt anything but grateful they are a punctual species that much i will say for them even after so long in the empire the hallessi would show up late for their own cremations if they could his mouth dropped open in wry amusement now that i think on it so would i if i could regretfully atvar turned his eye turrets away from the males of his own kind and with his interpreter entered the chamber where the tosevite representatives awaited him they rose from their seats as he entered a token of respect tell them to sit down so we can get on with it atvar said to the interpreter tell them politely but tell them the translator a male named uotat turned his words into english the tosevites returned to their chairs again in their usual pattern marshall the american male and eden his british counterpart always sat close together though eden was not really a formal participant in these talks then came molotov from the sssr and von ribbentrop of deutschland like eden togo of nippon was more an observer than a negotiator we begin atvar said the tosevite males leaned forward away from the rigidly upright position they preferred most of the time and toward one more like that the race used this was atvar had learned a sign of interest and attention he went on in most cases we have agreed in principle to withdraw from the territory controlled at the time of our arrival on tosev by the usa the sssr and deutschland we have done this in spite of claims we have received from several groups of big uglies offering the view that the sssr and deutschland did not rightfully possess some of these territories your notempires are the ones strong enough to treat with us this gives your claims priority von ribbentrop sat straight again and brushed an imaginary speck of dust from the material of the outer cloth covering of his torso he is smug uotat said to atvar using an eye turret to point to the deutsch envoy he is a fool atvar replied but you need not tell him that if you are a fool you derive no profit from hearing as much i now resume with the matter at hand because we are gracious we also agree to withdraw our males from the northern territory that seems to be not quite a part of either the usa or britain the toponym escaped him marshall and eden supplied it together canada canada yes atvar said the simple truth was that most of the place was too cold to be worth much to the race under any circumstances marshall also seemed to think it was for all practical purposes part of the usa though it had a separate sovereignty atvar did not fully understand that but it was to him a matter of small import now to the issue on which these talks paused in our last session atvar said the issue of poland poland in its entirety must be ours von ribbentrop said loudly no other solution is possible or acceptable so thefuhrer has declared uotat added this is the title of the deutsch notemperor i know atvar answered i have no room whatever for discussion on this matter molotov spoke he was the only tosevite envoy who did not use english his interpreter translated for uotat this view is unacceptable to the workers and farmers of the sssr who have an immediate claim on the eastern half of this region one which i personally brokered with the deutsch foreign minister and also a historic claim to the entire country atvar turned his eye turrets away from both contentious big uglies neither of them would budge on the issue atvar tried a new tack perhaps we could let the poles and the jews of poland form new notempires of their own between those of your notemperors molotov did not reply von ribbentrop unfortunately did as i have said thefuhrer finds this intolerable the answer is no the fleetlord wanted to let loose with a long hissing sigh but refrained the big uglies were undoubtedly studying his behavior as closely as he and his staff of researchers and psychologists were examining theirs he tried a different course perhaps then it is appropriate for the race to remain sovereign over this place called poland in saying that he realized he was meeting the ambitions of the tosevite moishe russie it wasnt what hed had in mind but he saw now that russie did indeed understand his fellow big uglies this may in principle be acceptable to the soviet union depending on the precise boundaries of said occupation molotov said in a low voice uotat added his own comment to that the tosevites of the sssr find the deutsche no more pleasant neighbors than we do truth atvar said amused but unwilling to show it to the big uglies von ribbentrop turned his head and looked at molotov for several seconds before giving his attention back to atvar if that wasnt anger the deutsch representative was displaying all the races studies of tosevite gestural language were worthless but von ribbentrop spoke without undue passion i am sorry to have to keep repeating myself but this is not acceptable to deutschland or to thefuhrer poland had been under and should return in its entirety to deutsch sovereignty that is not acceptable to the soviet union molotov said the soviet union had control over not a particle of polish soil at the time whenthe situation changed von ribbentrop retorted he turned back to atvar poland must be returned to deutschland thefuhrer has made it absolutely clear he will accept nothing less and warns of the severest consequences if his just demands are not met does he threaten the race atvar asked the deutsch envoy did not reply atvar went on you deutsche should remember that you hold the smallest amount of territory of any party to these talks it is conceivable that we could destroy you without wrecking the planet tosev to the point where it would be unsuitable for the colonization fleet when it arrives your intransigence here is liable to tempt us to make the experiment that was partly bluff the race did not have the nuclear weapons available to turn all deutschcontrolled territory to radioactive slag however delightful the prospect was the big uglies however did not know what resources the race had and what it did not atvar hoped then his threat would strike home marshall and togo bent over the papers in front of them and both began to write furiously the fleetlord thought that might represent agitation eden and molotov sat unmoving atvar was used to that from molotov this was his first prolonged dealing with eden who struck him as competent but who was also in a weak bargaining position von ribbentrop said then the war may resume fleetlord when thefuhrer states his determination in regard to any issue you may take it as certain that he means what he says am i to inform him that you flatly reject his reasonable requirement if i do so i warn you that i cannot answer for what will happen next his short blunttipped tongue came out and moistened the everted mucus membranes that ringed his small mouth that was the races researchers insisted a sign of nervousness among the big uglies but why was von ribbentrop nervous because he was running a bluff himself at the orders of his notemperor or because he feared the deutsch leader really would resume the war if his insistence on having poland was rejected atvar picked his words with more care than he would have imagined possible when speaking to a tosevite tell this male that his demand for all of poland is refused tell him further that as far as the race is concerned the ceasefire between our forces and those of the deutsche may continue while we address other issues and tell him that if the deutsche are the first to break the ceasefire the race will retaliate forcefully do you understand yes fleetlord i understand von ribbentrop replied through uotat as i have said thefuhrer is not in the habit of making threats he does not mean i shall convey your response to him then we shall all await his reply the big ugly licked those soft pink lips again i am sorry to say it but i do not think we will be waiting long major mon handed nieh hoting a cup filled with gently steaming tea thank you nieh said inclining his head the japanese was by his standards acting courteously nieh still thought of him as an imperialist eastern devil but one could be polite about such things mori returned the half bow i am unworthy of your praise he answered in his rough chinese the japanese hid their arrogance behind a facade of false humility nieh preferred dealing with the little scaly devils they made no bones about what they were have you decided which course would be most expedient for you to take nieh asked looking around the japanese camp he thought that should be obvious the eastern devils were ragged and hungry and starting to run low on the munitions that were their only means of coercing supplies from the local peasants the arrival of the little scaly devils had cut them off from the logistics train that ran back to japan they were better disciplined than a band of bandits but not much stronger but after their major nodded he did not give the reply nieh had hoped to hear i must tell you we cannot join what you call the popular front the little devils do not formally stop their war against us but they also do not fight us now if we attack them here who can say what that will provoke them to elsewhere in the world you join with them in effect against the progressive forces of the chinese people major mori laughed at him he stared he had thought of many possible reactions from the japanese but had not expected that one mori said you have made an alliance with the kuomintang i see that must be what transforms them from reactionary counterrevolutionary running dogs into progressives a nice magic trick i must say a mosquito buzzed down and bit nieh on the back of one wrist smashing it gave him a moment to collect his thoughts he hoped he was not turning red enough for the japanese to notice at last he said compared to the little scaly devils the reactionaries of the kuomintang are progressive i admit it though i do not love them compared to the little devils even you japanese imperialists are progressive i admit that too arigatothe major said giving him a politely sardonic seated bow we have worked together against the scaly devils before nieh knew he was pleading and knew he should not plead but the japanese man for man were better soldiers than either the troops of the peoples liberation army or the forces of the kuomintang having moris detachment as part of the local popular front would give the little scaly devils a great deal of added grief and so nieh went on the artillery shells with which you supplied me were put to good use and caused the little devils many casualties personally i am glad this is so mon replied but at the time you got those shells from me the little devils and japan were at war with each other that does not now seem to be the case if we join in attacks against the scaly devils and are identified any chance of peace may be destroyed i will not do that without a direct order from the home islands no matter what my feelings are nieh hoting got to his feet i will return to peking then unspoken was the warning that if the japanese kept him from returning or shot him they would find themselves rather than the little devils the focus of chinese efforts from then on even though he was but an eastern devil mori had enough subtlety to catch the warning he too rose and bowed once more to nieh as i say i wish you personal good luck against the little scaly devils but when set against the needs of the nation personal wishes must give way he would have phrased it differently had he been a marxist leninist but the import was the same i bear you no personal illwill either nieh said and left the japanese camp in the countryside for the hike back to peking dirt scuffed under his sandals as he trudged along crickets chirped in the undergrowth dragonflies skimmed by darting and twisting with maneuvers impossible for any fighter plane farmers and their wives bent their backs in fields of wheat and millet endlessly weeding had nieh been an artist instead of a soldier he might have paused a while to sketch what he was thinking about though had nothing to do with art he was thinking major moris japanese had lingered close by peking too long already the little scaly devils if they ever thought to do it could use the japanese against the popular front in the same way the kuomintang had used warlord forces against the peoples liberation army that would let the little devils fight the chinese without committing their own troops to the effort he had nothing personal against the japanese major no but because he respected mori as a soldier he found him all the more worrisome he had the potential to be more dangerous with the razorsharp logic of the dialectic that led to an ineluctable conclusion major moris pocket would have to be liquidated as soon as possible it might even work out for the best nieh said aloud no one to hear him but for a couple of ducks paddling in a pond if the little scaly devils were subtle enough to understand indirect hints the disappearance of possible allies would give them the idea that the popular front would not only prosecute a campaign against them but would do so vigorously he reached peking in the middle of the night off in the distance gunfire rattled someone was striking a blow for the progressive cause what are you doing here at this hour a human gate guard asked coming in to see my cousin nieh showed a false identity card and handed the guard a folded banknote with it the guard returned the card but not the money pass in then he said gruffly but if i see you coming around again so late i am going to decide youre a thief then it will go hard for you he brandished a spiked truncheon reveling in his tiny authority nieh had all he could do not to laugh in the fellows face instead he ducked his head as if in fright and hurried past the guard into peking the roominghouse was not far away when he got there he found liu han chasing liu mei around the otherwise empty dining room liu mei was squealing with glee she thought it a wonderful game liu han looked about ready to fall over she shook a finger at her daughter you go to sleep like a good girl or maybe i will give you back to ttomalss liu mei paid no attention by liu hans weary sigh she hadnt expected liu mei to pay any attention nieh hoting said what will you do with the little scaly devil called ttomalss i dont know liu han said its good to have you back but ask me hard questions another time right now im too tired to see straight let alone think straight she ran and kept liu mei from overturning a chair on top of herself impossible daughter liu mei thought it was funny has the scaly devil been punished enough nieh persisted he could never be punished enough not for what he did to me not for what he did to my daughter not for what he did to bobby fiore and other men and women whose names i do not even know liu han said fiercely then she calmed somewhat why do you ask because it may be useful before long to deliver either the little devil himself or his body to the authorities his kind have set up here in peking nieh answered i wanted to know which you would prefer that would be a decision for the central committee not for me alone liu han said frowning i know nieh watched her more warily than hed ever expected when they first met shed come so far from the peasant woman grieving over her stolen child shed been then when class was ignored when ability was allowed even encouraged to rise as in the peoples liberation army astonishing things sometimes happened liu han was one of those astonishments she hadnt even known what the central committee was now she could manipulate it as well as a party veteran he said i have not discussed the matter before the committee i wanted to learn your opinion first thank you for thinking of my personal concerns she said she looked through nieh for a little while as she thought i do not know she went on i suppose i could accept either if it helped our cause against the little scaly devils spoken like a woman of the party nieh exclaimed perhaps i would like to join liu han said if i am to make myself all i might be here i should join is that not so it is so nieh hoting agreed you shall have instruction if that is what you want i would be proud to instruct you myself in fact liu han nodded nieh beamed bringing a new member into the party gave him the feeling a missionary had to have on bringing a new convert into the church one day he told her your place will be to give instruction not to receive it that would be very fine liu han said she looked through him again this time perhaps peering ahead into the future seeing her so made nieh nervous did she see herself ordering him about he started to smile then stopped if she kept progressing at the rate she had thus far the notion wasnt so unlikely after all the clop of a horses hooves and the rattle of a buggys iron tires always took leslie groves back in time to the days before the first world war when those noises had been the normal sound of getting from one place to another when he remarked on that lieutenant general omar bradley shook his head its not quite right general he said back in those days the roads this far outside of town wouldnt have been paved youre right sir groves admitted he didnt often yield points to anyone not even to the nuclear physicists who sometimes made the metallurgical laboratory such a delight to administer but this one he had to concede i remember when a little town felt mediumsized and a mediumsized one felt like a big city because theyd paved all the streets downtown thats how it was bradley said you didnt have concrete and asphalt all over the place not when i was a boy you didnt dirt roads were a lot easier on a horses hooves it was an easier time a lot of ways he sighed as any man of middle years will when he thinks back on the days of his youth almost any man leslie groves was an engineer to the core mud he said dust lap robes so you wouldnt be filthy by the time you got where you were going more horse manure than you could shake a stick at more flies too give me a nice enclosed packard with a heater on a good flat straight stretch of highway any old time bradley chuckled you have no respect for the good old days to hell with the good old days groves said if the lizards had come in the good old days theyd have smashed us to bits so fast it wouldnt even have been funny there i cant argue with you bradley said and going out to a twohole chick sale with a halfmoon window wasnt much fun in the middle of winter he wrinkled his nose now that i think back on it it wasnt much fun in hot weather either he laughed out loud yeah general to hell with the good old days but what weve got now isnt the greatest thing since sliced bread either he pointed ahead to show what he meant groves hadnt been out to the refugee camp before he knew of such places of course but hed never had occasion to seek them out he didnt feel guilty about that hed had plenty to do and then some if he hadnt done what hed done the usa might well have lost the war by now instead of sitting down with the lizards as near equals at the bargaining table that didnt make the camp any easier to take hed been shielded from just how bad war could be for those who got stuck in the gears because the met lab was so important hed always had plenty to eat and a roof over his head most people werent so lucky you saw newsreels of things like this but newsreels didnt usually show the worst the people in newsreels were black and white too and you didnt smell them the breeze was at his back but the camp smelled like an enormous version of the outhouses bradley had mentioned all the same people in newsreels didnt come running at you like a herd of living skeletons either eyes enormous in faces with skin stretched drumtight over bones begging hands outstretched please came the call again and again and again food sir money sir anything youve got sir the offers the emaciated women made turned groves ears red can we do anything more for these people than were doing sir he asked i dont see what bradley answered theyve got water here i dont know how were supposed to feed them when we dont have food to give groves looked down at himself his belly was still ample what there was went to the army first not to refugees and to people from denver whose jobs werent essential to the war effort that made good cold hard logical sense rationally he knew as much staying rational wasnt easy not here with the ceasefire in place how soon can we start bringing in grain from up north he asked the lizards wont be bombing supply trains the way they used to thats so bradley admitted but they gave the railroads a hell of a pasting when they made their big push on the city the engineers are still trying to straighten things out even when the trains start rolling though the other question is where the grainll come from the lizards are still holding an awful lot of our breadbasket maybe the canadiansll have some to spare the scaly bastards havent hit them as hard as they did us seems like they like warm weather groves said there are better places to find it than north of minnesota youre right about that bradley said but watching people starve right here in the middle of the united states thats a damned hard thing to do general i never thought id live to see the day when we had to bring in what little we do have with armed guards to keep it from being stolen and this is on our side of the line whats it like in territory the lizards have held for the last couple of years how many people have died for no better reason than that the lizards didnt give a damn about trying to feed them too many groves said wanting to quantify that but unable to with any degree of certainty hundreds of thousands has to be millions wouldnt surprise me at all bradley nodded even if the lizards do pull out of the usa and leave us alone for a whileand thats the most we can hope forwhat kind of country will we have left i worry about that general quite a lot remember huey long and father coughlin and the technocrats a man with nothing in his belly will listen to any sort of damn fool who promises him three square meals a day and weve got a lot of people with nothing in their bellies as if to underscore his words three horsedrawn wagons approached the refugee camp men in khaki who wore helmets surrounded the supply wagons on all sides about half of them carried tommy guns the rest had rifles with fixed bayonets the surge of hungry people toward the wagons halted at a respectful distance from the troops hard to give shoottokill orders to keep starving people from mobbing your food wagons bradley said glumly if i hadnt though the fast and the strong would get food nobody else but cant let that happen no sir groves agreed under the hard and watchful eyes of the american soldiers their fellow citizens lined up to get the tiny handfuls of grain and beans the quartermasters had to dole out by comparison depression soup kitchens had been fivestar restaurants with blueplate specials the food then had been cheap and plain but thered always been plenty of it once you swallowed enough of your pride to take charity now watching the line snake forward groves realized hed been so busy working to save the country that general bradleys question never once crossed his mind what sort of country was he saving the more he looked around the refugee camp the less he liked the answers he came up with for once in his life vyacheslav molotov had to fight with every fiber of his being to maintain his stiff faceno he wanted to scream at joachim von ribbentroplet it go you fool we have so much of what we came here for if you push too hard youll be like the greedy dog in the story that dropped its bone into the river trying to grab the one its reflection was holding but the german foreign minister got up on his hind legs and declared poland was part of the germanreich before the coming of the race to this world and therefore must return to thereich as part of the races withdrawal from our territory so thefuhrer has declared hitler actually was quite a lot like the dog in the fable all he understood was taking nothing else seemed real to him had he only been content to stay at peace with the soviet union while he finished britain he could have gone on fooling stalin a while longer and then launched his surprise attack thereby contending with one foe at a time he hadnt waited he couldnt wait hed paid for it against the ussr didnt he see hed have to pay far more against the lizards evidently he didnt there was his foreign minister mouthing phrases that would have been offensive to human opponents against the lizards who were vastly more powerful than germany those phrases struck molotov as clinically insane through his interpreter atvar said this proposal is unacceptable to us because it is unacceptable to so many other tosevites with concerns in the region it would merely prove a generator of future strife if you do not immediately cede poland to us it will prove a generator of present strife von ribbentrop blustered the lizards fleetlord made a noise like a leaking inner tube you may tell thefuhrer that the race is prepared to take the chance i shall do so von ribbentrop said and stalked out of the shepheards hotel meeting room molotov wanted to run after him to call him backwait you fool was the cry that echoed in his mind hitlers megalomania might drag everyone else down along with germany even the nations with explosivemetal bombs and poison gas werent much more than large nuisances to the lizards until they could deliver their weapons somewhere other than along the front line with the aliens they could not threaten them on equal terms the soviet foreign commissar hesitated did von ribbentrops arrogance mean the hitlerites had such a method he didnt believe it their rockets were better than anyone elses but powerful enough to throw ten tonnes across hundreds maybe thousands of kilometers soviet rocket scientists assured him the nazis couldnt be that far ahead of the ussr if they were wrong molotov didnt care to think about what might happen if they were wrong if the germans could throw explosivemetal bombs hundreds or thousands of kilometers they were as likely to throw them at moscow as at the lizards he checked his rising agitation if the nazis had such rockets they would not be so insistent about holding on to poland they could launch their bombs from germany and then scoop up poland at their leisure this time the scientists had to be right if they were right hitler was reacting from emotion rather than reason what was nazi doctrine but perverted romanticism if you wanted a thing that meant it should become yours and that meant you had the righteven the dutyto go out and take itif anyone had the gall to object you ran roughshod over him your will was all that mattered but if a man a meter and a half tall who weighed fifty kilos wanted something that belonged to a man two meters tall who weighed a hundred kilos and tried to take it hed end up with a bloody nose and broken teeth no matter how strong his will was the hitlerites didnt see that though their assault on the ussr should have taught it to them note comrade fleetlord molotov said that the german foreign ministers withdrawal does not imply the rest of us refuse to work out our remaining differences with you yakov donskoi turned his words into english uotat translated the interpreters comments into the language of the lizards with a little luck the aliens would smash the hitlerites into the ground and save the ussr the trouble jager otto skorzeny shouted get your scrawny arse over here weve got something we need to talk about you mean something besides your having the manners of a bear with a toothache jager retorted he didnt get up he was busy darning a sock and it was hard work because he had to hold it farther away from his face than he was used to these past couple of years his sight had begun to lengthen you fell apart even if you didnt get shot it just happened excuse me your magnificent coloneldom sir my lord von jager skorzeny said loading his voice with sugar syrup would you be so generous and gracious as to honor your most humble and obedient servant with the merest moment of your ever so precious time grunting jager got to his feet all the same to you skorzeny i like get your scrawny arse over here better the ssstandartenfuhrer chuckled figured you would come on lets go for a walk that meant skorzeny had news he didnt feel like letting anyone else hear and that presumably meant all hell was going to break loose somewhere most likely somewhere right around here almost plaintively jager said i was enjoying the ceasefire lifes tough skorzeny said and its our job to make it tougherfor the lizards your regiments still the thin end of the wedge right how soon can you be ready to hit our scaly chums a good one right in the snout weve got about half our panthers back at corps repair center for retrofitting jager answered fuel lines new cupolas for the turrets fuel pump gaskets made the right way that kind of thing we took advantage of the ceasefire to do one lot of them and now that its holding were doing the other nobody told menobody told anybodyit was breaking down im telling you the ss man said how long till youre up to strength again you need those panthers dont you just a bit yes jager said with what he thought was commendable understatement they should all be back here in ten daysa week if somebody with clout goes and leans on the corps repair crews skorzeny bit his lipdonnerwetter if i lean on them hard you think theyd have your panzers up here at the front inside five days thats my outer limit and i havent got any discretion about it if they arent here by then old chum you just have to go without em go where jager demanded why are you giving me orders and not my division commander i mean because i getmy orders from thefuhrer and thereichsfuhrerss not from some tinpot major general commanding a measly corps skorzeny answered smugly heres whats going to happen as soon as youre ready to motor and the artillery boys are set to do their part too i blow lodz to kingdom come and youand everybody elsegets to hit the lizards while theyre still trying to figure out whats going on the war is back in other words jager wondered if his message to the jews of lodz had got through if it had he wondered if theyd been able to find the bomb the ss man had hidden there somewhere and those were the least of his worries what will the lizards do to us if we blow up lodz they took out one of our cities for every bomb we used during the war how many will they slag if we use one of those bombs to break a ceasefire dont know skorzeny said i do know nobody asked me to worry about it so i bloody well wont i have orders to blast lodz in the next five days so a whole raft of bignosed kikes are going to get themselves fitted for halos along with the lizards we have to teach the lizards and the people who suck up to em that were too nasty to mess withand we will blowing up the jews will teach the lizards something jager scratched his head why should the lizards give a damn what happens to the jews and with whom are we at war the jews or the lizards were sure as hell at war with the lizards skorzeny answered and weve always been at war with the jews now havent we you know that youve pissed and moaned about it enough so well blow up a bunch of kikesand a bunch of lizards and thefuhrer will be so happy hell dance a little jig the way he did when the frogeaters gave up in sofive days maximum youll be ready to roll by then if i have my panzers back from the workshops yes jager said like i said though somebody will have to lean on the mechanics illtake care of that the ss man promised with a large evil grin you think they wont hustle with me holding their toes to the fire jager wouldnt have bet against his meaning that literally other thing is ill make it real plain that if they dont make me happy theyll tell himmler why would you rather deal with me or with the little schoolmaster in his spectacles good question jager said taken as a man skorzeny was a lot more frightening than himmler but skorzeny was just skorzeny himmler personified the organization he led and that organization invested him with a frightfulness of a different sort the answer is if you had your choice you wouldnt want to get either one of us mad at you let alone both right skorzeny said and jager had to nod the ssstandartenfuhrer went on as soon as the bomb goes off you roll east who knows the lizards are liable to be so surprised you may end up visiting your russian girlfriend instead of the other way round howd you like that he rocked his hips forward and back deliberately obscene ive heard ideas i liked less jager answered his voice dry skorzeny boomed laughter oh i bet you have i just bet you have out of the blue he found a brandnew question she a jew that russian of yours he asked very casually as a sergeant of police might have asked a burglary suspect where he was at eleven oclock one night ludmila jager said relieved he was able to come back with the truth no good the ss man said i didnt think so but i wanted to make sure she wont be mad at you when lodz goes up then right no reason she should be jager said thats fine skorzeny said yes thats fine you be good then five days remember youll have your panzers too or somebody will be sorry he was ever born he headed back toward camp whistling as he went jager followed more slowly doing his best not to show how thoughtful he was the ss had taken that polish farmer apart knowing he was involved in passing news on to the jews in lodz and now skorzeny was asking whether ludmila was jewish skorzeny couldnt know anything not really or jager wouldnt still be at the head of his regiment but suspicions were raising their heads like plants pushing up through dead leaves jager wondered if he could get word into lodz by way of mieczyslaw he decided he didnt dare take the chance not now he hoped the jews already had the news and that theyd found the bomb that hope sprang partly from shame at what thereich had already done to them and partly from fear of what the lizards would do to germany if an atomic bomb went off in territory they held while truce talks were going on to say he didnt think theyd be pleased was putting it mildly from the moment jager first met mordechai anielewicz hed seen the jews had themselves a fine leader in him if he knew skorzeny had secreted the bomb in lodz hed have moved heaven and earth to come up with it jager had done his damnedest to make sure the jew knew five days from now skorzeny would press his button or whatever it was he did maybe a new sun would seem to rise as it had outside breslau and maybe nothing at all would happen what would skorzeny do then walking around out in the open with lizards in plain sight felt unnatural mutt daniels found himself automatically looking around for the nearest shell hole or pile of rubble so hed have somewhere to take cover when firing broke out again but firing didnt break out one of the lizards raised a scaly hand and waved at him he waved back hed never been in a ceasefire quite like this one back in the shooting had stopped because theboches threw in the sponge neither side had given up here he knew fighting could pick up again any old time but it hadnt yet and maybe it wouldnt he hoped it wouldnt by now hed had enough fighting to last any three men a couple of lifetimes each a couple of his men were taking a bath in a little creek not far away their bodies werent quite so white and pale as they had been when the ceasefire started nobodyd had a chance to get clean for a long time before that when you were in the front lines you stayed dirty mostly because you were liable to get shot if you exposed your body to water and air after a while you didnt notice what you smelled like everybody else smelled the same way now mutt was starting to get used to not stinking again from out of the north back toward quincy came the sound of a humanmade internalcombustion engine mutt turned around and looked up the road sure as hell here came one of those big dodge command cars officers had been in the habit of using till gas got too scarce for them to go gallivanting around seeing one again was a sure sign the brass thought the ceasefire would last a while sure as hell a threestar banner fluttered from the aerial of the command car the fellow who stood in back of the pintlemounted caliber machine gun had three stars painted on his helmet too he also had a bonehandled revolver on each hip heads up boys mutt called that theres general patton coming to pay us a call patton had a name for being a tough soandso and for liking to show off to let everybody know how tough he was daniels hoped he wouldnt prove it by squeezing off a couple of belts of ammo in the lizards direction the command car rolled to a halt even before the tires had stopped turning patton jumped out and came up to mutt who happened to be standing closer to the lizards than anybody else mutt drew himself to attention and saluted thinking the lizards would be crazy if they didnt have somebody with a head drawn on this aggressivelooking newcomer trouble was if they started shooting at patton theyd be shooting at him too at ease lieutenant patton said in a gravelly voice he pointed across the lines toward a couple of lizards who were busy doing whatever lizards did so there is the enemy facetoface ugly devils arent they yes sir mutt said of course they say that about us too sircall us big uglies i mean yes i know beauty is in the eye of the beholder or so they say inmy eye lieutenant those are ugly sons of bitches and if they think me ugly well by god i take it for a compliment yes sir daniels said again patton didnt seem inclined to start shooting up the landscape for which he was duly grateful are they adhering to the terms of the ceasefire in this area the general demandedmaybe hewould start the war up again if the answer turned out to be no but mutt nodded sure are sir one thing you got to give the lizards they make an agreement they stick by it moren the germans and the japs and maybe the russians ever learned you sound like a man who speaks from experience lieutenant daniels sir mutt almost laughed he was pattons age more or less if you didnt have experience by the time you were pushing sixty when the devil would you but that probably wasnt what the general meant i went through the mill around chicago sir every time we dickered a truce with the lizards for picking up wounded and such they stuck right with it they may be bastards but theyre honorable bastards chicago patton made a sour face that wasnt war lieutenant that was butchery and it cost them dear even before we used our atomic weapon against them their greatest advantage over us was speed and mobility and what did they do with it why they threw it away lieutenant and got bogged down in endless street fighting where a man with a tommy gun is as good as a lizard with an automatic rifle and a man with a molotov cocktail can put paid to a tank that would smash a dozen shermans in the open without breaking a sweat the nazis fought the same way in russia they were fools too yes sir daniels felt like one of the kids hed managed listening to him going on about the best time to put on the hitandrun patton knew war the way he knew baseball the general was warming to his theme too and the lizards dont learn from their mistakes if they hadnt come and if the germans had broken through to the volga do you suppose they would have been stupid enough to try and take stalingrad house by house do you lieutenant have to doubt it sir said mutt whod never heard of stalingrad in his life of course they wouldnt the germans are sensible soldiers they learn from their mistakes but after we drove the lizards back from chicago winter before last what did they do they slogged straight on ahead again right back into the meat grinder and they paid thats why if these talks go the way they look to be going theyre going to have to evacuate the whole usa thatd be wonderful sir if it happens mutt said no it wouldnt patton said wonderful would be killing every one of them or driving them off our world here altogether one thing you had to give him mutt realized he didnt think small he went on since we cant do that worse luck were going to have to learn to live with them henceforward he pointed across to the lizards has fraternization after the ceasefire been peaceful in this area lieutenant yes sir daniels said sometimes they come over andi guess youd call it talk shop sir and sometimes they want ginger i reckon you know about that oh yes patton said with a chuckle i know about that it was good to find out we werent the only ones with vices for a while there i did wonder and when they get their ginger what do they use to pay for it uh mutt said you couldnt tell a lieutenant generaluh though so he continued this and that sir souvenirs sometimes stuff that doesnt mean anything to them like us trading beads to the indians medicalkit supplies sometimes too they got selfstick bandages that beat our kind all hollow pattons pale eyes glittered they ever tradeliquor for their ginger lieutenant has that ever happened yes sir thats happened mutt allowed cautiously wondering if the sky would fall on him in the next moment pattons nod was slow his eyes still held daniels good if youd told me anything different id know you were a liar the lizards dont like whiskeyi told you they were fools theyll drink rum theyll even drink gin but scotch bourbon rye they wont touch em so if they can forage up something they dont want and trade it for something they do they think theyre getting the good half of the deal we havent had any trouble with drunk and rowdy sir mutt said which was close enough to true to let him come out with it straightfaced i aint tried to stop em from takin a nip when they come off duty not since the ceasefire but they got to be ready to fight all the time you look like a man whos seen a thing or two patton said i wont complain about the way youre handling your men so long as theyre combatready as you say the army isnt in the business of producing boy scouts is it lieutenant daniels no sir mutt said quickly thats right patton growled its not which is not to saywhich is not to say for a momentthat neatness and cleanliness arent of importance for the sake of discipline and morale im glad to see your uniform so tidy and in such good repair lieutenant and even gladder to see those men over there bathing he pointed to the soldiers in the creek too often men at the front lines think army regulations no longer apply to them they are mistaken and sometimes need reminding of it yes sir daniels said knowing how filthy he and his uniform had been till he finally took the time to spruce up a couple of days earlier he was glad herman muldoon wasnt anywhere aroundone look at muldoon and patton whose chin was neatly shaved whose uniform was not only clean but showed creases and whose spitshined shoes gave off dazzling reflections would have flung him in the brig from the look of things lieutenant you have a firstrate outfit here keep em alert if our talks with the lizards go as the civilian authorities hope well be moving forward to reclaim the occupied areas of the united states and if they dont well grab the lizards by the snouts and kick em in the tail yes sir mutt said again patton sent a final steelyeyed glare over toward the lizards then jumped back into the command car the driver started the motor acrid exhaust belched from the pipe the big clunky dodge rolled away mutt let out a sigh of relief hed survived a lot of contact with the lizards and now hed survived contact with his own top brass too as any frontline soldier would attest your own generals could be at least as dangerous to you as the enemy liu han listened with more than a little annoyance to the men of the central committee discussing how they would bring over to the side of the peoples liberation army the large number of peasants who flooded into peking to work for the little scaly devils in the factories they kept open the annoyance must have been visible hsia shoutao stopped in the middle of his presentation on a new propaganda leaflet to remark i am sorry we seem to be boring you he didnt sound sorry except perhaps sorry she was there at all he hadnt displayed that kind of scornful arrogance since before hed tried to rape her maybe the lesson hed got then like most lessons wore off if it wasnt repeated till it stuck everything i have heard is very interesting to me liu han replied but do you think it really would catch the interest of a peasant with nothing more in his mind than filling his belly and the bellies of his children this leaflet has been prepared by propaganda specialists hsia said in condescending tones how do you presume to claim you know more than they because i was a peasant not a propaganda specialist liu han retorted angrily if someone came up to me and started preaching like a christian missionary about the dictatorship of the proletariat and the necessity of seizing the means of production i wouldnt have known what he was talking about and i wouldnt have wanted to learn either i think your propaganda specialists are members of the bourgeoisie and aristocracy out of touch with the true aspirations of the workers and especially of the peasants hsia shoutao stared at her he had never taken her seriously or he would not have tried to force himself upon her he hadnt noticed how well shed picked up the jargon of the communist party she relished turning that complex artificial set of terms against those who had devised it from across the table nieh hoting asked her and how would you seek to make his propaganda more effective liu han weighed with great care the way her loverwho was also her instructor in communist party lorespoke nieh was hsias longtime comrade was he being sarcastic to her supporting his friend she decided he wasnt that the question was sincerely meant she answered it on that assumption dont instruct newcome peasants in ideology most of them will not comprehend enough of what you are saying tell them instead that working for the little devils will hurt people tell them the things they help the scaly devils make will be used against their relatives who are still back in the villages tell them that if they do work for the scaly devils they and their relatives will be liable to repisals these are things they can understand and when we firebomb a factory or murder workers coming out of one they will see we speak the truth they will not however be indoctrinated hsia pointed out so vehemently that liu han got the idea hed written most of the leaflet she was criticizing she looked across the table at him yes and so what most important is keeping the peasants from working for the little devils if it is easier to keep them from doing that without indoctrinating them then we shouldnt bother trying we do not have the resources to waste do we hsia stared at her half in anger half in amazement liu han might have been an ignorant peasant a year before but she wasnt any more could others be quickly brought up to her level of political consciousness though she doubted that she had seen the revolutionary movement from the inside an opportunity most would never enjoy nieh said we can waste nothing we are settling in for a long struggle one that may last generations the little scaly devils wish to reduce us all to the level of ignorant peasants this we cannot permit so we must make the peasantry ideologically aware at some point in our program whether that point is the one under discussion i admit is a different question hsia shoutao looked as if hed been stabbed if even his old friend did not fully support himwe shall revise as necessary he mumbled good liu han said very good in fact thank you once youd won you could afford to be gracious but not too gracious when you have made the changes please let me see them before they go to the printer but hsia looked ready to explode but when he glanced around the table he saw the other central committee members nodding as far as they were concerned liu han had proved her ability hsia snarled if i give you the text will you be able to read it i will read it she said equably i had better be able to read it wouldnt you say the workers and peasants for whom it is intended will not be scholars to know thousands of characters the message must be strong and simple heads again bobbed up and down along the table hsia shoutao bowed his own head in surrender his gaze remained black as a storm cloud though liu han regarded him thoughtfully trying to rape her had not been enough to get him purged even from the central committee let alone from the party what about obstructionism if he delayed or evaded giving her the revised wording for the leaflet as he was likely to do would that suffice part of her hoped hsia would fulfill his duty as a revolutionary the rest burned for a chance at revenge atvar paced back and forth in the chamber adaptednot quite well enoughto the needs of the race his tailstump quivered reflexively millions of years before when the presapient ancestors of the race had been longtailed carnivores prowling across the plains of home that quiver had distracted prey from the other end the end with the teeth would that the big uglies could have been so easily distracted i wish we could change our past he said exalted fleetlord the tone of kirels interrogative cough said the shiplord of the conquest fleets bannership did not follow his train of thought he explained had we fought among ourselves more before the unified empire formed our weapons technology would have improved when it came time to duplicate those antique weapons for conquests of other worlds we would have had better arms what was in our data banks served us well against the rabotevs and hallessi and so we assumed it always would tosev has been the crematorium of a great many of our assumptions truthundeniable truth kirel said but if our own internecine wars had continued longer and with better weapons we might have exterminated ourselves rather than successfully unifying under the emperors he cast his eyes down to the soft intricately patterned woven floor covering so did atvar who let out a long mournful hissing sigh only the madness of this world could make me explore mighthavebeens he paced some more the tip of his tailstump jerking back and forth at last he burst out shiplord are we doing the right thing in negotiating with the big uglies and for all practical purposes agreeing to withdraw from several of their notempires it violates all precedent but then the existence of opponents able to manufacture their own atomic weapons also violates all precedent exalted fleetlord i believe this to be the proper course painful though it is kirel said if we cannot conquer the entire surface of tosev without damaging great parts of it and having the big uglies damage still more best we hold some areas and await the arrival of the colonization fleet we gain the chance to reestablish ourselves securely and to prepare for the safe arrival of the colonists and the resources they bring so i tell myself over and over atvar said i still have trouble being convinced seeing how the tosevites have improved their own technology in the short time since we arrived here i wonder how advanced they will be when the colonization fleet finally reaches this world computer projections indicate we will retain a substantial lead kirel said soothingly and the only other path open to us it would appear is the one straha the traitor advocated using our nuclear weapons in prodigal fashion to smash the big uglies into submissionwhich also unfortunately involves smashing the planetary surface i no longer trust the computer projections atvar said they have proved wrong too often we do not know the big uglies well enough to model and extrapolate their behavior with any great hope of accuracy the rest however is as you say with the ironic proviso that the tosevites care much less about the destruction of major portions of their world than we do that has let them wage unlimited warfare against us while we of necessity held back has let them kirel said held back am i to infer exalted fleetlord you purpose a change in policy not an active one only reactive atvar answered if the deutsche for example carry out the threats their leader has made through this von ribbentrop creature and resume nuclear warfare against us i shall do as i warned and thoroughly devastate deutschheld territory that will teach whatever may be left of the deutsche that we are not to be trifled with and should have a salutary effect on the behavior of other tosevite notempires so it should exalted fleetlord kirel agreed he was too tactful to remark on how closely the plan resembled the one straha had advocated for which the fleetlord silently thanked him instead he continued i cannot imagine the deutsch tosevites taking such a risk in the face of our clear and unmistakable warnings however as a matter of fact neither can i atvar said but with the big uglies the only certain thing is uncertainty heinrich jager looked around with something approaching wonder he could not see all the panzers and other armored lighting vehicles in his regiment of course they were concealed along the front on which they were to attack but hed never expected to come so close to establishment strength never expected to be so fully loaded with both petrol and ammunition he leaned out of the cupola of his panther and nodded to otto skorzeny i wish we werent doing this but if we do it well do it well spoken like a soldier said an ss man standing near skorzeny the boys in the black shirts had drifted back up to the front line over the past few days if lizard intelligence was up to keeping track of their movements jager would be feeding his regiment into a sausage machine he didnt think the lizards were that smart and hoped he was right the ss man went on it is every officers duty just as it is that of every soldier to obey the commands of his superiors and of thefuhrer without question regardless of his personal feelings jager stared down at the jackbooted ignoramus in silent scorn take his words to the logical extreme and youd turn thewehrmacht into a bunch of automata as inflexible as the russians or the lizards if you got orders that made no sense you questioned them if they still didnt make sense or if they led you into an obvious catastrophe you ignored them you needed guts to do it you put your career on the line when you disobeyed orders but if you could convince your superiors youd been right or that the orders youd got showed no real understanding of the situation in front of you youd survive you might even get promoted jager now hadnt just disobeyed orders if you wanted to look at things in a particular light hed given aid and comfort to the enemy any ss man who found out about what hed done would look at it in that particular light for his part he studied the weedy little fellow standing there beside skorzeny had he dropped his pants and enjoyed himself with karols wife or maybe with his young daughter while a couple of others held her down was he the one whod carved ss runes into the polish farmers belly and what in his agony had karol said was this smiling chap just waiting for the bomb to go off before he arrested jager and started carving runes into him skorzeny glanced down at his wristwatch soon now he said when it goes up we move and the signal goes out to our armies on the other fronts too the lizards will be sorry they didnt give in to our demands yes and what happens afterwards jager asked as he had before still hoping he could talk skorzeny out of pushing the fateful button we can be sure the lizards will destroy at least one city of the germanreich theyve done that every time anyone used an explosivemetal bomb against them in war but this isnt just warits breaking a ceasefire arent they liable to do something worse i dont know skorzeny said cheerfully and you know what else i dont give a fuck either weve been over this ground already the job thefuhrers given me is kicking the lizards and the jews in the balls just as hard as i can thats what im going to do too whatever happens afterwards it damn well happens thats all and ill worry about it then that is the national socialist way of thought the other ss man declared beaming at skorzeny skorzeny wasnt looking back on him thestandartenfuhrers eyes were on jager instead up there in the cupola the engineers and mechanics had been rightit was a vastly improved cupola of the panther without giving his blackshirted colleague a hint of what he was thinking he made his opinion plain to the panzer colonel if it wasntwhat a load of pious crap jager would have eaten his service cap and yet even if skorzeny didnt give a damn about the slogans under which he fought they remained valid for him hitler flew him like a falcon at chosen foes and like a falcon he didnt worry about where he was flying or for what reasons only about how to strike the hardest blow when he got there that wasnt enough jager had fought the same way himself till hed had his eyes forcibly opened to what germany had done to the jews in the lands it had overrun and to what it would have done had the arrival of the lizards not interrupted things once your eyes were opened shutting them again wasnt easy jager had tried and failed hed alsocautiouslytried to open the eyes of some other officers skorzeny among them without exception everybody else had stayed willfully blind not wanting to see not wanting to discuss he understood that he even sympathized with itif you refused to notice the flaws of your superiors and your country you could go on about your daily routine a lot more easily as long as he was fighting just the lizards jager had no trouble suppressing his own doubts his own worries nobody could doubt for even a moment that the lizards were deadly foes not only to germany but to all mankind you did what you had to do to stop them but the explosivemetal bomb in lodz didnt have only the lizards in mind it didnt even have the lizards primarily in mind skorzeny knew as much hed set it there after the nervegas bomb hed intended for the jews of lodz failed it was hisand germanysrevenge on the jews for thwarting him once try as jager would he couldnt stomach that skorzeny walked away whistling when he came back he was wearing a pack like the one a wireless operator carried in fact it undoubtedly was a wireless operators pack the handset that went with it though was anything but standard issue it had only two elements a bar switch and a large red button i make the time hours skorzeny said after yet another glance at his watch the other ss man brought his right wrist up toward his face i confirm the time as hours he said formally skorzeny giggled isnt this fun he said the other ss man stared at him that wasnt in the script jager just snorted hed seen too many times that skorzeny was indifferent to the script the big ss man flipped the bar switch degrees the transmitter is now active he said i confirm that the transmitter has been activated the other ss man droned and then skorzeny broke the rules again he reached up and gave jager the handset asking do you want to do the honors me jager almost dropped it are you out of your mind good god no he handed the device back to skorzeny only after hed done so did he realize heshould have dropped it or else contrived to smash it against the side of the panzer all right dont let it worry you skorzeny said i can kill my own dog i can kill a whole great lot of sons of bitches his thumb came down hard on the red button xviii even had the weather been cool vyacheslav molotov would have been steaming as he stood around in the lobby of the semiramis hotel waiting for a lizard armored personnel carrier to convey him to shepheards idiocy the soviet foreign commissar muttered to yakov donskoi where von ribbentrop was concerned he did not bother holding his scorn in check idiocy syphilitic paresis or both probably both von ribbentrop waiting for his own armored personnel carrier might well have been in earshot but he didnt speak russian had he spoken russian molotov would have changed not a word the interpreter glanced over to the german foreign minister then almost whispering himself replied it is most irregular comrade foreign commissar but molotov waved him to silence but me no buts yakov beniaminovich since we came here the lizards have convened all our sessions as is only proper for that arrogant nazi to demand a noon meeting he shook his head i thought it was mad dogs and englishmen who went out in the noonday sun not a mad dog of a german before donskoi could say anything to that several personnel carriers pulled up in front of the hotel the lizards didnt seem happy about ferrying all the human diplomats to shepheards at the same time but von ribbentrop hadnt given them enough notice of this meeting upon which he insisted for them to do anything else when the negotiators reached atvars headquarters lizard guards made sure molotov did not speak to marshall or eden or togo before entering the meeting room they also made sure he did not speak to von ribbentrop that was wasted labor he had nothing to say to the german foreign minister precisely at noon the lizard fleetlord came into the meeting room accompanied by his interpreter through that male atvar said very well speaker for the notempire of deutschland i have agreed to your request for this special session at this special time you will now explain why you made such a request i listen with great attentiveness it had better be goodwas what he meant even through two interpreters molotov had no trouble figuring that out von ribbentrop heard it through only one so it should have been twice as clear to him if it was he gave no sign thank you fleetlord he said as he got to his feet from the inside pocket of his jacket he pulled out a folded sheet of paper and as portentously as he could unfolded it fleetlord i read to you a statement from adolf hitlerfuhrer of the germanreich when he spoke hitlers name his voice took on a reverence more pious than the pope back before the pope had been blown to radioactive dust would have used in mentioning jesus but then why not von ribbentrop thought hitler was infallible when hed made the germansoviet nonaggression pact the fascists had so brutally violated hed declared to the whole world thefuhrer is always right in such opinions unlike diplomacy he lacked the duplicity needed to lie well now in pompous tones he went on thefuhrer declares that as the race has intolerably occupied territory rightfully german and refuses to leave such territory regardless of the illegitimacy of that occupation thereich is fully justified in taking the strongest measure against the race and has now initiated those measures we molotov knew a sinking sensation at the pit of his stomach so the nazi had had a reason for summoning everyone the fascist regime had launched another sneak attack and was now in a pattern long familiar offering some trumpedup rationale for whatever its latest unprovoked act of aggression had been sure enough von ribbentrop continued have emphasized our legitimate demands by the detonation of this latest explosivemetal bomb and by the military action following it god will give the germanreich the victory it deserves the german foreign minister refolded the paper put it away and shot out his right arm in the nazi saluteheil hitler anthony eden shigenori togo and george marshall all looked as shaken as molotov felt so much for the popular front hitler had consulted with no one before resuming the war he and all too likely everyone else would have to pay the price uotat finished hissing and popping and squeaking for atvar molotov waited for the lizard fleetlord to explode and to threaten to rain down hideous destruction on germany for what it had just done the foreign commissar would have faced that prospect with considerable equanimity instead atvar directed only a few words to the interpreter who said the exalted fleetlord tells me to tell you he is looking into this statement as uotat spoke the fleetlord left the room he came back a few minutes later and spoke several sentences to the translator one by one uotat turned them into english as he did so donskoi translated them into russian for molotov the exalted fleetlord wonders why the negotiator for the notempire of deutschland has had us come here to listen to a statement bearing no resemblance to any sort of reality no atomic explosion has occurred in or near deutschland no atomic explosion in fact has occurred anywhere on tosev no unusual military activity of any sort by deutsch forces is noted the exalted fleetlord asks whether your brain is addled spokesmale von ribbentrop or that of yourfuhrer von ribbentrop stared at atvar along with the other human negotiators molotov stared at von ribbentrop something had gone spectacularly wrong somewhere that much was obvious but what and where otto skorzeny pressed down on the red button till his thumbnail turned white with the pressure heinrich jager waited for the southern horizon to light up with a brief new sun and for the artillery barrage that would follow over the intercom he spoke quietly to johannes drucker be ready to start the engine jawohl herr oberstthe panzer driver answered but the new sun did not rise the mild polish summer day continued undisturbed skorzeny jammed his thumb down on the button again nothing happened christ on his cross the ss man muttered then when that proved too weak to satisfy him he ground out goddamned motherfucking son of a shiteating bitch he tried the transmitter one more time before throwing it to the ground in disgust he turned to the blackshirt beside him get me the backup unitschnell jawohl herr standartenfuhrerthe other ss officer dashed away to return in short order with a pack and transmitter identical to the ones that had failed skorzeny flipped the activating switch and pressed the red button on the new transmitter again the bomb in lodz failed to explode shit skorzeny said wearily as if even creative obscenity were more trouble than it was worth he started to smash the second transmitter but checked himself shaking his head he said somethings fucked up somewhere go and broadcasteggplant on the generaldistribution frequencies eggplant the other ss man looked like a dog watching a juicy bone being taken away must we bet your arse we must maxi skorzeny answered if the bomb doesnt go off we dont move the bomb hasnt gone off now we have to send out the signal to let the troops know the attacks on hold well sendknife as soon as it goes up now move damn you if some overeager idiot opens up because he didnt get thehalt signal himmlerll wear your guts for garters jager had never imagined an ss officer named maxi hed never imagined anybody no matter what his name was could move so fast what now he asked skorzeny hed seldom seen the big bluff austrian indecisive but that was the only word that fit damned if i know skorzeny answered maybe some sexton or whatever the kikes call them spotted the aerial hooked up to the grave marker and tore it loose if thats all it is a simple reconnection would get things going again without much trouble if its anything more than that if the jews have their hands on the bomb he shook his head that could be downright ugly for some reason or other they dont exactly love us even his laugh usually a great fierce chortle rang hollow now for some reason or otherthat was as close as skorzeny would come to acknowledging what thereich had done to the jews it was closer than a lot of german officers came but it was not close enough not as far as jager was concerned he said what are you going to do about it skorzeny looked at him as if he were the idiot what do you think im going to do im going to shag ass down to lodz and make that fucker work one way or the other like i say i hope the problems just with the aerial but if its not if the jews really did get wind of this some kind of way ill manage just fine thank you very much you cant be thinking of going by yourself jager exclaimed if the jews do have ithe didnt know himself not for suretheyll turn you into ablutwurst quick as boiled asparagus the classics sometimes came in handy in the oddest ways skorzeny shook his head again youre wrong jager itll be awhat do the raf bastards call it a piece of cake thats what theres a ceasefire on remember even if the kikes have stolen the bomb they wont be guarding it real hard why should they they wont know we know theyve got it because they cant figure wed try and set it off in the middle of a truce his leer had most of its old force back of course not were good little boys and girls right except for one thing im not a good little boy mm id noticed that jager said dryly now skorzenys laugh was full of his wicked vinegarhe recovered fast he was also damned good at thinking on his feet every word he said sounded reasonable when are you leaving soon as i change clothes get some rations and take care of a couple of things here the ss man answered if the bomb goes up itll give those scaly sons of bitches a kick in the teeth theyll remember for a long time in absurdly coquettish fashion he fluttered his fingers at jager and tramped away from the cupola of the panther jager stared after him with his unit on full battle alert how the devil was he supposed to get away and get word to mieczyslaw so he could pass it on to anielewicz by whatever roundabout route he used the answer was simple and stared jager in the face he couldnt but if he didnt he worried not just about thousands of jews going up in a toadstoolshaped cloud of dust but also about germany whatwould the lizards visit on thevaterland for touching off an atomic bomb during a truce jager didnt know he didnt want to find out either from down in the turret of the panther gunther grillparzer said no show today after all colonel doesnt look that way jager answered and then took a chance by adding cant say im sorry either to his surprise grillparzer said amen the gunner seemed to think some kind of explanation was needed there for he went on i hold no brief for kikes mind you sir but it aint like theyre our numberone worry right now you know what i mean its the lizards i really want to boot in the arse not them theyre all going to hell anyway so i dont hardly have to worry about em corporal as far as im concerned they can sew red stripes on your trousers and put you on the general staff jager told him i think youve got better strategic sense than most of our top planners and thats a fact if i do then god help germany grillparzer said and laughed god help germany jager agreed and didnt the rest of the day passed in lethargic anticlimax jager and his crew climbed out of their panther with nothing but relief you rolled the dice every time you went up against the lizards and sooner or later snake eyes stared back at you sometime during the afternoon otto skorzeny disappeared jager pictured him slouching toward lodz a pack on his back and very likely makeup over the famous scar could he hide that devilish gleam in his eye with makeup too jager had his doubts johannes drucker disappeared for a while too but he came back in triumph with enough kielbasa for everybodys supper that night give that man a knights cross gunther grillparzer exclaimed turning to jager he said with a grin if youre going to put me on the general staff sir i might as well enjoy myselfnicht wahr warum denn nichtjager said why not as twilight deepened they got a fire going and stuck a pot over it to boil the sausage the savory steam rising from the pot made jagers mouth water when he heard approaching footsteps he expected them to come from the crew of another panzer drawn by the smell and hoping to get their share of meat but the men coming up to the cookfire werent in panzer black they were in ss blackso maxi and his friends arent above scrounging jager thought amused then maxi drew a walther from his holster and pointed it at jagers midsection the ss men with him also took out their pistols covering the rest of the startled panzer crewmen you will come with me immediately colonel or i will shoot you down on the spot maxi said you are under arrest for treason against thereich exalted fleetlord moishe russie said he was getting used to these sessions with atvar he was even coming to look forward to them the more useful atvar thought him now the less likely he and his family were to have to pay for his earlier strokes against the lizards and guessing with the diplomats of the great powers was a game that made chess look puerile he was apparently a better guesser than most of the lizards that kept the questions coming and let him find out how the negotiations fared which had a fascination of its own he was privy to knowledge only a handful of humans possessed atvar spoke in his own language zolraag turned these words into the usual mix of german and polish you are of course familiar with the tosevite notemperor hitler and hold no good opinion of himi take it this remains correct yes exalted fleetlord moishe added an emphatic cough good atvar said i judge you more likely then to give me an honest opinion of his actions than you would those of say churchill solidarity with your fellow big uglies will be less of an issue in hitlers case is this also correct yes exalted fleetlord moishe repeated thinking of hitler as his fellow human being did not fill him with delight whatever you had to say against them the lizards had shown themselves to be far better people than adolf hitler very well atvar said through zolraag here is my question how do you judge the conduct of hitler and von ribbentrop when the latter summoned me to announce the detonation of an atomic bomb and the resumption of warfare by deutschland against the race when in fact no such detonation and no such warfarebarring a few more ceasefire violations than usualin fact took place moishe stared this really happened exalted fleetlord truth atvar said a word russie understood in the lizards language he scratched his head as he thought for all he knew that might have made him uncouth in atvars eyes but then he was a big ugly so was he not uncouth in atvars eyes by assumption slowly he said i have trouble believing von ribbentrop would make such a claim knowing it to be untrue and knowing you could easily learn it was untrue that is perceptive of you the fleetlord said when the spokesmale for hitler did make the claim i immediately investigated it and finding it false returned to inform him of the fact the unanimous opinion of our psychologists is that my statement took him by surprise here observe him for yourself at atvars gesture zolraag activated one of the little screens in the chamber sure enough there stood von ribbentrop looking somewhere between arrogant and afraid a lizard the screen did not show spoke to him in hissing english the german foreign ministers eyes widened his mouth dropped open a hand groped for the edge of the table exalted fleetlord that is a surprised man moishe declared so we thought atvar agreed this raises the following question is the delivery of false information part of some devious scheme on hitlers part or was the information intended to be true in either case of course von ribbentrop would have believed it accurate as he delivered it yes moishe scratched his head again trying to figure out what possible benefit hitler might have derived by deliberately deceiving his foreign minister into threatening the lizards for the life of him he couldnt come up with any i have to believe the germans intended to attack you this is the conclusion we have also drawn although we warned them they would suffer severely if they made any such attacks atvar said it is unsettling distinctly so somewhere on our frontier with hitlers forces or perhaps beyond that frontier there is probably a nuclear weapon that for whatever reason has failed of ignition we have searched for such a weapon but have not discovered it after el iskandariya it is by no means certain we would discover it now will hitler be willing to accept failure and resume talks or will he seek to detonate the bomb after all being asked to peer inside hitlers brain was rather like being asked to debride gangrenous tissue revolting but necessary if the germans find any way to detonate the bomb my guess is that they will moishe said i have to say though thats only a guess it accords with the predictions our researchers have made atvar said whether this makes it accurate only time will show but i believe you are giving me your best and most reasoned judgment here truth exalted fleetlord moishe said in the language of the race good the lizard answered i am of the opinion that we previously tried to exploit you too broadly and as with any misused tool this caused difficulties we would not have had if we kept you within limits appropriate to your situation this appears to be the source of a large portion of your enmity toward us and your turning against us its certainly a source of some of it moishe agreed that was the closest to understanding him the lizards had ever come at any rate and vastly preferable to their equating his actions with treason as they had been doing if a knife breaks because it is used as a pry bar is that the fault of the knife atvar resumed no it is the fault of the operator because your service moishe russie has improved when you are properly used i grow more willing to overlook past transgressions when these negotiations between the race and the tosevites are completed perhaps we shall establish you in the area where you were recaptured the exalted fleetlord means palestine zolraag put in on his own these names you give places have caused us considerable difficulty especially where more than one name applies to the same place atvar resumed we shall establish you there as i was saying with your female and hatchling and as necessary consult with you on tosevite affairs we shall do a better job of recognizing your limits henceforward and not force you to provide information or propaganda you find distasteful would you accept such an arrangement they wanted to set him up in palestinein the holy landwith his family theyd use him as an expert on humanity without coercing him or humiliating him cautiously he said exalted fleetlord my only worry is that it sounds too good to be true it is truth the fleetlord answered have you not seen moishe russie that when the race makes an agreement it abides by what it agrees i have seen this moishe admitted but ive also seen the race ordering rather than trying to agree the fleetlords sigh sounded surprisingly human this has proved far less effective on tosev than we would have desired we are accordingly trying new methods here however distasteful innovation is for us when the males and females of the colonization fleet arrive they will undoubtedly have a great many sharp things to say about our practices but we shall be able to offer them a large portion of a viable planet on which to settle considering what might have happened here this strikes me as an acceptable resolution i dont see how i could disagree exalted fleetlord moishe said sometimes not everyone can get everything he wants from a situation this has never before happened to the race atvar said with another sigh moishe went from the worldbestriding to the personal in the space of a sentence when you settle me and my family in palestine there is one other thing i would like and what is this the fleetlord asked russie wondered if he was pushing his luck too far but pressed ahead anyhow you know i was studying to become a doctor before the germans invaded poland id like to take up those studies again not just with humans but with males of the race if there is peace well have so much to learn from you one of my principal concerns in making a peace with you big uglies is how much you will learn from us and what sorts of things atvar said you have learned too much already but in medicine i do not suppose you will become a great danger to us very well moishe russie let it be as you say thank you exalted fleetlord moishe said some american in a film had once used an expression that sounded so odd when dubbed literally into polish moishe had never forgotten it come up smelling like a rose if atvar stayed by the terms of the agreement hed somehow managed to do exactly that a rose he muttered just like a rose moishe russie atvar asked with an interrogative cough zolraag hadnt been able to make sense of the words it is a bargain exalted fleetlord moishe said and hoped the rose didnt prove to have too many thorns straha leaned away from the microphone and took off his earphones which didnt fit well over his hearing diaphragms anyhow another broadcast he said turning an eye turret toward sam yeager i do not see the necessity for many more not with talks between the race and you big uglies progressing so well you cannot imagine how you must have horrified stodgy old atvar to get him to talk with you at all im glad he did finally sam said ive had a bellyful of war this whole world has had a bellyfultwo bellyfulsof war half measures of any sort do not appear to succeed on tosev straha agreed had it been i in the fleetlords body paint we would have tried sooner and harder to batter you tosevites into submission i know that yeager nodded the refugee shiplord had never made any great secret of his preference for the stick over the carrot sam remembered the american atomic bomb sitting somewhere here in hot springs surely no more than a few hundred yards from this stuffy little studio he couldnt tell straha about the bomb of course general donovan would nail his scalp to the wall if he pulled a boner like that what he did say was with three notempires making atomic bombs youd have had a hard time stopping all of them truth there too of course straha sighed when peace comesif peace comeswhat becomes of me we wont give you back for the race to take vengeance on you sam told him weve already said as much to your people in cairo they didnt much like it but theyve agreed of this much i am already aware straha answered so i shall live out my life among you the tosevites of the usa and how am i to pass my time while i am doing this oh sam started to see what the refugee was driving at some males of the race fit in fine with us vesstils taught us an amazing lot about rocket engineering and ristin has for all practical purposes turned into a big ugly straha said with acid in his voice when you think about where he is whats he supposed to do sam asked he is a male of the race he should have the dignity to remember that fact straha replied after a second sam figured out what the lizard reminded him of a snobby englishman looking down his nose at a countryman whod gone native in tanganyika or burma or somewhere like that hed seen enough jungle movies with that as part of the story only trouble was he couldnt say as much to straha not without insulting him further instead he said maybe if we get a peace well get ahe had to fumble around to get across the idea he wanted but finally didan amnesty along with it for the likes of ristin there will surely be an amnesty straha said he shall have it though he does not require it to enjoy his life for the likes of vesstil there also may be an amnesty vesstil has taught you muchthis is truth sam yeager as you say but he came among you tosevites at my order he was my shuttlecraft pilot when i ordered his duty was to obey and obey he did despite the aid he has furnished you he may be forgiven but for me sam yeager of amnesty there shall be none i tried to remove the fleetlord atvar to keep him from losing the war to you tosevites i failedand so did he for is the war won do you think he will let me enter any land the race holds after peace comesif peace comes it would but remind him i was right to doubt him and that the conquest failed no if i am to live it must be among you big uglies sam slowly nodded traitors didnt get to go home again that looked to be the same among lizards as it was with people if rudolf hess flew back to germany from england would hitler welcome him with open arms not likely but hess in england was at least among his fellow human beings here in hot springs straha was as trapped among aliens as a human tool of the lizards who spent the rest of his days with themor more accurately still spent the rest of his days on home well do everything we can to make you comfortable yeager promised so your leaders and you have assured me from the start straha replied and so far as is in your power so you have done i cannot complain of your intentions but intentions go only so far sam yeager if peace comes i shall remain here remain an analyst of the race and propagandist for this notempire is this not the highprobability outcome truth sam said youve always earned your place here dont you want to go on doing that i shallit is the best i can do but you fail to understand straha said i shall stay here among you tosevites some other males surely will also stay and we shall build our tiny community for we shall be all of the race we have and we shall have to turn our eye turrets toward what the rest of the race is doing here on tosev and study it for the leaders of this notempire and never ever be a part of it how to live with that loneliness can it be done i shall have to learn i apologize yeager said i did not see all of it back before the germans conquered france every once in a while you used to read stories in the papers about the doings of russian emigres in paris if any of them were left alive these days they would have sympathized with straha there they were on the outside looking in while the great bulk of their countrymen went about building something new if that wasnt hell it had to be a pretty fair training ground straha sighed before long too in the scale of things the race commonly uses the colonization fleet will reach this world egg clutches will be incubated will any be mine it is to laugh his mouth fell open some of the russian emigres had russian wives others sweethearts the ones who didnt could look for willing frenchwomen straha didnt miss lady lizards the way a man missed women out of sight or rather out of scent really was out of mind for him but again hed be watching the race as a whole move along and he wouldnt be a part of it shiplord thats hard sam said truth straha said but when i came down to this not empire i did not ask that life be easy only that it continue continue it has continue it will in the circumstances i chose for myself i shall likely have a long time to contemplate whether i made the correct decision sam wanted to find the right thing to say but for the life of him could not come up with anything mordechai anielewicz walked casually past the factory that up until a few months before had housed workers turning out winter coats for the lizards then one of the nazis rocket bombs had scored a direct hit on the place it looked like any other building that had taken a onetonne bomb hit like the devil the only good thing was that the rocket had come down during the night shift when fewer people were working anielewicz looked around not many people were on the street he tugged at his trousers as if adjusting them then he ducked behind one of the factorys shattered walls any man might have done the same to get some privacy in which to ease himself from deeper in the ruins a voice spoke in yiddish ah its you we dont like people coming in here you know and why is that mendel mordechai asked dryly because were sitting on an egg we hope we dont ever have to hatch the guard answered his own tone less collected than he probably would have liked as long as its in our nest and not the one the germans laid for it anielewicz answered getting it out of the ghetto field had been an epic in itself and not one mordechai ever wanted to repeat the bomb had not been buried deep or he and his comrades never would have budged it as things were the gaping hole in the ground that marked its presence had remained for the lizards to spot when morning came fortunately the cover storythat the corpses in that grave were suspected to have died of cholera and so had to be exhumed and burnedhad held up like most lizards bunim was squeamish about human diseases mordechai peered out from the gloom inside the ruined factory none of the people who had been on the street was looking back nobody seemed to have taken any notice that he hadnt come out after going in there for privacys sake he walked farther into the bowels of the building the way back twisted and went around piles of brick and tumbledown interior walls but once out of sight of the street was free of rubble there sitting in its oversized crate on a reinforced wagon rested the bomb the nazis had buried in the ghetto field it had taken an eighthorse team to get it here theyd need another eight horses to get it out it they ever had to one of the reasons mordechai had chosen to hide the bomb here was the livery stable round the corner eight of the sturdiest draft horses the jewish underground could find waited there ready to be quickly brought over here in case of emergency as if by magic a couple of schmeissertoting guards appeared from out of the shadows they nodded to anielewicz he set his hand on the wagon when we have the chance i want to get this damned thing out of lodz altogether take it someplace where there arent so many lizards around that would be good said one of the guards a skinny walleyed fellow named chaim put it somewhere without so many people around too everybody who isnt one of us could be one ofthem he didnt specify whothey were likely he didnt know mordechai didnt know either but he had the same worries chaim did the enemy of your enemy wasnt your friend herehe was just an enemy of a different flavor anybody who found out the bomb was herelizards poles nazis even the jews who followed mordechai chaim rumkowskiand wasnt that an odd juxtaposition of names anielewicz thoughtwould try to take it away and take advantage of it anielewicz rapped gently on the crate again if we have to we can play samson in the temple he said chaim and the other guard both nodded that other fellow said youre sure the nazis cant set it off by wireless positive saul anielewicz answered we made certain of that but we have the manual detonator not far away both guards nodded they knew where it was god forbid we have to use it thats all omaynchaim and saul said together see anything unusual around here mordechai asked as he did every time he came to check on the bomb as they always did the guards shook their heads the job of guarding the crate was turning into routine for them neither was a man of much imagination anielewicz knew he had more than was good for him he made his way out toward the street pausing to ask mendel the question hed just put to saul and chaim mendel affirmed that he hadnt seen anything out of the ordinary either anielewicz told himself he was worrying over nothing nobody but the jewish underground and the nazis of course knew the bomb had come into lodz and nobody but his own people knew where it was now the nazis wouldnt have tried to set it off not with their ceasefire with the lizards still holding hed told himself that a great many times he still had trouble believing it after almost five years of war first against the germans and then sometimes against the germans and lizards both he had trouble believing any counsel of safety as he emerged onto the street he fumbled at his trousers to show why he had gone back behind the wall then looked up and down to see if anyone was taking any special notice either of him or of the wrecked factory building he didnt spot anyone like that so he started up the street there maybe fifteen meters ahead of him striding along briskly was a tall broadshouldered man with light brown hair the fellow turned a corner anielewicz followed not thinking much of him except that his black coat was too short it flapped halfway down his calves instead of at his ankles as it should have not many men in lodz were so big which no doubt explained why the fellow couldnt find a coat to fit him he lacked only six or eight centimeters of two meters height no anielewicz hadnt seen many men that size in the ghetto big beefy men because they needed more food had a way of dying faster on bad rations than small men did but anielewicz had seen a man about that tall some time in the not too distant past he frowned trying to remember when and where one of the polish farmers who sometimes passed information on to the jews it had been outside of lodz he was fairly sure of that all at once he started to run when he got to the corner at which the tall man had turned he paused his head swiveling this way and that he didnt see the fellow he walked over to the next corner where he peered both ways again still no sign of the man he kicked at a paving stone in frustration could that have been otto skorzeny on the streets of the lodz ghetto or was he starting at shadows the ss man had no rational reason to be here so anielewicz tried to convince himself hed spied someone else of about the same size and build its impossible he muttered under his breath if the nazis blow up lodz in the middle of peace talks god only knows what the lizards will drop on their heads reap the wind sow the whirlwind not even hitlers thatmeshuggeh as with his earlier more general fears he had trouble dismissing this one when you got right down to it who could say just howmeshuggeh hitler was david goldfarb and basil roundbush climbed off their bicycles and made their eager way toward the white horse inn like castaways struggling up to the edge of a desert oasis pity we cant bring mzepps with us roundbush remarked do the poor blighter good to have a night out dont you think me goldfarb said ive given up thinking for the duration commendable attitude roundbush said with a nod keep that firmly in mind lad and youll go farthough thinking about not thinking does rather spoil the exercise eh goldfarb had the sense not to get stuck in that infinite regress he opened the door to the white horse inn and was greeted by a cloud of smoke and a roar of noise basil roundbush shut the door after them as soon as hed done so goldfarb pushed aside the black cloth curtains that screened off the short entryway and went inside he blinked at the bright electric lamps i liked the place better when it was all torchlight and hearthfire he said gave it more atmosphere you felt shakespeare or johnson might drop in for a pint with you if johnson dropped in it would be for more than one and thats a fact roundbush said all the fires did take one back to the eighteenth century i must say but remember old boy the eighteenth century was a filthy nasty place give me electricity every day they seem to be doing just that goldfarb said making his way toward the bar amazing how quickly you can get a system of electricity up and running again when youre not being bombed round the clock makes a bit of a difference roundbush agreed i hear the blackout regulations will be going soon if this truce holds up he waved to naomi kaplan who stood behind the bar she smiled and waved back then turned up the wattage of that smile when she spotted the shorter goldfarb behind him roundbush chuckled you are a lucky fellow i hope you know it youd best believe i do goldfarb said so enthusiastically that roundbush laughed again and if i didnt my family would tell me too often to let me forget his parents and siblings approved of naomi hed been certain they would to his great relief she approved of them too though their crowded east end flat was far from the uppermiddleclass comforts shed known growing up in germany before hitler made life there impossible they found a narrow opening at the bar and squeezed in to widen it roundbush slapped silver on the damp polished wood two pints of best bitter he said to naomi and then set out more coins and one for yourself if youve a mind to thank you no she said and pushed those back at the raf officer the others she scooped into the cash box under the bar goldfarb wished she didnt have to work here but she was making much better money than he was the landlord of the white horse inn could raise prices to keep up with the inflation galloping through the british economy and raise wages almost as much goldfarbs meager raf salary ran several bureaucratic lurches behind he would have thought it a princely sum when he enlisted in what had been princely now left him a pauper he gulped down his pint and bought a round in return naomi let him get her a pint too which set basil roundbush to making indignant noises through his mustache they were just lifting the pint pots when someone behind goldfarb said whos your new chum old man goldfarb hadnt heard those cantabrian tones in a long time jones he said i havent seen you in so long id long since figured youd bought your plot then he got a good look at jerome jones companions and his eyes went even wider mr embry mr bagnall i didnt know theyd declared this old home week introductions followed jerome jones blinked with surprise when goldfarb presented naomi kaplan as his fiancee you lucky dog he exclaimed you found yourself a beautiful girl and id lay two to one shes neither a sniper nor a communist erno david said he coughed would i be wrong in guessing youve not had a dull time of it this past little while not half dull the other radarman said with unwonted sincerity he shivered not half goldfarb recognized that tone of voice someone trying hard not to think about places hed been and things hed done the more he looked at it giving up thought for the duration seemed a good scheme sylvia came back to the bar carrying a tray crowded with empty pint pots good lord she said staring at the new arrivals look what the breeze blew in of itself her hand went up to smooth her hair where the devil have you lads been i thought shed thought the same thing goldfarb had but didnt want to say it out loud beautiful romantic pskov george bagnall rolled his eyes to show how seriously the adjectives were meant to be taken wheres whateveryoucallit sylvia asked beating everyone else to the punch if you draw a line from leningrad to warsaw you wont be far off bagnall answered that let goldfarb put it on his mental map jerome jones added and all the time we were there the only thing sustaining us was the thought of the white horse inn and the sweet gentle lovely lasses working here sylvia looked down under her feet fetch me a dustpan she said to naomi its getting pretty deep in here she turned back to jones youre even cheekier than i recall he grinned not a bit abashed looking him embry and bagnall over with a critical eye sylvia went on you must be the lot who were in here last week looking for me i was in bed with the influenza i never thought to be jealous of a germ jones said sylvia planted an elbow in his ribs hard enough to lift him off his feet she went on behind the bar emptying the tray of the pints it had carried and started filling fresh ones wheres daphne ken embry asked she had twin girls last month i hear goldfarb answered which effectively ended that line of inquiry i do believe id kill for a bit of beefsteak bagnall said in a tone of voice implying that wasnt meant altogether as a joke one thing ive found since we got here is that were on even shorter commons than they are on the continent black bread parsnips cabbage spudsits like what the germans were eating the last winter of the great war you want beefsteak sir you may have to kill goldfarb said a man who has a cow stands watch over it with a rifle these days and it seems rifles are easy to come by for bandits too everybody got a rifle when the lizards came and not all of them were turned back in not by a long chalk youll hear about gunfights over food in the papers or on the wireless sylvia nodded emphatic agreement to that might as well be the wild west all the shooting that goes on these days chicken now we might come up with and theres fish about seeing as were by the ocean but beef no even chicken costs basil roundbush said goldfarb had been thinking the same thing but hadnt said it though with his tiny pay he had more justification than the officer but when you were a jew you thought three times before you let others perceive you as cheap jerome jones slapped himself in the hip pocket moneys not the biggest worry in the world right now not with eighteen months pay dropped on me all at once more money than i thought id get too how many times have they raised our salaries while we were gone three or four goldfarb answered but its not as much money as you think prices have gone up a lot faster than pay i was just thinking that a few minutes ago he glanced down the bar toward naomi who had just set a pint pot in front of a slickerclad fisherman his shoulders heaved up and down in a silent sigh it would be so good to get her out of here and live on his payexcept he could barely do that himself and two surely couldnt he caught his fiancees eye she came back over with a smile a round for all my friends here he said digging into his pocket to see what banknotes lay crumpled there by immemorial custom everyone would buy a round after that hed want a radar mounted on the front of his bicycle by the time he had to go back to barracks but he expected hed manage hed have a thick head come morning but hed manage that too beefsteak might be thin on the ground but theyd never yet run short on aspirin tablets the tosevite negotiators rose respectfully when atvar entered the chamber where they waited he flicked one eye turret toward uotat give them the appropriate greetings he said to uotat it shall be done exalted fleetlord the translator answered and switched from the beautiful precise language of the race to the mushy ambiguities of the big ugly tongue called english one after another the tosevites replied molotov of the sssr through his own interpreter they say the usual things in the usual way exalted fleetlord uotat reported good atvar said i am in favor of their doing any usual thing in any usual way on this planet that is in and of itself unusual and speaking of the unusual we now return to the matter of poland tell the speaker from deutschland i am most displeased over his recent threat of renewed combat and that the race will take unspecified severe measures should such threats reoccur in the future again uotat spoke english von ribbentrop replied in the same language exalted fleetlord he blames errors in decoding the instructions from his notemperor for that unseemly lapse of a few days ago does he atvar said after the fact a male may blame a great many things some of which may even have some connection to the truth tell him it was as well he was mistaken tell him his notempire would have suffered dreadful damage had he proved correct this time von ribbentrop replied at some length and apparently with some heat he denies that deutschland needs to fear the empire and the race he says that as the race has been dilatory in these negotiations his notempire is within its rights to resume conflict at a time and in a manner of its choosing he does regret having misinformed you at that time and in that manner however generous of him the fleetlord remarked tell him we have not been dilatory point out to him that we have the essentials of agreement with the sssr and with the usa tell him it is the intransigent attitude of his own notemperor over poland that has led to this impasse again uotat translated von ribbentrop let out several yips of tosevite laughter before answering he says that any agreement with the sssr is of less worth than the sheet of paper on which its terms are stated even before von ribbentrop had finished molotov began speaking in his own language which to atvar sounded different from english but no more beautiful molotovs interpreter spoke to uotat who spoke to atvar he accuses the deutsche of violating agreements they have made and cites examples do you want the full listing exalted fleetlord never mind atvar told him i have heard it before and can retrieve the data whenever necessary von ribbentrop spoke again he points out exalted fleetlord that the sssr has a long frontier with china where conflict against the local big uglies continues he also points out that one chinese faction is ideologically akin to the faction ruling the sssr he asks how we can imagine the males of the sssr will not continue to supply their fellow factionalists with munitions even after reaching agreement with the race that is an interesting question atvar said ask molotov to answer molotov did and took a while doing it though atvar could not understand his language any more than he could english he noted a difference in style between the representatives of deutschland and the sssr von ribbentrop was histrionic dramatic fond of making little points into big ones molotov took the opposite approach the fleetlord did not know what he was saying but it sounded soporific his face was almost as still as that of a male of the race which for a big ugly was most unusual uotat reported the male molotov states that a large number of soviet weapons and munitions are already in china they were sent there to aid the chinese or one faction of them in their struggle against nippon prior to our arrival here he further states that because of this the sssr cannot be held liable if such weapons and munitions are discovered in china wait atvar said the sssr and nippon were not at war with each other when we came to this miserable mudball yet molotov admits to aiding a chinese faction against the nipponese he does exalted fleetlord the translator replied then ask him why we should not expect the sssr to supply the chinese with arms against us with whom his notempire also would not be at war uotat spoke molotov answered his interpreter relayed his words to uotat and uotat to atvar he says that unlike the nipponese the race would have both the power and the interest to punish any such violations such breathtaking cynicism made the fleetlord let out a sharp hiss nevertheless the approach was realistic enough to make dealing possible tell him violationswill be punished he said and added an emphatic cough he acknowledges your concern uotat said after atvar had spoken how good of him to do so atvar said and now back to the matter of poland which appears to be the principal concern remaining before us here as he spoke he wondered if that would be true in the long run china had a much larger area and many more big uglies living in it than poland did it also had a long frontier with the sssr that even the races technology would have a hard time sealing sooner or later the males of the sssr would try to cheat and then deny theyd done it he could feel that coming the male from britain spoke up a moment please he was polite he waited for uotat to gesture for him to continue before going on i must reiterate that his majestys government while acknowledging the races conquest of large portions of our empire cannot consider any sort of formal recognition of these conquests without in return obtaining a ceasefire identical in formality and dignity to the ones to which you have agreed with the united states the soviet union and germany so long as the conquest is real whether you recognize it does not matter atvar replied a great deal of history contradicts you eden said as far as atvar was concernedtosev did not have a great deal of history he did not say that it only nettled the big uglies what he did say was you must know why britain is not in the same class as the notempires you named we have no atomic weapons the british male answered and you must know that is not necessarily a permanent condition for a moment atvar was tempted to grant the british the formal ceasefire they craved on the spot if for no other reason than to inhibit their nuclear research program but he held silent with three tosevite notempires already in possession of atomic weapons what did one more matter even if the british could make good on the warning poland he said is and must be ours von ribbentrop declared nyetatvar understood that word without any help from the interpreters molotov used it so much it had become unmistakable the race shall for the time being retain possession of those parts of poland it now holds the fleetlord said we shall continue discussion with deutschland with the sssr and even with the poles and jews in an effort to find a solution satisfactory to all parties general secretary stalin has instructed me to acquiesce in this molotov said thefuhrer does not will not and cannot agree von ribbentrop said i warn you and thefuhrer once more if you resume your war against the race and especially if you resume it with nuclear weapons your notempire will suffer the most severe consequences imaginable atvar said von ribbentrop did not answer not to bellow defiance not even to acknowledge hed heard the only thing that worried atvar worse than a blustering defiant big ugly was a silent one ludmila gorbunova pressed the selfstarter of the fieselerstorch the argus engine came to life at once she was not surprised german machinery worked well ignacy waved to her she nodded back as she built up revolutions she would have had to push thestorch hard to get it airborne before it rammed the trees ahead her old u could never have taken off in so short a space she nodded again more partisans bent to remove the blocks of wood in front of the light planes wheels at the same time ludmila released the brake thestorch bounded forward when she pulled back on the stick its nose came up and it sprang into the air she could see the trees through the cockpit glasshouse dark shapes down there almost close enough to reach out and touch the poles whose candles had marked the edge of the forest for her now blew them out she buzzed along steadily not wanting to gain much altitude as long as she was on the lizard side of the line she might be shot down as an enemy ironic that shed have to make it to germanheld territory to feel safe safe wasnt all she hoped shed feel by the coordinates she was returning to the same landing strip shed used before with luck heinrich jager would be there waiting for her off to the right muzzle flashes blazed in the darkness something hit the side of the fuselage once with a sound like a stone clattering off a tin roof ludmila gave thestorch more throttle getting out of there as fast as she could that complicated her navigation if she was going faster she needed to fly for less time how much less she worked the answer out in her head decided she didnt like it and worked it out again by the time she discovered where shed gone wrong the first time a glance at her watch warned her it was time to start looking around for the landing strip she hoped she wouldnt have to do a search spiral the germans were liable to start shooting at her if she buzzed around for too long and the spiral might take her back over lizardheld territory if it got too big there as usual the lanterns marking the landing strip were small and dim but she spotted them lowering the enormous flaps on thestorch killed airspeed almost as if she were stepping on the brakes on the highway the light plane jounced to a stop well within the area the lanterns marked off ludmila flipped up the cockpit door she climbed out onto the wing then jumped down to the ground men came trotting up toward thestorch in the darkness she couldnt be sure if any of them was jager they recognized her before she could make out who they were thereyou see gunther one of them said itis the lady pilot he gave the word the feminine ending as jager sometimes did as she had so often heard georg schultz do she wondered what might have happened to schultz and tatiana but only for a moment as far as she was concerned they deserved each other jayou were right johannes another german answered only goes to show nobody can be wrongall the time a couple of snorts floated out of the night gunther johannesyou are the men from colonel jagers panzer not so ludmila called quietly is heis he here too no point pretending she didnt care they couldnt help knowing about her and jager the panzer crewmen stopped in their tracks almost as if theyd run into an invisible wall no hes not here one of themgunther she thoughtanswered he spoke hardly above a whisper as if he didnt want his words to go beyond the span of thestorchs wings ice ran down ludmilas back tell me she said is he hurt is he dead did it happen before the ceasefire started tell me hes not deadyet gunther said even more softly than before hes not even hurtyet and no it didnt happen in the fighting with the lizards it happened three days ago as a matter of fact whathappened ludmila demanded maddeningly gunther fell silent after a moment when ludmila felt like yanking out her pistol and extorting answers at gunpoint if need be the crewman named johannes said miss the ss arrested him bozhemoiludmila whispered why what could he have done was it on account of me damned if we know johannes said this weedy little ss pigdog came up pointed a gun at him and marched him away stinking blackshirt bastardwho does he think he is arresting the best commander weve ever had his crewmen muttered profane agreement it would have been loud profane agreement except they were all veterans and wary of letting anyone outside their circle know their thoughts one of them said come on boys were supposed to be loading ammo into this miserable little plane it has to be because of me ludmila said shed always worried the nkvd would descend on her because of jager now instead his nations security forces had seized him on account of her that struck her as frightful and dreadfully unfair is there any way to get him free from the ss said the crewman whod just urged getting the mm rounds aboard thestorch he sounded incredulous evidently the nazis invested their watchdogs with the same fearsome almost supernatural powers the russian people attributed to the nkvd but the tankman called gunther said christ crucified why not you think skorzeny would sit around on his can and let anything happen to colonel jager no matter whod grabbed him my left nut he would hes an ss man yes but hes a real soldier too not just a damned traffic cop in a black shirt shit if we cant break the colonel out we dont deserve to be panzer troopers come on he was aflame with the idea that cautious crewman spoke up again all right what if we do break him out where does he go after that no one answered him for a couple of seconds then johannes let out a noise that would have been a guffaw if he hadnt put a silencer on it he pointed to the fieselerstorch well break him out well stick him on the plane and the lady pilot can fly him the hell out of here if the ss has its hooks in him he wont want to stick around anyhow thats for damn sure the other panzer crewmen crowded around him pumping his hand and pounding him on the back so did ludmila then she said can you do this without danger to yourselves just watch us johannes said he started away from thestorch calling the pilots got engine troubles were going to get a mechanic and off they went tramping through the night with sudden purpose in their stride ludmila left by herself thought about loading some of the german ammunition into thestorch herself in the end she decided not to she might want every gram of power the light plane had and extra weight aboard would take some away a cricket chirped somewhere out in the darkness waiting stretched her hand went to the butt of the tokarev she wore on her hip if shooting broke out shed run toward it but except for insects the night stayed silent one of thewehrmacht men who marked out the landing strip with lanterns called to heralles gut fraulein jashe answeredalles gut how much of a liar was she booted feet trotting on dirt coming closer fast ludmila stiffened all she could see out there in the grassscented night were moving shapes she couldnt even tell how many till they got close one two three four five ludmila was it it was jagers voice dashe answered forgetting her german something glittered one of the panzer men with jager plunged a knife into the dirt again and againto clean it maybebefore he set it back in the sheath on his belt when he spoke he proved to have gunthers voice get the colonel out of here lady pilot we didnt leave any eyes to see who we werehis hand caressed the hilt of the knife again just for a momentand everybody here is part of the regiment nobodyll rat on uswe did what needed doing thats all youre every one of you crazy thats all jager said warm affection in his voice his crewman crowded round him pressing his hand hugging him wishing him well that would have told ludmila everything she needed to know about him as an officer but shed already formed her own conclusions there she pointed to the dim shapes of the ammunition crates youll have to get rid of those she reminded the tankmen they were supposed to come with me well take care of it lady pilot gunther promised well take care of everything dont you worry about it we may be criminalsja but by jesus were not halfassed criminals the other tankers rumbled lowvoiced agreement ludmila was willing to believe german efficiency extended to crime she tapped jager on the shoulder to separate him from his comrades then pointed to the open door of the fieselerstorch get in she said take the rear seat the one with the machine gun wed better not have to use it he answered hooking a foot in the stirrup at the bottom of the fuselage that let him climb up onto the wing and into the cockpit ludmila followed she pulled down the door and dogged it shut her finger stabbed at the selfstarter the motor caught she watched the soldiers scatter glad she hadnt had to ask one to spin the prop for her have you got your belt on she asked jager when he said yes she let thestorch scoot forward across the field the acceleration might have shoved her passenger out of his seat if he hadnt been strapped in place as usual the light plane needed only a handful of ground on which to take off after one last hard bump it sprang into the air jager leaned to one side to peer down at the landing strip so did ludmila but there wasnt much to see now that they were airborne the fellows with the lanterns had doused them she supposedshe hopedthey were helping jagers crewmen get the ammunition either under cover or back into the regimental store over her shoulder she asked him are you all right pretty much so he answered they hadnt done much of the strongarm stuff yetthey werent sure how big a traitor i am he laughed bitterly then amazed her by going on a lot bigger than they ever imagined ill tell you that where are we going ludmila was swinging thestorch back toward the east i was going to take you to the partisan unit ive been with for a while no one will try and come after you there i shouldnt think well have a good many kilometers between us and germanheld territory is that good enough no not nearly he said again surprising her can you fly me down to lodz if you like you can let me out of the airplane and go back to the partisans yourself but i have to go there no matter what why she could hear the hurt in her own voice here at last they had the chance to be together and stay together and what could be so important in lodz thats a long story jager said and then proceeded to compress it with a forceful brevity that showed his officers discipline the more he talked the wider ludmilas eyes gotno the ss hadnt arrested him on account of her not at all he finished and so if i dont get back into lodz skorzeny is liable to blow up the town and all the people and lizards in it and if he does that what becomes of the ceasefire what becomes of thevaterland and what becomes of the world ludmila didnt answer for a few seconds then very quietly she said whatever you call yourself you werent a traitor she gained a little altitude before swinging thestorch in a rightward bank numbers spun round the dial of the compass on the instrument panel till it steadied on southsoutheast well both go to lodz ludmila said xix ttomalss must have slept through the opening of the outer door to the building that confined him the sharp click of the lock to the inner door though brought him up to his feet from the hard floor his eye turrets swiveling wildly as he tried to see what was going on next to no light came through the narrow window that illuminated and ventilated his cell fear coursed through him the big uglies had never come here at night before like any male of the race he found a break in routine threatening in and of itself this particular change he suspected would have felt ominous even to a tosevite the door opened not one but three big uglies came in each carried in one hand a lantern burning some smelly fat or oil and in the other a submachine gun the lanterns were primitive much the sort of tools the race had expected the natives of tosev to possess the submachine guns unfortunately were not in the dim flickering light ttomalss needed a moment to recognize liu han superior female he gasped when he did she did not answer right away but stood looking at him he commended his spirit to emperors past confident they would care for it better than the races authorities had protected his body while he lived be still liu han snapped ttomalss waited for the weapon in her hand to stitch him full of holes instead of shooting him though she set it on the floor she pulled out something she had tucked into the waist of her cloth legcovering a sack made of coarse heavy fabric while the two males with her kept their submachine guns pointed at ttomalss liu han came up to him and pulled the sack down over his head he stood frozen not daring to resistif they shoot me now i will not see the guns go off before the bullets strike he thought liu han tied the bag closed around his neck not quite tight enough to choke off his breath can he see one of the males asked then the fellow spoke directly to ttomalss can you see miserable scaly devil miserable ttomalss was no superior sir he answered truthfully liu han shoved him he almost fell over when he recovered she put a hand in the middle of his back you walk in the directions i choose for you she said first in chinese and then in the language of the race only in those directions she used an emphatic cough it shall be done ttomalss gasped maybe they were just taking him out to shoot him somewhere else but if they were wouldnt they have told him as much so they could enjoy his terrified anticipation big uglies were dreadfully sophisticated when it came to inflicting pain liu han shoved him again lightly this time he walked forward till she said go left and emphasized that by moving the hand on his back in the appropriate way he turned to the left why not in the sphere of blackness in which he moved one direction was as good as another a little later liu han said go right ttomalss went right he had not known where he was when he set out had he known he soon would have become hopelessly lost he turned right and left and right and left tens of times with what seemed to him random intervals and choices the streets of peking were very quiet he guessed it was somewhere between the middle of the night and dawn but could not be certain at last liu han said stop ttomalss did in apprehension was this the moment was this the place liu han untied the cord fastening the cloth sack over his head she said count to one hundred out loud slowly in your language then lift off the hood if you lift it before you reach one hundred youwill die at once do you understand yyes superior female ttomalss quavered it shall be done one two three he went on as steadily as he could ninetyeight ninetynine one hundred as he reached for the sack he waited for bullets to tear into him he yanked the cloth from his head in a quick convulsive gesture no one shot him his eye turrets scanned all around he was alone at the mouth of one of pekings innumerable littlehutungs he threw down the sack the softthwap it made hitting the ground was the only sound that reached his hearing diaphragms ever so cautiously he stepped out into the street onto which thehutung opened to his amazement he recognized it it was the lower slanting street in chinese thehsia hsieh chieh and there stood the ruins of thechang chun ssu the temple of everlasting spring he knew how to get back to the races headquarters in the center of peking he did not know if he would be allowed to do so but he knew he had to try the lower slanting street even led in the right direction before long he ran into a patrol of males of the race where the tosevites had let him go the patrol almost shot him before recognizing him as one of their ownthat would have been an irony on which to end his career but when he told them who he was they hurried him off to the thoroughly fortified citadel the race retained in what had been the forbidden city he was pleased to find his arrival important enough to justify rousing ppevel soon the assistant administrator eastern region main continental mass came into the chamber where ttomalss was enjoying proper food for the first time in ever so long and said i am glad to see you at liberty once more researcher the tosevites informed us yesterday they would release you but they are not always reliable in their assertions as you know truth superior siras i know too well ttomalss said with an emphatic cough did they saywhy they were releasing me to me they never gave a reason without waiting for an answer he dug into the plate of fried worms the cooks had given him even though theyd been desiccated for the trip to tosev and then reconstituted they were still a taste of home ppevel said by their messages partly as a goodwill gesture and partly as a warning typical of the big uglies to try to do both at once as if to give his words a different sort of emphatic cough a rattle of gunfire broke out off in the distance he went on they say this shows us they can move at will through this city and other cities in this notempire releasing whom they will taking whom they will killing whom they will they warn us the struggle to integrate china into the empire will fail before coming down to the surface of tosev perhaps even before his kidnapping ttomalss would have found that laughable ludicrous nowthey are determined superior sir and they are both ingenious and surprisingly well armed i fear they may trouble us for years maybe generations to come it could be so ppevel admitted which surprised ttomalss he said while i was a captive the female liu han claimed the race had granted certain tosevite notempires a ceasefire can this be so it can it is ppevel said these are the notempires capable of producing their own nuclear weapons and desperate enough to use them against us chinaall of its factionshas no such weapons and is excluded from the ceasefire this offends the chinese or so it would seem and so they redouble their annoyances in an effort to be included the racetreating with barbarous tosevites as if they were equals ttomalss looked up toward the ceiling in wonder and dismay even from your mouth superior sir i have trouble believing it its truth nonetheless ppevel answered even with these chinese we have negotiated as you know though we have not granted them the concessions the other notempires have gained we shall share dominion of this planet with the tosevites until the colonization fleet arrives perhaps we shall share it after the colonization fleet arrives i would not care to guess as to that it is the fleetlords decision not mine ttomalss head reeled almost as if he had ingested too much of the tosevite herb so many males found alluring so much had changed while he lay in captivity he would have to work hard to adapt himself always unsettling to the race he said we shall need more than ever then to seek to understand the essential nature of the big uglies truth ppevel agreed when you are physically recovered from your ordeal researcher we shall obtain for you with the greatest discretion possible a new tosevite hatchling with which you can resume your interrupted work thank you superior sir ttomalss said his voice far more hollow than he would have expected after what had happened to him with the last hatchingwith liu mei he made himself rememberthe work that had once consumed him now seemed liable to be more dangerous than it was worth with your generous permission superior sir i shall carry on this research back aboard a starship laboratory rather than here on the surface of tosev that may well be arranged ppevel said thank you superior sir ttomalss repeated he hoped the distance between the surface and the cleanness of open space would protect him from big uglies wild for revenge because of their familial and sexual structure he hoped sobut he was not so confident of it as he had been in the days when tosev was new and conquest had seemed certain to be quick and easy he cherished that certainty and knew he would never have its like again patients and refugees crowded around the lizard with the fancy body paint and the handheld electrified megaphone rance auerbach moved up slowly and carefullythe only way of moving he hadto get as good a vantage point as he could since so many other people had as much trouble moving as he did he got up pretty close almost to the guntoting guards around the speaker he looked around for penny summers and spotted her on the opposite side of the crowd he waved to her but she didnt see him the electrified megaphone made flatulent noises somewhere close by a child laughed then in pretty fair english the lizard began to speak we leave this place now the race and the government of this notempire here the united states we make agreement now no more fight the race to leave the land of the united states that include this place this karval colorado too he couldnt go on not right away a buzz ran through the crowd and then a cheer a woman started singing god bless america inside the second line of the song everybody there was singing with her tears stung auerbachs eyes the lizards were leaving they had won even getting shot up suddenly seemed worth it when the singing stopped the lizard resumed you free now yes more cheers rang out we go now auerbach cut loose with a rebel yell more of a coughing yip than the wild shriek hed wanted but good enough the lizard went on now you free now we gonow we not have to take care for you no more we go we leave notempire of united states to take care for you now they do it or nobody do it we go now that is all the lizard guards had to gesture threateningly with their weapons before the people would clear aside and let them and the speaker out for a few dreadful seconds auerbach was afraid they would start shooting with people packed so tight around them that would have been a slaughter he made his halting way toward penny summers this time she did spot him and moved far more nimbly than he could to meet him what did that scaly bastard mean exactly she asked way he was talking it sounded like the lizards are just gonna up and leave us on our own they couldnt do that auerbach said theres what thousands of people here and a lot of emme for instancearent what youd call good at getting around what are we supposed to do walk to the american lines up near denver he laughed at the absurdity of the notion but the lizards didnt think it was absurd they piled into trucks and armored personnel carriers and rolled out of karval that afternoon heading east back toward wherever their spaceships were parked by the time the sun went down karval was an altogether human town again it was a goodsized human town too and one utterly without government of any sort the lizards had taken as many of the supplies as they could load into their vehicles fights broke out over what was left penny managed to get hold of some hard biscuits and shared them with rance they made his belly rumble a little less than it would have without them off to the left not quite far enough away from his convalescent tent to be out of earshot somebody said we ought to string up all the stinking bastards who kissed the lizards butts while they was here string em up by the balls matter of fact auerbach shivered not so much because of what the fellow said as at the calm matteroffact way he said it in europe theyd called people whod gone along with the nazis people like quisling collaborators auerbach had never figured anybody would need to worry about collaborators in the usa but he didnt know everything there was to know either penny said theres gonna be trouble anybody whos got a score to settle against somebody else will say they went along with the lizards whos gonna be able to sort out whats true and what aint families will be feuding a hundred years from now on account o this youre probably right rance said but theres going to be trouble sooner than that he was thinking like a soldier the lizards may have pulled out of here but the army hasnt pulled in well eat karval empty by tomorrow at the latest and then what do we do walk toward denver i reckon penny answered what else can we do not much he said but walkwhat a hundred miles maybe he gestured toward the crutches that lay by his cot you might as well go on without me ill meet you there in a month maybe six weeks dont be silly penny told him youre doin a lot better than you were i know but im not doing well enough you will be she said confidently besides i dont want to leave you darling she blew out the one flickering candle that lit the inside of the tent in the darkness he heard cloth rustle when he reached out toward her his hand brushed warm bare flesh a little later she rode astride him groaning both in ecstasy and he thought in desperation tooor maybe he was just guessing she felt the same thing he did afterwards not bothering to dress she slept beside him in the tent he woke before sunrise and woke her too if were going to do this he said wed better get started early as we can that way we can go a long way before it gets too hot and lie up during the hottest part of the day sounds good to me penny said the eastern sky was just going pink when they set out they were far from the first to leave karval singly and in small groups some people were making their way north along one of the roads that led out of town others along the westbound road and a few hearty souls splitting the difference heading northwest crosscountry had auerbach been in better shape he would have done that as things were he and penny went west the horse river was likelier to have water in it still than any of the streams they would cross heading north he was stronger and better on his crutches than he had been but that still left him weak and slow men and women passed penny and him in a steady stream refugees from karval stretched out along the road as far as he could see some of us are going to die before we get to denver he said the prospect upset him much less than it would have before he got wounded hed had a dress rehearsal for meeting the grim reaper really doing it couldnt be a whole lot worse penny pointed up to the sky the wheeling black specks up there werent lizard airplanes or even piper cubs they were buzzards waiting with the patient optimism of their kind penny didnt say anything she didnt need to rance wondered if one of those buzzards would gnaw his bones he needed two days to get to the horse had its bed been dry he knew he wouldnt have got much farther but people crowded the bank down where the river passed under highway the water was warm and muddy and there not twenty feet away some idiot was pissing into the stream auerbach didnt care about any of it he drank till he was full he splashed his face he soaked his head and then he took off his shirt and soaked that too as it dried it would help keep him cool penny splashed water on her blouse the wet cotton molded itself to her shape auerbach would have appreciated that more had he not been so deadly weary as things were he nodded and said good idea lets get going they headed north up highway and reached punkin center early the next morning they got more water there a sadeyed local said wish we could give you some eats folksyou look like you could use em but the ones ahead o you done et us out of what we had good luck to you i told you to go on without me auerbach said penny ignored him one foot and two crutches at a time he wearily plodded north by the end of that afternoon he figured the buzzards were out tying napkins around their necks getting ready for a delicious supper of sunbaked cavalry captain if he fell over and died he figured penny could speed up and might make it to limon before the heat and the dry and the hunger got her i love you he croaked not wanting to die with things left unspoken i love you too she answered thats why im gonna get you through he laughed but before he could tell her how big a joke that was he heard cheering up ahead he pointed balancing for a moment on one foot and one crutch thats an army wagon he said in glad disbelief the horses were the most beautiful animals hed ever seen the wagon was already full but the soldiers gave him and penny canteens and crackers and scooted people around to make room in back well get you up to the resettlement center one of them promised and theyll take care of you there that took another couple of days but there were supply depots all the way auerbach spent his time wondering what the resettlement center would be like the soldiers didnt talk much about it when they finally got there he found out why it was just another name for a refugee camp one dwarfing the squalid miserable place outside karval how long will we have to stay here he asked a harried clerk who was handing penny bedding for two and directing her to an enormous olivedrab communal tent one of many all in a row god knows buddy the corporal answered the war may be stopped but this aint no easy street aint gonna be for a long time neither welcome to the united states new and not so improved model with luck you wont starve well take that penny said and auerbach had to nod together they set off to acquaint themselves with the new united states in his green undershirt and black panzer mans trousers heinrich jager didnt look badly out of place on the streets of lodz lots of men wore odds and ends of german uniform and if his was in better shape than most that meant little his colonels blouse on the other hand hed ditched as soon as he jumped out of thestorch awehrmacht officer was not a popular thing to be not here ludmila strode along beside him her clothesa peasant tunic and a pair of trousers that had probably once belonged to a polish soldierwere mannish but no one save a particularly nearsighted lizard could have mistaken her for the male of the species even with an automatic pistol on her hip neither pants nor sidearm drew any special notice a lot of women wore trousers instead of skirts or dresses and a surprising numbermost but not all of them jewishlookingcarried or wore firearms do you know lodz at all ludmila asked do you know how to findthe person were looking for she was too sensible to name mordechai anielewicz where anyone might overbear his name jager shook his head no and no respectively he kept his voice low nobody who spoke germanwehrmacht officer or not was likely to be popular in lodz these days not with jews not with poles and not with lizards either i expect well find him though in his own way hes a big man here he thought about asking a policeman he had a couple of different brands from which to choose poles in dark blue uniforms and jews with armbands left over from german administration and with kepis that made them look absurdly like frenchflics that didnt strike him as a healthy idea though instead he and ludmila kept walking north up stodolniana street till they came to what had to have been the jewish quarter even now it was brutally crowded what it had been like under thereich was something jager would sooner not have contemplated many more of those comicopera jewish policemen were on the street in that part of town jager kept right on ignoring them and hoping they would extend him the same courtesy he nodded to a fellow with a wild mop of hair and a big curly reddish beard who carried a mauser had another slung over his shoulder and wore crisscross bandoliers full of brass cartridges a jewish bandit if ever there was one and as such a man likely to know where anielewicz could be found im looking for mordechai he said the jews eyes widened slightly at his clear germannu are you he said using yiddish perhaps to see if jager could follow jager nodded again to show he could the jewish fighter went on so youre looking for mordechai so what is he looking for you as a matter of fact yes jager answered does the name skorzeny mean anything to you it did the fighter stiffened youre him he demanded and made as if to point the rifle he carried at jager then he checked himself no you cant be hes supposed to be taller than i am and youre not youre right jager pointed to ludmilashes really skorzeny ha the jew said a funny man all right funny man you can come with me well see if mordechai wants to see you see both of you he amended seeing how close ludmila stuck to jager as it happened they didnt have to go far jager recognized the brick building they approached as a fire station his escort spoke in polish to a graybearded man tinkering with the fire engine the fellow answered in the same language jager caught anielewiczs name but no more ludmila said i think they said hes upstairs but im not sure she proved right the jew made his companions precede him a sensible precaution jager would also have taken they went down the hall to a small room mordechai anielewicz sat at a table there with a plain woman he was scribbling something but stopped when the newcomers arrived jager he exclaimed what the devil are you doing here you know him the gingerbearded jew sounded disappointed he knows something about skorzeny he says ill listen to him anielewicz glanced at ludmila whos your friend she answered for herself with manifest pride ludmila vadimovna gorbunova senior lieutenant red air force red air force anielewiczs lips silently shaped the words you have the oddest friends jagerher and me for instance what would hitler say if he knew hed say i was dead meat jager answered of course since i was already under arrest for treason hes already said that or his bully boys have right now i want to keep him from blowing up lodz and maybe keep the lizards from blowing up germany to pay him back for better or worse it still is my fatherland skorzeny doesnt care what happens next hell touch that thing off for no better reason than because someone told him to you were right the woman beside anielewicz said you did see him then i thought you were worrying over every little thing i wish i had been bertha he replied worry and affection warring in his voice he turned his attention back to jager i didnt think anybodyhed probably been about to say something likeeven you damned nazis but forborewould explode the bomb in the middle of truce talks shows what i know doesnt it his gaze sharpened you were arrested for treason you saygevalt they found you were passing things to us they found out i was yes jager answered with a weary nod since his rescue things had happened too fast for him to take them all in at once for now he was trying to roll with each one as it hit later if there was a later and it wasnt frantic hed do his best to figure out what everything meant karol is dead one more memory he wished he didnt have they didnt really have any idea how much i was passing on to you if theyd known a tenth part of it id have been in pieces on the floor when my boys came to break me outand if my boys knew a tenth part of it they never would have come anielewicz studied him quietly the younger man said if it hadnt been for you we wouldnt have known about the bomb it would have gone off and god only knows what would have happened next he offered the words as in consolation for jagers having been rescued by his men when they didnt know what hed truly done he understood with a good officers instinctive grasp how hard that was to accept you say you saw skorzeny jager asked and anielewicz nodded jager grimaced you must have found the bomb too he said it was in a graveyard did you move it after you found it yes and that wasnt easy either anielewicz said wiping his forehead with a sleeve to show how hard it was we pulled the detonator toonot just the wireless switch but the manual deviceso skorzeny cant set it off even if he finds it and even if he gets to it jager held up a warning hand dont bet your life on that he may come up with the detonator you yanked or he may have one of his own you never want to underestimate what he can do dont forget ive helped him do it if he has only a detonator for use by the hand ludmila said in her slow german would he not be blowing himself up along with everything else if he had to would he do that good question anielewicz looked from her to jager you know him best he made that an accusationnu would he i know two things jager answered first one is hes liable to have some sort of scheme for setting it off by hand and escaping anyhowno i have no idea what but he may second one is you didnt just make him angry you made him furious when his nervegas bomb didnt go off he owes you one for that and he has his orders and whatever else you can say about him hes a brave man if the only way he can set it off is to blow himself up with it hes liable to be willing to do that mordechai anielewicz nodded looking unhappy i was afraid you were going to say that people who will martyr themselves for their cause are much harder to deal with than the ones who just want to live for it his chuckle held little humor the lizards complain too many people are willing to become martyrs now i know how they feel what will you do with us now that we are here ludmila asked that is another good question said the womanberthasitting by anielewicz she turned to him fondly jager wondered if they were married she wore no ring whatever that meant what shall we do with them jager is a soldier and a good one and he knows skorzeny and the way his mind works the jewish fighting leader said if he had not been reliable before he would not be here now him we will give a weapon and let him help us guard the bomb and what of me ludmila demanded indignantly jager could have guessed she was going to do that her hand came to rest on the butt of her automatic pistol i am a soldier ask heinrich ask the nazis ask the lizards anielewicz held up a placatory hand i believe all this he answered but first things first yes he was a good officer not that jager found that news he knew how to set priorities he also knew how to laugh which he did now and you will probably shoot me if i try to separate you from colonel jager here so all rightwehrmacht red air force a bunch of crazy jewswe are all in this together right together jager agreed together we save lodz or together we go up in smoke thats about how it is a male shook ussmak get up headmale you must get up oyyag said urgently adding an emphatic cough that is the signal for rousing if you do not present yourself you will be punished the whole barracks will be punished because of your failing ever so slowly ussmak began to move among the race superiors were supposed to be responsible for inferiors and to look out for their interests so it had been for millennia uncounted so on home it no doubt continued to be here on tosev ussmak was an outlaw that weakened his bonds of cohesion to the group though some of them were mutineers too even more to the point he was a starved exhausted outlaw when you were less than convinced your own life would long continuewhen you were less than convinced you wanted it to continuegroup solidarity came hard he managed to drag himself to his feet and lurch outside for the morning inspection the tosevite guards who probably could not have stated their correct number of thumbs twice running without luck on their side had to count the males of the race four times before they were satisfied no one had grown wings and flown away during the night then they let them go in to breakfast it was meager even by the miserable standards of the prison camp ussmak did not finish even his own small portion eat oyyag urged him how can you get through another days work if you do not eat ussmak had his own counterquestion how can i get through another days work even if i do eat anyhow i am not hungry that set the other male hissing in alarm headmale you must report to the big ugly physicians perhaps they can give you something to improve your appetite to improve your condition ussmaks mouth fell open a new body perhaps a new spirit you cannot eat oyyag said ussmaks weary gesture showed he could not his companion in misery who was every bit as thin as he was hesitated but not for long may i consume your portion then when ussmak did not at once say no the other male gulped down the food as if in a dream ussmak shambled out to the forest with his work gang he drew an axe and went slowly to work hacking down a tree with pale bark he chopped at it with all his strength but made little progress work harder you the tosevite guard watching him snapped in the russki language it shall be done ussmak answered he did some more chopping with results equally unsatisfactory to the guard when he first came to the camp that would have left him quivering with fear now it rolled off his skinny flanks they had put him here try as they would how could they do worse he shambled back to camp for lunch worn as he was he could eat little again someone quickly disposed of his leftovers when too soon it was time to return to the forest he stumbled and fell and had trouble getting up again another male aided him half guiding half pushing him out toward the tosevite trees he took up his axe and went back to work on the palebarked tree try as he would he could not make the blade take more than timid nips at the trunk he was too weak and too apathetic for anything more if he did not chop it down if the work gang did not saw it into the right lengths of wood they would fall short of their norm and would get only penalty rationsso what ussmak thought he hadnt been able to eat a regular ration so why should he care if he got less all the other males would get less too of course he could not care about that either a proper male of the race would have he knew as much but hed begun to get detached from the rest of the race when a tosevite sniper killed votal his first landcruiser commander ginger had made things worse then hed lost another good landcruiser crew and then hed led the mutiny for which hed had such hope and the results of that had been this no he was no proper male no longer he was so tired he set down the axeill rest for a moment he thought work a guard shouted gavnoussmak said adding an interrogative cough grudgingly the big ugly swung aside the muzzle of his weapon and bobbed his head up and down to grant permission the guards let you evacuate your bowelsmost of the time it was one of the few things they did let you do stumbling slowly away from the tree ussmak went behind a screen of bushes he squatted to relieve himself nothing happenednot surprising not when he was so empty inside he tried to rise but instead toppled over onto his side he took a breath a little later he took another quite a bit later he took one more of themselves the nictitating membranes slid across his eyes his eyelids drooped closed in those last moments he wondered if emperors past would accept his spirit in spite of all he had done soon he found out what he would find out when the lizard didnt come out of the bushes after taking a shit yuri andreyevich palchinsky went in after it he had to scuffle around to find it and it would not come out when he called stinking thing will pay he muttered then he did find it by tripping over it and almost falling on his face he cursed and drew back his foot to give it a good kick but didnt why bother the damn thing was already dead he picked it up slung it over his shoulderit didnt weigh anything to speak ofand carried it back toward the camp off to one side was a trench in which to toss the ones who starved or worked themselves to death this week in went the latest body on top of a lot of others were liable to fill this one up before its time to dig next weeks palchinsky muttered he shrugged that wasnt his worry the work gang was he turned his back on the mass grave and headed out to the woods we have shown we can be merciful liu han declared we have let one little scaly devil go back to his kind in spite of his crimes against the workers and peasantsi have let him go in spite of his crimes against me she added to herselflet no one say now that i cannot put the interests of the party the interests of the peoples liberation army above my own in a few days the truce to which we agreed with the scaly devils expires they still refuse to make us party to the larger ceasefire we shall show them we can be strong as dragons too they will become sorry enough to make concessions she sat down the men of the peking central committee put their heads together discussing what she had said and how she said it nieh hoting murmured something to a newcomer a handsome plumpcheeked man whose name she hadnt caught the man nodded he sent liu han an admiring glance she wondered if he was admiring her words or her body she stared back steadily measuring him with her eyescountry bumpkin she decided forgetting for a moment how recently she had been a peasant with no politics whatever sitting on niehs other side was hsia shoutao he got to his feet liu han had been sure he would if she said the yangtze flowed from west to east he would disagree because she had said it nieh hoting raised a warning finger but hsia plunged ahead anyhow zeal is important to the revolutionary cause but so is caution through too much aggressiveness we are liable to force the little devils into strong responses against us a campaign of lowlevel harassment strikes me as a better plan one more likely to yield the results we desire than going at once from truce to allout war hsia looked around the room to see what sort of reaction hed received several men were nodding but others among them four or five upon whom hed counted sat silent and stony liu han smiled inside while keeping her own features impassive as was her way shed prepared this ground before she began to fight on it had hsia shoutao an ounce of sense he would have realized that beforehand learning of it now the hard way made his face take on almost the rictus of agony it had worn when liu han kneed him in the private parts to her surprise the bumpkinish fellow by nieh hoting spoke up while war and politics cannot be divorced for a single instant still it is sometimes necessary to remind the foe that power springs ultimately from the barrel of a gun the little scaly devils in my view must be forcibly shown that their occupation is temporary and shall in the end surely fail thus as comrade liu has so ably stated we shall strike them a series of hard blows the instant the truce expires gauging our subsequent actions on their response he didnt talk like a bumpkin be talked like an educated man perhaps even a poet and now up and down the table heads bobbed in approval of his words liu han saw more was involved there than how well hed spoken he had authority here authority everyone acknowledged without question she wished shed learned what his name was as usual mao tsetung analyzes clearly nieh hoting said his viewpoint is most reasonable and we shall carry out our program against the little scaly devils as he directs again the members of the peking central committee nodded as if a single puppeteer controlled all their heads liu han nodded along with everyone else her eyes were wide with amazement though as she stared at the man who headed the revolutionary cause throughout china mao tsetung had thought well of somethingshe said he looked back at her beaming like ho tei the fat little god of luck in whom proper communists did not believe but whom liu han had trouble dismissing from her mind yes hed approved of her words his face said that clearly and yes he was looking at her as a man looks at a woman not crudely as hsia shoutao did when he all but spread her legs with his eyes but unmistakably all the same she wondered what she ought to do about that shed already had doubts about her attachment to nieh hoting doubts both ideological and personal she was a little surprised to note maos interest a lot of the central committee members probably most of them lusted after revolution more than after women hsia was a horrible example of why that rule worked well but mao was surely a special case shed heard he was married even if he did want her even if he did bed her she was certain he wouldnt leave his wife for her some sort of actress if she remembered rightly how much influence could she gain as a mistress and was that enough to make the offer of her body worthwhile had she felt no spark she wouldnt have considered the notion for an instant thanks to the scaly devils shed had far too much of coupling with men she did not want but shed thought mao attractive before she had any idea who he was she smiled at him just a little he smiled too politely nieh hoting noticed nothing he tended to be blind that way she sometimes thought she was more a convenience for him than a proper lover the foreign devil bobby fiore had shown far more consideration for her as a person what to do then part of that of course depended on mao but liu han with a womans ancient wisdom knew that if she showed herself to be interested he would probably lie down beside her did she want to do that hard to be sure would the benefits outweigh the risks and annoyances she didnt have to decide right away the communists thought in terms of years fiveyear plans decades of struggle the little scaly devils shed learned thought in decades centuries millennia she hated the little devils but they were too powerful to be dismissed as stupid viewed from their perspective or even that of the party leaping ahead with a seduction before you worked out the consequences was foolish nothing else but she smiled at mao again it might well not matter anyhow not today who could guess how long hed be here shed never seen him in peking before and might not see him again any time soon but he likely would come back that only stood to reason when he did she wanted him to remember her by then wheneverthen was she would have made up her mind she had plenty of time and whichever way she decided the choice would behers mordechai anielewicz had played a lot of catandmouse games since the nazis invaded poland to open the second world war in every one of them though against the germans against the lizards against what mordechai chaim rumkowski thought of as the legitimate jewish administration of lodz playing the germans and lizards off against each other hed been the mouse operating against larger more powerful foes now he was the cat and finding he didnt much care for the role somewhere out there otto skorzeny was lurking he didnt know where he didnt know how much skorzeny knew he didnt know what the ss man was planning he didnt like the feeling one bit if you were skorzeny what would you do he asked heinrich jager jager was after all not only a german but a man whod worked closely with the commando extraordinaire asking a german felt odd anyhow intellectually he knew jager was no jewbutcher emotionally the panzer colonel scratched his head if i were in charge instead of skorzeny id lie low till i knew enough to strike then hit quick and hard he chuckled wryly but whether thats what hell do i couldnt begin to tell you he has his own way of getting things done sometimes i think hes dafttill he brings it off nobodys set eyes on him since i did anielewicz said frowning he might have fallen off the face of the earththough thatd be too much to ask for wouldnt it maybe be is lying low he cant do that for too long though jager pointed out if he finds out where the bomb is hell try to set it off its late already of course and a major attack hinges on it he wont wait weve taken out the detonator mordechai said its not in the bomb any more though we can get it to the bomb in a hurry if we have to jager shrugged that shouldnt matter if skorzeny didnt bring another one hes a fooland a fool hes not besides which hes an engineer hed know how to install it an engineering student himself anielewicz grimaced he wanted nothing in common with the ss man ludmila gorbunova asked will he have men he can recruit here in lodz or is he all alone in this city anielewicz looked to jager jager shrugged again this town was under the rule of thereich for some time before the lizards came are there still germans here from the days when it was litzmannstadt you mean mordechai asked and shook his head without waiting for an answer no after the lizards came we made most of the aryan colonists pack up and go the poles did the same thing with them and do you know what we dont miss the germans a bit either jager looked at him steadily anielewicz felt himself flushing if any man alive was entitled to score points off a german soldier he wasa german soldier yes but notthis german soldier if it hadnt been forthis german soldier he wouldnt be hereto score points he had to remember that no matter how hard it was not many germans eh jager said matteroffactly if any are left skorzeny will find them and hell probably have connections among the poles they dont like you jews either was he trying to score points too mordechai couldnt be sure even if he was that didnt make him wrong ludmila said but the poles if they help skorzeny theyll be blowing themselves up too you know that jager said i know that but the poles dont necessarily know it if skorzeny says here i have a big bomb hidden that will blow up all the jews but not you theyre liable to believe him hes a good liar anielewicz asked trying to get more of a feel for his opponent than he could from the unending propaganda thereich pumped out about skorzeny but jager might have been part of gobbels propaganda mill hes good at everything that has to do with being a raider he answered with no trace of irony then proceeded to give an example he went into besancon for instance with a sack of ginger to bribe the lizards and he came out driving one of their panzers i do not believe this ludmila said before anielewicz could i heard it reported on german shortwave wireless but i do not believe it its true whether you believe it or not jager said i was there i saw his head sticking up out of the drivers hatch i didnt believe he could do it either i thought he was going in there to commit suicide nothing more i was wrong i have never underestimated him since anielewicz took that evaluation which he found almost too depressing to contemplate to solomon gruver and bertha fleishman gruvers mouth turned down at the corners making him look even gloomier than he usually did he cant be that good the former sergeant said if he were that good hed be god and he isnt hes just a man we have to put our ears to the ground among the poles bertha said if anything is going on with them we need to hear about it fast as we can mordechai sent her a grateful look she took this whole business as seriously as he did given the levelheadedness she usually displayed that was a sign it needed to be taken seriously so we listen so what gruver said if hes that good we wont hear anything we wont spot him unless he wants to be spotted and we wont know what hes up to till he decides to hit us all of which is true and none of which means we can stop trying anielewicz said he slammed his open hand into the side of the fire engine that hurt his hand more than the engine if only id been certain i recognized him if only id come out ofwhere i came out ofa few seconds earlier so i could have seen his face if if if it ate at him even thinking he was in lodz put us on alert bertha said who knows what he might have done if hed got here without our knowing it he turned a corner anielewicz said running it through his mind again like a piece of film from the cinema he turned a corner and then another one very quickly the second time i had to guess which way hed gone and i guessed wrong dont keep beating yourself over the head with it mordechai bertha said it cant be helped now and you did everything you could thats so gruver rumbled no doubt about it anielewicz hardly heard him he was looking at bertha fleishman shed never called him by his first name before not that he remembered he would have remembered too he was certain of that she was looking at him too she flushed a little when their eyes met but she didnt look away hed known she liked him well enough he liked her well enough too except when she smiled she was plain and mousy hed been to bed with women far prettier he suddenly seemed to hear solomon gruvers deep voice again goingso what gruverthatwasnt had a point hed bedded those women and enjoyed himself doing it but he hadnt for an instant thought of spending his life with any of them bertha though if we live through this he said the five words made a complete sentence if you knew how to listen to them bertha fleishman did yes if we do she replied a complete answer the real solomon gruver seemed less attentive to what was going on around him than the imaginary one inside anielewiczs head if we live through this he said were going to have to do something better with that thing we have than leaving it where it is but if we move it now we just draw attention to it and that lets this skorzenymamzer have his chance thats all true solomonevery word of it mordechai agreed solemnly then he started to laugh a moment later so did bertha and what is so funny gruver demanded with ponderous dignity did i make a joke and god forbid not know it god forbid anielewicz said and laughed harder as george bagnall and ken embry walked to dover college jet engines roared overhead bagnalls automatic reaction was to find the nearest hole in the ground and jump into it with an effort he checked himself and looked upward for once the thinking rational part of his brain had got it right those were meteors up there not lizard fighterbombers bloody hell embry burst out conditioned reflex must nearly have got the better of him too weve only been gone a year and a half but it feels as though weve stepped back into not doesnt it just bagnall agreed they were flying those things when we left but not many of them you dont see hurricanes at all any more and theyre phasing out spitfires fast as they can its a brave new world and no mistake still a place for bomber crewfor the next twenty minutes anyhow embry said they havent put jets on lancs not yet they havent but everything else they have done he shook his head no wonder they sent us back to school were almost as obsolete as if wed been flying sopwith camels trouble is of course we havent been flyinganything its even worse for jones bagnall said were still flying the same buses even if they have changed the rest of the rules his radars are starting to come from a different world literally same with our bombaiming techniques embry said as they climbed the pouredconcrete steps and strode down the corridor toward their classroom the lecturer there a flight lieutenant named constantine jordan was already scribbling on the blackboard though it still lacked a couple of minutes of the hour bagnall looked around as he took his seat most of his classmates had a pale pasty look to them some were in obvious if stifled pain that made sensebesides the rarities like bagnall and embry the people whod been out of service long enough to require refresher courses were the ones whod been badly wounded a couple had dreadful scars on their faces what lay under their uniforms was anyones guess though not one bagnall cared to make an instant before the clock in the bell tower chimed eleven flight lieutenant jordan turned and began as i noted at the end of yesterdays session what the lizards callskelkwank bids fair to revolutionize bomb aimingskelkwank light unlike the ordinary sorthe pointed up to the electric lampsis completely organized you might say its all of the same frequency the same amplitude the same phase the lizards have several ways of creating such light were busy working on them to see which ones we can most readily make for ourselves but thats largely beside the point weve captured enough generators ofskelkwank light to have equipped a good many bombers with them and thats why youre here bagnalls pencil scurried across the notebook every so often hed pause to shake his hand back and forth to wring out writers cramp all this was new to him and all vitalnow he was able to understand the term hed first met in pskov amazing all the things you could do withskelkwank light jordan went on what we do is we illuminate the target with askelkwank lamp a sensor head properly attuned to it manipulates the fins on the bomb and guides it to the target so long as the light stays on the target the guidance will work weve all seen it used against us more often than wed fancy again were operating with captured sensor heads which are in limited supply but were also exploring ways and means to manufacture them yes mr mcbride you have a question yes sir replied the flying officer whod raised his hand these new munitions are all very well sir but if were flying against the lizards how do we approach the target closely enough to have some hope of destroying it their weapons can strike us at much greater range than that at which we can respond believe me sir i know that he was one of the men who had scar tissue slagging half his face it is a difficulty jordan admitted we are also seeking to copy the guided rockets with which the lizards have shot down so many of our aircraft but thats proving slower work even with the assistance of lizard prisoners wed best not fight another war with them any time soon is all i can say mcbride answered or well come out of it with no pilots left at all without rockets to match theirs were hors doeuvres nothing better bagnall had never thought of himself as a canape but the description fit all too well he wished he could have gone up against theluftwaffe with a lancaster armed withskelkwank bombs and rockets to swat down themesserschmitts before they bored in for the kill after a moment he realized he might fly with those weapons against the germans one day but if he did the germans were liable to have them too flight lieutenant jordan kept lecturing for several minutes after the noon bells rang again that was habit at last he dismissed his pupils with the warning tomorrow youll be quizzed on what weve covered this past week those with poor marks will be turned into toads and sent hopping after blackbeetles amazing what technology can do these days is it not see you after lunch when bagnall and embry went out into the corridor to head to the cafeteria for an uninspiring but free meal jerome jones called to them care to dine with my chum here his chum was a lizard who introduced himself in hissing english as mzepps when bagnall found out hed been a radar technician before his capture he willingly let him join the group talking civilly with a lizard felt odd even odder than his first tense meeting with that german lieutenantcolonel in paris barely days after the raf had stopped going after the nazis despite mzepps appearance though the lizard soon struck him as a typical noncommissioned officer worried about his job but not much about how it fit into the bigger picture you big uglies you all the time go why why why he complained who cares why just do why not important is word yes important it never has occurred to him jones remarked that if we didnt go why why why all the time we should have been in no position to fight back when he and his scaly cohorts got here bagnall chewed on that as he and ken embry headed back toward flight lieutenant jordans class he thought about the theory jordan was teaching along with the practical applications of what the raf was learning from the lizards by everything mzepps had said the lizards seldom operated that way themselveswhat mattered more to them thanwhy i wonder why that is he murmured why what is embry asked which made bagnall realize hed spoken aloud nothing really he answered just beinghuman is that a fact embry said you couldnt prove it by me the raf men in the lecture hall stared at them as they walked through the doors as far as bagnall knew no one had ever done that laughing before a sunbeam sneaking through the slats of a venetian blind found ludmila gorbunovas face and woke her rubbing her eyes she sat up in bed she wasnt used to sleeping in a bed not any more after blankets on the ground a real mattress felt decadently soft she looked around the flat mordechai anielewicz had given her and jager the plumbing wasnt all it might have been the wallpaper was peeling after years of neglectanielewicz had apologized for that people in lodz it seemed were always apologizing to outsiders for how bad things were they didnt seem that bad to ludmila she was slowly starting to think the problem was different standards of comparison they were used to the way things here had been before the war she was used to kiev what that said she stopped worrying about what that said because her motion woke jager up he came awake quickly and completely shed seen that the last couple of nights she had the same trick she hadnt had it before the war started she wondered if jager had he reached up and set a hand on her bare shoulder then he surprised her by chuckling what is funny she asked a little indignantly this he answered waving at the flat everything here we are two people who for love of each other have run away from all the things we used to think important we cant go back to them ever again we arewhat do the diplomats say stateless persons thats what we are its like something out of a cheap novel as he had a way of doing he quickly sobered or it would be if it werent for the small detail of the explosivemetal bomb cluttering up our lives yes if it werent ludmila didnt want to get out of bed and get dressed here naked between the sheets with jager she too could pretend love had been the only thing that brought them to lodz and that treason and fear not only for the city but for the whole world had had nothing to do with it with a sigh she did get up and start to dress with a matching sigh an octave deeper jager joined her theyd only just finished putting on their clothes when somebody knocked on the door jager chuckled again maybe hed had amorous thoughts too and also set them aside they would have had to answer the door anyhow now at least they werent interrupted jager opened it as warily as if he expected to find otto skorzeny waiting in the hallway ludmila didnt see how that was possible but she hadnt seen how a lot of skorzenys exploits jager talked about were possible either skorzeny wasnt out there mordechai anielewicz was a mauser slung over his shoulder he let it slide down his arm and leaned it against the wall do you know what i wish we could do he said i wish we could get word to the lizardsjust as a rumor mind youthat skorzeny was in town if they and their puppets were looking for him too it would hold his feet to the fire and make him do something instead of lying back and letting us do all the running around you havent done that have you jager said sharply i said i wished i could anielewicz answered no if the lizards find out skorzenys here theyre going to start wondering what hes doing hereand theyll start looking all over for him we cant afford that which leaves first move up to him he has the white pieces sure enough you play chess ludmila asked outside the soviet union shed found not so many people did she had to use the russian word she didnt know how to say it in german anielewicz understood yes i play he answered not as well as id like but everyone says that jager kept his mind on the business at hand whatare you doingas opposed to the things youre reluctantly not doing i mean i understood you anielewicz answered with a wry grin ive got as many men with guns on the street as i can afford to put there and im checking with every landlord who wont run straight to the lizards to find out if hes putting up skorzeny so far he snapped his fingers to show what he had so far have you checked the whorehouses jager asked that was another german word ludmila didnt know when she asked about it and he explained she thought at first hed made a joke then she realized he was deadly serious mordechai anielewicz snapped his fingers again this time in annoyance no and i should have he said sounding angry at himself one of those would make a good hideout for him wouldnt it he nodded to jager thanks i wouldnt have thought of that myself ludmila wouldnt have thought of it either the world outside the soviet union had corruptions new to her along with its luxuriesdecadent she thought again she shook her head shed have to get used to it no going back to therodina not now not ever not unless she wanted endless years in thegulag or perhaps more likely a quick end with a bullet in the back of the head shed thrown away her old life as irrevocably as jager had his the question remained could they build a new one together here this being the sole remaining choice if they didnt stop skorzeny that answer was depressingly obvious too anielewicz said im going back to the fire station i have to ask some questions i havent worried much about thenafkehs the whores he amplified when he saw ludmila and jager didnt catch the yiddish word but somebody will know all about em men are meneven jews he looked a challenge at jager the german to ludmilas relief didnt rise to it men are men he agreed mildly would i be here if i didnt think so no anielewicz said men are meneven germans maybe he touched a finger to the brim of the cloth cap he wore reslung his rifle and hurried away jager sighed this isnt going to be easy however much we wish it would even if we stop skorzeny were exiles here he laughed wed be a lot worse off than exiles though if the ss got its hooks in me again i was just thinking the same thing ludmila said not about the ss but about the nkvd i mean she smiled happily if two people thought the same thing at the same time that had to mean they were well matched but for herself jager was all she had left in the world not believing the two of them were well matched would have left her desolately lonesome her eyes slipped to the bed her smile changed ever so slightly they were well matched there that was certain then jager said well not surprising we havent got much else to think about here have we theres usand skorzeny daludmila said disappointed out of the german shed mostly been speaking and back into russian what shed taken as a good sign was to jager merely a commonplace how sad that made her showed how giddy she was feeling on the table lay a chunk of black bread jager went into the kitchen came back with a bonehandled knife and cut the chunk in two he handed ludmila half of it without the slightest trace of irony he said german service at its finest was he joking did he expect her to take him literally she wondered as she ate her breakfast that she didnt know and couldnt guess with any real confidence of being right bothered her it reminded her how little she truly knew of the man shed helped rescue and whose fate shed linked with her own she didnt want to be reminded of thatvery much the contrary when shed flown away with him hed come straight out of the hands of the ss he hadnt had a weapon then of course anielewicz had given him a schmeisser after he got to lodz a sign the jewish fighting leader trusted him perhaps further than he was willing to admit to himself jager had spent a lot of time since with oil and brushes and cloth getting the submachine gun into what he reckoned proper fighting condition now he started to check it yet again watching how intent his face grew as he worked made ludmila snort half in annoyance half in fascination when he didnt look up she snorted again louder that distracted him enough to make him remember she was there she said sometimes i think you germans ought to marry machines not people schultz your sergeantyou act the same way he did if you take care of your tools as you should they take proper care of you when you need them jager spoke as automatically as if he were reciting the multiplication table if what you need them for is keeping yourself alive youd better take care of them or youll be too dead to kick yourself for not doing it its not that you do it itshow you do it like there is nothing in the world but you and the machine whatever it is and you are listening to it i have never seen russians do this ludmila said schultz was the same way he thought well of you perhaps he was trying to be like you that seemed to amuse jager who checked the action of the cocking handle nodded to himself and slung the schmeisser over his shoulder didnt you tell me hed found a russian lady too yes i dont think they got on as well as we do but yes ludmila hadnt told him how much time schultz had spent trying to get her trousers down as well as tatianas she didnt intend to tell him that schultz hadnt done it and she hadntquitehad to smash him across the face with the barrel of her pistol to get him to take his hands off her jager said lets go to the fire station ourselves i want to tell anielewicz something its not just whorehousesskorzeny might be taking shelter in a church too hes an austrian so hes a catholicor he was probably raised as one anyhow hes about the least godly man i know but thats one more place or set of places to look for him you have all sorts of ideas ludmila would not have thought of anything that had to do with religion here though that outmoded notion proved strategically relevant it is worth checking i think yes the part of lodz that is not jewish is catholic yes jager headed for the door ludmila followed they walked downstairs hand in hand the fire station was only a few blocks awaygo down the street turn onto lutomierska and you were there they went down the street they were about to turn onto lutomierska when a great thunderclap a noise like the end of the world smote the air for a dreadful moment ludmila thought skorzeny had touched off his bomb in spite of everything theyd done to stop him but then as glass blew out of windows that had held it she realized she was wrong this explosion had been close by shed seen an explosivemetal bomb go off had she been so near one of those blasts she would have been dead before she realized anything had happened people were screaming some ran away from the place where the bomb had gone off others toward it to help the wounded she and jager were among the latter pushing past men and women trying to flee through stunned ears she caught snatches of horrified comments in yiddish and polish horsecart in front just stopped there man went away blew up in front of by then shed come close enough to see the building in front of which the bomb had blown up the fire station on lutomierska street was a pile of rubble through which flames were beginning to creepbozhemoi she said softly jager was looking at the dazed and bleeding victims grim purpose on his face wheres anielewicz he demanded as if willing the jewish fighting leader to emerge from the wreckage then he spoke another word skorzeny xx the lizard named oyyag dipped his head in a gesture of submission hed learned from the nkvd it shall be done superior sir he said we shall meet all norms required of us that is good headmale david nussboym answered in the language of the race if you do your rations will be restored to the normal daily allotment after ussmak died the lizards of alien prisoner barracks three had fallen far below their required labor quotas and had gone hungryor rather hungrieron account of it now at last the new headmale though hed had no great status before his capture was starting to whip them back into shape oyyag nussboym thought would make a better headmale for the barracks than ussmak had the other lizard perhaps because hed been a mutineer had tried to make waves in camp too if colonel skriabin hadnt found a way to break the hunger strike hed started no telling how much mischief and disruption in routine he might have caused oyyag swiveled his eye turrets rapidly in all directions making sure none of the other males in the barracks was paying undue attention to his conversation with nussboym he lowered his voice and spoke such russian as he had this other thing i do i do it you do like you say danussboym said wishing he were as sure he could deliver on his promise as he sounded only one way to find out whether he could or not he left the barracks hall and headed for the camp headquarters luck was with him when he approached colonel skriabins office the commandants secretary was not guarding the way in nussboym stood in the doorway and waited to be noticed eventually skriabin looked up from the report hed been writing trains were reaching the camp more reliably now that the ceasefire was in place with paper no longer in short supply skriabin was busy catching up on all the bureaucratic minutiae hed had to delay simply because he couldnt record the relevant information come in nussboym he said in polish putting down his pen the smudges of ink on his fingers told how busy hed been he seemed glad of the chance for a break nussboym nodded to himself hed hoped to catch the colonel in a receptive mood and here his hope was coming true skriabin pointed to the hard chair in front of his desk sit down you have come to see me for a reason of courseyoud better not be wasting my time was what he meant yes comrade colonel nussboym sat gratefully skriabinwas in a good mood he didnt offer the chair at every visit nor did he always speak polish instead of making nussboym work through his russian i can report that the new lizard headmale is cooperative in every way we should have far less trouble from barracks three than weve known in the past this is good skriabin steepled his inky fingers is it the only thing you have to report nussboym made haste to reply no comrade colonel skriabin noddedhad he been interrupted just for that he would have made nussboym regret it the interpreter went on the other matter though is so delicate i hesitate to bring it to your attention he was glad he was able to use polish with skriabin he could never have been subtle enough in russian delicate the camp commandant raised an eyebrow we seldom hear such a word in this place i understand this howevernussboym looked back over his shoulder to make certain the desk out there remained unoccupiedconcerns your secretary apfelbaum does it skriabin kept his voice neutral all right go on you have my attention what about apfelbaum day before yesterday comrade colonel apfelbaum and i were walking outside barracks three with oyyag discussing ways the lizard prisoners could meet their norms nussboym picked his words with great care and apfelbaum said everyones life would be easier if the great stalinhe used the title sarcastically i must sayif the great stalin worried as much about how much the soviet people ate as he did about how hard they worked for him that is exactly what he said he was speaking russian not yiddish so oyyag could understand and i had trouble following him so i had to ask him to repeat himself he did and was even more sarcastic the second time than the first is that so skriabin said nussboym nodded skriabin scratched his head and the lizard heard it too you say and understood it nussboym nodded again the nkvd colonel looked up to the boards of the ceiling he will i suppose make a statement to this effect if it is required of him comrade colonel i think he would nussboym replied would it be perhaps i should not have mentioned it but butindeed skriabin said heavily i suppose you now think it necessary to file a formal written denunciation against apfelbaum nussboym feigned reluctance i would really rather not as you recall when i denounced one of thezeks with whom i formerly worked this is not something i care to do it strikes me as useful skriabin suggested nussboym looked back at him with wide eyes glad the nkvd man could not see his thoughts no they hadnt put him in charge of this camp by accident he reached into his desk and pulled out a fresh form headed with incomprehensible cyrillic instructions write out what he saidpolish or yiddish will do that way we will have it on file i suppose the lizard would talk about this to all and sundry you would never do such a thing yourself of course comrade colonel the idea would never enter my mind nussboym put shocked innocence into his voice he knew he was lying as did colonel skriabin but like any game this one had rules he accepted a pen and wrote rapidly after scrawling his signature at the bottom of the denunciation he handed the paper back to skriabin he supposed apfelbaum would come back with a denunciation of his own but hed picked his target carefully skriabins clerk would have a hard time getting his fellow politicals to back any accusations he made they disliked him because of the way he sucked up to the commandant and the privileges he got because he was skriabins aide the ordinaryzeks despised himthey despised all politicals and he didnt know any lizards skriabin said from another man i might think this denunciation made because he wanted apfelbaums position you could not possibly say that of me nussboym answered i could not fill his position and would never claim i could if the camp functioned in polish or yiddish then yes you might say that about me but i do not have enough russian to do his job all i want is to let the truth be known you are the soul of virtue skriabin said dryly i note however that virtue is not necessarily an asset on the road to success indeed comrade colonel nussboym saidbe careful the nkvd man was telling him he intended to be careful if he could shake apfelbaum loose from his job get him sent off to some harder camp in disgrace everyone here would move up his own place would improve now that hed acknowledged he was in effect a political and cast his lot with the camp administration he thought he might as well take as much advantage of the situation as he could after all if you didnt look out for yourself who was going to look out for you hed felt miserable after skriabin had made him sign the first denunciation the one against ivan fyodorov this one though this one didnt bother him at all offhandedly skriabin said a train bringing in new prisoners will arrive tomorrow a couple of cars worth i am given to understand will be women that is most interesting nussboym said thank you for telling me women who knew what was good for them accommodated themselves to the powerful people in the camp first to the nkvd men then to the prisoners who could help make their lives tolerable or otherwise the ones who didnt know what was good for them went out and cut trees and dug ditches like any otherzeks nussboym smiled to himself surely a man as practical as he could find some equally practical woman for himselfmaybe even one who spoke yiddish wherever you were you did what you could to get by a lizard with a flashlight approached the campfire around which mutt daniels and herman muldoon sat swapping lies that is you second lieutenant daniels he called in pretty good english this heres me mutt agreed come on over smallunit group leader chook set yourself down you boys are gonna be pullin out tomorrow mornindid i hear that right it is truth chook said we are to be no more in the illinois place we are to move out first back to main base in kentucky then out of this notempire of the united states i tell you two things second lieutenant daniels the first thing is i am not sorry to go the second thing is i come here to say goodbye thats mighty nice of you mutt said goodbye to you too a sentimental lizard muldoon said snorting who woulda thunk it chook here aint a bad guy daniels answered like he said when we got the truce the first time him and the lizards hes in charge of got more in common with us than we do with the brass hats way back of the line yeah thats right enough muldoon answered at the same time as chook was saying truth again muldoon went on it was like that over there wasnt it us and the germans in the trenches we was more like each other than us and the fancy dans back in gay paree thats for damn sure show those boys a louse and theyd faint dead away i have also for you a question second lieutenant daniels chook said does it molest you to have me ask you this does it what mutt said then he figured out what the lizard was talking about chooks english was pretty good but it wasnt perfect no go ahead and ask whatever the hell it is you and me weve got on pretty good since we stopped tryin to blow each others heads off your troubles they look a lot like my troubles cept in a mirror this is what i ask then chook said now that this war this fighting this is done what do you do herman muldoon whistled softly between his teeth so did mutt thats the question okay he said first thing i do i reckon is see how long the army wants to keep me i aint what youd call a young man he rubbed his bristly chin most of those bristles were white not brown what do you do if you are not a soldier the lizard asked mutt explained about being a baseball manager he wondered if he would have to explain about baseball too but he didnt chook said i have seen tosevites some almost hatchlings some larger playing this game you were paid for guiding a team of them he added an interrogative cough when mutt agreed that he was the lizard said you must be highly skilled to be able to do this for pay will you again in time of peace damfino daniels answered who can guess what baseballs gonna look like when things straighten out i guess maybe the first thing i do i ever get out of the army i go home to mississippi see if i got me any family left chook made a puzzled noise he pointed west toward the great river flowing by you live in a boat your home is on the mississippi mutt had to explain about the difference between the mississippi river and the state of mississippi when he was through the lizard said you big uglies sometimes you have more than one name for one place sometimes you have more than one place for one name it is confused i tell no great secret to say once or twice attacks go wrong on account of this maybe well just have to call every town in the country jonesville herman muldoon said he laughed happy with his joke chook laughed too letting his mouth fall open so the firelight shone on his teeth and on his snaky tongue you do not surprise me you tosevites if you do this very thing he pointed to daniels before you become a soldier then you command baseball men you are a leader from hatching again mutt needed a moment to understand the lizard a born leader you mean now he laughed loud and long i grew up on a mississippi farm my own self there was nigger sharecroppers workin bigger plots o land than the one my pappy had i got to be a manager on account of i didnt want to keep walkin behind the ass end of a mule forever so i ran off an played ball instead i was never great but i was pretty damn good i have heard before these stories of defiance of authority from tosevites chook said they are to me very strange we have not any like them among the race mutt thought about that a whole planet full of lizards all doing their jobs and going on about their lives for no better reason than that somebody above them told them that was what they were supposed to do when you looked at it that way it was like what the reds and the nazis wanted to do to people only more so but to chook it seemed like water to a fish he didnt think about the bad parts just about how it gave his life order and meaning how about you smallunit group leader daniels asked chook after you lizards pull out of the us of a what do you do next i go on being a soldier the lizard answered after this ceasefire with your notempire i go on to some part of tosev where no truce is i fight more big uglies till soon or late the race wins there then i go to a new place again and do the same all this for years till colonization fleet comes so you were a soldier from the gitgo then mutt said you werent doin somethin else when your big bosses decided to invade earth and just happened to scoop you up so as you could help that would be madness chook exclaimed maybe he was taking mutt too literallyand maybe he wasnt he went on a hundred and five tens of years ago the rd emperor fatuz who reigned then and now helps watch spirits of our dead he set forth a soldiers time mutt could hear the capital letters thudding into place but didnt know what exactly they meant a soldiers time he echoed yes a soldiers time the lizard said a time when the race needed soldiers at first to train the males who would go with the conquest fleet and then in my own age group and that just before mine the males who would make up the fleet wait a minute mutt held up a stubby bent forefinger are you tryin to tell me that when its not a soldiers time you lizards you dont have any soldiers if we are not building a conquest fleet to bring a new world into the empire what need do we have for soldiers chook returned we do not fight among us the rabotevs and hallessi are sensible subjects they are not tosevites to revolt whenever they like we have the data to make males into soldiers when the emperorhe looked down at the grounddecides we need them for thousands of years at a time we do not need is it different with you big uglies you fought your own war when we came did you have soldiers in a time between wars he sounded as if he were asking whether they picked their noses and then wiped their hands on their pants mutt looked at muldoon muldoon was already looking at him yeah weve been known to keep a soldier or two around while were not fightin mutt said just in case we might need em muldoon added his voice dry this is wasteful of resources chook said its even more wasteful not to keep soldiers around mutt said on account of if you dont and the country next door does theyre gonna whale the stuffing out of you take what used to be yours an use it for their own selves the lizards tongue flicked out wiggled around and flipped back into his mouth ah he said now i have understanding you are always in possession of an enemy next door with us of the race it is a thing of difference after the emperorshe looked down againmade all home one under their rule what need had we of soldiers we had need only in conquest time then the reigning emperorand againdeclared a soldiers time after the ending of the conquest we needed soldiers no more we pensioned them let them die and trained no new ones till the next time of need mutt let out a low soft wondering whistle in a surprisingly good cockney accent herman muldoon sang out old soldiers never die they only fade away he turned to chook explaining with us thats just a song i heard it over there during the last big war you lizards though sounds like you really mean it aint that a hell of a thing we mean it on home we mean it on rabotev we mean it on halless chook said here on tosev who knows what we mean here on tosev who knows what anything means maybe one day second lieutenant daniels we fight again not with me you dont mutt said at once they let me out of the army they aint never gettin me back in an if they do they wouldnt want what they got i done had all the fightin thats in me squeezed out you want to mix it up down line smallunit group leader chook you got to pick yourself a younger man two younger men sergeant muldoon agreed i wish to both of you good fortune chook said we fighted each other now we do not fight and we are not enemies let it stay so he turned and skittered out of the circle of yellow light the campfire threw aint that somethin muldoon said in wondering tones i mean aint that just somethin yeah mutt answered understanding exactly what he was talking about if they aint got a war goin on they dont have any soldiers neither wish we could be like that dont you he didnt wait for muldoons nod which came as automatically as breathing instead he went on voice dreamy no soldiers atall not for hundredsshitfire maybe thousands all i knowof years at a time he let out a long sigh wishing for a cigarette almost makes you wish they won the war dont it muldoon said yeah mutt said almost whatever mordechai anielewicz was lying on it wasnt a feather bed he pulled himself to his feet something wet was running down his cheek when he put his hand against it the palm came away red bertha fleishman sprawled in the street in amongst the tumbled bricks from which he had just arisen she had a cut on her leg and another one a nasty one on the side of her head that left her scalp matted with blood she moaned not words just sound her eyes didnt quite track fear running through him mordechai stooped and hauled her upright his head was filled with a hissing roar as if a giant highpressure air hose had sprung a leak right between his ears through that roar he heard not only berthas moan but the screams and cries and groans of dozens scores maybe hundreds of injured people if hed walked another fifty meters closer to the fire station he wouldnt have been injured he would have been dead the realization oozed slowly through his stunned brain if i hadnt stopped to chat with you he told bertha she nodded though her expression was still faraway what happened her lips shaped the words but they had no breath behind themor maybe anielewicz was even deafer than he thought some kind of explosion he said then later than he should have he figured out what kind of explosion a bomb again he seemed to be thinking with mud rather than brains because he needed several more seconds before he burst out skorzeny the name reached bertha fleishman where nothing had before itgottenyu she said loud enough for anielewicz to hear and understand we have to stop him that was true they had to stop himif they could the lizards had never managed it anielewicz wondered if anyone could one way or the other he was going to find out he looked around there in the chaos using a bandage from the aid kit he wore on his belt squatted heinrich jager the old jew who held out a mangled hand to him didnt know hed been awehrmacht panzer colonel or care and jager by the practiced careful way he worked didnt worry about the religion of the man he was helping beside him his russian girlfriendanother story about which anielewicz knew less than he would have likedwas tying what looked like an old wool sock around a little boys bloody knee anielewicz tapped jager on the shoulder the german whirled around snatching for the submachine gun hed set down on the pavement so he could help the old man youre alive he said relaxing a little when he realized who mordechai was i think so anyhow anielewicz waved at the hurlyburly all around your friend plays rough this is what i told you the german answered he looked around too but only for a moment this is probably a diversionprobably not the only one either wherever the bomb is youd better believe skorzenys somewhere close by as if on cue another explosion rocked lodz this one came from the east gauging the sound anielewicz thought it had gone off not far from the ruined factory sheltering the stolen weapon he hadnt told jager where that factory was not quite trusting him now he had no more choice if skorzeny was around there hed need all the help he could get lets go he said jager nodded quickly finished the bandaging job and grabbed the schmeisser the russian girlthe russian pilotludmiladrew her pistol anielewicz nodded they started off mordechai looked back toward bertha but shed slumped down onto the pavement again he wished he had her along too but she didnt look able to keep up and he didnt dare wait the next blast wouldnt be a fire station it wouldnt be whatever building had gone up in the latest explosion it would be lodz nothing was left of the fire station petrol flames leaped high through the wreckagethe fire engine was burning mordechai kicked a quarter of a brick as hard as he could sending it spinning away solomon gruver had been in there later onif he livedhed grieve the mauser thumped against his shoulder as he trotted along it didnt bother him he noticed it only at odd moments what did bother him was how little ammunition jingled in his pockets the rifle bore a full fiveround clip but he didnt have enough cartridges to refill that clip more than once or twice he hadnt expected to fight today how are you fixed for ammunition he asked jager full magazine in the weapon one more full one here the german pointed to his belt sixty rounds altogether that was better but it wasnt as good as mordechai had hoped you could go through the magazine of a submachine gun in a matter of seconds he reminded himself jager was a panzer colonel if a german soldiera german officer no lessdidnt maintain fire discipline who would maybe nobody when bullets started cracking past your head maintaining discipline of any sort came hard and i i have only the rounds in my pistol ludmila said anielewicz nodded she was coming along jager seemed to think she had every right to come along but jager was sleeping with her too so how much was his opinion worth enough that anielewicz didnt feel like bucking it not when anybody who wouldnt run away at the sound of a gunshot was an asset shed been in the red air force and shed been a partisan here in poland so maybe shed be useful after all his own fighters had shown him some women could do the joband some men couldnt he passed a good many of his own fighters as he hurried with jager and ludmila toward the ruined factory several shouted questions at him he gave only vague answers and did not ask any of the men or women to join none of them was privy to the secret of the explosivemetal bomb and he wanted to keep the circle of those who were as small as possible if he stopped skorzeny he didnt want to have to risk playing a game of samson in the temple with the lizards afterwards besides troops who didnt know what they were getting into were liable to cause more problems than they solved a couple of order service policemen also recognized him and asked him where he was going them he ignored he was used to ignoring the order service they were used to being ignored too men who carried truncheons were polite to men with rifles and submachine guns either they were polite or their loved ones assuming order service police had any loved ones a dubious proposition saidkaddish over new graves in the cemetery jager was starting to pant how far is it he asked on the exhale sweat streamed down his face and darkened his shirt at the back and under the arms anielewicz wasshvitzing too the day was hot and bright and clear pleasant if you were just lounging around but not for running through the streets of lodzthis couldnt have happened say in fall he thought aloud though he answered not much farther nothing in the ghetto is very far from anything else you nazis didnt leave us much room here you know jagers mouth tightened cant you leave that alone when you talk to me if i hadnt got through to you youd have been dead twice by now thats true mordechai admitted but it only goes so far how many thousands of jews died here before anyone said anything he gave jager credit the german visibly chewed on that for a few strides before nodding a cloud of smoke was rising as mordechai had thought from the sound it was close to the place where the bomb lay concealed somebody shouted to him wheres the fire engine its on fire itself by now he answered the other explosion you heard was the fire station his questioner stared at him in horror when he had time he figured he would be horrified too what would the ghetto do for a fire engine from now on he grunted if they didnt stop skorzenyfrom now on would be a phrase without meaning he rounded another corner jager and ludmila beside him almost then he stopped dead in his tracks the burning building housed the stable that held the heavy draft horses hed gathered to move the bomb in case of need fire trapped the horses in their stalls their terrified screams more dreadful than those of wounded women dinned in his ears he wanted to go help the animals and had to make himself trot past them people who didnt know what he did were trying to get the horses out of the stable he looked to make sure none of the bomb guards were there to his relief he didnt see any but he knew he might well have when that thought crossed his mind he was suddenly certain skorzeny hadnt bombed the building at random hed tried to create a distraction to lure the guards away from their proper posts that ss pal of yours hes a realmamzer isnt he he said to jager a what the panzer man asked a bastard anielewicz said substituting a german word for a yiddish one you dont know the half of it jager said christ anielewicz you dont know a tenth part of it im finding out mordechai answered come on we go round this last corner and then were there he yanked the rifle from his shoulder flipped off the safety and chambered the first round from the clip jager nodded grimly he also had his schmeisser ready to fire and ludmila had been carrying her little automatic in her hand all along it wasnt much but better than nothing at the last corner they held up if they went charging around it they were liable to be walking straight into a buzz saw ever so cautiously mordechai looked down the street toward the dead factory he didnt see anyone not with a quick glance and he knew where to look in the end though whether he saw anyone didnt matter they had to go forward if skorzeny was ahead of them with luck hed be busy at the bomb without luck he glanced over to jager any better idea of how many little friends skorzeny is liable to have with him the panzer colonels lips skinned back from his teeth in a mirthless grin only one way to find out isnt there ill go first then you then ludmila well leapfrog till we get to where were going mordechai resented his taking over like that even if the tactic did make good sense no ill go first he said and then to prove to himself and jager both that it wasnt bravado he added youve got the weapon with the most firepower cover me as i move up jager frowned but nodded after a moment he slapped anielewicz lightly on the shoulder go on then anielewicz dashed forward ready to dive behind a pile of rubble if anyone started shooting from inside the factory no one did he hurled himself into a doorway that gave him some cover no sooner had he done so than jager ran past him bent double and dodging back and forth he might have been a panzer man but hed learned somewhere to fight on foot anielewicz scratched his head the german was old enough to have fought in the last war and who but he could say what all hed done in this one ludmila ran by both of them she chose a doorway on the opposite side of the street in which to shelter while she paused there she shifted the pistol to her left hand so she could shoot from that position without exposing much of her body to return fire she knew her business too then anielewicz sprinted past her up to within ten or twelve meters of the hole in the wall that led into the ruined factory he peered in trying to pierce the gloom was that someone lying still not far inside he couldnt be certain but it looked that way behind him booted feet thumped on the pavement he hissed and waved heinrich jager saw him and ducked into the doorway where he was standing whats wrong the german asked breathing hard anielewicz pointed jager narrowed his eyes squinting ahead the lines that came out when he did that said he was indeed old enough to have fought in the first world war thats a body he said just as ludmila came up to crowd the narrow niche in front of the door id bet anything you care to name it isnt skorzeny s body either no thanks mordechai said i dont have much but what ive got ill keep he drew in a deep breath that took some effortnerves he thought he hadnt run that far he pointed again if we can make it up to that wall we go in there and then head for the bomb along the clear path that leads into the middle of the building once were at the wall nobody can shoot at us without giving us a clear shot back at him we go then ludmila said and ran for the wall she made it muttering under his breath jager followed so did anielewicz ever so cautiously he peered into the factory yes that was a sentry lying therehis rifle lay beside him his chest wasnt moving mordechai tried to take another deep breath himself his lungs didnt seem to want to work inside his chest his heart stumbled he turned back toward jager and ludmila it had been shadowy inside the wrecked factory hed expected that but here too on a bright sunny day he saw his comrades only dimly he looked up at the sun staring at it didnt hurt his eyes he looked back to ludmila her eyes were very blue he thought and then realized why her pupils had contracted so much he could barely see them at all he fought for another hitching breath somethingswrong he gasped heinrich jager had watched the day go dark around him without thinking much of it till anielewicz spoke then he swore loudly and foully while fear raced through him he was liable to have killed himself and the woman he loved and all of lodz out of sheer stupidity you couldnt see nerve gas you couldnt smell it you couldnt taste it it would kill you just the same he yanked open the aid kit hed used to bandage the wounded old jew he hadhe thought he hadfive syringes one for himself and each man in his panzer crew if the ss had taken those out when theyd arrested himif theyd done that he was dead and he wouldnt be the only one but the blackshirts hadnt they hadnt thought to paw through the kit and see what was inside he blessed them for their inefficiency he took out the syringes antidote he told ludmila hold still all at once speaking was an effort for him too the nerve gas was having its way a few more minutes and he would have quietly keeled over and died without ever figuring out why he was dead ludmila for a wonder didnt argue maybe she was having trouble talking and breathing too he jabbed the syringe into the meat other thigh as hed been trained and pressed down on the plunger he grabbed another syringe you he told anielewicz as he yanked off its protective cap the jewish fighting leader nodded jager hurried to inject him he was starting to turn blue if your lungs didnt work and your heart didnt work that was what happened to you jager threw down the second syringe its glass body shattered on the pavement he heard that but had trouble seeing it working as much by touch as by sight he got out another syringe and stabbed himself in the leg he felt as if hed held a live electrical wire against his flesh it wasnt wellbeing that rushed through him instead he was being poisoned in a different way one that fought the action of the nerve gas his mouth went dry his heart pounded so loud he had no trouble hearing it and the street which had gone dim and faint as the nerve gas squeezed his pupils shut all at once seemed blindingly bright he blinked tears filled his eyes to escape the hideous glare he ducked inside the factory there in real shadows the light seemed more tolerable mordechai anielewicz and ludmila followed what was that stuff you shot us with the jew asked his voice a whisper the antidote for nerve gasthats all i know jager answered they issued it to us in case we had to cross areas wed already saturated while we were fighting the lizardsor in case the wind shifted when we didnt expect it to skorzeny must have brought along gas grenades or maybe just bottles full of gas for all i know throw one in let it break give yourself a shot while youre waiting and then go in and do what you were going to do anielewicz looked down at the dead body of the sentry we have nerve gas now too you know he said jager nodded anielewicz scowled were going to have to be even more careful with it than we have beenand weve taken casualties from it jager nodded again with nerve gas you couldnt be too careful enough of this ludmila said where is the bomb and how do we get to it and stop skorzeny without getting killed ourselves those were good questions jager couldnt have come up with better if hed thought for a week and he didnt have a week to waste thinking he glanced over to anielewicz if anybody had the answers the jewish fighting leader did anielewicz pointed into the bowels of the building the bomb is there less than a hundred meters away see the opening there behind the overturned desk the path isnt straight but its clear one of you maybe both of you should go down it its the only way youll get there fast enough to be useful me i set this place up theres another way to get to the bomb ill take thatand we see what happens then jager was used to sending others out to create distractions for him to exploit now he and ludmila were the distraction he couldnt argue with that not when anielewicz knew the ground and he didnt but he knew the people who created distractions were the ones likely to get expended when the shooting started if his mouth hadnt already been dry from the antidote it would have gone that way anielewicz didnt wait for him and ludmila to argue like any good commander he took being obeyed for granted pointing one last time to the upsidedown desk he slipped away behind a pile of rubble stay in back of me jager whispered to ludmila chivalry is reactionary she said you have the better weapon i should lead and draw fire in strictly military terms she was right hed never thought strictly military terms would apply to the woman he loved but if he failed here out of love or chivalry or whatever you wanted to call it he failed altogether reluctantly he waved ludmila ahead she didnt see the motion because shed already started moving forward he followed close as he could as anielewicz had said the path wound but was easy enough to use with his pupils dilated by the nerve gas antidote he could see exactly where to place each foot to make the least possible noise what he thought was about halfway to the bomb ludmila stopped in her tracks she pointed round the corner jager came up far enough to see a jewish guard lay dead there one hand still on his rifle ever so carefully jager and ludmila stepped over him and moved on up ahead jager heard tools clinking on metal a sound with which hed become intimately familiar while serving on panzers normally that was a good sound promising that something broken would soon be fixed something broken would soon be fixed now too here though the sound of ongoing repair raised the hair at the back of his neck he made a mistake thenbrushing against some rubble he knocked over a brick it fell to the ground with a crash that seemed hideously loud jager froze cursing himselfthats why you didnt stay in the infantry you clumsy son of a whore he prayed skorzeny hadnt heard the brick god wasnt listening the handicraft noises stopped a burst of submachine gun fire came in their place skorzeny couldnt see him but didnt care he was hoping ricochets would do the job for him they almost did a couple of bouncing bullets came wickedly close to jager as he threw himself flat give up skorzeny he shouted wriggling forward with ludmila beside him youre surrounded jager for one of the rare times in their acquaintance he heard skorzeny astonished what are you doing here you kikeloving motherfucker i thought i put paid to you for good they should have hanged you from a noose made of piano wire by now well they will one day they will he fired another long burst he wasnt worried about spending ammunition bullets whined around jager striking sparks as they caromed off bricks and wrecked machines jager scuttled toward him anyhow if he made it to the next heap of bricks he could pop up over it and get a decent shot give up he yelled again well let you go if you do youll be too dead to worry about it whether i give up or not the ss man answered then he paused again no maybe not you should be dead already as a matter of fact why the hell arent you now he sounded friendly interested as if they were hashing it out over a couple of shots of schnapps antidote jager told him isnt that a kick in the balls skorzeny said well id hoped id get out of here in one piece but thebut was punctuated by a potatomasher hand grenade that spun hissing through the air and landed five or six meters behind jager and ludmila he grabbed her and folded both of them into a tight ball an instant before the grenade exploded the blast was deafening hot fragments of casing bit into his back and legs he grabbed for his schmeisser sure skorzeny would be following hard on the heels of the grenade a rifle shot rang out then another one skorzenys submachine gun chattered in reply the bullets werent aimed at jager he and ludmila untangled themselves from each other and both rushed to that pile of bricks skorzeny stood swaying like a tree in the breeze in the gloom his eyes were enormous and all pupil hed given himself a stiff dose of nervegas antidote right in the center of the ragged old shirt he wore was a spreading red stain he brought up his schmeisser but for once didnt seem sure what to do with it whether to aim at anielewicz or at jager and ludmila his foes had no such hesitation anielewiczs rifle and ludmilas pistol cracked at the same instant in which jager squeezed off a burst more red flowers blossomed on skorzenys body the breeze in which he swayed became a gale it blew him over the submachine gun fell from his hands his fingers groped toward it pulling hand and arm after them as they struggled from one rough piece of ground to the next a centimeter and a half farther on jager fired another burst skorzeny twitched as the bullets slammed into him and at last lay still only then did jager notice the ss man had pried several planks off the big crate that held the explosivemetal bomb under them the aluminum skin of the device lay exposed like that of a surgical patient revealed by an opening in the drapes if skorzeny had already set the detonator in there jager ran toward the bomb he got there a split second ahead of anielewicz who was in turn a split second ahead of ludmila skorzeny had removed one of the panels from the skin jager peered into the hole thus exposed with his pupils so dilated he had no trouble seeing the hole was empty anielewicz pointed to a cylinder a few centimeters in front of his left foot thats the detonator he said i dont know if its the one we pulled or if he brought it with him the way you said he might it doesnt matter what matters is that he didnt get to use it we won ludmila sounded dazed as if she was fully realizing for the first time what theyd done what theyd prevented nobody will put the detonator in this bomb any time soon anielewicz said nobody will be able to get close to it and keep living not for a while not without the antidote whatever that is how long does the gas persist jager you know more about it than anyone else around here its not exposed to bright sun whats left of the roof will keep rain off it should last a good while days certainly weeks maybe jager answered he still felt keyed up ready to fight maybe that was the aftermath of battle maybe too it was the antidote driving him anything that made his heart thump like that probably scrambled his brains too can we go out of here now ludmila asked she looked frightened the antidote might have been turning her to flight not fight wed better get out of here id say anielewicz added god only knows how much of that gas were taking in every time we breathe if theres more of it than the antidote can handle yes jager said starting toward the street and when we do get out we have to burn these clothes we have to do it ourselves and we have to bathe and bathe and bathe you dont need to breathe this gas for it to kill you if it touches your skin that will do the jobslower than breathing it but just about as sure were dangerous to anyone around us till we decontaminate lovely stuff you germans turn out anielewicz said from behind him the lizards didnt like it jager answered the jewish fighting leader grunted and shut up the closer jager got to the street the brighter the glare became till he squeezed his eyes almost shut and peered through a tiny crack between upper and lower lids he wondered how long his pupils would stay dilated and then relentlessly pragmatic wondered where in lodz he could come up with a pair of sunglasses he strode past the outermost dead jewish sentry then out onto the street which seemed to him awash in as much brilliance as if the explosivemetal bomb had gone off the jews probably would have to cordon off a couple of blocks around the wrecked factory on one pretext or another just to keep people from inadvertently poisoning themselves as they walked by ludmila emerged and stood beside him through his halfblind squint he saw hers he didnt know what was going to happen next he didnt even know whether as anielewicz had suggested theyd ended up breathing more nerve gas than their antidote could handle if the day started going dim instead of brilliant he still had two syringes left in his aid kit for three people that made twothirds of a shot apiece would he need it if he did would it be enough he did know what wouldnt happen next lodz wouldnt go up in a fireball like a new sun the lizards wouldnt aim their concentrated wrath at germanynot on account of that anyhow he wouldnt go back to thewehrmacht nor ludmila to the red air force whatever future they had whether hours or decades was here he smiled at her her eyes were almost closed but she saw him and smiled back he saw that very clearly atvar had heard the buzzing racket of tosevite aircraft a great many times through sound recordings but only rarely in person he turned one eye turret toward the window of his suite sure enough he could see the clumsy yellowpainted machine climbing slowly into the sky that is the last of them is it not he said yes exalted fleetlord that one bears away marshall the negotiator from the notempire of the united states zolraag replied the talks are complete atvar said sounding disbelieving even to himself we are at peace with large portions of tosev no wonder i sound disbelieving he thoughtwe have peace here but peace without conquest who would have imagined that when we set out from home now we await the arrival of the colonization fleet exalted fleetlord zolraag said with its coming with the permanent establishment of the race on tosev begins the incorporation of this whole world into the empire it will be slower and more difficult than we anticipated before we came here but it shall be done that is also my view and why i agreed to halt largescale hostilities for the time being atvar said he turned one eye turret toward moishe russie who still stood watching the big ugly aircraft shrink in the distance to zolraag he went on translate for him what you just said and ask his opinion on the matter it shall be done zolraag said before shifting from the language of the race to the ugly guttural grunts he used when speaking to the tosevite russie made more grunts by way of reply zolraag turned them into words a person could understand his answer is not altogether germane exalted fleetlord he expresses relief that the negotiator from deutschland departed without embroiling the race and the tosevites in fresh warfare i confess to a certain amount of relief on this score myself atvar said after that pompous pronouncement the big ugly issued which proved to be either a bluff or a spectacular example of deutsch incompetenceour analysis there is still incompletei did indeed anticipate renewed combat but the tosevites apparently decided to be rational instead zolraag translated for russie whose reply made his mouth fall open in amusement he says expecting the deutsche to be rational is like expecting good weather in the middle of winter you may get it yes for a day or two but most of the time you will be disappointed expect anything from either tosevites or tosevite weather and most of the time you will be disappointedthough you need not translate that the fleetlord answered russie was looking at him with what he thought was alertness he remembered the big ugly did know some of the language of the race atvar shrugged mentally russie already had a good notion of his opinion of tosevites he said tell him that sooner or later his people will be subjects of the emperor zolraag dutifully told him russie did not answer not directly instead he went back to the window and stared out once more atvar felt only annoyance the tosevite aircraft was long gone by now but russie still kept looking out through the glass without saying anything what is he doing atvar snapped at last patience deserting him zolraag put the question through him moishe russie replied i am looking across the nile at the pyramids why atvar said irritated still what do you care about thesewhat were they these large funerary monuments is that it they are massive yes but barbarous even by tosevite standards my ancestors were slaves in this country three maybe four thousand years ago russie told him maybe they helped build the pyramids thats what our legends say though i dont know if its true who cares about the ancient egyptians now they were mighty but they are gone we jews were slaves but were still here how can you know what will happen from what is now now atvars mouth fell open tosevite pretensions to antiquity always make me laugh he said to zolraag hear how the big ugly speaks of three or four thousand yearssix or eight thousand of oursas if it were a long time in historic terms we had already absorbed both the rabotevs and the hallessi by then and some of us were beginning to think about the planets of the star tosev day before yesterday in the history of the race truth exalted fleetlord zolraag said of course it is truth atvar said and it is why in the end we shall triumph our setbacks because of the big uglies unexpected technological sophistication notwithstanding we are content to progress one small step at a time there are whole tosevite civilizations as russie just said which moved forward at the usual big ugly breakneck clipand then failed utterly we do not have this difficulty nor shall we ever we are established even if on only part of the world with the arrival of the colonization fleet our presence shall become unassailably permanent we then have only to wait for another tosevite cultural collapse extend our influence over the area where it occurs and repeat the process until no section of the planet remains outside the empires control truth zolraag repeated because of tosevite surprises the conquest fleet might not have accomplished quite everything the plan back on home called for kirel could not have been more cautious and diplomatic than that zolraag continued the conquest however does go on just as you said what in the end does it matter if it takes generations rather than days in the end it matters not at all atvar replied history is on our side vyacheslav molotov coughed the last t had rumbled through red square a good while before but the air was still thick with diesel fumes if stalin noticed them he gave no sign he chuckled in high good humor well vyacheslav mikhailovich it wasnt quite a victory parade not the sort i would have wanted after wed finished crushing the hitlerites for instance but it will do it will do indeed comrade general secretary molotov said stalin for once had been guilty of understatement molotov had gone to cairo expecting to have nothing but trouble because of the intransigent stand stalin required him to take but if stalin had disastrously misread hitlers intentions hed gauged the lizards aright the lizards have adhered in every particular to the agreement you forged with them stalin said displays of martial might such as the one just past made him happy as a boy playing with lead soldiers they have everywhere removed themselves from soviet soil with the exception of the formerly polish territory they elected to retain and there comrade foreign commissar i have no fault to find with you for which i thank you iosef vissarionovich molotov answered better to have borders with those who keep agreements than with those who break them exactly so stalin said and our mopping up of german remnants on soviet soil continues most satisfactorily some areas in the southern ukraine and near the finnish border remain troublesome but on the whole the hitlerite invasion like that of the lizards can be reckoned a thing of the past we move forward once more toward true socialism he dug in a trouser pocket and took out his pipe a box of matches and a leather tobacco pouch opening the pouch he filled the pipe from it then lighted a match and held it to the bowl of the pipe his cheeks hollowed as he sucked in breath to get the pipe going smoke rose from the bowl more leaked from his nostrils and one corner of his mouth molotovs nose twitched hed expected the acrid reek ofmakhorka which as far as he was concerned was to good tobacco what diesel fumes were to good air what stalin was smoking though had an aroma rich and flavorful enough to slice and serve on a plate for supper a turkish blend he asked as a matter of fact no stalin answered an american one a gift from president hull milder than i quite care for but good of its kind and there will be turkish again in short order once we have the northern coast of the black sea fully under our control sea traffic will resume and we can also begin rail shipments by way of armenia and georgia as he usually did when he mentioned his homeland he gave molotov a sly look as if daring him to make something of his ancestry never one for foolhardy action molotov knew much better than that stalin took another puff then went on and we shall have to work out arrangements for trade with the lizards too of course comrade general secretary molotov said stalins leaps of thought often left logic far behind sometimes that brought great benefits to the soviet state his relentless industrialization much of it beyond the range of nazi bombers might have saved the ussr when the germans invaded of course the invasion when it came would have been better handled had stalins intuition not convinced him that everyone who warned him of it was lying you couldnt tell in advance what the intuition was worth you had to sit back and await results when the soviet state was on the line that grew nerveracking trade with the lizards stalin repeated as if to a backwards child the regions they occupy will not produce everything they need we shall supply them with raw materials they may lack being socialists we shall not be good capitalists and we shall lose greatly on the exchangesso long as we obtain their manufactured goods in return ah molotov began to see this time he thought stalins intuition was working well you want us to begin copying their methods and adapting them for our own purposes that is right stalin said we had to do the same thing with the west after the revolution we had a generation in which to catch up or they would destroy us the nazis struck us a hard blow but we held now with the lizards we havemankind haspaid half the world in exchange for most of another generation until the colonization fleet comes molotov said yes logic backed intuition to give stalin solid reasons for trading with the lizards until the colonization fleet comes stalin agreed we need more bombs of our own we need rockets of our own we need calculating machines that almost think we need ships that fly in space so they cannot look down upon us without our looking down upon them as well the lizards have these things the capitalists and fascists are on their way to them if we are left behind they will bury us iosef vissarionovich i think you are right molotov said he would have said it whether he thought stalin right or wrong had he actually thought him wrong he would have started looking for ways and means to ensure that the latest pronunciamento was diluted before it took effect that was dangerous but sometimes necessary where would the soviet union be now had stalin liquidated everyone in the country who knew anything about nuclear physicsunder the lizards thumb molotov thought stalin accepted molotovs agreement as no more than his due of course i am he said complacently i do not see how we can keep the colonization fleet from landing but the thing we must rememberthis above all else vyacheslav mikhailovichis that it will bring the lizards fresh numbers but nothing fundamentally new true enough comrade general secretary molotov said cautiously again stalin had got ahead of him on the page this time though intuition had nothing to do with it while molotov was dickering with the lizards stalin must have been working through the implications of their social and economic development he said it is inevitable that they would have nothing fundamentally new marxist analysis shows this must be so they are despite their machines representatives of the ancient economic model relying on slaveswith them partly mechanical partly the other races they have subjugatedto produce for a dependent upper class such a society is without exception highly conservative and resistant to innovation of any sort thus we can overcome them that is nicely argued iosef vissarionovich molotov said his admiration unfeigned mikhail andreyevich could not reason more trenchantly suslov stalin shrugged he made some small contributions to this line of thought but the main thrust of it of course is mine of course molotov agreed straightfaced as usual he wondered what the young party ideologist would say to that but had no intention of asking in any case it did not matter no matter who had formulated the idea it supported what molotov had believed all along as the dialectic demonstrates comrade general secretary history is on our side sam yeager strolled down central avenue in hot springs savoring the summer weather one of the things he savored about it was being able to escape it every now and then the sign painted on the front window of the southern grill saidour refridgerated airconditioning is working again the wheeze and hum of the machinery and fan backed up the claim he turned to barbara want to stop here for some lunch she looked at the sign then took one hand off the grip of jonathans baby carnage twist my arm she said sam gave it a token twist oh mercy she cried but not very loud because jonathan was asleep sam held the door open for her best mercy i know of he followed her into the restaurant that took them out of hot springs summer in a hurry the airconditioning was refrigerated all right sam felt as if hed walked into minnesota november he wondered if his sweat would start freezing into tiny icicles all over his body a colored waiter in a bow tie appeared as if by magic menus under his arm you jus follow me sergeant maam he said ill take you to a booth where you can park that buggy right alongside sam slid onto the maroon leatherette of the booth with a sigh of contentment he pointed to the candle on the table then to the electric lights in the chandelier overhead now the candle is a decoration again he said you ask me thats the way its supposed to be having to use candles for light when we didnt have anything better he shook his head i didnt like that no neither did i barbara opened her menu she let out a squeak of surprise look at the prices with some apprehension sam did just that he wondered if hed suffer the embarrassment of having to walk out of the southern grill he had maybe twentyfive bucks in his wallet army pay hadnt come close to keeping up with jumping prices the only reason hed figured he could eat out once in a while was that he got most of his meals for nothing but barbara hadnt said which way prices had gone everything was down about a third from what hed expected and a handwritten addendum boasted of cold budweiser beer he remarked on that when the waiter returned to take his order and barbaras yes sir first shipment from st louis the colored man replied just got in yesterday matter of fact were startin to see things now we aint seen since the lizards came things is lookin up that they is sam glanced at barbara when she nodded he ordered budweiser for both of them the redwhiteandblue labels made them smile the waiter poured the beers with great ceremony barbara lifted her glass on high heres to peace she said ill drink to that sam matched action to word he swallowed the first swig of beer then thoughtfully smacked his lips he drank again and was even more thoughtful you know hon after drinking mostly home brews and such the last couple of years ill be darned if i dont like em better more flavor to em you know what i mean oh good barbara said if i were the only one who thought that id figure it was just because i didnt know anything about beer it doesnt mean i cant drink this though she proved as much and it is good to see the budweiser bottle againas if an old friend were back from the war yeah yeager wondered how mutt daniels was doing and about all the other decatur commodores whod been riding the train with him when the lizards strafed it in northern illinois the waiter set a hamburger in front of him and a roastbeef sandwich before barbara then with a flourish he put a full bottle of heinz catsup on the table between them this got here this morning he said yall are the first ones to use it how about that sam said he pushed it over toward barbara so she could have first crack at it it acted like catsupit didnt want to come out of the bottle when it did pour too much came out except after most of two years without how could there be too much after hed anointed the hamburger sam took a big bite his eyes widened unlike the budweiser he found no disappointment there mmmm he said with his mouth full thats the mccoy mmhmm barbara agreed with as much enthusiasm and as few manners sam disposed of the hamburger in a few bites then slathered more catsup on the grits that took the place of french fries he didnt usually do that in fact nobody he knew did that a proper southerner who saw him perpetrating such an atrocity would probably ride him out of town on a rail he didnt care not today he wanted every bite of the sweetsour tomato tang he could get and any excuse was a good one when barbara did the same thing he grinned in vindication another beer the waiter asked as he picked up their plates yes sam said after glancing at barbara again but why dont you make it a local special this time im glad to see the budweiser but its not as good as i remembered youre about the foth person to say that today sir the negro remarked ill be right back with the pride of hot springs he had just set the local brewsaltogether a deeper richer amber than budweisersbefore sam and barbara when jonathan woke up and started to fuss barbara took him out of the carriage and held him which calmed him down you were a good boyyou let us eat lunch she told him she checked youre even dry pretty soon ill give you lunch too now she looked over at sam and pretty soon maybe ill be able to start giving him formula in a bottle that should be one of the things that come back pretty fast uhhuh sam said way things work itll probably start showing up right about the time he can start drinking regular milk he grinned at his son who was groping for barbaras bottle of beer she pushed it safely out of reach jonathan started to cloud up but sam made a silly face at him so he decided to laugh instead sam let his features relax what a crazy world hell grow up in i only hope its a world where hecan grow up barbara said setting a hand on top of the babys head jonathan tried to grab it and stuff it into his mouth jonathan tried to grab everything and stuff it into his mouth these days barbara went on what with the bombs and the rockets and the gas she shook her head and the lizards colonization fleet will get to earth when hes only a young man who can guess what things will be like then not you not me not anybody sam said not the lizards either the colored waiter set the check on the table sam dug his wallet out of his hip pocket and pulled out a ten a five and a couple of singles which left the fellow a nice tip barbara put jonathan back into the buggy as she started wheeling the baby toward the door sam finished his thought well just have to wait and see what happens thats all authors note and acknowledgements harry turtledove was born in los angeles in
