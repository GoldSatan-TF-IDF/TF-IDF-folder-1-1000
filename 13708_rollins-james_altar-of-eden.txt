beast its hour come round at last slouches towards bethlehem to be born w b yeats the study of nature makes a man at last as remorseless as nature h g wells map prologue april baghdad iraq the two boys stood outside the lions cage i dont want to go inside the smaller one said he kept close to his older brother and clasped tightly to his hand the two were bundled in jackets too large for their small forms faces swathed in scarves heads warmed by woolen caps at this early hour with the sun not yet up the predawn chill had crept down to their bones they had to keep moving bari the cage is empty stop being a shakheef look makeen the older of the two pushed the black iron gate wider and revealed the bare concrete walls inside a few old gnawed bones lay piled in a dark corner they would make a nice soup makeen stared out at the ruins of the zoo he remembered how it had once looked half a year ago for his twelfth birthday they had come here to picnic at the alzawraa gardens with its amusementpark rides and zoo the family had spent a long warm afternoon wandering among the cages of monkeys parrots camels wolves bears makeen had even fed one of the camels an apple he still remembered the rubbery lips on his palm standing here now he stared across the same park with older eyes far older than half a year ago the park sprawled outward in a ruin of rubble and refuse it was a haunted wasteland of fireblackened walls fetid pools of oily water and blasted buildings a month ago makeen had watched from their apartment near the park as a firefight blazed across the lush gardens waged by american forces and the republican guard the fierce battle had begun at dusk with the rattle of gunfire and the shriek of rockets continuing throughout the night but by the next morning all had gone quiet smoke hung thickly and hid the sun for the entire day from the balcony of their small apartment makeen had spotted a lion as it loped out of the park and into the city it moved like a dusky shadow then vanished into the streets other animals also escaped but over the next two days hordes of people had swarmed back into the park looters his father had named them and spat on the floor cursing them in more foul language cages were ripped open animals were stolen some for food some to be sold at the black market across the river makeens father had gone with a few other men to get help to protect their section of the city from the roving bands he had never returned none of them had over the next weeks the burden had fallen upon makeen to keep his family fed his mother had taken to her bed her forehead burning with fever lost somewhere between terror and grief all makeen could get her to do was drink a few sips of water if he could make a nice soup for her get her to eat something more he eyed the bones in the cage again each morning he and his brother spent the hour before dawn searching the bombedout park and zoo for anything they could scrounge to eat he carried a burlap sack over his shoulder all it held was a moldy orange and a handful of cracked seed swept up off the floor of a birdcage little bari had also found a dented can of beans in a rubbish bin the discovery had brought tears to makeens eyes he kept the treasure rolled up inside his little brothers thick sweater yesterday a larger boy with a long knife had stolen his sack leaving makeen emptyhanded when he returned theyd had nothing to eat that day but today they would eat well even mother inshallah he prayed makeen entered the cage and dragged bari with him distant gunfire crackled in short spurts like the scolding claps of angry hands trying to warn them off makeen took heed he knew they had to hurry he didnt want to be out when the sun was up it would grow too dangerous he hurried to the pile of bones dropped his sack and began shoving the gnawed knuckles and broken shafts inside once finished he tugged the sack closed and stood before he could take a step a voice called in arabic from nearby yalla this way over here makeen ducked and pulled bari down with him they hid behind the kneehigh cinderblock wall that fronted the lions cage he hugged his brother urging him to remain silent as two large shadows passed in front of the lions cage risking a peek makeen caught a glimpse of two men one was tall in a khaki military uniform the other was squat with a round belly dressed in a dark suit the entrance is hidden behind the zoo clinic the fat man said as he passed the cage he huffed and wheezed to keep up with the longer strides of the man in military fatigues i can only pray we are not too late makeen spotted the holstered pistol on the taller mans belt and knew it would be death to be found eavesdropping bari shivered in his embrace sensing the danger too unfortunately the men did not go far the clinic was directly across from their hiding spot the fat man ignored the twisted main door days ago crowbars had forced the way open the facility had been cleaned out of drugs and medical supplies instead the heavy figure stepped to a blank wall framed by two columns makeen could not make out what the man did as he slipped his hand behind one of the columns but a moment later a section of the wall swung open it was a secret door makeen shifted closer to the bars father had read them stories of ali baba tales of secret caverns and vast stolen treasures hidden in the desert all he and his brother had found at the zoo were bones and beans makeens stomach churned as he imagined a feast fit for the prince of thieves that might wait below stay here the fat man said ducking through the entrance and down a dark set of stairs the military man took up a post by the doorway his palm rested on his pistol his gaze swung toward their hiding spot makeen ducked out of sight and held his breath his heart pounded against his ribs had he been spotted footsteps approached the cage makeen clung tightly to his brother but a moment later he heard a match strike and smelled cigarette smoke the man paced the front of the cage as if he were the one behind the bars stalking back and forth like a bored tiger bari shook within makeens embrace his brothers fingers were clamped hard in his what if the man should wander into the cage and find them huddled there it seemed an eternity when a familiar wheezing voice echoed out of the doorway i have them the cigarette was dropped and ground out onto the cement just outside the cage door the military man crossed back to join his companion the fat man gasped as he spoke he must have run all the way back up the incubators were offline he said i dont know how long the generators lasted after the power went out makeen risked a peek through the bars of the cage door the fat man carried a large metal briefcase in his hand are they secure the military man asked he also spoke in arabic but his accent was not iraqi the fat man dropped to one knee balanced the case on his thick thigh and thumbed open the lock makeen expected gold and diamonds but instead the case held nothing but white eggs packed in molded black foam they appeared no different from the chicken eggs his mother bought at the market despite his terror the sight of the eggs stirred makeens hunger the fat man counted them inspecting them theyre all intact he said and let out a long rattling sigh of relief god willing the embryos inside are still viable and the rest of the lab the fat man closed the case and stood up ill leave it to your team to incinerate what lies below no one must ever suspect what weve discovered there can be no trace i know my orders as the fat man stood the military man raised his pistol and shot his companion in the face the blast was a thunderclap the back of the mans skull blew away in a cloud of bone and blood the dead man stood for a moment longer then flopped to the ground makeen covered his mouth to stifle any sound no trace the murderer repeated and collected the case from the ground he touched a radio on his shoulder he switched to english bring in the trucks and prime the incendiary charges time to get out of this sandbox before any locals turn up makeen had learned to speak a smattering of the american language he couldnt pick out every word the man spoke but he understood the message well enough more men were coming more guns makeen sought some means of escape but they were trapped in the lions cage perhaps his younger brother also recognized the growing danger bari s shaking had grown worse since the gunshot finally his little brothers terror could no longer be held inside and a quiet sob rattled out of his thin form makeen squeezed his brother and prayed that the cry had not been heard footsteps again approached a sharp call barked toward them in arabic whos there show yourself taaal hnaa makeen pressed his lips to his brothers ear stay hidden dont come out makeen shoved bari tighter into the corner then stood up with his hands in the air he backed a step i was just looking for food makeen said stuttering speaking fast the pistol stayed leveled at him get out here walad makeen obeyed he moved to the cage door and slipped out he kept his hands in the air please ahki laa termi he tried switching to english to show he was on the mans side no shoot i not see i not know he fought to find some argument some words to save him he read the expression on the other mans facea mixture of sorrow and regret the pistol lifted higher with merciless intent makeen felt hot tears flow down his cheeks through the blur of his vision he noted a shift of shadows behind the man the secret door cracked open wider pushed from inside a large dark shape slipped out and flowed toward the mans back it ran low and stuck to the deeper shadows as if fearing the light makeen caught the barest glimpse of its oily form muscular lean hairless with eyes glinting with fury his mind struggled to comprehend what he was seeingbut failed a scream of horror built inside his chest though the beast made no noise the man must have felt a prickling of warning he swung around as the creature leaped with a sharp cry gunshots blasted eclipsed by a savage wail that raised the hairs on makeens body makeen swung away and rushed back to the cage bari he grabbed his brothers arm and dragged him out of the lions cage he pushed bari ahead of him yalla run off to the side man and beast fought on the ground more pistol shots fired makeen heard the heavy tread of boots on pavement behind him more men came running from the other side of the park shouts were punctuated by rifle blasts ignoring them all makeen fled in raw terror across the bombedout gardens careless of who might see him he kept running and running chased by screams that would forever haunt his nightmares he understood nothing about what had happened he knew only one thing for certain he remembered the beasts ravenous eyes shining with a cunning intelligence aglow with a smokeless fire makeen knew what he had seen the beast known as shaitan in the koranhe who was born of gods fire and cursed for not bowing down to adam makeen knew the truth at long last the devil had come to baghdad act one first blood chapter may am new orleans the bronco crushed through the debris left by the hurricane and bounced off yet another hole lorna nearly hit the roof of the cabin the car slid to the left on the wet road she eased off the accelerator as she fought for control the storm had stripped vegetation sent creeks overflowing their banks and even floated an alligator into someones swimming pool luckily the worst of the dying hurricane had struck farther west still with such downpours mother nature seemed determined to turn orleans parish back into swamplands as lorna sped along the river road all she could think about was the phone call it had come in twenty minutes ago theyd lost power at acres the generators hadnt kicked in and a hundred research projects were threatened as she rounded a final oxbow in the mississippi river the compound appeared ahead the audubon center for research of endangered species occupied more than a thousand acres downriver from new orleans though associated with the citys zoo acres was not open to the public sheltered within a hardwood forest the grounds included a few outdoor pens but the main facility was a thirtysixthousand squarefoot research building that housed a halfdozen laboratories and a veterinary hospital the latter was where dr lorna polk had worked since completing her postgraduate residency in zooandwildlife medicine she oversaw the facilitys frozen zoo twelve tanks of liquid nitrogen that preserved sperm eggs and embryos from hundreds of endangered species mountain gorillas sumatran tigers thomsons gazelles colobus monkeys cape buffalo it was a big position to fill especially for someone only twentyeight and just out of her residency her responsibilitythe frozen genetic bankheld the promise of pulling endangered species back from the brink of extinction through artificial insemination embryo transfer and cloning yet despite the weight of her responsibility she loved her work and knew she was good at it as she raced down the long entry road toward the main facility her cell phone chimed from the cup holder she grabbed it and cradled it to her ear while driving onearmed the caller must have heard the line pick up and spoke rapidly dr polk its gerald granger from engineering i thought you should know weve got the generators working and isolated the power loss to a downed line she glanced to the trucks clock the power had been down for close to fortyfive minutes she calculated in her head and let out a sigh of relief thanks gerald ill be there in another minute she flipped the phone closed reaching the employee lot she parked and rested her head on the steering wheel the relief was so palpable she almost cried almost after taking a moment to collect herself she straightened and stared down at the hands on her lap suddenly aware of what she wore she had fled the house in a pair of wrinkled jeans an old gray turtleneck and boots not exactly the professional appearance she usually maintained twisting to exit the bronco she caught her reflection in the rearview mirror oh dear god her blond hairnormally primly braidedhad been pinned back into a rough ponytail this morning several flyaways only added to her already disheveled appearance even her blackframed glasses sat askew on the bridge of her nose at the moment she looked like a drunken college student returning from a mardi gras party if she looked the part she might as well go all the way she pulled out the pin holding her hair and let it fall around her shoulders then climbed out of the truck and crossed toward the main entrance before she could reach the facilitys front doors a new noise drew her attention a heavy wumpwumping she turned toward the mississipi a white helicopter skimmed over the tree line and headed in her direction it was coming in fast as she frowned a hand settled on her shoulder from behind she jumped slightly but fingers squeezed in reassurance a glance back revealed her boss and mentor dr carlton metoyer the head of acres covered by the noise of the helicopter she had not heard his approach thirty years her senior he was a tall wiry black man with bushy white hair and a trimmed gray beard his family had been here in the region for as long as lornas tracing their roots back to the cane river creole colony a blend of french and african heritage dr metoyer shielded his eyes as he stared at the sky we got company he said the helicopter was definitely headed toward acres it swept toward an adjacent field and began to descend she noted it was a small astar helicopter equipped with floats instead of the usual landing skids she also recognized the slash of green across the white shell of the aircraft after katrina most people in new orleans knew that insignia it was one of the border patrol helicopters fleets of such choppers had been vital to the rescue operations and security following the disaster what are they doing here she asked theyve come for you my dear theyre your ride chapter lornas stomach sank as the helicopter lifted offnot so much from the motion as from sheer panic she clutched the armrests as she sat next to the pilot the growing roar of the rotors penetrated her bulky headphones it felt like rising in an elevator an elevator strapped to a rocket she had never been a fan of heights hated air travel in general and considered riding an airborne lawn mower the height of madness she had only flown once in a helicopter during an externship in south africa conducting a census of african elephants in the lands bordering a preserve back then she had prepared for that flight by downing a pair of xanax tablets before the trip still her legs had felt like warm pudding for hours afterward and today shed had no warning dr metoyer had only filled her in on the sketchiest of details as the helicopter landed he had not even given her time to go inside and inspect her projects liquid nitrogen tanks staff is already on it he had promised adding that hed check them himself and radio the details later radio they were flying beyond any cell signal she risked a glance through the side window the helicopter banked giving her a birdseye view of the mississippi they were traveling downriver roughly following the big muddys course the name was particularly apt following the storm the river was a chocolate brown rich with silt eddying and churning as it flowed toward the gulf of mexico they were headed out over the rivers delta where all that alluviumsilt clay sand and soildeposited and pushed out into the gulf forming over three million acres of coastal wetlands and salt marshes not only was the region environmentally significant home to a vast and complicated ecosystem that traced its roots back to the jurassic period it was also commercially significant the area supplied the united states with a large percentage of its seafood and almost percent of its oil it was also a weak link in the nations border the maze of islands twisting waterways and isolated fishing docks made the delta a sieve for smugglers and traffickers of all sorts the department of homeland security had designated the region a highlevel threat and reinforced the new orleans station of the border patrol according to her boss the border patrol had been searching the area following last nights storm surge it was common for smugglers to work under the cover of storms to bring in drugs guns even human cargo early this morning a team had discovered a trawler beached on one of the outlying islands after investigating the ship theyd made a call to acres much of that call remained a mystery even to dr metoyer he had not been informed about the nature of the request or why lorna in particular had been asked to make this trip despite her trepidation about air flight a smoldering anger was building she had projects in jeopardy over at acres what was she doing flying out into the middle of nowhere her anger grew stoked by her anxiety what was going on why ask for her in particular she knew no one in the customs and border protection service the only answers lay at the end of this flight the radio built into her earphones crackled the pilot pointed toward the horizon he wore a green uniform with shoulder patches marking him as part of the border patrols air and marine unit he had introduced himself but she hadnt caught his name dr polk well be landing in a few moments she nodded and stared forward the dense emerald of the swampy marshes broke apart below into a tangle of islands and peninsulas ahead farther out into the gulf a dark line near the horizon marked a row of larger barrier islands that helped protect the fragile marshes and coastal swamps but they werent going that far she spotted a shiny white boat moored by one of the small islands finally as they descended toward it she also noted an old fishing trawler rammed into the beach it had struck hard enough to topple a few trees and ride halfway up onto the island it plainly had been shoved there by the storm surge the helicopter dropped fast her grip tightened on the armrests she had read that a majority of air crashes occurred during takeoffs and landings not a statistic she wanted to bear in mind at the moment within a few yards of the water their descent slowed the rotorwash beat the waves flat then as gently as a goose landing on a still pond the choppers floats settled to the water a few flicks of some switches and the whine of the rotors began to slow please stay seated the pilot said theyre sending a zodiac out for you his nod out the window drew her attention to a small rubber pontoon boat that pushed off from the island and shot toward them moments later a crewman dressed in the same border patrol green helped her out of the helicopter and into the zodiac she dropped onto a bench of the pontoon boat both relieved yet still carrying a hot coal in her belly she shaded her eyes as they headed toward shore searching for some answer for the mysterious and sudden summons the morning was already growing warm as the sun broke apart the clouds and opened blue skies the day promised to grow into one of louisiana s steam baths and she was okay with that she took deep breaths to steady herself taking in the brackish odor of leafy decay wet moss and muddy salt water to her it was the smell of home her family had lived in louisiana going back to the nineteenth century like all the old families of new orleans her history was as deeply ingrained as the lines on her palms ancestors names and stories were as familiar as if theyd died only yesterday during the war of her greatgreatgrandfather only seventeen at the time had abandoned the british army during the battle of new orleans and made his home in the new burgeoning frontier city he met and married the daughter of the de trepagnier family and quickly made a small fortune by growing sugarcane and indigo on a hundredacre plantation given as a dowry over the years that fortune continued to grow and the polk family was one of the first to build in the oakshadowed glen of new orleans s garden district after selling the plantation the family settled permanently in the district over the generations the polk mansion became respected as a gathering place for military generals legal scholars and countless men of science and letters the italianate mansion still stood but like the city the polk family had begun a slow decline during the twentieth century only lorna and her brother still bore the family name her father had died of lung cancer when lorna was a child her mother passed away a year ago leaving the siblings a mansion in ill repair and a pile of debt but the tradition of valuing education continued she had gone into medicine and science her brother younger by a year was an oil engineer working for the state for the moment brother and sister both single shared the family estate a grind of wet sand on rubber pulled her back to the present the small island one of a series forming a chain back to the dense coastal marshes was covered in cypress trees matted together by spanish moss it looked impenetrable beyond the edge of the beach but thats not where she was going this way the zodiac pilot said he offered a hand to help her out of the boat but she ignored him and climbed out herself the fos is waiting to speak to you fos field operations supervisor she didnt understand the command structure of the border patrol but it sounded like this was the guy in charge of the investigation maybe the one who had summoned her away from acres wanting answers she followed the pilot toward the beached trawler having grown up along the river she knew boats the trawler was a small one a fortyfooter its starboard booms had been shattered by the collision but on the port side the long poles still pointed crookedly toward the sky the shrimp nets were still tied down to the booms a handful of men all in rough duty uniforms of the border patrol gathered on the beach alongside the trawler some wore tan stetsons others green baseball caps she also noted the holstered sidearms one man had a remington shotgun resting on a shoulder what was going on the men fell silent as she approached a few pairs of eyes traveled up and down her form looking little impressed she kept her face fixed into something resembling a stern expression but she felt her cheeks heat up in irritation she resisted the urge to flip them all off definitely a boys club here the agents parted to reveal a tall man similarly attired in dark green trousers and a matching longsleeved work shirt casually rolled to the elbows he fingercombed his black hair damp with sweat and secured a black baseball cap in place but not before his bluegray eyes also examined her from head to foot unlike the others she sensed nothing lascivious in his attention only sizing her up still she was glad when the bill of his cap shadowed those eyes he crossed to close the distance between them he stood well over six feet tall broadshouldered and muscular without looking bulky his carriage was of someone who knew how to lead with no need to dominate confidence along with a feral edge flowed from him he held out a large hand as he reached her dr polk thank you for coming she shook his hand and noted a long scar down his forearm from elbow to wrist glancing up she met his gaze his complexion was a tanned olive further darkened by black stubble over his chin and jaw her ear picked up his slight french cajun accent so he was local to the area in fact there was something naggingly familiar about himand then it struck her she was about to demand an answer as to why she was brought here instead a different question stumbled out jack his lips full but definitely masculine shifted to a harder line as he gave the barest nod her image of him similarly transformed in a sudden shift of perspective the anger drained out of her replaced with something colder and more uncomfortable it had been over ten years since shed last seen him she had only been a sophomore in high school he had been a senior though she hadnt really known him well back thenin high school two years was an insurmountable social gulfthey had darker ties that bound them together a connection she had wanted forever left in her past from the expression passing like a cloud over his face he possibly wished the same either way now was not the time to reopen those old wounds dr polk he said stiffly his accent grew thicker more husky i called you here because because i didnt know who else had the expertise to offer guidance about what we found she straightened her back going equally professional maybe that was best she swallowed and stared toward the trawler glad for an excuse to look away what did you find youd best see for yourself he turned and led the way to the trawler a rope ladder led up to the deck he climbed first clambering easily up she was all too conscious of the hard strength in his legs and back once he vanished over the gunwale one of his men secured the ladders lower end making it easier for her to climb at the top jack helped pull her to the deck two other men stood guard by a door that led to the lower holds one of them passed jack a flashlight sir weve run a portable lamp down into the hold but its still damn dark down there jack thumbed on his flashlight and waved for her to follow careful of the blood on the stairs his light revealed a dark stain along one side of the steps like something had been dragged down into the hold she suddenly did not want to go down there we found no bodies jack said as if sensing her discomfort or maybe he was merely filling her in on the details of the case she followed him down the steps and along a narrow passageway they kept them caged in the main hold she didnt bother to ask what was caged she already smelled the familiar musk of a rank kennel she heard the shuffle of bodies a rustling a mewling cry a sharp screech of a bird she began to understand why she had been summoned exotic animal smuggling was a billiondollarayear industry ranking just behind drug and gun trafficking and unfortunately the united states was one of the leading consumers of such smuggled cargo accounting for percent of such sales she had read just last week about the bust of a major trafficking ring dealing in rare tigers in that case the missouri couple wasnt bringing in the big cats for pets but for parts they were smuggling in tigers then butchering them hides of leopards tigers and lions could fetch upward of twenty thousand dollars but that wasnt all like some bloody chop shop they were selling off all parts tiger penises to be ground into aphrodisiacs bones for arthritis cures no part went to waste gallbladder liver kidneys even teeth in the end such large cats were worth far more dead than alive she felt anger building as she followed jack into the main hold a tall pole lamp lit the lowroofed space stainlesssteel cages lined both sides of the long hold larger pens in the back were still in shadows she gaped at the size of the smuggling operation certain now why she was needed here a veterinarian specializing in exotic animals jack turned and shone his flashlight into the nearest cage she stared insideand knew she was wrong about everything chapter jack menard studied the womans reaction shock and horror widened lornas eyes she covered her mouth with a hand but only for a moment after the initial surprise he also recognized a glint of concern her eyes narrowed again her lips drawn tight in thought she moved closer to the cage he joined her and cleared his throat what type of monkeys are they cebus apella she answered brown capuchin monkeys native to south america jack stared at the two who shared the small cage squatting in their own filth huddled and scared at the back of the cage their limbs and backsides were a deep chocolate brown their faces and chests a softer tan their heads capped in black they were so small he could have cupped one in the palm of his hand are they babies he asked she shook her head i dont think so the fur coloring suggests theyre adults but youre right theyre way too small pygmy versions of the breed but jack knew that wasnt the most shocking aberration with a quiet cooing noise lorna coaxed the pair to move toward the bars her coldly professional manner seemed to melt away her face softening relaxing the pair of monkeys responded to her still hugging each other they crept forward clinging tightly not that they could ever truly be apart siamese twins lorna said the two were joined at the hipliterallyfused together sharing three legs but bearing four arms poor things she whispered they look half starved they came to the bars plainly needing reassurance as much as sustenance their eyes were huge especially in such small faces jack sensed their hunger and fear and also a trace of hope he reached into a pocket and removed a granola bar he ripped it open with his teeth broke off a piece and handed it to lorna she gently passed it through the bars one of them took it with its tiny fingersthen the pair retreated to share the prize huddled around it nibbling from both sides but their eyes never left lorna she glanced to jack for a moment he saw the girl he remembered from his school days before he left for the marines she had dated his younger brother tom during their sophomore yearand the summer thereafter he shied away from that memory lorna must have sensed this well of pain her face hardened going professional again she nodded to the other cages show me he led her along the rows of cages shining his flashlight into the shadowy recesses each enclosure held a different animal some familiar some exotic but like the monkeys they all bore some twisted abnormality they stopped next at a large glasswalled terrarium that held a fifteenfoot burmese python curled around a clutch of eggs the snake looked ordinary enough until its coils slid more tightly around the eggs and revealed two pairs of folded vestigial legs scaled and clawed remnants of its lizardlike evolutionary origin it looks like a severe form of atavism lorna said and that would be what in english she offered him a small apologetic smile atavism is where a genetic trait lost for generations reappears in an individual a genetic throwback exactly in this case a throwback to a time before snakes lost their limbs thats a mighty long throw isnt it she shrugged and moved on most atavism is caused by the accidental recombination of genes but i dont think it was accidental here not with these many cases so youre saying someone bred them this way on purpose is that even possible i cant rule it out genetic science has come a long way and continues to push boundaries at acres weve successfully cloned wild cats weve even merged a fluorescent protein from a jellyfish to produce a cat that glows in the dark mr green genes i read about that he said in fact its one of the reasons why i called for you i needed an expert on genetics and breeding someone to tell me who could have produced this bizarre cargo he led her through the hold a wire cage held a mass of winged bats the size of footballs vampire bats lorna said but theyre ten times the size they should be may be a form of primordial gigantism similarly a caged fox down the row was the size of a bear cub it hissed and growled and threw itself against the bars they quickly moved past stopping briefly at a tall cage that held an ordinarysize parrot but it had no feathers it cawed loudly leaped to the front bars and studied them while cocking its head back and forth jack had a hard time hiding his disgust there was something so alien and wrong about its appearance lorna just moved closer when baby parrots first hatch theyre featherless or covered only with a light down i dont know if this ones stunted into an infantile state or if its a throwback too in fact its theorized that birds are the closet living relatives of dinosaurs jack didnt argue the creatureleatherskinned and beaked definitely had a prehistoric look to it but what really got him unnerved was the sharpness of its attention the bird leaped back to its perch spouting a garble of spanish that aspect of the parrotthe ability to mimicremained intact it began to screech a string of numbers in english its pronunciation and diction sounding perfectly human if pitched slightly sharper three one four one five nine two six five they continued onward then lorna stopped in midstep she stared back at the cage as the bird continued to screech out numbers it went on and on without stopping what is it he asked that parrot those first numbers i cant be sure what three one four one five those are the first five digits of the mathematical constant pi jack remembered enough from high school geometry to know about pi represented by the greek letter n he pictured the number in his head awe filled lornas voice as the parrot continued its numerological tirade pi has been calculated to trillions of digits id love to find out if the numbers the bird is mimicking are sequentially correct and if so how long of a sequence the parrot has memorized as the bird continued without pause jack noted a hush fall over the hold the mewling growling even shuffling of the other animals grew quiet as if they too were listening eyes reflecting the light seemed to stare toward them from the dark cages with a shake of his head he moved on he had a crime to investigate what i really wanted to show you is back here he led her to the larger pens at the stern end of the hold one pen held a nursing lamb and its mother but rather than curly wool the animals coats hung straight to the ground more like a yaks pelt than a sheeps but thats not what jack wanted to show lorna he tried to urge her on but she paused at the next cage the occupant of that pen lay stiffly on its side atop the hay floor legs straight out eyes wide and fixed dead it looked like a miniature pony but the creature was no larger than a cocker spaniel look at its hooves lorna said theyre cloven four toes in front three in back the earliest ancestor of the modern horse hyracotheriumwas only the size of a fox and had the same digital division she crouched to examine the dead body the hoof of one toe had been torn away its head bore signs of fresh concussions as if it had panicked and thrashed against the bars before it died looks like something scared it to death she assessed i can guess what that might have been jack headed toward the very back of the hold this way she followed irritation entered her voice along with a thread of deeper anger what were these people doing for that matter how did they do it thats what i hoped you could answer but we have a bigger and more immediate problem they reached the last pen it was large and heavily barred hay covered the floor but no animal was in sight we found the door dented and broken open when we came down here something escaped lorna glanced from the empty pen back toward the passageway and stairs clearly recalling the blood trail we need you to tell us what it was he said she frowned at him how he pointed as something buried beneath the hay shifted a weak mewling followed lorna glanced to him her face shining with curiosity he pulled the door and held it open for her to enter be careful he warned chapter lorna ducked through the low door and into the pen inside the space was tall enough to stand upright still she kept slightly crouched most of the hay had been pushed and piled to the back of the pen she studied the space with a critical eye her nose picked up the strong ammonia smell of old urine she avoided stepping in a sludgy pile of scat loose and watery whatever had been caged in here had been ill the hay pile at the back shifted as something burrowed away from her it backed into a corner and could retreat no farther the mewling had stopped lorna crossed knelt and gently picked the hay away she spotted snowy fur with faint gray spots a long tail lay tucked around the curled frightened shape small feline ears lay flat against its head a leopard or jaguar cub she whispered but its white jack said by the doorway like some sort of albino she stared at the cubs pinched blue eyes no eye color is normal likely its a form of inherited leucism where only the skin pigment is lost either way its definitely some type of panther i thought you said it was a leopard or jaguar she understood his confusion it was a common mistake panthers not really a taxonomic term the genus panthera covers all the big cats tiger lion leopard jaguar and a white panther could be a version of any of those cats and which one is that cub from the skull structure and what i can tell from the faint spotting id guess jaguar but i cant be sure lorna knew that jack needed more information he must have suspected what was plain to her at first glance and wanted confirmation out of the nest of hay tiny eyes squinted up at her poorly focused they looked newly opened suggesting the cub was only a couple of weeks old or maybe even younger additional juvenile featuresstubby rounded ears underdeveloped whiskerssupported her assessment of its newborn status but what was throwing her off was its size it had to weigh fifteen or twenty pounds large enough to be seven or eight weeks old even jack must have recognized the disparity and what it suggested and the age of the cub a week or two she glanced back at him extrapolating that would make an adult around four to five hundred pounds more the size of a siberian tiger a typical jaguar weighs half that another genetic throwback she sighed ill need to run some tests to be sure but first id like to examine the cub more closely she carefully scooped the cub out of its nest it squirmed and cried but only weakly she felt its bones a pinch of skin revealed dehydration she bit back anger at its mistreatment and cradled the cub to her belly she did her best to calm and reassure the little fellow from a glance at its genitalia it was definitely a male she held the cub firmly letting the panic beat itself out shh its okay little one one hand cupped his head while a finger gently and rhythmically rubbed under his chin after a moment the cub leaned into her and let out a hungry cry she allowed him to suckle on her finger definitely a newborn as the cub attempted to nurse she felt something in the mouth that shouldnt be there at this age young cats had no teeth only gums to knead a milky teat but her fingertip probed as the cub suckled she discovered four teeth fanged canines while small and immature they were still sharp and prominentlonger on top than on bottom and they shouldnt be there at all not at this age the early presence suggested developmental dominance of this feature it heralded a genetic expression of some significance as the realization of what that might be sank in she felt a trickle of dread along the back of her neck she glanced over to the rest of the cages settling on the dead pony no wonder it had died of fright she turned to jack as she cradled the cub weve got a bigger problem whats that as she had extrapolated the infants weight to estimate the size of the adult she did the same now with its dentition she knew what the early presence of these canine milk teeth might portend she pictured fangs growing proportionally upper fangs curving and extending beyond the lower jaw this cub is something more than just an oversize jaguar lorna warned how so she stood up carrying the creature and ducked out to join jack this is the cub of a sabertoothed cat chapter back in the brightness of the morning sun jack stood on the trawlers deck with lorna polk she still cradled the jaguar cub if the woman was right they were looking for a massive cat pale as a ghost possibly with fangs ten to twelve inches long she had gone on to explain how such fangs were not limited to the infamous sabertoothed tiger according to her many other prehistoric felines even some marsupials carried this genetic trait but a sabertoothed jaguar it seemed impossible still he did not doubt her assessment she had spoken at length about atavism and genetic manipulation and had supported her case soundly plus he had seen the other freakish animals caged down below he stared over the rail toward the coast it was a dense mass of bottomland forests marshes and swamps encompassing millions of acres of the mississippi river delta it was also his home hed been raised in the bayou where family and clan held sway far more than any rule of law his own family earned their income through shrimping and fishing and through a few lessthanlegal enterprises on the side he knew how easy it was to hide out in the swamps how difficult it could be to track something that wanted to keep out of sight lorna stepped over to him shed been talking on the radio making arrangements with us fish and wildlife they have a boat on the way she said theyre bringing portable cages and tranquilizers i also talked to dr metoyer over at acres theyre setting up a quarantine lab for the animals he nodded it had been decided to use the isolated acres facility as a base of operations one of his men had found a steel trunk locked up in the captains quarters it held a laptop and some digital tapes an expert on computer forensics was already en route from new orleans to start working on the contents hopefully the archive held more than just the captains stash of porn but before they abandoned the trawler completely jack still wanted more answers specifically about the most pressing threat do you have any idea where this jaguar might have gone could it have drowned during the storm i doubt it big cats have no aversion to water and jaguars are quite strong swimmers and besides these waters are shallow it could easily have swum from island to island taking rest stops along the way and you think it would have headed all the way for the coast jaguars typically have territories covering a hundred square miles these islands are too small it would have kept going but what about her cub he nodded to the creature cradled in lornas arms would a mother abandon it so easily not likely jaguars are very protective of their young nursing them until six months mothering them until the age of two but theyre also practical this cub is sickly a typical litter for a jaguar is two or three cubs i suspect there was another cub caged with this one the mother took the stronger of the two with her abandoning the weaker as a means of survival so shell have a cub with her that could slow her down it could also make her more dangerous shell aggressively defend her last child lornas brow tightened with a new concern she pointed to the blood trail on the stairs which raises another question where are the bodies the ships crew not here and not on the island jack said we searched from the blood patterns we figured the crew numbered four maybe the bodies were washed overboard or they were dragged overboard dragged by the cat from the blood on the stairs that body wasnt just washed away the cat mustve hauled it up from below but why thats a good question cats often hide their kills to protect the meat even hanging them up into treesbut if thats not possible theyll normally just leave the bodies to rot as carrion and move on lorna frowned the behavior here its not typical if im right it displays an unusual cunningness as if shes trying to cover her trail lorna met his gaze he saw the worry in her eyes maybe youre reading too much into it he offered the tropical storm blew to neargale forces last night maybe the cat and the bodies were all swept out into the gulf by the tidal currents theres one way to find out how lorna waded from the zodiac onto the sandy beach of the neighboring island she left her boots in the boat and rolled her pants to her knees jack followed at her side his attention on the hump of sand and tangled cypress trees ahead he went barefoot too but he kept his boots laced over one shoulder in case he had to venture into the dense thicket that crowned the island he also carried an m carbine assault rifle over his other shoulder if the cat had survived the storm it had likely already reached the coast but he wasnt taking any chances at lornas suggestion he had piloted the zodiac from the trawler to the closest neighboring island the cat would have come here first on its way to the mainland lorna insisted as she climbed up the beach we need to look for any telltale pugmarks pugmarks paw prints we should search above the hightide mark also watch for scat urine scratched trees i know how to track jack said but what if the cat swam past this island then we search the next one she couldnt have gotten too far before needing to rest fight and flight take its toll adrenaline eventually gives out shell have needed a place to catch a breath they began to circle the island keeping to the hightide mark in the sand they scanned the beach in silence the days heat had grown to a stifling blanket only a few clouds remained from last nights storm sweat rolled down his back and pooled at his belt line over here lorna suddenly said she hurried away from the water heading up the sand to where a large cypress shadowed the beach spanish moss draped and formed a curtain some of it had been ripped away as if something large had torn through its mesh careful jack warned and grabbed her arm he pulled her back and raised his rifle let me check it out first he edged to the tree with his rifle leading the way he poked through the rent in the moss he scanned the bower below then the limbs above it looked clear lorna spoke at his shoulder not heeding his command to hang back look at the sand near the trunk the ground had been churned up but he noted a single distinct paw print pressed deeply into the sand they crossed together into the shadows jack kept watch for any sign of movement around them in such a heightened state of alertness he was all too conscious of lornas shoulder against his side of the smell of her hair of her skin the thing is huge lorna said as she knelt down from the size of this paw i may have underestimated its weight she splayed out her hand over the print the paw was easily twice as big so it definitely survived he said and its headed to the coast jack stood up and clutched his rifle even after the storm the delta will be full of fishermen campers hikers well have to evacuate the area put together a hunting party while we still have daylight lorna joined him youll have a hard time finding the cat during the day itll find a place to hole up and sleep your best chance is at dusk when jaguars usually begin their hunt he nodded itll take that long to put a team together anyway trackers hunters people who know the coastal region of the delta ill bring along my srt she glanced at him for explanation special response team jack nodded to the white patrol boat moored off the other island the border patrols equivalent of special forces in other words border patrol commandos theyre good men he said a bit too defensively only realizing afterward that she was gently joking with him flustered he turned away a flurry of activity was going on across the water the fish and wildlife boata foilsupported catamaranhad arrived and anchored offshore the wardens and border agents were busily ferrying cargo from the trawlers hold lets get back over there lorna said jack heard the desire in her voice plainly anxious to oversee the offloading herself she had left the jaguar cub on his boat cradled in an empty fishing tackle box they were wading toward the zodiacwhen the fishing trawler exploded chapter kneedeep in water lorna watched in horror as the trawlers hull shattered outward in a blast of fire and smoke its wooden fishing booms went sailing high trailing flaming nets debris scattered over the island and out to sea along with bodies she covered her mouth how many had been aboard the trawler burning planks and wreckage rained down upon the two anchored patrol boats shouts and screams echoed over the water smoke roiled high into the blue sky jack grabbed her arm and dragged her toward the zodiac they climbed into the pontoon boat and shoved off jack yanked on the outboards starter and seconds later they were flying across the waters he had the radio to his ear she listened to his end of the conversation confusion still reigned but command filled his voice call back that chopper let emergency services know were coming in with wounded across the way the broken husk of the trawler smoldered on the beach the other two boats circled the nearby waters searching through the floating wreckage and flaming pools of oil survivors fished bodies out of the water jack opened the throttle and shot the zodiac back to the island lorna pointed to a figure rising out of the surf it was one of the border patrol agents he struggled to his knees cradling one arm blood ran down his face from a scalp wound he looked stunned in shock jack over there he responded and swung the zodiac in the mans direction they sped over and collected the injured man it was the agent who had passed jack the flashlight earlier his arm was broken clearly a compound fracture from the white bone poking through his sleeve lorna held a fistful of rags to his forehead stanching the bleeding wheres tompkins the man asked blearyeyed he he was still on the upper deck they searched the waters the wounded agent tried to stand in the zodiac but jack barked for him to stay seated lorna noted jack squint toward the beach one last time and away again only then did she spot a body sprawled near the tree line smoke steamed from his burned clothes a dark stain flowed into the sand the body was missing an arm and half its skull jack met her gaze as he swung around she read his expression tompkins lorna felt tears swellingnot in grief but at the senselessness of it all what happened she whispered to herself still jack must have heard her as he cut the engine and let the zodiac drift up against his patrol boat the pontoons bumped them to a stop a dead mans switch he answered cryptically as men scrambled down to help carry the injured agent up to the deck of the boat another replaced jack at the rudder of the zodiac ready to continue the search for survivors jack was needed above to take command lorna followed him up the ladder the open deck had been converted into a triage hospital the uninjured tended to the wounded some sat up others were flat on their back she also noted one form covered over with a tarp without being told lorna headed to the emergency medical kit on the deck she began to administer first aid using her medical skills as best she could moving from patient to patient shortly thereafter a coast guard rescue helicopter and a life flight air ambulance flew in and began loading the most critical cases word slowly spread of the number of casualties three dead a horrible number but it could have been worse the border patrol boat began its journey up the mississippi followed by the fish and wildlife catamaran a newly arrived coast guard cutter remained behind to secure the area and keep it cordoned off until a forensic team could sweep the wreckage lorna stood by the bow rail letting the wind cool the sweat from her brow but it did little to ease the tension or shock amid the chaos she had focused on her work staying professional turning her full attention upon a laceration a concussion a broken bone it was a crutch she used to get through the morning the remaining injured were now stable and monitored by a coast guard doctor once she was no longer needed the weight of the tragedy settled over her she hugged her arms around her chest what if id still been in the hold with jack what if we hadnt gone to the island she suddenly sensed someone behind her and glanced back jack stood a few steps away as if unsure if he should disturb her she appreciated his civility though it irritated her a little too did he think she was that fragile she nodded to him to join her she wanted answers some explanation that would allow her to sleep at night she hoped he could give it he came forward im sorry for dragging you into this if i had known how could you have known she turned to study the shoreline as jack joined her at the rail a long stretch of silence followed as each tested their footing with the other what do you think happened she finally asked the explosion earlier you had a theory something about a dead mans switch he made a noncommittal sound at the back of his throat well need a demolition expert to confirm it but while you were working here i inspected the wreckage looks like the fuel tank exploded maybe triggered by some sort of failsafe your dead mans switch he nodded someone else knew about that boat the cargo had to come from somewhere had to be headed somewhere after the storm when no word reached that other party they must have triggered the failsafe by radio to destroy the cargo and cover things up his words reminded her of her other responsibility the animals how many made it unfortunately the team only had time to ferry off a handful of the animals before the explosion the parrot the pair of monkeys the lamb they also managed to salvage that clutch of python eggs but the snake and all the rest were lost we also have the jaguar cub thats right i hadnt forgotten despite all that happened theres another survivor to worry about the cubs mother shes still out there somewhere as soon as we hit new orleans ive got to arrange a search party and in the meantime ill set in motion the genetic studies necessary to figure out exactly what happened to those animals try to ascertain who might have been capable of all this good ill call tomorrow to see what you found he began to turn away but she grabbed his arm wait jack i can have everything set up at acres before nightfall his brow crinkled in confusion not understanding the implication behind her words im going with you tonight she said his crinkles failed to smooth if anything they grew deeper she sighed in exasperation when you go hunting for the cat im coming along he stared hard at her his features turning granite no theres no need for you to come itll be too dangerous anger warmed through herand a part of her appreciated feeling anything after so much death she took strength from that look jack ive hunted big game before im an expert marksman with a tranquilizer gun so am iand im not talking about a tranquilizer gun and i know the bayou better than you and i know big cats better than you lorna cmon jack be reasonable if i were a man would we even be having this conversation you told me that you were going to put together a team of experts trackers hunters your special response team im offering you my expertise he looked ready to argue but she refused to back downand not out of pride i know big cat behavior better than anyone south of the masondixon line she stared him square in the eye my knowledge could save someones life you know that or is preserving your male ego worth someone dying over she knew those last words werent fair her anger had gotten the best of her though before she could take her words back jack turned away be ready by dusk he said and stalked off chapter hours later lorna stood inside the isolation ward of the veterinary hospital at acres power was back up the overhead lights shone brightly off the bank of stainlesssteel cages climbing one wall the ward had been commandeered in order to quarantine the animals recovered from the trawler only five left along with the clutch of eleven python eggs dressed in scrubs she cradled the jaguar cub in the crook of her arm and held a bottle of milk it suckled and gnawed at the rubber nipple eyes closed a low growl flowed whenever she jostled him too much hungry little fella it was his third bottle of milk since arriving here six hours ago she had spent most of her time here and was glad to do it after all the death there was a balm in spending time with the animals to get them settled examined and fed as always she drew comfort and consolation in caring for her patients as a scientist she understood why there had been thousands of studies of the humananimal bond how petting a cat lowered a persons blood pressure how visiting dogs got bedridden hospital patients to respond and revive while no one could quite explain this bond it was real and quantifiable but for lorna it ran even deeper than that when surrounded by animals she felt more herself more alive even her senses seemed more acute noting the milky smell of a puppys breath the coarse feel of a cats tongue on the back of her hand the rumble of a frightened dog more felt under her palm than heard she had always been that way going back to childhood from third grade on she knew she wanted to be a veterinarian and over time while other colleagues grew jaded her bond only grew stronger as lorna continued to feed the cub she walked the bank of kennels the conjoined monkeys shared a middle cage the two were clutched together asleep nestled in a warm pile of towels she noted the small white bandages over their elbows where theyd collected blood samples and run intravenous fluids to hydrate the mistreated pair a steel dish in a corner held a pile of monkey chow along with slivers of fresh bananas lorna had already reviewed the medical file hanging on a clipboard below the cage their blood chemistries and cbc were unremarkable mild anemia and elevated liver enzymes most likely from prolonged malnourishment but despite the terror of their new surroundings the pair had eaten well after their initial tests she noted that someone had already filled in the space for the patients names they had scribbled in huey and dewey she smiled so much for professional detachment but she could hardly complain she rocked the cub in her arm like a baby she had named him bagheera after the panther from kiplings jungle book still despite the endearment of names the facility had a mystery to solve concerning these animals someone had gone to some effort to produce this bizarre cargo blood had been shed to cover it up but why and to what endand more importantly who were they lorna sensed that answers were locked within these animals shortly after arriving each had undergone a thorough physical exam including a fullbody magnetic resonance imaging scan the mri data was still being compiled by a new computermodeling program which used the data to produce threedimensional images of all internal organs she was anxious to see the results what other genetic abnormalities might they find at the back of the ward a haylined run held the small lamb a little girl she lay in a pile of straw looking forlorn without her mother large brown eyes stared at lorna as she passed she was worried about the lamb so far she had refused to nurse off a bottle before lorna could ponder other ways to get the lamb to suckle a loud irritated squawk drew her attention to the final patient she turned to the last survivor of the trawler an avian expert on staff determined the bird to be a male african grey parrot a species from the rain forests of west and central africa though without any feathers or plumage that identification remained far from certain the judgment was based on the birds characteristic white irises set against black pupils and graygreen skin the color pattern made the eyes excessively expressive she knew he wanted out of the cage the parrot had already escaped once shortly after arriving here he had used his beak and claw to flip the door latch and swing it open they found the bird atop the bank of cages screaming whenever anyone came close theyd had to use a net to capture him and return him to his kennel its door securely locked now sorry charlie she said as she stepped closer the parrot leaped to the front of the bars and flashed its eyes black pupils waxing and waning in anger igor the bird screamed at her in an eerily human voice igor good igor igor igor igor lorna realized what he was trying to communicate she smiled so my little man youre igor she stressed the last word clearly his name his eyes stopped flashing the bird cocked his head back and forth studying her more quizzically like someone debating whether to share a secret the name was disturbingly fitting igor was dr frankensteins deformed assistant someone out there had a black sense of humor the parrot turned his head to the side staring at her with one eye want to go go away im sorry a chill crept through with his words she knew psittacine species which included all parrots had a braintobody ratio equal to that of chimpanzees parrots were the smartest of all birds with the cognitive capacity according to some studies of a fiveyearold child igors nervous words reminded her of the famous case study of alex an african grey parrot owned by dr irene pepperberg a professor of psychology at brandeis university alex wielded a vocabulary of a hundred and fifty words and showed an amazing ability to solve problems he could answer questions count numbers even understood the concept of zero and more than that the bird could also express his feelings quite plainly when alex had been left at a veterinary hospital for a surgical procedure he had pleaded with his owner come here i love you im sorry i want to go back igors words here in the isolation ward echoed eerily that same cognition and understanding curious she moved to place the jaguar cub back into its cage the cub had finished the bottle and was already contently half asleep igor continued to watch her tracking her as she returned bagheera to a woolen nest of blankets once she had the cub settled she crossed back to the parrot and leaned closer she spoke softly hello igor hello he mimicked back and climbed up and down the bars still clearly nervous with his new surroundings she struggled to think of a way to help calm himthen remembered her visit to the trawlers hold and had a sudden inspiration she slipped a pda out of her pocket and keyed up the calculator she pressed the icon for a familiar greek letter once ready she asked igor what is pi the parrot froze on the cage door eyed her again then hopped back to his wooden perch he stared at her with one eye then the other cmon igor what is pi he squawked again his head jogged up and down a couple of times then he began a familiar recitation three one four one five nine two six five his head continued to bob with each number rhythmic and regular she stared at her calculators display it was the mathematical constant pi the number sequence was correct the parrots nervous shivering slowly settled as he continued passing beyond the number of digits on her pdas display he sank low to his perch and crouched over his claws clearly finding some solace in the concentrated repetition like someone knitting or an old man working a crossword puzzle he went on and on slipping into an almost hypnotic rhythm she lost count of the number of digits he spouted it had to be well over a hundred she didnt know if the continuing sequence was just nonsense but she planned on repeating the test at the first opportunity she listened for several minutes in stunned silence recognizing she would need pages and pages of the mathematical constant to see if the bird was correct how long a sequence has he memorized and who taught him before she could consider this further the door to the isolation ward pushed open with a soft pop of its double seals igor immediately fell silent she turned as the lanky figure of dr carlton metoyer strode into the ward carlton she said surprised by the directors unannounced visit what are you doing down here he offered her a warm fatherly smile i see youve finished feeding bagheera he stressed the cubs new name his eyes dancing with amusement she inwardly groaned she had only mentioned the cubs name to her research assistant but as always word traveled quickly across acres she felt a flush warm her cheeks she was supposed to be a postdoctoral fellow not a preteen with a new kitten his bellys full she said at least for the next couple hours then hell be crying for his bottle again that should give the lab enough time to finish their genetic analyses whats been done so far she was anxious for any news after arriving at acres with the animals she had spent all her time stabilizing the debilitated animals and assisting in the collection of blood and tissue samples while she had performed the physical exams the dna samples had vanished into the main genetic labdr metoyers exclusive domain the director was worldrenowned for his pioneering work on cloning and interspecies embryo transplants weve barely scratched the surface carlton said but an initial chromosomal assay has already revealed an intriguing quirk were repeating the test right now but i wanted to come down here and fetch you its something you should see for yourself he motioned and headed toward the door he was clearly enthused about something and that excitement passed to her she followed practically vibrating with curiosity as she left she glanced back and spotted igor staring back at her perched again on the door he had returned to his shivering she heard him whisper behind her want to go home chapter lorna hated to close the door on igors plaintive plea but she had a bigger mystery to solve still a pang of sympathy coursed through her dulling the sharp edge of her professional interest as the isolation door clicked shut her boss was already halfway down the hall moving with long purposeful strides he had been speaking but she caught only the last bit and weve already started pcr tests to begin amplifying the key chromosomes but of course dna sequencing will take most of the night she hurried to close the distance with carlton both physically and mentally together they headed down another hallway and reached the double doors to the suite of genetic labs that occupied this wing of the acres facility the main lab was long and narrow lined on both sides by biohazard hoods and workstations the latest genetic equipment filled shelves and tables centrifuges microscopes incubators electrophoresis equipment a digital camera system for visualizing dna and racks of pipettes glassware scales vials of enzymes and pcr chemicals carlton led the way to where two researchersa man and a womanwere crouched before a computer monitor the pair stood so close together both wearing white lab coats they reminded lorna of the conjoined monkeys bonded at the hip just like huey and dewey this is amazing dr paul trent announced and glanced over a shoulder as she reached them he was young thinly built with wavy blond hair combed behind his ears looking more like a california surfer than a leading neurobiologist pauls wife zoë stood next to him she was hispanic her black hair was bobbed shortshorter than her husbandsframing wide cheekbones lightly freckled her lab coat did little to hide the generously curved body beneath the two were biologists from stanford wunderkinds in the field earning their degrees before their midtwenties and already well regarded professionally they were in new orleans on a twoyear grant researching neural development in cloned animals studying the structural differences between the brains of cloned specimens and their original subjects the pair of doctors certainly had come to the right place acres was one of the nations leading facilities involved with cloning in they had been the first to clone a wild carnivore an african cat named ditteaux pronounced ditto for obvious reasons and in the coming year the facility was about to begin the commercial cloning of pets as a method to raise funds for their work with endangered species zoë stepped back from the computer monitor lorna you have to see this lorna moved closer and recognized a karyogram on the screen it showed a set of numbered chromosomes lined up into a chart karyograms were built by using a chemical to trap cell division in its metaphase stage the chromosomes were then separated dyed and sequenced via digital imaging into a numbered karyogram humans carried fortysix chromosomes divided into twentythree pairs the monitor showed twentyeight pairs definitely not human carlton explained we built this karyogram from a white blood cell from one of the capuchin monkeys from the general excitement lorna knew there remained another shoe to drop paul spoke up his voice was full of wonder capuchins normally have a complement of twentyseven pairs of chromosomes lorna stared at the karyogram on the screen but theres twentyeight here exactly zoë said lorna turned to the facilitys director carlton you said you still wanted to repeat the test surely this is a lab error its under way but i suspect well confirm the original findings here he nodded to the computer whys that carlton leaned forward grabbed the computer mouse and toggled through another five genetic maps this next karyogram is from the conjoined twin of the first monkey again twentyeight chromosomal pairs same as the first the next studies are from the lamb the jaguar cub the parrot and this last is from the burmese python the python frowning she glanced across the lab to where an incubator housed the clutch of snake eggs in his desire to confirm what she was beginning to suspect carlton must have opened one of the eggs to get at the developing embryo inside and obtain its dna sample pythons typically have thirtysix pairs of chromosomes carlton continued a mix of micro and macrochromosomes lorna read off the screen there are thirtyseven here thats right one pair more than normal like all the rest thats why im sure well get the same results when we run the genetic studies again its beyond statistical probability that the lab came up with the same error six times in a row lornas mind reeled as she struggled to come to grips with what this implied are you saying that each of the animals from the trawler is showing the same genetic defect that each is carrying an extra set of chromosomes such genetic abnormalities occasionally occurred in humans a single extra chromosome caused a child to be born with down syndrome or there was klinefelters syndrome where a male was born with two x chromosomes forming an xxy karyotype and in rare instances some people were born with an extra pair of chromosomes abnormalities this severe usually resulted in early death or severe mental retardation she frowned at the screen none of her animals exhibited such debilitation the confusion must have been plain on her face i dont think youre understanding the full thrust of what were saying carlton said this extra pair of chromosomes isnt the result of a genetic error it didnt come about from a random mistake in cell division in a sperm or egg how can you be so sure carlton manipulated the mouse and flipped through the six karyograms again he pointed to the last chromosome pair on each of the studies the specimens from the trawler arent just carrying an extra set of chromosomes the director continued theyre carrying the same ones only now did lorna recognize that the extra pair of chromosomes in each of the species looked identical as the implication sank in understanding began to slowly well up it felt like a tide shifting the foundation under her impossible carlton poked at the computer screen that is not an error of nature thats the hand of man someone put that extra pair of chromosomes in all these animals who lorna mumbled out unbalanced to the point of feeling dizzy but also oddly excited by it all carlton turned to her his bushy gray eyebrows resting high on his forehead his wide eyes shone with raw curiosity the bigger question my dear is why chapter deep in the bayou danny hemples father waded through the reeds youre trying my last nerve boy sometimes youre as useless as tits on a bull danny didnt argue he knew better at seventeen he was nearly as big as his father but not even half as mean hed once watched his dad beat a man bloody with the handle of a hammer payback for shortchanging him on his share of a fishing haul at the moment danny watched his father drag a crab trap out of the muddy reeds it didnt belong to them and it wasnt some old barnacleencrusted trap that had been long abandoned it looked brandspankingnew with a fresh line buoy and legal tag still attached his father used a pocketknife to cut the line and tag away he slogged through the reeds with his prize danny spotted a dozen or so goodsize louisiana blue crabs scuttling within the stolen trap boy get your thumb out of your ass and move the damned boat closer we dont have all day his father wore waders held up by suspenders as he worked through the shallows danny poled the boat closer to him it was a halfrusted airboat thatd had its fan removed and replaced with an old outboard evinrude this close to the muddy bank it was too shallow to use the engineand it would be too noisy anyway what they were doing could get them in big trouble with the state wildlife guys storms like the one last night wreaked havoc on the thousands of crab traps staked along the waterways near the gulf surges ripped them from their moorings and cast them deeper into the surrounding swamps like throwing out free money his father had often quipped danny had joked with his friends that it was more like casting pearls before swine he had made the mistake of repeating that joke within earshot of his father dannys nose still had a knot from that old break come get this already theres at least two more oink oink danny thought sourly to himself and poled forward once close enough he took the trap from his fathers arms and added it to the four already stacked in the boat it was good haul and as much as he might despise what they were doing he understood why at eight dollars a pound for claw meat and twice that for jumbo lump they might clear close to a grand for the afternoons work not to mention reselling the crab traps back to the same people who once owned them scavenging like this wasnt lost on the fish and wildlife guys if the wardens didnt haul you to jail and fine your ass they held out an open palm for their cut of the bounty the price for doing business out here they explained but that wasnt the worst danger there were other hunters like dannys father fights broke out over territories sometimes leading to bloodshed it was said the alligators out here were well fed aware of that threat danny kept a watch on the bayou around him though mostly with his ears it was hard to see much farther than twenty yards in any direction all around forests of cypress and sweet gum dripped with mosses and vines and shut out the world branches laced over the narrow canal he listened for the trebling whine of a wardens airboat or the growl of another scavengers outboard engine so far all he heard was the whine of mosquitoes and the warbling calls of swallowtailed kites as the birds swept through the branches overhead danny wiped his brow with a handkerchief and stuffed it back in his pocket the days heat seemed trapped under the branches even the shade offered little relief to make things worse the crab pots had begun to stink but what could he do with no choice he poled after his father keeping along the edges of the reeds they were deeper into the bayou than they normally searched and out later than usual danny knew why his father was taking such a risk his little sisters leukemia had relapsed with his father between jobs they had no health insurance the storm had been a godsend so danny didnt begrudge his fathers gruff manner for once he recognized the worry and shame that lay behind it i think theres another trap over there pop danny pointed his pole toward where a small branch of the canal dove into deeper shadows a single white buoy floated in the current near the entrance then go get it while i free this one lines all tangled in some roots as his father cursed behind him danny sank his pole into the water and punted his boat toward the side channel the narrow waterway was covered in a layer of water lilies and wound itself into a dense tangle of forest it looked more like a tunnel than a creek he had to work the boat into the channel to reach the stray buoy a loud splash gave him a start he turned to see a raccoon swimming across the main channel it paddled quickly away danny scowled at it normally the vermin were not that frightened of people and it was a foolhardy flight to begin with many a raccoon ended up as a snack for a hidden alligator before he turned away a second coon leaped from a branch sailed far out and splashed into the water he puzzled at their panic whatcha lookin at his father called at him hurry it up already danny frowned and returned to the task at hand he leaned down and grabbed the buoy he hauled it up and drew in the line he felt the weight of the submerged trap from experience he knew it was a good haul he braced his legs for balance and hauled the trap out of the water crabs packed the wire cage a smile spread over his face as he calculated the value of the catch he dragged the trap into the boat and stacked it with the others as he shifted to pole out of the side channel a flash of white drew his eyes deeper down the waterway he pulled a lowhanging branch out of the way a tangled knot of four buoys floated about fifty feet away all right he used the branch to pull him and the boat deeper down the channel then poled the rest of the way though focused on his goal he kept a watch for any suspicious logs on the banks or any telltale peek of a scaly snout alligators often nested in such secluded channels he didnt overly worry only during mating season did bull alligators grow aggressive and females attack anything that approached their nests besides like his father he had a holstered pistol at his hip he reached the cluster of buoys and was about to lean over and begin untangling them when he saw that their lines trailed toward shore he spotted the cages abandoned at the edge of the water each was mangled and torn open as if dropped into a wood chipper he saw no sign of crabs his first thought was that some bull alligator had gone for an easy meal but a cold finger of dread traced his spine in all his years hed never seen an alligator attack a crab pot and considering how heavy the traps were it took something big to drag them to shore but if not an alligator he swallowed hard his mouth gone dry he straightened and poled away retreating down the channel he remembered the pair of raccoons hightailing it away something had spooked them maybe something more than a kid in a boat he stared back at the mangled cages all too conscious of the stinking cargo sharing his boat he poled away faster a loud crack of a branch wheeled him around his heart jackhammered into his throat a thick tree branch crashed down and landed across the waterway cutting off his escape bushes rustled on the opposite shoreas if something had leaped out of the tree and landed on the far side danny dropped his pole and snatched for his pistol he fumbled with the snap securing the weapon the rustling retreated going fast danny never caught sight of it but he sensed something large and stealthy frozen in place he strained his ears worrying it might circle back a sudden shout almost toppled him out of the boat boy put your dick back in your pants and git back here only then did danny realize the direction of the rustling where it was headed no eldon hemple knew something was wrong he knew it before he heard his sons terrified scream dad eldon had hunted the swamps and bayous since he was kneehigh to his own father and his instincts were honed to a sharp edge the sudden stillness was the only warning it felt as if the sky were pressing down like before a big storm he stood ankledeep in the shallows buried in a thicket of reeds and palmettos he lowered the crab trap back in the water and freed his pistol he turned in a slow circle staring without blinking his body screamed for him to run a primal urge he fought against it not knowing the direction of the danger he strained to listenfor a splash for the snap of a branchsome warning terror squeezed his chest fear not so much for his own life as for his sons he rode the boy hard but he loved him even harder then he heard it behind him a harsh cough not like a man but more like the chuffing of some beast a low growl followed he swung an arm blindly behind him and fired popping off a sharp series of blasts at the same time he ran in the opposite direction toward the deep water danny get outta here he crashed through the reeds razoredged leaves cut his face and bare arms if he could get to deep water dive into the channel behind him something crashed through the palmettos only then did he realize the cough and growl had been purposeful meant to flush him out the reeds broke around him open water lay ahead he bunched his legs for a leaping divebut something massive struck his back pounding him facedown into the shallow water all air was knocked from his lungs knives cut into his shoulder and back he fought to get his arm around to fire blindly over his shoulder he managed one squeeze the gun near his ear the blast deafened but not enough to miss the hissing scream that followed full of blood and fury a shadow fell over him blocking the sun he felt hot breath on his neck jaws clamped onto the back of his head and shoved his face under the water and into the boggy mud he felt pressure in his skull a moment of piercing pain a crack of bone then nothing but darkness danny heard the gunshots the piercing scream of rage the call for him to flee he knew he had only moments bobcats and bears hunted the louisiana wetlands but whatever had made that cry was far larger and had no place among its swamps and bayous the hairs rose all over his body vibrating to that scream he grabbed his pole and propelled his boat away from the main channel it was the only direction open to him the fallen tree limb blocked his way it was far too large and tangled to move on his own and he knew he had no time to struggle with it he had to get as far away as possible as he poled he listened for more gunshots a blistering shout any sign that his father was still alive but the bayou had gone quiet even the mosquitoes seemed to have grown more hushed he dug the pole into the bottom mud and shoved he passed the spot with the mangled crab pots and continued deeper into the maze of hillocks and dense stands of cypress he didnt know this section of the bayou all he knew was that he had to keep moving the weight of the pistol helped keep him breathing he had shoved the gun into his belt not trusting he could free it from its leather holster in time just keep moving it was his only hope he needed to reach open waters maybe even the gulf itself but he realized he was headed in the wrong direction north instead of south he had no hope of reaching the mississippi but small settlements lay between here and the big muddy if he could reach one raise an alarm stir up men men with lots of guns time slowly passed measured by the pounding of his heart it felt like hours but was probably less than one the sun hung low on the horizon at some point noises returned to the swamp the croak of frogs the whistling of birds he even welcomed the buzzing clouds of mosquitoes whatever monster hunted the swamps must have decided not to give chase the thin channel opened at last into a small lake he poled into the center of it glad to see the shoreline retreat around him but the sun had dropped below the tree line turning the lakes surface into a black mirror it was in the reflection that danny caught a flicker of movement along the shoreline something white flashed silently through the forest keeping mostly out of sight he grabbed the pistol from his waistband a deadfall along one edge of the lake allowed him to catch his first glimpse of the beast it looked like a pale tiger only sleeker and longer of limb balanced by a long tail it carried something limp and pale in its bloody muzzle danny feared it was some bit of his father an arm a leg but as he kept his gaze locked over the barrel of his pistol he saw it was a large cub carried by its scruff before the cat disappeared back into the forest it stopped and glanced back at danny their eyes locked its muzzle rippled back and exposed fangs that looked like bony daggers a hot wetness flowed down dannys left leg a trembling shook through him then in a flicker the cat vanished back into the forest danny remained with his pistol still pointed after a full minute he slowly sank into the center of the boat he hugged his knees to his chest he sensed the big cat had moved on but he wasnt going anywhere he would rather starve than ever move closer to shore as he watched the forest around him he could not shake the memory of the creatures gaze there had been nothing bestial in those eyes only calculation and assessment it had seemed to be judging him deciding what was needed to reach him in that moment danny knew the broken tree limb had not blocked his way by accident the cat had done it purposefully to separate the two men it had gone after his father first recognizing the greater threat knowing its other prey was trapped and at its mercy with danny snared as surely as a crab in a pot he was easy pickings for later only something had drawn the beast off something more troubling than a boy in a boat chapter jack crossed over the swinging bridge he didnt bother with the moldy rope rails that lined both sides he didnt look downthough several wooden slats of the bridge had long rotted and fallen away he carried his weight with the easy balance of the familiar ahead his family home rested on one of the small islands in bayou touberline the land was really no more than a hillock pushing out of the black water fringed by mats of algae and edged by saw grass the house sat on the crown of the island a ramshackle construction of rooms assembled more like a jumbled pile of toy blocks each marked additions and extensions built as the menard clan had grown over the past century and a half most rooms were now empty as modern life lured the younger generations away but the core of the ramshackle structure remained a sturdy old stackedstone home it was there his parents still lived well into their seventies along with a smattering of cousins and nieces and nephews an old fishing boat listed by a dock near the side of the house it still floatedmore by the sheer will of his older brother than any real soundness of keel randy sat on a lawn chair at the foot of the dock beer can in one hand staring at the boat barechested he wore kneelength shorts and flipflops his only acknowledgment of jacks arrival was the lifting of his beer can into the air so were going hunting randy said as jack reached him did you call tbob and peeyot they got word theyll be hererandy stared to the lowering sun then belched with a shrug when they get here jack nodded tbob and peeyot thibodeaux were brothers half black cajun half indian they were also the best swamp trackers he knew last spring they had helped find a pair of drug smugglers who had abandoned ship in the mississippi and tried to escape through the delta after a day on their own the escapees were more than happy to be found by the thibodeaux brothers what are we hunting randy asked you never did say a big cat bobcat bigger randy shrugged so thats why you came here to fetch burt is he with daddy where else would he be jack headed toward the house his brother was in an especially sour mood he didnt know why but he could guess the source you shouldnt be drinking if youre coming with us i shoot better with a few beers in me jack rolled his eyes unfortunately his brother was probably right reaching the house he swung open the door he hadnt lived here in over a decade he had his own place near lake pontchartrain a fixerupper he bought after katrina he entered the front parlor this was homemore home than anywhere else the smell of frying oil competed with a black melange of spices over the ages the odor had seeped into the very mortar of the stones along with wood smoke and tobacco he flashed back to his mostly happy childhood spent in this bustling chaotic loud mess of a family it was much quieter now like the house was half slumbering waiting to wake again a call reached him qui cest qça its me dad he called back to find his father only required turning his nose toward the heaviest pall of pipe smoke and following the soft scratchy sound of zydeco music his father was in his study down the hall a stone fireplace filled one wall the rest held shelves stacked with books there you are jack his father made a half gesture toward rising out of his recliner jack waved him back down he settled back with a sigh his father was nearly crippled with arthritis his once robust frame had withered to bone knotted at the joints he probably should be in a nursing home but here was where he was the most content with his books his music and his old hunting dog burt the last of a long line of bloodhounds the dogs were as much a part of the menard family as any brother or sister the blackandtan bloodhound lay by the cold hearth sprawled across the cool stone all legs and ears at thirteen years he had gone gray in the muzzle but he remained strong and healthy and had a nose like no other a nose jack wanted to borrow for the night his father tamped some more tobacco into his pipe heard youre taking the boys out to do a little hunting burt lifted his head ear cocked responding to a welcome word his tail thumped once almost a question asking if hed heard right his nose might be sharp but his hearing was fading that we are jack answered them both good good your mother cleaned and oiled your rifle shes out back with your cousin hanging the laundry jack smiled picturing the old woman taking apart his rifle and delicately cleaning each part as a cajun woman she could probably still do that with her eyes closed in her prime his mother had been the best shot in their family she had once pegged a bull gator from the kitchen window when it shambled out of the water and stalked straight for his kid brother tom had been playing too close to the waters edge left unattended by jack when he was supposed to be watching she had placed one shot straight through the gators eye dropping it dead in its tracks after scolding his younger brother and tanning jacks backside for his dereliction of duty she had simply returned to the dishes the memory dimmed jacks smile she had done her best to protect all of them as fierce as any loving mother but in the end she couldnt protect them from themselves on the way down the hall he had passed the bedroom shared by him and his brother no one used it now it had become little more than a shrine toms awards and trophies still adorned the shelves along with his collection of shells books and old vinyl records there was little left of jack in that room hed been shouldered out by grief and memory his father must have noted something in jacks face i heard you saw that girl today the one who who dated tommy he started to ask how his father knew that then he remembered this was bayou country word especially gossip swept faster through the swamps than any storm he now understood the rather cold reception and surly attitude from randy shes helping with a case an animal smuggling ring nothing important jack felt his face heat up embarrassed not only by the halftruth now but by a larger untruth buried in his past his brothers death had been attributed to a drunken accident lorna had been driving that much of the story was true few people knew the rest lorna was blamed given a slap on the hand mostly because of jacks testimony in private with the judge his family though had never forgiven her she seemed like such a nice girl his father mumbled around his pipe they were just kids jack offered lamely he had promised never to tell anyone other than the judge the truth for both their sakes his father stared at jack the shine in those eyes suggested his father suspected there was more to the story a call from the other end of the house shattered the awkward moment jack his mother shouted where are you i packed a cooler for you and the boys got a basket full of cracklins and boudin too be right there his fathers heavy gaze tracked him as he left the study he let out a sigh as he reached the hall as he stepped out his cell phone vibrated in his pocket glad for the distraction he brought the phone to his ear it was scott nester his secondincommand with the cbp we found someone who saw that damned cat who where a kid in a boat he took potshots at one of our search helicopters to get its attention are you sure its our target oh yeah described a big white cat with big teeth says the cat killed his father weve got a search team looking for the body jacks fingers tightened on the phone did the boy see where the target was headed north he thinks toward the mississippi where exactly was the boy found you got a map i can get one scott passed him the coordinates after a few more instructions jack hung up and hurried over to where his brother stored a set of nautical charts in a cupboard near the back door it was crammed full of fishing gear tackle boxes and all manner of handtied lures he stabbed his thumb on a stray hook as he dug out a map of the delta with chart in hand he pinched away the stubborn lure and wiped the blood on his shirt he crossed to a table unfolded the map and used a pencil to mark the location where the boy in the boat was rescuedor as best he could with the old chart a couple years of shifting sands and repeated flooding blurred the details of even the regions best maps still he was also able to pick out the island where the trawler had gone aground he drew a straight line between the shipwreck and where the boy was found the path aimed due north the same direction the cat had been headed jack extended a dashed line north from the boys location he ran it all the way until he reached the mississippi the line ended at the small river town named port sulphur he marked an x on the map he knew the town itd been almost entirely wiped out by katrina some homes had been washed a hundred feet off their foundations leaning back jack studied the map randy pushed through the back door and joined him tbob and peeyot just got here in their canoe he pointed to the x drawn on the map that where were going thats where were starting well gather everyone in port sulphur and head south into the bayou he stared at the dotted line the sabertoothed cat had to be hiding somewhere along that path so whats holding us up his brother asked and clapped him on the shoulder laissez les bons temps router jack folded the map before he could follow his brothers advice and let the good times roll he had one more thing to do to honor a grudging promise i have someone to pick up first chapter lorna never got back to raking her yard after the storm by the time she climbed the stone steps to her home in the garden district it was late the sun hovered near the horizon casting heavy shadows off the magnolias and towering oaks stormswept leaves and crinkled blossoms formed a jackson pollock painting across her overgrown lawn along with a few broken tiles blown from the roof a dry stone fountain topped by a mossfrosted angel stood in the center of the yard she sighed at the sorry state of the family mansion paint bubbled and peeled across the porch its italianate columns were chipped even the carved mahogany front door took an extra hard tug to pull it open its frame warped from a century of passing seasons she struggled with the door now and fought it open the house was dark her brother was troubleshooting a problem at an offshore oil platform in the gulf he wouldnt be back until tomorrow just as well she flipped on the entryway light a wooden staircase rose on the right side and climbed to a secondstory landing and from there up to the thirdstory level overhead a massive chandelier imported from an eighteenthcentury french chateau hung down through the stairwell half the bulbs were dark it took a feat of engineering to change the bulbs and polish the crystals she dropped the heavy case she was carrying by the door wondering if she had time to draw a hot bath back at acres she had changed out of her scrubs and back into her worn jeans and shirt she longed to shed the soiled clothes and run the hottest bath the old water heater could manage maybe with bubbles and a single glass of chardonnay a girl could dream it would be a long night and tomorrow would be a busy day at acres she had done all she could there for now critical tests were still processing and wouldnt be finished until the morning she was especially interested in the dna analysis of the extra pair of chromosomes shared by all the recovered animals who had been performing these experiments and why answers could lie in the genetic codes of those strange chromosomes before she could reach the stairs a phone jangled from deeper in the house she hurried across the entryway to a hall table it must be jack though she was surprised he wasnt calling her cell phone her heart beat faster anxious to hear about the plans for tonights hunt but as she lifted the phone her heart sankmore than it should havewhen she heard her younger brothers voice it was kyle calling from the oil platform lorna just checkin in making sure the house is still standing at the moment it is cant promise anything beyond that her brother chuckled he must be bored as usual they spoke more on the phone than at the house when together they tried to maintain a measure of privacy for each other which wasnt hard in a home with seven bedrooms and five baths i left a message earlier kyle said figured you mustve been called into work didnt want to bother you there you couldve called though its been a crazy day she gave him a thumbnail version of what had happened christ thats really odd i know were still doing some lab tests no i meant that jack menard called you into the investigation that must have been uncomfortable she took a moment to respond uncomfortable was a pale description of the storm of emotions that had run through her guilt sorrow shame anger and something deeper something hidden but shared between them she pictured jacks stormgray eyes the way his stare seemed to strip her to the bone not even her little brother knew the truth about that bloody night at least youre done with him now kyle said she found her voice again but only a shadow of it thats not exactly true im going to help him search for the escaped jaguar what do you mean by help to offer professional advice that and im going with him on the hunt tonight stunned silence followed then a hard outburst are you plumb nuts why she glanced back at the black case by the door it held a disassembled tranquilizer rifle i want to make sure we capture the cat alive screw the cat youre going into the swamp with a member of a family that would just as soon feed you to a gator she couldnt explain why she had nothing to fear from jack ill be fine it wont be just the two of us therell be a whole search team theres nothing to worry about dont go lorna or at least wait until im back tomorrow i can come with you then no jaguars are nocturnal shell be hunting tonight its our best chance to catch her before anyone else is killed lorna her phone chimed in her pocket ive got another call wait until im back he said in a rush before she could hang up ill talk to you in the morning she clicked the receiver down and fished out her cell phone dr polk here are you ready it was jack his brusque manner instantly set her on edge she heard the familiar whine of a helicopter in the background of course i am can you meet us at the dock behind the audubon zoo i can be there in fifteen minutes whats the plan well pick you up by chopper i have everyone gathering at port sulphur she heard the tension in his voice sensing something left unsaid whats wrong weve had a sighting your cat attacked someone earlier out in the middle of the bayou we found the body a few minutes ago up in a tree wrapped in spanish moss skull was crushed an arm ripped off lorna felt the breath knocked out of her they were already too late jack pressed one last time my team can handle this on our own theres no reason for you to go she stared again at the gun case in the hall jack was wrong she now had two reasons she still wanted to capture the cat alive but its behavior now worried her made her even more anxious to track it the jaguar hadnt holed up as shed hoped it was on the movebut to where jack im going arguing will only cost us time the faster we track this cat the fewer lives will be in danger he sighed heavily over the line be at the dock in fifteen not a minute later like you said weve no time to waste he hung up lorna hurried to the front door there would be no hot bath she snatched her case and tugged open the front door already the sun had sunk to the horizon it would be dark soon as she rushed down the front steps a trickle of doubt ran through her what am i doing her brothers concern jacks warning she had pushed them both aside but their worries had taken root in her found fertile ground she was a veterinarian not a biggame hunter still she didnt stop moving she headed for her brothers bronco parked at the curb she had hesitated once before let fear intimidate her and it had cost a boy his life not this time and not ever again chapter as the sun began to set the marine helicopter banked away from the mississippi river and out over the small town of port sulphur from the air there was not much to distract lorna from her mode of transportation if she kept this up she might even get used to air travel but her sweaty palms and shallow breathing defied any such accommodation now to offset her fright she concentrated on the passing landscape below marking landmarks estimating how long she had to remain airborne below port sulphur was easy to miss covering less than six square miles protected by a weathered and battered levee system it had once been a rugged company town serving freeport sulphur but in the nineties after drilling and refinery operations had shut down the town had begun a slow decline waiting only for katrina to write its epitaph a twentytwofoot wall of water had swept through the town all but wiping the place away of the three thousand or so residents only a small fraction had returned to their flooded homes if lorna hadnt been studying the world below with such anxiety she might have missed the place they were past the town in seconds and over water againa wide shallow lake called bay lanaux they began a fast descent it had been a short flight covering the forty miles as a crow flies from new orleans in less than fifteen minutes short as it was lorna was still ready to get out of this bird tense she jumped slightly when jacks amplified voice cut into her headphones he sat up front with the pilot she shared the back with two other cbp agents they had told her their names but she had already forgotten her mind too occupied with keeping the helicopter flying by sheer willpower well be taking a cbp boat into the canals south of the lake jack explained the boat will act as the base of operations for this mission two smaller airboats will flank our path canvassing the smaller byways and channels to either side and in case theyre needed we have a pair of canoes for tighter places lorna stared out at the gathered maritime force as the helicopter settled to its floats in the water a second larger helicopter lifted off from the lake it had carried in more of jacks team along with some local talent the cbp boat nearby looked to be the same one from earlier an interceptorclass craft made for inland or ocean travel a pair of smaller airboats circled farther out propelled by their giant fans whisking swiftly over the water after they landed chaos ruled as men and weapons were ferried from chopper to boats reaching the aft deck of the cbp boat lorna found herself mostly in the way tussled by big rugged men smelling of cheap aftershave leather and gun oil rough voices barked around her or burst with laughter she moved to a quiet corner away from the tornado of testosterone nearby a halfdozen men in dark green shirts and trousersjacks special response teambustled about securing weapons sidearms shotguns assault rifles nightvision goggles sat atop their helmets no one was taking any chances three other men dressed in hunting vests and jeans shared the back of the boat but they kept to the other side sitting atop overturned canoes lorna recognized the flatbottomed dugouts to be cajun pirogue all three mentwo black one whitedefinitely had the rangy look of backwater cajuns one vaguely resembled jack maybe a relative while dating tommy she had never met all of the menard clan the final member sharing the boat came waltzing up tongue lolling tail wagging it was a purebred bloodhound but even the dogs manner was cocky with a happygolucky glint in his eyes that was pure cajun burt she whispered to herself as memories of happier times swelled through her she might not have met tommys older brother but she had been introduced to the familys best hunting dog jack had mentioned bringing a scent hound along for the hunt but she never thought it would be burt glad for some friendly greeting she knelt to accept the dogs attention he ambled up shaking a bit of drool she reached out a hand to scratch behind one of his impossibly long earsbut a sudden sharp shout froze them both burt git your butt back over here leave that bonne à rien alone the dog glanced over his shoulder and dropped his tail with a reluctant almost apologetic glance at lorna burt turned and returned to the trio by the canoes the one who had barked the order glared over at her it was the man who bore a resemblance to jack probably related lorna didnt understand what he had called herbonne à rienbut from the sneer in his voice it wasnt a flattering term jack had been talking to his secondincommand but he swung around fast and came at the other he grabbed the man by the collar of his flannel shirt and pulled him nose to nose if i ever hear you talk to dr polk like that again ill toss your ass overboard brother or not shes here at my request stow that attitude or get off my boat lorna stared harder at the two brother she studied the other man with new eyes that would make him randy the older brother of jack and tom he had been in jail when she and tom were dating incarcerated for a year after a drunken brawl in a pub on bourbon street it didnt help that he had slugged an offduty policeman randy seemed about to argue and even placed a palm on jacks chest as if to shove his brother away but he mustve read something in jacks face his arm fell away he took a step back and tried to shrug it off with a halfhearted acknowledgment youre the boss little brother not satisfied jack held him a moment longer letting his intensity burn randy finally sagged mais oui all right i heard you jack let him go and glanced to lorna in the same apologetic way as the hounddog the brother returned to his friends the trio retreated to the far side of the canoes once jack finished with orders for his secondincommand he joined lorna sorry about that cmon before you cause any more trouble let me show you the layout for tonights search see if you can offer any advice thats why youre here isnt it she rankled a bit at his surliness but she kept her mouth shut she followed him toward the pilots cabin of the boat as he held the door for her she was surprised to discover that the cabin was airconditioned almost chilly compared with the persistent heat of the evening the sun had set but the western sky still glowed a rosy orange he led her to a chart table the only other occupant in the cabin was the ships pilot dressed like all of jacks men in the cbp rough duty uniform minus the helmet the ship was already headed across bay lanaux the trundle of the engine vibrated the deck through her hiking boots the line of bayou forest stretched ahead of them looking impenetrable and dark heres the route were taking jack placed a palm on a map clipped to the table he ran a finger down a line drawn on the chart after the storm we estimate the cat made landfall near bay joe wise then headed due north his finger stopped here is where we rescued the boy that cat covered a lot of ground in a short time lorna had already heard the details about that fatal encounter she took a deep breath glad to fall back on her professional background jaguars hunt a wide territory she started thats why shes on the move shes genetically wired to keep moving until she finds a spot that she believes will support her so she could keep moving for a while definitely this migratory trait is one of the reasons jaguars are endangered in the wild their native jungles and forests are being encroached upon and broken apart by man with this strong drive to roam the breakup of their forests was driving them into deadly encounters with people she had read about an environmental project was under way to create a continentspanning chain of wild forests linked from mexico to south america a vast landscape through which the jaguar populations could expand and migrate freely it was called the paseo de jaguar or path of the jaguar she studied the map trying to figure out this particular jaguars paseo there was one important clue lets not forget that she also has a cub lorna pressed so shell be looking for a territory with a rich food supply rich enough for both of them jack kept to her shoulder studying the map alongside her but where if she continues north shell be passing between adams bay and lake washington thats deep bayou country where do we even begin to search we start with her food supply the bayous are the perfect environment for a jaguar they typically hunt along waterways in fact a large part of their diet is seafood turtles fish caiman jack turned at her the kid we rescued said the cat had torn into a bunch of crab pots she nodded jaguars are opportunistic carnivores theyll eat anything they can even bring down cows and fullgrown horses she responded to the disbelief in his face theyre the perfect killing machine where tigers and lions rip out the throat of their prey jaguars kill by crushing their preys skull they have the strongest jaws of any large cat evolved its believed to help jaguars crack through the ironhard shells of turtles if they like turtles weve got plenty of em in the bayous terrapin snapping turtles and all manner of cooters and sliders yes but theyre small and less abundant than our jaguar will need with her body mass shell be looking for a dense and easily accessible food supply she wont stop until she finds it jack suddenly stiffened beside her what she asked he leaned closer to the map and ran his finger along the handdrawn line he also searched to both sides of the path his finger stopped and tapped a name was written under there bayou cook jack straightened and glanced to her how sharp is a jaguars sense of smell extremely sharp theyre mostly nocturnal hunters so they have to be able to track prey by scent how far do you think they could track a smell hard to say depends on the source of the odor its strength the wind direction she shook her head lots of variables could be many miles if the conditions were right so if a place gave off a really strong odor and the wind was in the right direction it could draw the cat even from miles away sure but it would have to be a scent that the cat recognized as a food source you said jaguars fed not just on turtles and fish but also on caiman the southern cousin of the american alligator thats right so if there was a concentrated source for such a meal a place that really smelled strongly it would definitely draw her jack ripped the chart from the clips and carried it over to the boats pilot he pointed this is where were headed bayou cook radio the airboats let them know theres been a change in plans well head directly over there yes sir jack returned the map in his hand whats at bayou cook lorna asked a tourist site draws sightseers yearround mostly from the cruise ships that dock in new orleans you get a swamp tour an airboat ride and at the end a visit to bayou cook whats there jack stared hard at her certainty in his eyes uncle joes alligator farm chapter uncle joe had no interest in children but the camp groups brought in good money he stood on the front porch of his house with a tall frosted bottle of budweiser resting on the rail the scorching day only seemed to grow hotter and damper as the sun faded away it was like that out here the first hour after sunset the heat seemed reluctant to leave overstaying its welcome but slowly over the course of the night it began to drain away making it easier to breathe he enjoyed that time of night course the beer helped too he took a deep swig and stared across the thirty acres of his property on the far side a new campsite had been carved out of the neighboring stand of oldgrowth cypress forest it was currently occupied by a troop of boy scouts from baton rouge booked for the entire week campfires flickered among the tents and strings of lanterns decorated the encampment songs echoed through the early evening accompanied by the honking of bullfrogs and the occasional hoot from an owl or bellow from a bull alligator between his log home and the campsite stretched the eight pools and pits of the alligator farm he also had a bobcat exhibit and a shallow pond that held gipper a giant snapping turtle the farm was crisscrossed with elevated walkways and observation decks he looked on with pride it had cost him over half a million to expand the place from a single pond with a few breeding alligators to this singular attraction of the bayou last year alone he had grossed three times his investment of course some of that money was under the table as a conservator he wasnt supposed to sell the alligators for skin or meat but it didnt cost much to grease the palms of local enforcement agents to get them to look the other way and for some wealthy anglers newly hatched baby alligators were considered the best bait for bass fishing across the farm joe watched a couple men patrol the walkways rifles at their shoulders they were the local militia hed hired earlier today after hearing of some large cat sighted near the coast he had been warned by radio to evacuate the area but the gulf was far away and he would lose thousands in deposits and campsite rentals from the scout troop alone if he evacuated besides the warning was just that a warning not an order he hadnt let katrina chase him off he wasnt about to let some wildcat do the same to justify his decision he had hired four men from the parishs sheriffs department in these hard times everyone was looking for a little overtime footsteps approached behind him papa im off to feed elvis he glanced back as his daughter crossed the porch she carried a cookie tray stacked with chicken carcasses not too many we have a show scheduled for the morning for the campers i want him hungry you cant starve the old fella she scolded him gently he waved her away feeling a welling of love and pride for his only child at twentytwo stella had been accepted to business school at tulane the first of his family to attend college she was aiming for an mba but also took classes in environmental law while his preservation efforts here at the farm were motivated by profit she was a true conservationist she knew about his underthetable dealings but she had a good head on her shoulders this was louisiana nothing got done without some backroom bargaining and besides many of his illicit profits went right back into the farm and its many conservation programs she climbed down the stairs to the first of the elevated walkways that crossed the ponds footsteps again sounded behind him accompanied by a slight shaking of the deck his wife joined him wiping her pudgy hands on a dish towel she took his beer bottle shook it to judge how much was left then pulled out a fresh bottle from her apron pocket and handed it to him thanks peg she settled next to him and leaned her elbows on the rail she sipped at the remains of his old beer she was a large woman but he liked her big he was not exactly skinny himself with his belly hanging farther and farther over his belt buckle each year and under his lsu ball cap his hairline was retreating just as quickly as his belly was expanding i wish shed wear more clothing his wife said he watched stella cross toward the central pool he understood his wifes concern she wore cutoff shorts and a blouse tied around her midriff exposing her belly she hadnt even bothered with shoes and she definitely hadnt inherited any fat genes from them she was all muscle and curves with long blond hair like some venus of the bayou joe was not unaware of the effect she had on the local boys not that she gave any of them the time of day in fact it was long odds that hed ever get the opportunity to change the name of his farm from uncle joes to grandpa joes he suspected stellas interests lay elsewhere than boys she talked much too much about her friend at tulane a girl named sandra who wore a bikers jacket and leather boots but maybe it was just a phase he took a big swallow from his bottle if only she met the right boy cmon big fella who wants a latenight snack stella stood on the observation deck over the largest of the farms ponds her only illumination was a single lantern on a pole the black water below merely reflected the light hiding what lurked beneath its surface she unhitched the gate in the fence with one hand while balancing the tray of chicken carcasses in the other she had freshly slaughtered the four chickens herself blood still warm spilled off the tray and down her arm she grimaced and headed out onto the bare plank that extended over the pond like a diving board she moved to the end and leaned over the water until she could see her own reflection in the pond there wasnt even a ripple but she knew elvis was down there the bull alligator had been at the farm longer than any of them one of the original inhabitants of the breeding pond when her daddy first bought the place since hed been caught in the wild no one knew elviss exact age but a team of biologists guessed the alligator had to be close to thirty years old the scientists had come here to collect blood samples from the ponds denizens apparently a protein found in alligator blood showed promise for a new generation of powerful antibiotics killing even resistant superbugs but even the biologists hadnt attempted to approach elvis he stretched eighteen feet long and weighed well over half a ton no one messed with elvis past his breeding age he had the pond to himself and liked it that way he was definitely spoiled she set down the cookie tray next to her and knelt at the end of the plank grabbing one of the bloody carcasses she extended her arm out over the water droplets of blood fell and lightly splashed into the water below sending out faint circular ripples she waitedbut it didnt take long across the pond a new set of ripples formed a v and aimed toward her position the tip of the alligators snout was all that was visible it glided smoothly toward her unhurried but determined behind a sashaying swirl marked the swish of elviss massive tail still hidden under the water it was that movement almost sexual in its sway that earned the alligator its nickname cmon elvis i dont have all night she shook the chicken as if put off by her demand he sank out of sight all ripples died away stella tensed movement at the corner of her eye drew her attention across the pond caught for just a glimpse something bright flowed through the forest reflecting the moonlight then vanished back into the darkness she stared at the spot already beginning to doubt shed seen anything the swamp was full of stories of ghosts usually attributed to glowing swamp gas what the cajuns called feu follet or crazy fire but this wasnt swamp gas she squinted for any other sign of it concentrating with both eyes and earsthen an eruption blasted below her water fountained upward along with the explosive surge of a half ton of armored muscle massive gaping jaws lined by jagged yellow teeth surged up toward her close enough she couldve leaned down and tapped the creatures nose elvis could leap high out of the water clearing even his hind legs stella dropped the chicken into those open jaws they clamped shut with an audible snap gravity took over and dragged elvis back down he splashed heavily and sank away with his prize stella dropped another two chickens into the water normally alligators needed movement to draw them to feed but elvis was accustomed to being handfed hed fish out the other two carcasses at his leisure minding her fathers instructions she left the fourth chicken on the tray done with the feeding she collected the cookie tray and turned to head back a large shape blocked the gate startled she fell back a step almost tumbling off the end of the plank but it was one of her daddys hired guns he carried a shotgun a militarygrade twelvegauge over his shoulder and leaned on the gatepost done feeding the beast eh see you gotcha an extra chicken there the man shifted so that the lamplight revealed the speaker ten years older he was a bull of a man though a bull that had gone to pot he wore a dirty stetson that did little to hide the greasy strings of his mudbrown hair he sucked on a toothpick and spoke around it one hand rested on a fat belt buckle shaped like a set of steer horns she scowled and headed toward the gate shouldnt you be patrolling thats what my daddy paid you for he leaned on a hip completely blocking her way why dont you be a good girl and head on back to the house and cook me up some of that chicken sweetheart his gaze traveled up and down her form as if he were interested in more than just chicken disgust churned up but also a trickle of fear she was all too conscious of her exposurenot just the amount of bare skin but also her precarious perch on the plank she also knew this man well enough to fear him garland chase better known around these parts as gar because of his resemblance to the nasty snakefish that plagued these swampswas the sheriffs son and everyone in pasquamish parish knew his daddy turned a blind eye to his boys lessthanlegal activities including running his own protection racket stellas father volunteered a monthly stipend to the policemens orphan fund paid directly to this asshole my daddys paid you plenty for the night she said you can fetch your own dinner feigning more courage than she felt she straightened her shoulders and headed toward the gate she refused to let him intimidate her he backed aside but only a step she tried to push past him but at the last moment he blocked the way with a thick arm again he leaned in close she smelled his breath he had been drinking whats wrong cant dykes cook he asked or is it your girlfriend who does all the cooking what you need is a real man someone to teach you how to fetch and carry like a good wife fear turned to fury in a heartbeat id rather fuck elvis the man stiffened his fat lips disappearing into a sneer maybe ill throw you in there and you can try accidents happen all the time in the swamps stella knew this wasnt an idle threat the man wasnt above such actions gar and his cronies were known to have caused accidents in the past it was one of the reasons her daddy never missed a payment she shoved his arm out of the way but he kept tight to her his eyes gone dead mean at that moment the screaming startedloud strident and terrified they both turned it rose from the boy scout camp chapter lorna sat by herself on the front deck of the cbp boat it slid smoothly down a narrow canal framed by ancient cypress trees the low rumble of the engine had a lulling effect she had not realized how tired she was until this quiet moment she took what rest she could staring out at the spread of the bayou half a mile ahead the sharper whines of the two airboats led the way their searchlights were willothewisps in the darkness closer at hand fireflies flickered in branches and flew in warning patterns across the channel she listened to the swamp breathe around her the wash of water through cypress knees the whispery rattle of leaves from an occasional ocean breeze all accompanied by the heavy croaking of bullfrogs the screech of an owl the ultrasonic whistle of hunting bats beneath it all she sensed something timeless and slumbering about this place a glimpse of a prehistoric world a sliver of a primordial eden are you hungry the voice made her jump she had been close to drifting off lost in her private thoughts she sat up smelling something wonderful and spicy in the air it cut sharply through the moldy mire of the swamp jack approached he had a helmet under one arm and a plastic bowl in the other crawfish gumbo hope you like okra wouldnt be a southerner if i didnt she took the bowl gratefully she was surprised to discover a couple pieces of pain perdu floating in the stew her mother used to make it every sunday morning soaking stale bread in milk and cinnamon overnight then frying it in a skillet the smell would fill the entire house shed never had pain perdu served with gumbo she spooned up a piece questioningly jack spoke a grin behind his words my grandméres recipe try it she tasted a chunk of the sodden bread her eyes slipped closed ohmygod the blend of heat from the gumbo and sweetness of the cinnamon came close to making her swoon the grin in his voice reached his face we cajuns know a thing or two about cookin he sat near her as she worked her way through the bowl they kept each other quiet company but it slowly turned uncomfortable there was too much hanging between them ghosts of the past that grew all too real in the dark swamp and the silence jack finally broke the tension as if needing to push back the darkness he swept out an arm and captured a flash of light that flickered past he opened his fingers to reveal a tiny firefly gone dark its magic broken just a small winged beetle again where my grandmére was a great cook my grandpére was a bit of a medicine man he had all sorts of homegrown remedies bathing in pepper grass to soak away aches if you had a fever you slept under the bed he used to crush fireflies and mix them with puregrain alcohol to make an ointment cured rheumatism he claimed jack blew on the beetle and sent it winging away again flickering and winking brightly i still remember him walking around the house in his underwear at night with glowing goop smeared all over his shoulders and knees a warm laugh bubbled out of her your brother once mentioned that said it scared him to death i remember grandpére passed away when tom was only six he was too young to understand course it didnt help that whenever we spotted some fiery swamp gas in the bayou id tell him it was the ghost of grandpére coming to get him she smiled as their two memories wrapped around each other centered around tom silence again dropped around them it was the problem with keeping company with jack no matter what they discussed they had their own ghost haunting them in that moment they couldve let the silence crush them drive them apart but jack remained seated plainly there was much left unsaid between them left unexplained for years his voice dropped to a breath but she still heard the pain i have to ask do you ever regret your decision she tensed she had never talked about it aloud with anyone at least not directly but if anyone deserved an honest answer it was jack her breathing grew harder she immediately went back to that moment in the bathroom staring down at the ept strip as always the past was never more than a heartbeat away if i could take it all back she said i would and not just for toms sake theres not a day goes by that i dont think about it her hand drifted to her belly i shouldve been stronger jack waited a half breath clearly weighing how much and what to say you and tom were just kids she shook her head slightly i was fifteen old enough to know better before and after she and tom had made love in the garden shed at her house after a spring dance they were stupid and in love having dated for almost a year theyd both been virgins their coupling had been painful and illconceived and full of misconceptions no one got pregnant the first time after she missed her period followed by confirmation with a pregnancy test kit that particular misconception was shattered the full weight of reality and responsibility came crashing down on them theyd kept silent about it a terrifying secret between them that wasnt going away over the next month she had practically cleaned out a neighboring towns drugstore of its test kits she prayed on her knees every night what were they to do she wasnt ready for a child to be a mother tom was terrified of how their parents would respond she had also been raised catholic had her first communion at the st louis cathedral there seemed no options especially if her parents learned the truth tom had suggested a solution in the neighboring parish there was a midwife who performed abortions in secret and not the clotheshanger sort of deal she had been trained at a planned parenthood clinic taking that skill along with some blackmarket tools and drugs and setting up a makeshift clinic out of an old house in the delta the midwife ran a booming business and it wasnt just scared teenagers but also cheating spouses rape victims and anyone who needed to keep a secret there were plenty of those in southern louisiana the region had an unwritten rule as long as you didnt talk about it it never happened and in the end that was the true power of the bayou under its dark bower secrets could be drowned forever but it was a delusion to think such secrets truly died someone still had to live with them and often what was thought gone forever rose to the surface again jack read the pain in the womans posture the grief shining so plainly in her face he shouldve kept his mouth shut it wasnt his place to question her to drive this stake through her heart when it came to this story he had his own burden to bear maybe thats why he was here to find some way to forgive himself jack spoke into the quiet tom never said a word about the pregnacy not even to me we were sharing the same bedroom so i knew something was wrong he got all sullen and quiet walked around the house like he was waiting for someone to hit him over the head it wasnt until he called that night half drunk sobbing perhaps seeking absolution from his older brother lorna turned to him she had never heard this part what did he say jack rubbed at the stubble on his chin it made too loud a scratching sound so he dropped his hand back to his lap you were with the midwife at the time while he was waiting he slipped off to a nearby backwater moonshine bar and got drunk she stared at him waiting for more he knew she was well familiar with that part of the story already i could barely understand him jack continued he got you pregnant that much was clear that wasnt all on him she added he nodded moving on tom was racked by guilt he was sure he had ruined your life sure that you would hate him but more than anything he felt like he had pressured you into going out there that it was the wrong choice but now it was too late she glanced back to him i knew he was scared like i was but i didnt know he was that tortured he kept that locked away its the cajun way joie de vivre sadness is supposed to be bottled up especially for the men probably why tom got drunk couldnt keep that up without some anesthesia she frowned when i came out and found him slurring and weaving i got so angry i was in pain half drugged on sedatives and there he was drunk i yelled at him lit into him good we had planned on going to a hotel after the procedure my parents thought i was sleeping over with a friend it was all planned but after i found him in that state i figured we would have to spend the night in the back of his truck wait until he sobered up jack heard the catch in her voice and knew why but tom hadnt been drinking alone no about that time jack had been racing across the parish on his motorcycle after the drunken call he knew his brother needed help he certainly wasnt fit enough to drive lornas voice grew cold distancing herself as much as possible from the memory tom had already passed out in the back of the truck by the time they came they pulled me out of the rear bed had me on the ground before i even knew what was happening i fought but they pinned me down they had my jeans down to my knees tore open my blouse you dont have to go there lorna she seemed deaf to him i couldnt stop them i still remember the bastards stinking breath fuming with alcohol his laughter his hands tearing at me i shouldve been more careful her voice cracked and she visibly trembled they were predators jack said he pushed against the guilt he heard in her voice they probably scouted regularly around that makeshift clinic with women already half drugged they found easy marks who would report an attack these were women sneaking off for a secret abortion at an illegal clinic their silence was practically guaranteed the bastards probably plied tom with cheap moonshine so hed be out of the picture leaving you alone and vulnerable but i wasnt alone she turned to him her eyes shining in the darkness jack had arrived at that exact time skidding to a stop on his motorcycle in the parking lot he spotted them at the edge of the woods on top of lorna a blood rage had filled him at the time he flew into the group of them but he tempered his fury with calculation with three against one he needed to make an example to unleash such a savage attack that it would cow the other two he ripped the bastard off of lorna twisted his arm until bone snapped and a scream followed he then pounded the man half animal in his savagery breaking the bastards nose his cheekbone knocking out his front teeth still he had the wherewithal to tell lorna to run to get in the truck and hightail it out of there he didnt know how many others were out there if they had any friends nearby who would be drawn by the fight while he fought lorna had hesitated by the truck hovering by the door hed thought she was paralyzed by fear get moving you stupid bitch he had screamed at her words he still regretted both for their cruelty then and for the consequences that would follow she had jumped into the cab and with a roar of the engine flew off while beating the man under him to a bloody pulp he watched her fishtail out of the parking lot and onto the narrow winding road that led through the bayou at the time he didnt know his brother was passed out in the open truck bed only later after the accident did he learn the truth she had lost control in the dark miscalculated a turn and ended up plowing into a tree the airbag saved her tom was found fifty feet away facedown in the water lorna recognized the haunted look in jacks eyes she remembered little after the accident the next days had been a blur to her in the end the fallout of that night was typical of louisiana justice deals were struck behind closed doors she was convicted of a dui though not alcoholrelated as everyone suspected following the tox screen on toms body he had a bloodalcohol level four times the legal limit her dui was based on her impairment while under the effect of a sedative a detail kept out of the newspapers to spare her parents any additional humiliation jack had also testified behind closed doors as to why she had been driving at the same time he was also up on assault charges she was ashamed that she never really knew what had happened to him after that he had simply vanished where did you go she finally asked after the courthouse he sighed and shook his head the man i beat up the one that attacked you he came from a wellconnected family lorna sat stunned she struggled to shift her view of the past to match his words shock then anger burned through her wait i thought no one knew who he was during the attack she hadnt gotten a good look at her assailant and out in the backwoods people kept their mouths shut i was railroaded jack explained looking back now i recognize that they feared prosecuting me outright it would expose the attempted rapea crime that in the backwaters is often dismissed as boys being boys but no one wanted to test that theory and besides you hadnt been raped so why stir the pot jack must have felt her go cold next to him those were their words he said not mine either way the case never went to trial still they couldnt just me let go his family had pull mine didnt we had a long history of trouble with the law as you might remember randy was already locked up for assaulting a policeman they made veiled threats against his life if i didnt cooperate if i didnt keep my mouth shut so i was given a choice go to jail or join the marines thats why you left had no choice he kept his eyes purposefully away and to be honest i was happy to leave i was the one who sent you flying away in that truck ordered you to leave how could i face my family and when i did return home after two tours of duty i found it easier to remain silent to let the dead rest in peace lorna understood that all too well even at her house the matter was never discussed openly again by her family if you didnt talk about it it didnt happen they sat for a long spell in silence but it was no longer as heavy or as haunted footsteps finally interrupted jacks secondincommand joined them she had been introduced earlier scott nester was from arkansas and still carried a bit of hillbilly drawl in his voice but his attitude was all professional sir we still havent raised anyone at the farm on the radio how do you want to proceed i can call the chopper to have them head out there jack stood up the warmth and intimacy evaporating as he assumed the mantle of responsibility the farm was told to evacuate maybe thats why no ones answered have you been able to confirm that they left i have kesler still making calls from jacks expression he was still weighing whether to call in the chopper she wasnt sure that was a good idea she lifted her hand that much noise from a helicopter the blaze of its searchlights if the cats nearby the commotion might drive it off we could lose this opportunity jack considered her advice then checked his watch we should reach the farm in another five minutes the chopper cant get there much faster still scotty go ahead and call the pilot make sure he keeps that birds engine hot we dont want he was cut off by the pounding of boots another agent ran up he looked barely older than a teenager jack faced him what is it kesler sir i just fielded a call about the farm did they evacuate no sir i dont know sir jack stared hard at the man willing him to calm down he took a gulping breath after making several calls i received one back from the local chapter of the boy scouts according to the call a group of scouts was headed to the farm this morning to camp there for the week lornas heart sank into her belly no ones heard from them since chapter stella ran across the elevated boardwalks toward the campsite childrens screams continued to burst out sharp and sibilant but they were now punctuated by the deeper shouts from scoutmasters and chaperoning parents her bare feet slapped against the boards followed by the harder pounding of garland chases boots he swore a blue streak next to her a walkietalkie pressed to his lips get everyone over to the camp he hollered more fleet of foot she reached the cleared section of oldgrowth forest first lanterns were strung on lines a few campfires glowed tents dotted the open ground in an array of colors and sizes from an old armysurplus pup tents to elaborate gazebos purchased from the local rei there were also piles of kayaks fishing gear and empty sleeping bags strewn about like the skins of shedding snakes she ran up to one of the scoutmasters a robust fellow whose belly strained his khaki uniform his face was a sweaty crimson whats wrong she asked the screaming rose from the far side of the camp but it seemed to be already subsiding just some spooked kids the scoutmaster said with a scowl they were out gathering firewood claimed they saw a swamp monster came running back screaming bloody murder after all the campfire ghost stories it was like throwing gasoline on fire got all the kids running and hollering half in real terror half in play gar swore under his breath he had his shotgun clutched in one hand the other rested on a knee as he leaned over huffing and gasping from the sprint goddamn kids sorry the camp leader said well get em back under control put em all to bed there wont be any more trouble one of the scouts arrived redheaded and freckled he looked to be around eighteen probably an eagle scout acting as the scoutmasters assistant he dragged an elevenyearold boy by an elbow heres one of the kids causing all the trouble the boy wore swimming trunks and a gryffindor tshirt his eyes were huge glassy he trembled with frightnot because he was in trouble instead his gaze remained fixed on the forest the scoutmaster grabbed his chin and made the boy face him ty look at the ruckus youve caused with your silly story do you want me to send you home right now what would your parents think about that the boy strained against the grip holding him near panic whatever had happened out in the swamp this kid believed it was a monster dropping to a knee to get eye level with him stella reached over and freed the boy from the older men she kept hold of his shoulders ty tell me what you saw he again glanced toward the forest then to her i didnt get a good look his voice was a scared whisper it was all white saw it leap over the water and back into the woods we hightailed it out of there probably just a deer gar said with a dismissive sneer little bastards just scared of the dark the boys shaking grew worse at gars threatening manner stella scowled silently telling the bastard to shut up the boy had seen something but what she remembered catching a fleeting glimpse of something herself in the woods a ghostly shape that seemed to capture and hold the moonlight it was big the boy said lots bigger than a deer how big she asked like a i dont know he swept his arms wide least as big as a small car gar snorted and shouldered his shotgun stella stood up a coldness ran through her without missing a beat she turned to the scoutmaster i want you to gather all the children and head over to my house she pointed to her parents twostory log cabin built stoutly of cypress logs it had ridden out katrina safely she wanted everyone under cover not out in the open what are you talking about the scoutmaster asked why she took a deep breath earlier in the day she had taken the call herself about a big cat loose near the coast the details had been sketchy except for one detail the cat was said to be huge she did her best to keep panic out of her voice theres been a report of a large jaguar loose in the bayou she said escaped from a shipwreck along the coast far from here but lets not take any chances the scoutmaster looked stunned why wasnt i told about by now gars team had arrived the men came puffing up rifles in hand gar seemed to draw strength from their numbers he lifted an arm now lets all calm down i heard about that report too big cat or not theres no way a jaguar covered that much ground in a single day so lets not get all riled up just because some kid jumps at his own shadow the scoutmaster looked unsure the camp was his responsibility ill send some of my guys out to take a look gar assured him if theres anything in the woods theyll find it his men grinned readying their weapons you do that stella said but im still moving the campers over to the cabin gar looked ready to arguethen simply shrugged fine ill go with you make sure theres no other trouble he glared at the boy then turned and ordered his men to sweep the neighboring forest stella swung back to the camp leader get all the children together as quickly and quietly as possible he nodded in a matter of minutes children and adults were gathered into neat groups en masse they set off across the farm traversing the boardwalks kids chattered excitedly adults looked worried or annoyed stella led them with gar trailing behind as much as she despised the man she appreciated his shotgun at her back she kept watch on the forest to either side nothing seemed amiss bullfrogs croaked fireflies flickered and mosquitoes buzzed and divebombed still she felt a prickling along the nape of her neck as if something were staring at her out of the dark forest she was relieved to clamber up the stairs to the family cabin the home was large and though it would be cramped it should hold everyone her parents met her on the porch whats happening her father asked whats all the commotion stella related what she knew with a crinkled brow of concern her mother wiped her hands on her apron then waved to the children lets get everyone inside i can make a big batch of hot chocolate stella kept to the porch as a parade of children filed into the house following her mother like a gaggle of goslings many faces were pinched with worry while others grinned at the excitement of it all her father joined her you made the right call stell peg will get those younguns settled but whatre the odds that cat really is out there gar climbed up to the porch dont matter none my boys are scouting the woods if that cats out there theyll take care of its sorry ass i hope youre right hell its only a damn cat as if summoned by his words a shape dropped out of the dark forest on the far side of the ponds it landed on one of the boardwalks and stood dead still crouched low to the planks practically filling the space its eyes reflected the moonlight staring straight at them holy mother of god stellas father gasped out gar fell back a step while scrambling his shotgun to his shoulder dont stella warned gar fired the blast deafened smoke flowed from the barrel it was a stupid potshot a panicked knee jerk there was no way he could hit the cat at that distance gar expelled the smoking cartridge and onehandedly pumped in another load but he was already too late the beasts long tail swished once in agitation then in a burst of muscle it swung around and dove back into the forest everyone inside her father said gar call your men back we need every weapon here to protect the kids out in the woods a spat of rifle blasts cracked a single bloodcurdling scream followed the three of them remained frozen on the porch the dark forest went silent even the frogs had gone quiet gar kept his cheek pressed to the butt of his shotgun joe stellas mother called from inside into the house her father ordered as they began to retreat a new noise sliced through the quiet a sharp whining it came from the other side of the house where the farms dock and fuel station jutted into a deepwater channel an airboat stella said someone was coming hopefully with lots of guns uncle joe waded across the great room of the cabin through a sea of children sitting on the floor or huddled in small groups wide eyes stared at him scoutmasters called out questions but he was deaf to them he focused on the large stone fireplace that filled the back wall to either side wide windows looked out toward the rear of the house toward the docks he led his daughter and the sheriffs son across the room gar headed to one window with his walkietalkie at his lips shouting for someone to answer him were any of his men still alive out there he and stella moved to the other window taking up a post shoulder to shoulder inside the cabin they could no longer hear the whine of the airboat he reached the window and stared out there was no sign of the boat only the lights of the dock reflecting off the black water what if it wasnt headed here he had no way to radio out after the storm theyd been having trouble with the shortwave a common problem whenever the temperature ran through such extremes humidity condensed inside the equipment wreaking havoc with their reception the warning call had barely been audible the radio had shut down completely after that hed been meaning to fix it but hadnt gotten around to it he studied the waterway the only channel into or out of the farm the canal was narrow and twisted but hed had it dredged deep enough to accommodate the larger tenders that ferried cruiseship passengers to the farm to either side the forest had been groomed to look especially picturesque the underbrush had been cleared to accentuate the size and majesty of the oldgrowth cypresses flowering plants strategically placed added to the beauty as did the manicured beds of water lilies along both shorelines there stella burst out and pointed a sharp light bloomed into existence far down the channel flickering between trees two of them stella said noting a second glow they must be heading here stay by the window ill go down to the dock daddy no at least wait until theyre closer and take gar with you he hesitated the first airboat appeared around a bend in the canal it sailed in a smooth arc propelled by the giant fan at its stern its searchlight speared straight at the cabin blinding them he lifted a hand to shield against the brightness as the airboat raced at full speed toward the dock the second appeared behind it riding the wake of the first rising and falling its light played wildly the only warning was a sharp gasp from his daughter he blinked against the glare catching sight of something large leaping out of the woods and flying high it struck the pilot of the lead airboat and ripped him out of his seat pilot and cat went crashing into the water on the far side splashing into a bed of water lilies before the first wave even washed up onto the bank the cat bounded out of the shallows and back into the woods a body floated on its stomach in the water its head bobbed farther out in the lilies daddy stella pointed back to the empty airboat momentum carried it like a missile straight toward the dock the fuel tank the airboat hit the dock at full speed its nose shot high as it flew up over the edge its underside struck the upright fuel pump and tore it from its stanchions gas sprayed as the boat landed atop it sliding with a scrape of metal on metal a pole toppled over shattering an electric lantern sparks danced across the deck oh no joe held his breath the other airboat sensing the danger tried to turn it twisted broadside pushing into its own wake trying to brake and turn to get away too late a flash of fire and the explosion ripped high joe shoved into his daughter and toppled them both away as the glass in the cabins windows blew out heat and smoke pounded inside sharper screams cut through his ringing ears he turned to see a flaming dock timber shatter through a window in the kitchen he heard a rattle of more debris rain over the roof he knelt up and crawled back to the window the world was on fire even the canal was burning with pools of flaming oil smoke choked and swirled he spotted the second airboat crashed upside down at the edge of the channel tossed there by the blast stella joined him and tugged on an arm the house is on fire she pointed to the kitchen flames had spread from the flying timber he glanced up and spotted curls of smoke in the open rafters along with a telltale glow the roof had caught fire lit by the rain of burning debris we have to get the kids out of here she turned and called through the cacophony of screaming children gar help us get everyone out but the man was already retreating on his own blood dripped down his face cut by broken glass he shoved kids out of his way and cracked the butt of his shotgun into a parents face who tried to stop him gar stella made a move to chase after him but hed already reached the front door and fled through it joe grabbed his daughters elbow you and peg get the kids moving im going for the gun case upstairs check with any of the adults if anyone knows how to handle a firearm send them to me stella stood frozen for a moment scared and half in shock honey take the kids back to the campsite get those fires blazing brightly something broke inside her freeing her she nodded her eyes focused on him more fully daddy what are you fixin to do dont worry ill be right behind you if were going to survive well need every weapon we can find a loud crack echoed above a section of roof opened raining fiery ash into the room he shoved his daughter away from him go chapter a whirlwind of fire swept into the sky aboard the cbp boat everyone froze for a stunned beat as the explosion echoed away jack grabbed his secondincommand by the arm call the chopper now jack spun toward the pilothouse the boat continued down the canal chugging toward a bend in the channel ahead the firestorm collapsed leaving behind a ruddy glow that shone through the forest he caught an oily whiff of fuel in the night breeze he flashed back to the exploded trawler was this another booby trap he dismissed that as unlikely only a handful of people knew his team was on its way to the alligator farm still he wasnt taking any chances throttle down he called to the pilot as he entered the cabin all ahead slow he joined the man at the wheel the engines growl dropped a full octave the boats prow lowered as their course turned into a glide the pilot hauled on the wheel and guided them around the bend in the river jack swore at the sight ahead the world was on fire sir the pilot asked full stop at the end of the channel sat a large log home with a wide dock below it the smoldering wreckage of an airboat lay amid the fiery ruins of the pier jack struggled to understand had the pilot lost control of his craft and rammed the dock he couldnt put it past an airboat pilot they were generally a cocky lot daredevils of the bayous the second airboat rested upside down on the bank of the canal nose buried half in the trees likely tossed there by the explosion in the glow of the fires he spotted bodies in the water scott nester burst into the cabin behind him choppers on its way jack barely heard him and pointed to the canal get swimmers overboard weve got men in the water scott vanished back out again jack followed at his heels his secondincommand shouted orders the smoke had grown thicker oilier falling like an axed tree over the boat at the end of the canal the log house continued to burn a section of its roof collapsed with a plume of fiery ash the fire had already begun to spread into the surrounding forest licking quickly through the shrouds of mossladen trees jack he turned to find lorna at his side her face was pale her eyes huge i heard screaming she pointed toward the inferno sounded like children jack pinched his brow in concentration straining to hear past the crackling roar of the fire he heard nothing but he trusted the certainty in lornas eyes he remembered the report of the missing scouts if there were kids out there his team had to find a way around the flames but how he dared not bring the big boat any closer the conflagration completely cut off the way ahead and with every gust of wind the flames swept wider into the forest he studied the dark swamp this region of the bayou was a maze of sinuous waterways most too narrow for the ships zodiacs but maybe not for something smaller jack turned and spotted randy and the thibodeaux brothers they had kept their posts by the pair of pirogue canoes if they moved quickly enough the canoes could be used to circle around to reach the farm randy jack headed toward his brother gathering men as he crossed the deck each canoe could hold five or six people get those canoes overboard now randy needed no further instructions he matched jacks gaze understanding immediately he flicked his cigarette into the water and turned to the thibodeaux brothers you heard my little brother they moved swiftly literally tossing the canoes over the side water splashed and the boats bobbed back up ropes kept the canoes from drifting away off to the side men donned helmets and slung assault rifles and shotguns then clambered down into the flatbottomed skiffs there was little chatter jacks team responded whipfast to his orders coast guards been alerted scott said at jacks shoulder weve got more boats and choppers on the way he nodded take command of the boat here ill need you to coordinate rescue operations understood jacks eyes momentarily caught on lorna she stood with her arms crossed radiating irritated patience she didnt want to be left behind but she also recognized she was out of her league he turned and climbed over the edge of the boat tbob and peeyot took one canoe along with three of jacks team jack joined his brother and two men in the second boat the plan was for the canoes to head in opposite directions it was the best odds for discovering a way around the fires the thibodeaux brothers boat was already heading east their paddles slicing cleanly into the water jack took a position at the prow of randys canoe his brother manned the stern and guided their direction with a thick wooden paddle they turned toward the western bank aiming for a narrow tributary that spilled away from the main channel and flowed into the deeper bayou jack lowered a pair of nightvision goggles over his eyes ahead the dark swamp snapped into finer detail the goggles used the latest technology known as sensor fusion combining the image intensification of ambient light with the heat differentiation from infrared the only negative was their narrowed view the goggles required constant panning to maintain a decent range of perception as the canoe pushed into the side channel jack absently glanced toward the fires he bit back a curse as the brightness and heat of the flames blazed through his sensitive goggles blinding him he tore his gaze away and to his relief the boat drifted into the darkness under the trees his eyes slowly readjusted the world focused back into phosphorus shades of green ahead a few fireflies flickered like camera flashes in the dark but off to his right the world still shone brightly as if a sun were rising to the south jack kept his gaze fixed forward they needed to find a way around that rising sunbefore it burned them all lorna watched jacks canoe vanish into the darkness the cbp had been left with a skeletal crew jacks secondincommand stood with a satellite phone pressed to the side of his face the boats pilot set about securing an anchor to keep the craft from drifting too close to the growing firestorm in just the few minutes it took to offload jacks team the flames had already grown higher and stretched wider she hated to be left behind but at least she wasnt the only one burt sat on his haunches at her side the hound leaned against her commiserating at being abandoned jack had needed all the room in the tiny canoes for his team no room for burt she felt a shiver in the dogs body the fire and smoke had him nervous she patted his side dont worry burt jack will be back soon a tail thumped the deck twice acknowledging her but still not happy splashing drew her attention to the stern a border patrol agent leaned over the edge of the boat and helped two swimmers roll a body onto the deck it must be one of the airboat pilots even from steps away lorna saw the man was dead burt stood up but lorna held a palm in front of his nose stay the dog obeyed but remained on his legs lorna crossed to see if she could be of any help the agent called down into the water to one of the swimmers what about jerry lorna guessed that was the name of the other airboat pilot the swimmer kicked up higher dead as proof he lifted a gruesome object and placed it atop the deck it was a severed head shocked lorna fell back a step fan blade the swimmer guessed and made a slicing motion across his own throat well retrieve the body next the swimmer slipped back into the water to join his partner lorna wanted to run but she held pat with only a glimpse of the decapitated head she already knew the mans death had not come from a whirling fan blade swallowing back her squeamishness she approached closer and dropped to one knee she avoided looking at the waxen face the open eyes swamp water pooled under the head tinged red against the white deck she concentrated on the neck wound it was not a clean cut instead the wound had a ragged edge not what one would expect from fan blade she reached out and used a fingertip to gingerly tease up a flap of the torn skin noting the pattern of the rip maam the agent said maybe you shouldnt be touching that she ignored him it took all her effort to maintain a dispassionate professionalism in her role as a veterinarian she had performed hundreds of necropsies and pathology exams this was no differentor so she kept telling herself she leaned closer the cervical vertebrae c and c had been crushed pulverized under great force a full five inches of whitegray spinal cord draped from the ruined column like wire stripped from a cable only a tremendous force could have ripped the head from its body in such a manner lorna swallowed hard while working in africa she had come across the carcasses of antelope and gazelles freshly killed by lions examinations of those remains had revealed similar wounds characterized by savage ripping and pulling maam the agent tried again lorna stood up the world darkened at the edges as her certainty grew she stared at the forest the firestorm was not the only danger out there not by far she turned and hurried toward the man left in command here agent nester he was still on his satellite phone but he must have recognized the urgency and terror in her voice he lowered the phone cupping his hand over it for privacy what is it you have to radio jack she said in a rush warn him and the other boat warm them about what the cat that monster we came hunting its already here chapter tbob kept to the front of the boat while his younger brother guided at the back with a paddle with his eyes half closed tbob listened to the bayou he didnt need fancy goggles to hunt like the two border patrol agents who shared his canoe he smelled their aftershave the starch in their clothes he had no use for the pair tbob had been born in the bayouliterally birthed in a canoe like this one he had hunted these parts since he could first walk the bayou was as much kin to him as his own brother as they headed through the swamp he listened to the forest around him night in the bayou was a noisy time he heard the bullfrog the owl the twitter of nesting birds to either side saw grass and reeds rustled as his brother glided their canoe through the dense growth closer at hand the whirring of mosquitoes buzzed his ears in the distance he still heard the hungry grumble of fire eating wood but it had grown muffled as they paddled deeper into the forest still the heat and smoke continued to drive animals outward a pair of marsh hares burst out of the reeds and bounded across the creek a moment later a red deer followed flagging her white tail at them tbob studied their passage the animals werent in full panic so the flames must still be a ways off from the path and direction of the fleeing creatures he kept track of the fires edge tbob had full confidence he could find a way around the flames he tested the water with a fingertip judging currents and guided his brother with hand signals he avoided channels that seemed too stagnant knowing theyd only deadend into a pond or pool instead he kept to the flowing water and aimed them in a sweeping arc around the fires as he helped turn the canoe into a new stream a strange odor struck his nose though it was faint it was still like a slap in the face the smell of the swamp was as familiar as his wifes slim body he knew every exhalation of the bayou no matter the season or the weather his nostril crinkled what he smelled had no part here he lifted a hand and formed a fist peeyot turned his paddle and slowed the canoe to a gentle and silent stop why are we one of the men asked tbob silenced him with a glare and an upraised hand with the goggles in place the agent looked more like an insect than a man stupid couyon tbob turned his attention to the dark forest he let the others keep watch with their hightech gadgets his senses were sharper something had passed through here but was it still around tbob again let his eyelids drift lower listening with his entire body to each splash chirp crackle and rustle a picture of the bayou formed in his minds eye as he sank deeper he discerned a funnel of sound off in the distance shaped both by noises and silences a series of plopping frogs the sudden interruption of a woodpeckers tapping the chittering flight of a squirrel something was out there and on the move slowly furtively it was heading toward the fire rather than away coming toward them tbob pointed and his brother shoved off the muddy bottom of the stream he glided the canoe expertly down the indicated channel tbob no longer avoided the flames he aimed their canoe straight toward the heart of the inferno it was their only chance to vanish into the fires heat and smoke and hope the hunter didnt follow but for that to succeed they needed to move swiftly and silently behind him a radio squelched loudlythen a voice called team one report in the border patrol agent placed a hand on his radio but tbob stopped him from unclipping it and shook his head the four in the boat went dead still eyes staring outward they waited a long breath except for the fires rumble the swamp had gone silent around them im getting no answer from mansours team scott reported in seated stiffly in the canoe jack was about to reply when a spat of rifle fire echoed across the bayou it sounded as close as the next tree but he knew it had to have come from at least a mile off they had their answer lorna was right the cat was here jack lifted the radio how long until the chopper gets here eta in five have it sweep to the east toward where the others went he remembered lornas concern about the helicopters lights rotorwash and engine scaring off the jaguar he prayed it would work tell the pilot to keep low to the tree line maximum noise randy called from the back of the boat whats going on jack kept the radio to his lips and scotty watch yourselves over there get everyone back on board already done were watching both shorelines are you heading back to the boat jack felt the eyes of the other men on him no well continue on try to circle past the fire and offer support to whoevers trapped at the farm they may need our firepower with that cat on the loose aye sir understood jack lowered the radio randy spoke from the stern so were going on he nodded were almost around the fire jack stared through his goggles the heat and glow of the inferno were plain through the trees he hated to turn his back on the thibodeaux brothers and his other teammates but it would take them longer than five minutes to retreat out of the swamp and even longer to track the other canoes path on the far side of the canal jack pointed to a wider flowing stream heading due south if it ran relatively straight they could use it to skirt the edge of the fire and reach the alligator farm randy sighed and shoved off the two other men paddled the canoe glided into the channel and they were off again jack tracked the encroachment of the forest fire unfortunately the channel grew narrower and tree limbs lowered until it felt like they were traveling through a chute made even more pronounced by the tunnel vision of his goggles jack crouched low and still lowhanging branches batted at his helmet and beards of moss slapped his face randy swore behind him but at least the fires stayed to the east of them unfortunately the stream grew more tortuous taking sudden twists and opening into stagnant side pools fireflies swirled in the night creating luminous silvergreen clouds through his goggles half blinded by a swarm jack did not see the branch it smacked him in the face and clawed at his cheek he shoved it out of the way only then realizing his mistake the branch was soft covered in cloth the body fell out of the tree overhead and crashed atop the canoe limbs tangled men shouted in surprise and horror jack ripped off his goggles and yelled for everyone to calm down the corpse draped half in the water facedown over the edge of the canoe it was missing a leg a hand randy pointed a paddle ahead jack twisted the glow from the nearby fires lit up a gruesome sight another two bodies hung in the trees like macabre christmas decorations as he stared thick droplets of blood splashed into the water jack glanced past them about twenty yards away a fence crossed the stream sealing it off a sign hung there though it was dark he could still make out the red lettering no trespassing it had to be the outskirts to the alligator farm theyd made it confirming this jack heard people shouting off in the distance the roar of the fire obscured any words but jack discerned brighter voices among the tumult children keep moving jack said his two men dumped the body overboard paddles splashed and the canoe glided forward passing under the draped bodies a cold drop stuck the back of jacks hand he stared down at the splash of crimson then back at the bodies the positioning of the dead men so near the farm seemed too purposeful as if theyd been left as a warning the cat marking her territory exactly how smart was this beast chapter stella yelled to be heard above the scared cries and sobs of the children spread the campfires in a circle around us stoke them high why are we staying here one den mother asked the fires spreading well be trapped stella noted other eyes staring at them many of them hadnt seen the big cat or how quickly the monster moved if they tried to escape on foot it would pick them off one at a time the campsite is open space stella shouted the wind is heading the other direction and even if the fires circle us we have access to water to soak ourselves but just in case we should start wetting down bandannas be ready to cover noses and mouths against the smoke if the wind shifts shes right her father said nodding to her were safest if we stick here he was covered in soot and sweat he had been helping the men and older boys with setting up the protective ring of fires her mother was with some of the other women keeping the younger children corralled together trying to stave off panic someones coming a man yelled pushing up to them but pointing back at the farm stella and her father turned three figures stood on one of the boardwalks on the far side of the breeding ponds smoke wafted over them the fire raged nearby where had they come from a fourth man climbed over one of the border fences and joined the others are those gars men her father asked i dont think so stella squinted a gust of wind cleared the smoke for a second three of the men wore uniforms had helmets they all carried weapons look like the military they definitely werent gars cronies in fact she had seen neither hide nor hair of garland chase since the fire after fleeing the burning house he had hightailed it toward the radio shack near the edge of the farm it sat on the highest ground its roof bristling with antennas gar must have decided to hole up there the coward likely barricading himself inside on the other side of the farm the four men had gathered and now pounded across the elevated walkways they headed straight toward the campsite the closer they got the more sure stella grew about her initial assessment the men wore combat uniforms and carried assault weapons as they ran they guarded both sides of the boardwalk as if expecting to be attacked did they know about the giant cat in less than a minute the four men came running up her father and the scoutmaster met them the leader of the combat team stood a head taller than the others he studied the camp with a calculating eye agent jack menard with the cbp the man introduced himself so he was with the border patrol as her father gave a thumbnail version of their story she noted a patch on his uniform it bore the symbol of a rearing pegasus with three lightning bolts and the encircling words special response team they were the elite of the patrol we have a boat on the far side of the fires the man said even if it could reach here its too small for this many people but a coast guard rescue unit is on its way with helicopters and boats once theyre here we can begin ferrying everyone to safety but itll take time well need everyone to stay calm her father lowered his voice you should know that theres some sort of white tiger out there one hell of a big monster a nod we know didnt you get the evacuation warning her father glanced sheepishly at her then down doesnt matter the man said not bothering to scold water under the bridge his expression seemed to say he even clapped her father on the shoulder youve done a good job setting up a perimeter fire wall if we stay alert and keep weapons ready well be okay her fathers back drew straighter stella studied the agent with new eyes appreciating how he didnt browbeat her father and avoided demoralizing him during such a tense time recriminations could come later for now the agent wanted everyone focused no wonder this man was a leader agent menard passed on a few orders to his men then unclipped a radio from his belt she hovered a step away eavesdropping weve reached the farm but there are over sixty people here men women children have you heard from the other team as he listened she noted his fingers tighten on the radio his voice cracked bright with anger thickening his cajun accent shes gone and done what lorna headed overland through a section of bottomland forest two border patrol agents flanked her garcia and childress ahead of her trotted burt the hounds nose was buried in the marsh grasses the dog ran with his tail high she carried her assembled tranquilizer gun stiffly in front of her it was acaliber pneudart rifle loaded with a clip of five cc darts containing etorphine hydrocloride known as m a highly potent neuroleptanalgesic a single drop could kill a man five milligrams was enough to drop a rhino still once darted the drug took time to send an animal into a catatonic state so she was happy to have garcia and childress at her back with their assault rifles the three of them had left the cbps zodiac tied up on to the eastern bank of the channel minutes ago theyd all heard the sporadic gunfire from the team on this side of the canal then nothing since theyd kept watch on the forest through nightvision goggles but there had been no sign of the other team still during that vigil lorna had spotted something of interest out in the swamp a heat signature about fifty yards back into the bayou the shape was indistinct she couldnt be sure but it looked too large to be a raccoon she watched it for a full minute it didnt move and seemed nested at the foot of a large cypress finally the silhouette rose and stretched its back forming a characteristic feline arch that seemingly boneless curve so typical of cats it turned a few times then settled back down could it be the jaguars cub the sibling to bagheera back at acres it could explain why the big cat had turned so aggressive the mother wasnt only defending territory and food supply but also her child no wonder she attacked the thibodeaux boat first that team had been unlucky enough to pick this side of the channel where the cub was hidden it all came down to the cub if they could capture it get it back to the boat theyd have the perfect bait for its mother a way to lure it away from the assaulted team that is if the men were still alive and if not theyd still have a tool to control the jaguar and thats just what she had argued with scott nester control the cub you control the mother it was worth the risk of a fast search she had insisted on coming along warning jacks secondincommand that shed jump overboard and swim to shore if necessary as they readied the zodiac scott had tried to radio jack for authorization but thered been no response so scott finally relented just as concerned about his teammates fate still his instructions had been firm to garcia and childress there and back if it runs off you dont pursue he had pointed at lorna drag her back by her hair if she gives you any trouble so they moved swiftly through the forest they aimed toward the large cypress but there was no way to move without any noise within a few steps lorna watched the cubs silhouette slip behind the bole of the tree alerted to their presence was it still there or had it run off generally cubs tend to stick to their nests even in the face of danger she recalled a nature documentary in which an entire litter of lion cubs was killed by a cobra simply because they feared leaving their den with any luck the cub was still there as lorna hiked she caught the barest whisker of a heat signature through her goggles the cub was still behind the tree but it looked ready to bolt she dared not try tranquilizing it the darts were too potent for something so small but she couldnt let it get away burt the hound stopped one ear cocked back listening but he kept his nose fixed ahead he didnt need any goggles to pick out the cub lorna had to trust that the hound was typical of hunting dogs in the area trained like most to hunt raccoons and there was only one sure way of catching a raccoon go tree him boy she commanded burt lunged ahead running low spearing through the grass he angled to the side circling out and around he wasnt about to let his prey escape into the deeper woods as lorna had hoped the cub stuck to its instincts it didnt want to leave the spot where its mother had left it but it also recognized the threat in burt reacting on pure feline instinct the cub shot up the cypress burt hit the tree letting out a loud bawl announcing his success they all took off at a run toward the treed cat lorna hated to terrify the small creature but she also recognized the necessity of its capture and quickly the dogs barking was surely already drawing the big cat in their direction lorna reached the tree first quiet burt the hound bounded about the trunk excited tongue lolling but he obeyed and stopped his bawling the cub was perched on a limb overhead barely newborn it hadnt been able to climb too high huge eyes glassy with fear stared down at them it hissed a warning its coat bristling out in all directions lorna had brought along a thick red fire blanket carried over one shoulder she set down her rifle unfurled the blanket and tossed it like a net over the cub the weight and the surprise rolled the cub off its perch tangled in the blanket it fell but lorna caught it in her arms it squirmed and fought inside the bundled blanket but like its sibling it was malnourished it didnt have much fight she hugged the cub through the blanket trying to stifle its panic with a calming pressure from inside came a plaintive mewling the sound tugged at her heart poor thing maam time to go garcia said he and his partner held their rifles tight to their shoulders they all strained to listen for any telltale sign of an angry mother barreling toward them instead a different noise intruded a heavy thumpthumping they all turned to the north lorna winced as the bright lights flared in her goggles it had to be the helicopter jack had called down from bay lanaux onehanded she pushed the goggles to her forehead darkness enveloped her and the brightness dissolved to a dot in the sky the chopper was still a half mile off but the noise grew louder with every heartbeat lets go garcia pressed lorna reached her free arm and grabbed her rifle from the grass as she straightened she found herself staring at a pair of large eyes deep in the forest reflecting the meager light glowing in the dark she froze a deep growl flowed from burt then in a blink the eyes vanished she backed in a hurried stumble whats wrong childress asked run chapter lorna clambered from the zodiac up into the boat she was winded her heart pounded in her throat reaching the open deck she gazed back toward shore why hadnt the big cat given chase overhead the helicopter hovered its rotors pounded down at them shaking the leaves and branches of the tree line though they had reached the boat with their precious cargo she knew they were all far from safe the tree line was only ten yards off the cat could easily leap that distance from a dead standstill garcia and childress recognized this danger too as soon as their boots hit the deck they spun with their rifles up and pointed toward the shore burt hopped up from the zodiac and sniffed at the blanketwrapped parcel in lornas arms scott nester joined them he had to yell to be heard you found the kitten cub lorna corrected and its mother scott stared at the dark bank nothing moved garcia do you see anything nothing but friggin fireflies the man kept alert but the taut tension in his shoulders loosened maybe dr polk only saw some reflection off the water childress and i didnt see anything out there shes out there lorna insisted it hadnt been refracted starlight off water those glowing eyes still burned in her memory bright with a cunning intelligence if youre right scott said then shell stick close knowing we have her cub that should keep her away from the men out there lorna read the unspoken caveat in the mans worried expression if any of them are still alive lorna hiked the cub higher in her arms it had settled the warmth and darkness lulling it into submission she stared out at the dark woods why hadnt the cat come after them lorna sensed it wasnt the noise and blaze of the hovering helicopter that held her back shed had no fear of attacking the airboat and its pilot the cub squirmed seeking a more comfortable spot while this cub wasnt as sickly as the one theyd recovered from the shipwrecked trawler it was still in poor shape had the mother known that and given up on the cub was that why she hadnt given chase lorna refused to believe that the mother had gone to great lengths to protect her child thus far she would not give up so readily so then where was she what was her plan another five minutes passed still there remained no sign of her the helicopter made a sweeping pass its searchlight spearing the dark forest below scott retreated to the far side of the boat talking and coordinating with the coast guard on his satellite phone the rescue force would arrive on site in another ten minutes burt curled on the deck his nose tucked under his tail the dog seemed little concernedand that worried her the wind blew out of the east if the cats scent was in the air burt should still be wired pacing the deck whining shes gone lorna mumbled behind her scotts voice grew agitated she turned as he lowered his radio and hurried over to lorna jack radioed in the cats been spotted over at the farm why isnt it here i thought you said shed stay by her cub lorna turned and stared toward the burning cabin digesting the new information the helicopter swept past stirring hot smoke over the channel yet careful not to fan the flames toward them still fiery ash rained over the boat and sizzled into the water im sending the chopper jacks way scott said see if it cant chase that monster away from the children despite the heat lorna went cold children slowly she sensed an inkling of the cats intent she thrust out an arm give me the radio i need to speak to jack now jack inspected the circle of fires they completely surrounded the campsite randy kept in step beside him they both carried their rifles jack had everyone retreat into the center of the camps tents as far from the edge of the bayou as possible only those with weapons kept guard near the flames still they only had seven men not enough to keep a perfect vigil on the forest with the fires blazing high jacks nightvision goggles were useless the surrounding oldgrowth forest remained a dark impenetrable wall the cat had been spotted briefly by one of jacks men but it was gone before he could even shift his rifle into position fucking ghost were the words used to describe it randy spoke at his side shes playing with us like a cat with a bunch of mice jack knew what his brother meant the jaguar had proven to be a skilled hunter she wouldnt have allowed herself to be spotted so easily it was as if she were testing them something felt wrong about this his teeth ached with tension of it all over here a man shouted on the far side of the encampment it was one of the scoutmasters his rifle blasted other men scrambled toward his position some fired blindly randy made a move to follow but jack grabbed his arm no maybe it was his years of hunting the bayou or his two tours playing cat and mouse with insurgents in iraq but jack recognized that they were being set up he scanned the forests to either side randy understood mirroring his action his rifle poised and ready at his shoulder but there was too much ground to cover for just the two of them jack spotted the danger too late on the far side of a tent to the left a boy had been carrying firewooda camp chair broken into kindlingtoward the stockpile near one edge of the tents he had stopped half turned toward the sound of the gunshots behind him a large shape burst out of the forest in one bound the cat hurdled the fires and landed within their secured area the attack was so fast the boy didnt even have a chance to scream the cat grabbed him by the back of the shirt spun off one paw and leaped back over the fire and into the woods with the child jack had his rifle up and pointed but he had hesitated for a fraction of a heartbeart afraid hed hit the child an instinctual reaction and the wrong one the boy was dead either way at his waist his radio kicked in jack come in he wouldve ignored the call but the voice was lornas and she sounded panicked he snatched the radio and lifted it to his lips what is it he barked unable to hold back his frustration and anger the cat i think shes going for the children jack let out a shuddering breath youre too late she already attacked and killed a boy killed no jack thats not what from the forest a sharp cry echoed out jack lowered the radio it had to be the boy his wails continued to echo out of the darkness rising and falling in raw terror but at least he was still alive relief fired through jack but also worry why was the boy still alive jack remembered randys description of the cat and the mouse which suggested one grim answer cats played with their food before killing it as jack listened the screaming went on and on lorna heard the cries through the radios open channel that was enough she turned and shoved the radio at scott call the chopper back the helicopter had begun to sweep toward the farm what for i need to get over there with the cub scott frowned but he didnt argue and lifted the radio he shouted into it seconds later the helicopter retreated back toward the boat he lowered the radio we cant land the chopper on the deck scott said theyre going to drop a harness its a short hop over the fire to the farm as realization struck her lorna felt instantly ill her blood drained to her feet her stomach tried to follow they can haul you all the way up into the helicopter scott explained but itll be quicker if they dont have to they can simply ferry you in the harness as she pictured swinging by a wire the helicopter returned with a pounding sweep of its rotors she looked up spooling from a winch by the choppers side door a thick cable lowered down a yellow rescue harness she suddenly regretted her rash decision she hadnt fully thought this through it was bad enough flying in a chopper while inside the cabin the harness arrived swinging and bobbing garcia grabbed it and hauled it toward her she fought not to back away it took all her will to simply hold her ground scott took the blanketwrapped cub as garcia helped her into the harness he slipped it over her head and under her arms then cinched it tightly are you okay he asked as answer she pointed pass me my rifle childress retrieved the tranquilizer gun from the deck with a bit of effort she awkwardly slung it over her shoulder once she was ready scott passed the cub back to her she hugged it to her chest scott gave her a questioning thumbsup not trusting her voice she merely nodded satisfied scott backed a step and twirled his arm over his head the engine above gunned harder and the harness suddenly dug into her armpits her legs lifted off the deck she kicked anxious to touch ground again but it was too late the helicopter climbed while at the same time the winch retracted several yards of the cable she stared down as the boat dropped away under her she tore her gaze away she wanted to close her eyes but knew that would terrify her even more ahead the log home still blazed the roof had long caved in leaving behind a smoldering frame smoke poured upward licking with flames the helicopter climbed higher aiming to fly over the ruins she didnt think theyd make it the pilot must have thought the same the winch hauled her up farther then they were over the inferno the choppers blades cut through the smoke and swirled a searing tornado around her she held her breath and finally closed her eyes the heat scorched as if she were flying over the mouth of a volcano she hugged hard to both the harness and the blanketwrapped cub seconds later they were clear the temperature plummeted she took a tentative breath of clear air and squinted her eyes open the view below was peppered by black ponds wooden walkways platforms and bridges filled the spaces in between along with a few tinroofed outbuildings on the far side of the ponds a circle of fire lit the dark bayou people clustered in its center the campsite the helicopter banked in a gentle arc toward the encampment momentum swung her outward on the cable wind rushed over her for just a moment she felt a flush of exhilarationbut only for a moment movement drew her attention directly below a man burst out of one of the smaller shacks an outbuilding sprouting a tangle of antennas he pounded across the walkway below he waved a thick black shotgun in one hand and cupped his mouth with the other shouting the roar of the helicopter drowned out his words he mustve heard the chopper and thought it was the coast guard rescue force frantic that he was ignored the man ran fastertoo fast he finally spilled over his own legs and went sprawling hard onto the planks she watched his shotgun strike the boards even through the engines howl she heard the gun blasts a staccato series of slugs strafed out of the smoking muzzle then the helicopter lurched above her bobbling in the air like a hooked trout on a line she rocked and jerked in the harness clutching for her life she craned up oily smoke poured from the back of the helicopter an unlucky round must have struck something vital the chopper tipped on its nose and began a fast descent trailing flames now lorna stared down as the world rushed up at her they were going to crash chapter jack watched the helicopter plummet out of the sky below its undercarriage a figure swung in a rescue harness from the flag of blond hair jack knew it was lorna the helicopter fought to slow its descent wobbling wildly rotors faltering the pilot had the wherewithal to aim the craft away from the encampment avoiding the gathered children banking to the west the chopper swung toward the bayou dragging lorna with it she hung thirty feet below its floats as the aircraft dropped she struck the boardwalk hard and skidded across the planks on her back dragged by the crashing helicopter but she wasnt hauled far the chopper crashed into the forest just beyond the farms border spinning rotors sheared treetops then the blades broke away and catapulted deeper in the bayou jack waited for an explosion but only a thick cloud of smoke rolled into the sky the hardfought descent and cushion of the swampy bower must have blunted the impact bolton reese jack turned to his teammates bellowing to be heard above the cries and screams from the camp check on the pilot as they took off jack sprinted toward the nearest bridge followed at his heels by randy hed lost sight of lorna across the farm a man staggered to his feet backlit by flames he stumbled forward heading in lornas direction too he carried a militarygrade shotgun it looked like an aa a combat autoassault weapon used in urban warfare capable of chewing apart a steel oil barrel at thirty yards or blasting through walls jack had seen the man fall followed by the accidental burst from his gun mustve been running with his finger on the trigger goddamn yokel had more firepower than he could handle hed seen it often enough in the backwaters the bigger the gun the bigger the ego jack dismissed the jackass and searched for lorna was she still alive lorna lay on her back dazed ears ringing she must have blacked out for a moment she rose up on an elbow and heard screaming nearby as if she were waking from a nightmare it took her half a breath to remember where she was she remembered twisting on her back as she hit protecting herself as best she could as she was dragged still her entire backside felt as if someone had taken a belt sander to it a shadow fell over her and growled jeezus h christ are you all right the nasal in his voice pitched higher i didnt mean to shoot it was an accident i swear if you hadnt gone off and kept flying away i mean didnt you goddamn see me his words were harsh graveled more accusation than concern as if what had happened were all her fault but there was something else about the voice maybe it was the situation on her back dazed woken into a nightmare past and present blurred around her the shadowy shaped dropped next to her loomed over her his face was sculpted out of darkness he reached for her dont move it sounded like a threat youre all tangled up still she pulled away something about that voice all of a sudden it struck her like a blow to the gut the voice even the shape of the silhouette leaning over her she knew this man gasping in shock she scrambled back as if trying to escape a past that had haunted her for over a decade she became further snarled in the helicopters cable and her harness whats wrong with you the speaker stepped forward turning slightly to face the approach of pounding boots his face lit by the fires she stared shellshocked she recognized that mans features the crooked nose the fat lips the piggish eyes memory crushed her an empty space filled inside her with color and noise in her ears she heard her own sobbing her cries to stop felt again the humiliation and terror she mustve blocked it all away pushed it deep down with everything else traumatized she had somehow convinced herself that shed not gotten a good look at her attacker she was wrong here was the man whod tried to rape her ten years ago whose attack led to toms death lorna she jumped at the call of her name it was jack running toward her coming to the rescue like before blurring past and present even further still lorna didnt take her eyes off the bastard in front of her he seemed to shrink and drop back into the shadows as jack came running up with his brother jack hurried to her side not even giving the monster a second glance he dropped hard to his knees lorna dont move though the words were the same as a moment ago she heard no threat this time only heartfelt concern in jacks voice im okay she said to him then repeated it for herself im okay she grabbed his arm he helped her up and out of the harness over his shoulder she watched her attacker retreat away heading across the farm its him she said jack noted where she staredthen stiffened next to her in recognition his face became a thundercloud randy swore sharply shoulda known garland chase sheriff gumbos inbred bastard who else would go and shoot halfcocked like that lorna clutched jacks shoulder finally putting a name to a nightmare garland chase her voice rang with a mix of certainty and disbelief hes the bastard who attacked me the night tommy died randy turned sharply toward her i know jack whispered randy squinted whatre you two talking about jacks brother knew nothing about that night his family had grown to hate her to blame her the same family shed once hoped would be her own she began to tremble perhaps still half in shock from the crash jack took her in his arms and held her she didnt resist she felt the strength in his arms and something indefinable a warmth and closeness long missing from her life in his arms she realized for the first time the true depth of her loss that horrible nightnot just the loss of an unborn baby and a young lover but also an entire family a future full of love and warmth shed lost it all that night yet with that recognition came no sorrow instead anger hot and bright surged through her lorna was done with secrets sick to the bone of them she pushed out of jacks armsand fully out of that old nightmare this wasnt the past she wasnt a scared halfdrugged teenager any longer she looked around her and spotted her tranquilizer gun she stalked over to the rifle picked it up and hurried ahead fire still blazed down her back with every step but the pain helped focus her jack came alongside her lorna whatre you thinking of doing hes not worth it she burned him with a glare of course hes not worth it ill deal with that bastard later right now we have bigger problems she searched to either side of the boardwalk backtracking along the path on which shed been dragged when she hit shed lost hold of the blanket and the cub both went flying out of her arms on impact but where had they gone she rounded another ponda breeding pond from the looks of itand spotted a flash of crimson below near the waters edge beyond the rail a grassy bank ringed the pond the fire blanket and its cargo had rolled halfway into the water lorna set down her rifle ducked under the rail and dropped below ahead the blanket squirmed a plaintive mewl sounded the motion sent ripples across the ponds mirror out on the water black logs drifted closer drawn by the motion a scalyridged pair of eyes rose like a submarines periscope from the water a pair of boots struck the grassy mud behind her jack she kept her focus on the pond on the blanket and rushed forward she reached the bank in four steps the blanket shook as the trapped cub struggled to escape the water if it got loose ran off a hem of the blanket lifted she spotted a tiny white muzzle whiskers lorna lunged forward sliding on her knees in the mud she grabbed the blanket and scooped up the cub gotcha she leaned back pulling the cub to her chest she rolled to her feet and straightenedwhen water exploded from the ponds edge an alligator burst out jaws wide fishbellywhite maw and yellow teeth flashing in the dark lorna jerked back but she was too slow the jaws snapped with enough force to shatter bone teeth caught the trailing edge of the blanket and ripped it out of her grip the beast surged back and tossed its leathery head the blanket went flying and the cub got hurled along with it the small cat hit the grass rolled then pounced back to its tiny paws it took off like a flash of lightning away from the pond no lorna knew shed never be quick enough to catch it again if it reached the open bayou but jack dove across its path like a tight end catching a fumbled football he snatched the panicked cub in midflight he rolled with the cat clutched to his belly as he came to a stop shadows stirred under the boardwalk behind him jack an alligator surged out of the darkness barreling on four legs toward the man on the ground jack would never gain his feet in time the gator lunged toward him no you dont leatherface a dark shape dropped down from above and landed on the alligators back randy whooped and used his weight to pin the creature down sprawling on top the alligator twisted and rolled but randy kept hold lorna dodged out of the way as the pair came wrestling past before they hit the water randy rabbitkicked with both legs into the gators belly the armored creature went flying tail whipping and splashed far out into the pond lorna hurried and helped randy up more leathery logs floated toward them it was time to get out of here she grabbed the sodden blanket from the water and it was a good thing she did jack was on his feet and struggling with the feral cub panicked and as large as a mediumsize dog it clawed and ripped at him shredding his uniforms sleeves but he refused to let go his face clenched in pain she rushed to him with the blanket held wide give him to me jack gladly shoved the squirming mass of claws and needlesharp saber teeth at her she wrapped the cub again and bundled it up the three of them hurried back to the boardwalk and climbed up onto the planks why is that little monster so important jack asked as he stood blood rolled down his arms and dripped from his fingertips lorna started to answerthen the words died in her throat while turning to explain she happened to glance down the boardwalk toward the forests edge the answer to jacks question crouched at the end of the boardwalk it was a mountain of muscle claws and fangs far larger than she had expected it practically filled the boardwalk the jaguar stared straight at lorna a primal fear gripped her chest making it hard to breathe how long had she been there moonlight and firelight washed over the cats snowy fur from its snarling jaws hung a small boy limp and lifeless caught by his scouting vest according to jacks radio message the boys name was tyler was he dead then the boys arm lifted weakly still alive thank god but plainly in shock jack swung around he raised his rifle but hesitated tyler still lived but a shot that failed to drop the big cat immediately would likely result in the boy being mauled to death dont lorna warned she stepped ahead of jack she parted the blanket to reveal the cub hiking the little fellow higher cmon you know what you really want still staring at her the jaguar lowered the boy to the planks but kept one paw on his chest pinning tyler down lorna she kept her gaze fixed forward recognizing the preternatural intelligence in those eyes i know what im doing she whispered back to jack at least she hoped she did chapter gar lay flat on his stomach trying his best not to be seen his shotgun was trapped under him but he feared shifting to free it ten seconds ago hed been trotting back toward the safety of the radio shack he and his buddies had stashed a case of budweiser in there and had been taking turns during the day to slip inside and wet their whistles what could it hurt gar had never really believed the story of a monster cat loose in the bayou christ how many tall tales had he heard about the swamps over the years many coming from his own mouth figuring it was easy money gar had been more than happy to lounge around the farm drink a few beers he even emptied a couple of the campers wallets pilfered from unsupervised backpacks all in a days work but now everything had changed while fleeing across the farm hed spotted a flash of white out in the forest flowing straight at him reacting instinctively he had turned and hopped over the boardwalk gate and onto the plank on the far side the timber stuck out like a diving board over a pond he had dropped flat to the boardand just in time the huge cat had bounded over the border fence and landed on the boardwalk twenty yards from him he continued to hold his breath stifling a cry of terror under his bulging gut he felt every nail head and knot in the wood his bladder quivered threatening to let loose but he didnt move it would be death to be seen voices drew his attention to the other side of the boardwalk he watched the woman from the helicopter cautiously ease toward the cat she held a bundle of blankets up in her arms behind her he recognized the menard brothersjack and randy even through his terror a twinge of hatred burned in his chest jack had once broken his nose knocked out his two front teeth gar had wanted him dead at the time but instead his daddy got the bastard shipped off to iraq now jack was back at the moment gar was plenty happy about that jack had an assault rifle pinned at his shoulder aimed toward the cat kill the fucker gar silently cursed at him but jack didnt shoot and gar could guess why hed also spotted the boy the cat crouched lower over the little snoteater shoot already damn it the blond woman stopped a few paces past gars hiding spot she dropped to one knee and placed the blanketed bundle on the planks with her back to him he couldnt make out what she was doing something with the blanket and under the blanket why didnt the monster attack her she finally straightened and retreated back toward jack and his brother go on she mumbled under her breath as she passed gars hiding spot again come get your baby on the other side of the boardwalk a low growl flowed from the catfelt more in the gut than heard with the ears it took one pace forward then another abandoning the unconscious boy it slinked forward low to the ground its tail swished in clear agitation whipping side to side muscles bunched and trembled its lips pulled back into a silent snarl baring hugeass fangs as it came closer gar tried to press harder against the planks his bowels churned with a slippery queasiness cold sweat soaked his clothes why wasnt the bastard shooting lorna held a hand up urging jack to hold his fire jaguar skulls were the thickest of all large cats necessary to support the strength of their powerful jaw muscles even at close range a shot to the head might only glance away and a nonfatal shot would turn their standoff into a bloodbath she had to trust that the cat wanted to protect her last child to make this trade her cub in exchange for the boy lorna gambled all her hopesand their liveson the fact that the cat hadnt slain the child the jaguar crept forward its eyes shone a tawny gold most felines had slitted pupils but not jaguars she watched the cats pupils stretch wider thrumming with adrenaline lorna shifted from foot to foot keeping the cat focused on her steps away the jaguar reached the blanket close enough for lorna to catch a whiff of the muskiness of its wet pelt it massed before her a wall of savage intent beautiful and terrifying at the same time large eyes shone with that preternatural intelligence again studying her the cat shifted closer muscles bunching and rolling under the fur like a tidal prehistoric force if lorna reached out a hand now she could almost touch it a part of her wanted toto prove it existed to commune even for a moment with something that did not belong in this world in the shine of those eyes she sensed a bottomless depth something more than cat staring out at her then the moment broke until now the cub at her feet had been silent but it caught a whiff of its mother the cub scrabbled in the snarl of blankets trying to wrestle itself free the mother glanced down not good lorna needed the mothers attention focused on her she stamped her foot the jaguar hissed and crouched lower eyes darting back up to lorna thats right keep looking at me the cat swatted out a huge splayed paw yellow nails caught the edge of the blanket then just as quickly the cat jerked her paw back a black dart flew from the paws pad and spun away into the night a moment ago while setting down the cub lorna had jammed two tranquilizing darts between the planks of the boardwalk the needles pointed up she had hoped that the big cat might step on one of them stabbing and injecting herself without being accompanied by a gunshot or a stinging impact the needle prick might be ignored or so she prayed the cat growled low and harsh before lorna could even step back the jaguar lunged forward panicked shocked at its speed lorna tripped backward and fell hard onto her backside but the cat ignored her the mother grabbed both the blanket and her cub in her teeth then spun around in a blur of fur and muscle and bounded back toward the cover of the forest lorna knew that in another ten minutes the tranquilizer would melt away the cats consciousness sending her into a catatonic state after that it would be safe to track the jaguar and collect her unconscious body lorna allowed herself a moment of relief letting out a longheld breath theyd done it then the crack of a gun made her jump and flinch ahead a flash of crimson exploded from the jaguars left haunch the impact caught the cat in midleap knocked around the jaguar landed on her side and slid right next to the boys slack body lorna swung to jack and his brother but they looked just as startled take that you motherfucker a harsh call shouted in triumph she twisted around to see a figure rise from beyond the boardwalk seeming to hover in midair over the neighboring pond it was that bastard garland chase he had his shotgun up he fired again and again the cat writhed with the impacts but this was no bobcat she was bloodied but far from incapacitated to the side lorna spotted a pile of white fur on the wood the cub knocked loose by the fall and crushed under its mothers bulk it lay limp and lifeless its neck twisted wrong the shotgun blasts grew wilder as the man realized the cat was not down a section of the wood railing exploded beside the jaguar the cat burst toward them in a blood rage confused by the blasts and the pain the cat attacked the closest targets it leaped straight at lorna jack and randy the sharp retort of a rifle blast deafened her left ear she ducked instinctively but noted the right orbit of the cats eye shatter away into a cloud of blood and gore the jaguars attack halted in midlunge as if hitting a wall her massive bulk dropped to the boards legs splayed out lorna started to straighten but jack grabbed her shoulder with one hand he stepped past her the muzzle of his rifle smoking he approached the cat warily his gun still up randy covered him but the cat was clearly dead both mother and child a cry drew her attention over the rail of the boardwalk a gate led out to a plank extending over the neighboring pond it was the hiding spot from which garland chase had shot at the cat endangering everyone but the man was goneno not gone help me she gained her feet and spotted garland hanging from the planks end by his fingertips in his panic he must have lost his footing to the side randy hurried past the cat to check on the boy the gunshots had stirred tyler out of his stupor the boy pushed up groggily lorna unlatched the gate jack i need a hand over here he turnedjust as water erupted out of the black pond below a scaly shape lunged upward jaws wide yellow teeth clamped onto one of garland s kicking legs he wailed as the bulk of the giant alligator ripped him from his perch flailing garland and the alligator crashed back into the water lorna rushed down the plank below the water churned as the gator rolled and shredded its prey a pale hand swept into view then vanished again jack joined her he pointed his rifle but there was no clear shot the black water hid the fight below across the pond a voice called out elvis no a young woman stood atop an observation deck on the far side she dove over the railing and into the water what is she doing jack asked he lunged forward clearly intending to dive in after her lorna clutched his arm wait the woman clearly worked here she had called the gator by name lorna knew some alligators learned to recognize their handlers even coming when called other trainers sometimes swam with their gators as the woman disappeared the waters grew calmer the frenzy died away moments later she reappeared dragging a slack figure by the collar a greasy crimson sheen followed in their wake blood help the young woman hollered behind her the alligator surfaced in the pond the specimen had to be over fifteen feet long from its jaws a pale limb protruded a leg torn away at the knee content with its prize the alligator drifted away lorna turned and hurried toward a set of steps that led down to the ponds bank below the girl struggled to haul the victims body out of the water jack followed at lornas heels i need your belt she called back to him as much as she hated to do it she had to save the bastards life chapter hidden in the bayou duncan kent sat in an ebonyhulled jet boat he sucked on a cherry life savers four other men all equipped in body armor shared the craft with him another boat a twin to his floated twenty yards to his right the team ten in all had been handpicked by duncan they were the elite of ironcreek industries duncan studied the alligator farm through a pair of nightvision binoculars since sunset the two boats had run dark through the swamps the only light in duncan s boat was the small gps unit held in his other hand he had used the device to track the specimen from the coast each beast of the babylon project had been tagged with an electronic marker the plan was for a quick kill and extraction to take down the jaguar during the night and leave no trace behind as luck would have it the first part of his mission had already been accomplished he stared through the binoculars at the cooling bulk of the great cat it was a significant loss but not a fatal one to the babylon project he recalculated his mission objectives as he watched a small group labor around an injured man on the ground the man writhed in agony while another sat on his chest a blond woman set about cinching a makeshift tourniquet around a severed limb duncan lowered his binoculars his team had arrived too late even with the tracker it had taken too long to home in on their target no matter with the cat dead the body would have to be secured but not now not with the coast guard on its way he would have to bide his time discover where it was taken still bile burned in his gut he had warned the ceo of ironcreek about the risks of transporting specimens during a tropical storm but his warning had fallen on deaf ears his superiors were on a tight timetable the specimens had been headed to ironcreek headquarters in bethesda maryland to demonstrate the viability of the babylon project it was essential to ironcreeks future when it came to private military contracting competition had grown fierce with wars being fought on two fronts iraq and afghanistan the business of supplying men supplies and new technologies for the battlefield had grown into a multibilliondollar industry ironcreek competed with raytheon airscan dyncorp and many others for government contracts the key to thriving in this environment was to carve out a unique niche to supply a service or product unlike any other where outfits like blackwater specialized in security and protection services ironcreek industries concentrated on research and development for the military in fact their main competition wasnt from other private outfits but from darpa itself the us defense departments r d agency already the government was moving forward with various bioengineering projects treading too heavily into ironcreeks territory darpa was wiring rats and sharks with cerebral implants learning to control them like biological robots they were inserting electronic chips into insect larvae so moths and flies would mature with the chips grown inside them the list went on and on the latest had darpa dabbling into the genome itself to find ways of enhancing performance through direct genetic manipulation to survive ironcreek needed a leg up in this burgeoning industry they found it in iraq within a biological weapons facility hidden in the heart of the baghdad zoo a laboratory ironcreek learned about from intelligence tortured out of an iraqi military scientist they had paid well to keep that intelligence secured within their own circles duncan had been the one sent over to secure the research and any viable specimens he had paid for the bounty with his own flesh written across his body in scars was proof of the projects viability on the left side of his face four ropy scars ran from the crown of his head to his chin after a week in a coma it took nine surgeries to rebuild his nose fix his broken jaw and screw in dental implants damage to his salivary glands and ducts left him perpetually drymouthed alleviated somewhat by sucking on lozenges and hard candies more scars mapped his bodybut not all of them were physical some nights he woke with his sheets tangled soaked with sweat his lips snarled in a scream of pain and terror memories of that morning in baghdad of the beast leaping on him tearing into himmarked him as surely as any scar the creature had once been a chimpanzee if it hadnt been half starved and debilitated by neglect duncan would not have survived still he had given his blood for this project he wasnt about to see it exposed and destroyed not when they were so close he recognized that there were problems like the recent aberrations that had begun to arise at the test station on lost eden cay but when it came to success in the marketplace speed often outweighed precaution safety first was the motto of the spineless duncan lifted an arm and waved it in a circle the quiet burble of the boats waterjet engines grew sharper as the boats turned away and fled back toward the extraction point sir his secondincommand asked filling that one word with both respect and meaning whats the plan now he was asking duncan pocketed his gps unit the surviving specimens are still locked up at that animal research facility by the river in order to safeguard ironcreeks interest and limit exposure the test subjects would have to be either secured or destroyed he checked his watch and calculated a time line they were running out of night but he dared not waste another day well hit it tonight he said a surgical strike before sunrise in his head he began formulating an attack strategy but his secondincommand had one more question sir once again duncan knew the query behind that one word and answered it no survivors act two babylon rising chapter lorna stood on her front porch sunrise was only a couple of hours away she should be bonetired but the opposite was true she was wired still running on adrenaline from all that had happened during the night a step below her jack waited he had driven her from the new orleans border patrol station where shed finished giving a statement the campers were all safe treated for some minor burns and smoke inhalation the boy seized by the jaguar had been evacuated by a life flight air ambulance as had garland chase the man had lost a lot of blood along with most of his left leg to the alligator but hed live the coast guard had wanted to shoot the gator but lorna had argued against it explaining how the gunshots and fire had riled the beast causing it to lash out with a million years of defensive instinct the farm owners daughterthe one who dove in and rescued garland looked ready to throw herself between the coast guard sharpshooter and the gator in the end elvis lived unfortunately the same couldnt be said about the jaguar and her cub their carcasses were airlifted to acres the animals deaths were a tragic loss but lorna had also watched three mens bodies hauled out of the forest their skulls crushed their throats ripped out the cat was a maneater a remorseless killing machine too dangerous to be allowed to live still not all of the aftermath was tragic the pilot of the crashed helicopter had survived found in the wreckage with a broken arm and collarbone likewise a lone pirogue had paddled into the park appearing on the opposite side of the farm the thibodeaux brothers thought lost to the cathad survived their encounter along with jacks two teammates tbob had had enough swamp savvy to abandon the canoe and retreat his group up a pair of tall cypresses from the high vantage point and hidden from the cat hed taken potshots to drive her off lorna pictured the mothers limp bulk rising into the air hauled aloft in a cargo net she was anxious to get back to acres but jack had insisted she fly with him back to new orleans aboard a coast guard chopper to give a statement afterward he offered to drive her home then to the docks to retrieve her bronco she wanted to grab a change of clothes and head directly out to acres ill wait here jack said from the porch step he stood in his undershirt his uniform top had been shredded and bloodied by the cubs frenzy his left arm was bandaged from wrist to elbow dont be stupid come inside she nodded to his arm youre already seeping through your gauze ive got a firstaid kit inside ill put on a fresh wrap before we head out itll only take a few minutes he tried to hide his injured arm ill be fine cat bites and scratches shouldnt be taken lightly she warned and she certainly had the scars on her arms to prove it did they give you any antibiotics a prescription ill pick it up in the morning she rolled her eyes clearly the coast guard medical team knew nothing about feline injuriesbut then why would they there werent a lot of feral cats on the high seas are you allergic to penicillin she asked and turned to the front door with her keys no cats carry a form of pasteurella in their mouths a toxic and septic bacterium ive seen animal health technicians lose fingers and parts of hands from neglected bite wounds antibiotics must be started immediately i have some augmentin inside i always keep a supply in case i need to selfmedicate she glanced back to jack but you didnt hear that from me he finally relented and climbed the last step to the porch she tugged open the door flicked on the light inside and led him into the foyer the kitchens in back she pointed ill grab my kit and meet you there she climbed the stairs to the upper landing taking the steps two at a time her abraded back protested but she didnt slow definitely wired she retreated to the hall bathroom and opened the medicine chest rows of prescription pill bottles lined the shelves along with various toiletries and sundries she grabbed the bottle of augmentin and shook it plenty still left she also snatched a fresh roll of gauze hydrogen peroxide and iodine as she closed the medicine chest she caught her reflection in the mirror her hair was a scraggly mess half plastered to her skull her clothes had fared even worse she wasnt a vain woman but there were limits even for her she abandoned the medical kit into the sink and turned to the tub she twisted on the shower waited for the steam to rise then climbed in fully clothed she let the water run over her for a full half minute with her eyes still closed she stripped to the skin let the blisteringhot water scald over her then finally climbed back out and toweled off in another few minutes her hair was brushed loose to her shoulders and shed hurried to her room naked and changed into a fresh pair of jeans and white tank top retrieving the medical kit she headed downstairs she found jack sitting at the kitchen table his back to her his head was hanging half drowsing from his posture she hated to disturb him and paused in the doorway for just a moment she flashed back on tom as she caught jack in half silhouette the family resemblance was uncanny relaxed with his guard down jack looked ten years younger she could see the boy hidden behind the hardness of the man almost a ghost of his younger brother he must have heard or sensed her presence his head jerked up and toward her his face going stony again still his cajun accent drawled softly huskily lorna the one word flushed goose bumps along her arms his gaze traveled sleepily up and down her body taking in her new clothes if not so exhausted he might not have been so brazen about it under his raw gaze a warmth traveled deep into her belly and settled there discomfited she hurried to the table and dumped the medical supplies down then crossed to the sink to get a glass of water for him to take with the antibiotics she was glad to have her back to him as she turned on the tap get ahold of yourself already glass in hand she turned back around better take two pills then let me check that arm as he shook out the pills into his palm she pulled up a chair and laid out the fresh gauze and a bottle of betadine he craned back to swallow the antibiotics she noted the pinpricks of blood that stained his undershirt did anyone treat the wounds on your chest she asked theyre just scratches annoyance burned away the residual discomfort of his close presence take off your shirt she said theyre nothing she waved at him dont argue he gave her a tired sheepish look then in one pull shed his shirt his bare chest and belly were crisscrossed with shallow scratches the movement and pull of cloth set a few to bleeding again no one had bothered to clean them she sighed theres a full bath with a shower off the sleeping porch in back i want you to take hot water and soap to any and every wound from that cub we dont have time doctors orders she stood up there are clean towels in there ill get you a fresh shirt my brothers about your size he looked ready to argue but she pointed her arm go ill make a fresh batch of coffee and warm some leftover beignets that seemed to satisfy him and he headed off toward the bathroom she pulled out a teakettle and a french press to make coffee as the water heated she picked up the phone and punched in the number for acres she called the genetics lab figuring someone was still there the line picked up the voice spoke in an impatient rush dr trent here zoë its lorna in the background she heard the neurobiologists husband paul talking animatedly about rna transcription errors she also recognized dr metoyers muffled voice but couldnt make out his words none of them had left they were pulling an allnighter too i was just checking in lorna said then youd better stop checking chica and get that butt of yours over here youre missing all the fun and i can use a little estrogen here she smiled at her colleagues excitement had to pick up a few things from home i should be there in the next hour is the dna analysis finished zoës voice grew more serious not yet should be done by the time you get here but the mri data finished compiling the results showed some strange neurological anomalies what do you mean its too much to go over on the phone oh and just so youre prepared about an hour ago we performed a series of eegs on your animals electroencephalograms what why irritation dulled her initial excitement lorna felt protective of the recovered animals they had been traumatized enough any live testing should have waited until i was on the premises you all know that i know i know but the procedure was noninvasive well explain it all when you get here ill be right over she hung up the phone knowing her last words sounded as much a threat as a promise the teakettle whistled for her attention she packed the french press with a chicory blend from cafe du monde and allowed the simple routine to resettle her thoughts down the hall she heard the bathroom door pop open jack returned with his hair wet and his skin almost steaming he came in barefoot wearing only his work trousers and a towel over one shoulder i heard talking as i was drying off everything okay will be once i get over to acres somethings got them all worked up jack nodded to the table then this can wait i can take care of all of this after i drop you off sit she pointed a cup of hot coffee toward the table sugar cream black will do he sank reluctantly back into his seat lorna checked the scratches and bite wounds satisfied that hed scrubbed them clean thisll sting she painted the marks with betadine noting his skin flinch with each touch but the deeper underlying muscle never moved and his breathing never changed its steady rhythm she felt an impulse to press her ear to his chest to listen to his heart to monitor that rhythm too but she restrained herself the only other reaction from his body was a flush along his neckline and a hardening of his abdominals as if he were preparing to take a blow to the stomach she suspected it wasnt all from the pain confirming this he shifted selfconsciously as she worked in silence she noted several old ropy scars across his left shoulder neck and down his back without meaning to she allowed one finger to lightly trace one of the scars shrapnel from an ied he explained matteroffactly a roadside bomb sorry i didnt mean her hand dropped away and her face heated with embarrassment she finished her ministrations and replaced the bandage on his arm when she glanced up she found him staring her full in the face his eyes were like a wolf raw and unreadable he leaned closer for a moment she thought he was going to kiss her but instead he reached to the cup of coffee on the table thanks he stood up you said something about a new shirt thats right she stammered out feeling stupid for forgetting and for stammering ill get one from my brothers room she was happy to flee the room she wiped her damp hands on her jeans she blamed the fine sheen of perspiration over her body on the nights humidity or maybe it was just the exhaustion weakening her guard or maybe it was the boy shed noted in the slumbering man an echo of tom of long nights in each others arms she might have forgotten but her body had not she dragged a clean tshirt from her brothers dresser and hurried back to the hallway where jack waited he tugged into the shirt she was wrong about jack being the same size as her brother the shirt was a tight fit and clung to his shoulders and chest ready he asked as he shoved into his socks and boots she nodded and pulled open the front door glad for the cool night breeze on her heated face out of the shadows in the front yard a hard shout called to her where the hell do you think youre all going chapter at the shout jack pulled lorna behind him an instinctual reaction he crouched feeling exposed under the porch lamp blinded by its glare towering oaks and bushy magnolias shadowed the dark walkway movement drew his eye below a figure stalked up from the front gate lorna stepped back into view kyle what are you doing back i thought you were stuck on that oil rig for another four days lorna turned to jack and explained under her breath my brother i told you on the phone i was coming back early and i told you that wasnt necessary well i wasnt about to let you go hunting in the swamps by yourself and it looks like i got here just in time the figure climbed the steps and into the porch light jack sized him up lornas brother had the same sandy blond hair as his sister in his case cropped short on the sides and longer on the top from the looks of it he hadnt shaved in days and had worn the same cargo shorts and loose polo shirt for just as long he had a wiry physique like a coiled springthough at the moment wound a bit too tightly as the kid gripped the porch rail jack noted that his fingernail beds and the wrinkles of his knuckles were black with groundin oil the only thing darker was the kids demeanor as he eyed jack with a hard suspicion i told you not to come lorna said the hunts already over you came all the way back here for nothing then where are you two going kyle stood a step below blocking the way over to acres both of you lorna glanced to jack no he was just taking me over to fetch the bronco its over by the dock near the zoo jack cleared his throat or i could take you directly to your lab be faster and i wouldnt mind hearing firsthand what your colleagues have figured out about those animals might be important to the investigation lorna nodded id like i mean that would be fine kyle narrowed one eye and studied him youre jack menard arent you he nodded kyle turned back to his sister then im going with you dont be stupid get some sleep if hes goingkyle stabbed a finger at jackthen im going someone needs to chaperone this date its not a date lornas face flushed more angry than embarrassed i can damn well take care of myself what like the last time you took off with one of the menard brothers lornas eyes widened shocked by his words struck dumb jack had to restrain an urge to slam a fist in the kids face kyle seemed to recognize hed overstepped himself and backpedaled sorry that was a stupid thing to say he hurriedly climbed the last step and joined his sister as if shortening the distance could temper his words he touched her arm but she turned away he followed matching her step for step after what those menards put you through kyle said more softly as his anger bled away to raw concern i dont want you hurt again thats all i was saying id cut off my right arm to protect you you know that she sagged under his assault of course i know that kyle but in this case you dont know what youre talking about she glanced over at jack i trust him something in her face more than her words steeled through jack he found himself standing a bit straighter at the same time he remembered her fingers on his skin warm and soft kyle looked between the two of them then shook his head id still like to go with you i wont get any sleep till youre home anyway his tone was more conciliatory and plainly worked better on lorna and i promise i wont cause any trouble fine but were leaving right now thats okay by me he stepped aside and lorna led the way back to the street kyle kept pace next to jack though the kid had taken a more mollifying tone with his older sister jack read the continuing suspicion in his glance as they headed out kyle was clearly keeping his guard upand jack respected that lornas brother only wanted to protect her and didnt care whose feathers he ruffled they all piled into the service truck and headed out jack placed a quick call to his own brother about the change in plans randy still had burt and had been waiting at the station for them to head back home together then ill just meet you at that zoo place randy said and hung up before jack could argue lowering the phone jack glanced sidelong at his passenger lorna shared the front seat with him he could tell she was lost elsewhere her eyes had crinkled at the corners her mind already working on the mysteries surrounding this case the woman becoming the doctor again kyle leaned forward intruding between them so whats up with these damned animals anyway whats so special about them lorna muttered still lost to the moment thats what im trying to figure out chapter an hour later lorna sat before a thirtyinch widescreen lcd computer monitor in the genetics suite multiple windows were open on the screen but she studied the one in the center a threedimensional image of an avian brain rotated on the screen compiled from the magnetic resonance imaging scan done on the african grey parrot named igor a neighboring window showed a photo of the reptilianlooking featherless bird what are we looking at jack asked behind her zoë trent answered him standing on her other side something remarkable the neurobiologist shared the small conference room with them off the main lab her husband paul was still out there reviewing the dna analysis on the aberrant chromosome whats wrong with this bird kyle asked her brother sat on a stool beside the small birdcage that held igor the parrot sat sullenly hunched low to the perch the bird was nothing like the bright and attentive fellow he had been earlier also watery droppings covered the bottom of his cage diarrhea due to stress a knot of annoyance burned in lornas gut her colleagues should have waited until she returned to perform those extra tests the health and wellbeing of the facilitys animals were her responsibility and that duty extended to the animals rescued from the trawler the creatures had already been through enough they didnt deserve to be treated like guinea pigs here too how come this ugly guy doesnt have any feathers her brother asked lorna answered without taking her eyes off the screen first hes not ugly second we think its a genetic throwback a lost trait thats surfaced again weird she didnt argue with that it was weird everything about this was strange just keep him company hes spooked talk to him parrots were social creatures and found solace in companionship kyle shrugged and leaned closer to the cage her brother lowered his voice to a gentle coo so whos an ugly bird not you igor cocked an eye quizzically at kyle and responded with a soft clucking the avian equivalent of a chuckle like lorna her brother always had a way with animals and despite his quick temper he had a big heart which might explain his volatility he felt things deeply and she knew how much he loved her sought to protect her with their father passing away when they were children he had always taken on the role of the man of the houseand even more so after their mother had died she both loved him for this effort and bristled against it but in the machismo world of the south it was an alltoocommon family dynamic jack drew her attention back to the computer he leaned a hip on the desk so whats so remarkable about this mri scan he asked zoë why insist lorna see this first the neurobiologist pointed to the monitor itll help explain why we didnt wait before performing the electroencephalograms her voice took on an apologetic tone but it didnt appease lorna she studied the rotating image the brain looked like most birds and in fact it was not that much different from a mammalian brain on the screen the spinal cord bloomed into a medulla a cerebellum and a cerebrum that was divided into two hemispheres she noted something strange almost immediately five distinct darker objects appeared to be embedded between the hyperpallium and mesopallium layers of forebrain the avian equivalent to the human neocortex they were crisp and hardedged appearing almost crystalline in structure she rotated to get a top view of these odd densities the five formed a perfect pentagram within the neurological tissue what are they she asked instead of answering zoë reached and tapped a button on the keyboard the parrots brain vanished and was replaced by another this is the brain from one of the capuchin monkeys lorna pictured the conjoined twins as she leaned closer to the screen the same strange densities were lodged within the brain tissue of the monkey she revolved the image the same number and lodged in the equivalent morphological locations even the pattern was the same a perfectly symmetrical pentagram despite the warmth of the room a chill edged through her zoë shifted closer we found these same odd intrusions in all the animals recovered from the trawler i can show you the other scans lorna shook her head trusting her colleagues assessment are they implants we dont think so excitement welled in the neurobiologists voice we think they might be natural features natural thats right zoë shifted the computer mouse to zoom down on one of the densities look closer see how theres no scarring around the intrusions like youd expect from a surgical implant also theres no granulation tissue walled around it like youd see from an embedded foreign body then what are they zoë shrugged thats what dr metoyer wants to know jon greer over in pathology is attempting to dissect one from the dead cubs carcass so we can study it hes also taking multiple brain biopsies around the intrusion biopsies jack asked why zoë circled a finger around the abnormalities on the computer screen the neurological tissue appears to be denser within the zone of the intrusions dr metoyer wanted to confirm a supposition that this region is made up of more densely packed neurons lorna wanted to know too she remembered the glow from the jaguars eyes its cunningness even the parrots ability to recite the mathematical equivalent of pi more neurons translated to a richer synaptic environment which meant more computing power to be tapped this discovery could explain why the animals seemed especially hyperintelligent zoë straightened and ran a hand through her short black hair now you know why we wanted to perform those eegs we were so excited we couldnt wait lorna slowly nodded by studying the electrical patterns of the brain they were looking for any change in functionality associated with these intrusions what did you find with the eegs at first nothing each animals brainwave patterns seemed normal enough each as unique as a fingerprint there seemed to be no common ground rather than disappointment zoës face shone with amazement lorna knew there was another shoe still to drop zoë glanced over to igors cage lorna followed her gaze then back to the neurobiologist what ill show you zoë sidled next to her and tapped rapidly at the keyboard im going to display the set of four eegs we took from the parrot the two monkeys and bagheera the cub for simplicitys sake im only going to show a single lead from each animal the readings appeared on the screen zoë glanced over to lorna with one eyebrow cocked she read her colleagues question can you see anything weird here it took lorna only a second she pointed to the two center tracings these two runs are nearly identical she read the labels and scrunched her brow cebus apella specimens a and b those readings came from the conjoined twin monkeys zoë nodded thats right at first we thought it might be a mistake perhaps the electrode net placed on one monkey was picking up the electrical pattern from its twin or maybe because they were genetic twins their brain activity also matched just to be sure we brought all the animals up here and retested them she tapped at the keyboard and another four leads were displayed this is what we got when all four specimens were in the room at the same time lorna leaned closer running each lead with the tip of a finger amazement grew impossible jack spoke next to her they all look roughly the same we ran the leads for a full ten minutes each they continued to stay synchronized lorna struggled to comprehend what she was seeing afterward zoë said we took the other animals back to their ward except for the parrot here we tested igor again with the others gone his eeg returned to its original unique pattern lorna stared over to the parrot and her brother are you saying that when theyre all together their brainwave patterns somehow slip into perfect synchronization thats what seems to be happening how could that be she had heard of women in dorms who would begin to menstruate in unison when housed togetherbut that was due to pheromones in the air triggering a synchronized cycling what could be causing the neurological equivalent in these animals if this data were correct there had to be some sort of stimulus or communication among the animals lorna pulled up the mri data on the monitor again the threedimensional model of igors brain appeared she rotated it to look down upon the five strange densities whatevers going on has to be tied to these intrusions lorna said all the specimens share this common structure she stared at the screen picturing the net of denser tissue that spanned the pentagram it reminded her of something but what she cupped out her hand splaying her five fingers wide then it dawned on her she rotated her hand back and forth a satellite dish she mumbled what zoë asked the structure in the animals brain what if its acting like a small transmitting dish emitting an ultralow frequency signal that the others pick up and somehow triggers this synchronization zoë frowned caught between disbelief and possibility are you talking about some form of telepathy kyle asked eyeballing the parrot with suspicion no lorna spoke faster at least not exactly for the eegs to match something has to be triggering it it cant be hormonal or pheromonal theyre different species plus the reaction time is too fast zoë added her disbelief fading lorna nodded but a weak electrical signal could trigger it just enough to flip a switch in the brains of all four animals but what could be powering it all jack asked i dont see any battery zoë answered him no battery is needed the brains an electrical organ producing energy known as action potentials by pumping chemicals into and out of neurons the average brain produces a continuous ten to twelve watts of electricity morning noon and night enough to power a flashlight and certainly enough to transmit a lowgrade signal lorna stared at the mri model and swallowed a new voice spoke by the doorway which of course begs another question my dear lorna turned to find her boss carlton metoyer leaning in the doorway how long had he been listening in on their conversation what question is that zoë asked he stepped into the room wearing a crisply pressed lab jacket ever the southern gentleman even when up all night dr polk has just offered us an intriguing solution as to how these brains are linking up which raises an even more dynamic question lorna understood and asked that question aloud why why were these animals linking up chapter duncan sat alone in a truck parked outside the entry road to acres he had the window rolled down and listened to the nighttime chorus of frogs and crickets off to the left the mississippi river whispered muddily as it swept alongside the levee road a soft wind stirred the thick humid air making it almost breathable with his nightvision scope fixed to his face he studied the facility on the far side of the levee the place was dark except for a few lighted windows on the first floor his earpiece registered the call signs of his team as they reached their various positions around the building while waiting duncan kept watch on the one road into and out of the facility he didnt want any surprises his secondincommand finally reported the allready on your signal have you confirmed the number and identity of the civilians seven one is a border patrol agent and we should assume hes armed make him a highpriority target remember we need one of the scientists to interrogate offsite understood sir they needed to gauge how much the researchers had learned about the babylon projectand more important if any word had spread after that the subject would be eliminated and the body disposed of there were plenty of hungry sharks in the caribbean duncan studied the facility one last time his team had the place surrounded and locked down incendiary charges would cover their tracks afterward at first light an animal rights terrorist group would email and claim responsibility for the attack nothing would be traced back to ironcreek industries with everything ready he lifted the radio to give the order to move inwhen suddenly lights flared behind his truck the flash stung through his nightvision scopes he tore off the goggles and glanced to the rearview mirror a truck rumbled around a far bend in the river road its headlights swept around the corner and speared duncans parked truck he lowered his radio and waited suspicion rankled through him at this hour and in these remote parts he had not expected any traffic while he watched the vehicle approach he popped another life savers in his mouth pineapple he grimaced at the flavor not his favorite still he sucked on the candy as he waited he judged the threat level and recalibrated his plans once the truck was close enough he saw that it appeared to be a beatup chevy held together mostly with rust and old gray primer it sidled toward his position keep moving he willed it as if obeying him the chevy swung wide preparing to pass around but a flare of crimson bloomed from the rear as the truck began to brake the vehicle slowed and settled to a stop beside duncans truck with a wheezy sigh of its engine the driver leaned toward the open passenger window and pushed up the brim of a ball cap he wore a hunting vest over a stained tshirt need a hand buddy he called out his accent was thickly cajun just a swamp rat out late duncan shifted the pistol on his lap and inwardly grimaced the jackass just had to stop duncan tilted toward the window the driver flinched at the sight of his scarred face one not easy to forget there could be no witnesses he lifted his gun to the window but a blackandtan hound suddenly lunged up from the trucks rear bed it bayed loudly at him like an angry bullhorn startled duncan jerked back with a strangled gasp old terror crackled through his ribs he flashed back to another time a beast had caught him by surprise the driver turned and hollered at the dog burt shut your piehole i can hardly hear myself think duncans heart pounded in his throat oblivious of his reaction the driver swung back toward him mister you dont happen to know if theres some zoo place out here do ya my fool of a brother was heading over terror turned to fury angered at being caught off guard duncan yanked up his pistol and thrust it through the window as he pulled the trigger the dog launched out of the truck straight at him he flinched as the gun went off blood splattered against the other windshield the driver grabbed the side of his head yelling a loud fuck and dropped out of view duncan swung toward the attacking dog but the hound twisted in midair struck the side of his truck and fell between the two vehicles across the way the chevys engine suddenly revved and gears popped the truck bounced away careening wildly back and forth as the driver drove blindly from his hiding place duncan shoved the door open leaped out into a shooters stance and emptied his entire clip at the truck the chevy veered sharply to the left not slowing down it leaped off the levee road and went airborne over the steep edge he ran after it while ejecting the dead clip and slapping a fresh one into his pistol he watched the trucks front end hit the stony embankment below and flip upside down into the stormswollen mississippi river the current spun the vehicle as it quickly sank duncan kept watch gun pointed he waited a full two minutes no body came thrashing to the surface screw it with no time for a more thorough search he swung away even if the man survived duncans team would be long gone before the bastard could alert anyone redfaced with his heart still thudding he returned to his truck he watched for any sign of the dog but the hound must have hightailed it away at the truck he grabbed his radio off the front seat he was done here he lifted the radio to his lips all positions move in take this place down chapter igor tell me what pi is lorna said as she leaned by the birdcage taking kyles place what is pi the others gathered behind her the parrot stared at her with one eye then the other following her brothers gentle attention igor had straightened out of his sullen hunch but there remained also a dullness to his gaze unlike his earlier verve carlton stood at her elbow lorna what are you doing testing something she waved her boss back everybody clear away as they retreated she moved closer lowering her voice to a soft soothing whisper cmon igor igor the bird mimicked tentatively good igor whos a good bird igor he squawked more brightly and hopped from foot to foot on the perch good boy now tell me what pi is youve done it before pi on the computer nearby lorna had pulled up a full page of the mathematical constant the parrot bobbed his head three thats right good igor one four he was doing it again but then things began to fall apart eight seven round triangle igor cocked his head almost upside down eyes squinted to slits as if struggling to remember lorna carlton pressed he glanced at his wristwatch losing patience she turned instead of being disappointed by igors poor performance she grew more assured still she wanted to confirm her hypothesis zoë would you mind running down and fetching bagheera and paul can you bring up the capuchins the two neurobiologists nodded and rushed off lorna faced carlton earlierboth at the trawler and down in the wardigor was able to recite pi to hundreds of digits back then i didnt have time to doublecheck his recitation but the bird was correct to at least a dozen digits i remember that too jack said supporting her carlton shrugged i dont understand its simple mimicry is it not nothing more what are you trying to prove i think its more than mimicry you posited the question why these animals seem to be synchronizing their brain waves i think i might have the answer she noted jack staring at her she took strength in the intensity of his interest and attention but what if she was wrong a few moments later zoë and paul returned with charges in hand zoë carried bagheera like a baby in a blanket the cat stared out at them with bright blue eyes the two monkeys clutched to pauls lab coat with both hands and feet he gently cradled them under an arm while wearing a goofy smile like a proud papa lorna asked carlton once the animals were brought together how long did it take for this synchronization to occur id say a matter of seconds half minute at most satisfied lorna turned back to the birdcage lets try this again igor what is pi the birds posture had gone straight again fully attentive his eyes brighter staring hard at lorna what is pi she repeated igor flashed his pupils at lorna and began a recitation with that eerily human voice this time there was no hesitation three one four one five nine two six five kyle seated by the computer followed on the screen her brothers eyes got huge by golly hes right as igor continued to recite the numbers his eyes drifted closed not with squinted concentration but more like contentment three five eight nine seven nine three everyone remained silent lornas boss drifted closer to kyle and followed along on the screen igor performed for a full three minutes passing beyond the hundreds of numbers displayed on the screen lorna watched carltons face shift from skepticism to awe he finally took off his glasses and polished them with a handkerchief he shook his head i concede his memory is amazing im not sure it is memory lorna said as igor continued i think hes actively calculating it carlton looked ready again to scoffthen something seemed to dawn in his eyes youre thinking the synchronization that it goes beyond physicality and into functionality she smiled and nodded whats that mean kyle asked zoë moved closer she stared down at the cub in her arms then theyre not just linking up to synchronize her husband finished her thought theyre networking together at the functional level kyle shrugged heavily still not understanding jack also moved closer to lorna wanting to know more she explained a brain is really an organic computer and most of the time its vast network of neurons and synapses are inactive a large resource of untapped computing power i think the transmission dishthe one inside their headsis functioning as a network router linking the computing power in each animals brain each one has full access to tap into the dormant resources of the others organic computer basically these animals are forming a crude computer network linked wirelessly but how can that be jack asked before anyone could answer the buzz of a cell phone interrupted the discussion carlton gave an apologetic look and answered it he listened for a moment then said thank you jon well be right down lornas boss closed his phone and faced jack it seems our resident pathologist might have an answer to your question agent menard jack had experienced his share of dead bodies but there was something particularly macabre about the pathology suite at acres the windowless room was as large as a basketball court drains and floor traps crisscrossed an expanse of cement floor huge stainlesssteel tables lined the center of the room lit by surgical lamps overhead ran a pulleyandchain system for moving the carcasses of large animals into and out of the place the air reeked of formaldehyde and an underlying hint of decay on the whole the space had a feel of a giant slaughterhouse the promise of answers from the facilitys pathologist had drawn everyone down here off to one side the intact carcass of the female jaguar covered one table but they all gathered by another it held the dissected remains of the young cub the tiny body was splayed out like a frog its cavities had been hollowed out parts floating in labeled jars heart kidney spleen liver but the most gruesome sight was the cranial cavity sawed open and empty the brain rested on an instrument tray at the head of the table the organs gray surface glistened moistly under the halogen lamps jack noted lorna staring at the hollowedout carcass the violation and needless loss of life clearly troubled her but the pathologist drew her attention dr jon greer waved everyone closer with a thumb forceps i thought you should see this in person jack did not necessarily appreciate this consideration but he kept quiet using the forceps and the edge of a scalpel the pathologist peeled back the top layer of the brain and exposed a deeper layer of the cerebrum the tissue looked much like the rest of the organ except for what appeared to be four tiny black diamonds reflecting the light the indentation for a fifth marked the firm flesh i teased out one of the inclusion bodies and did a couple of quick tests let me show you he moved to a neighboring table on a plastic tray rested one of the black diamonds only this one had been sectioned into four pieces greer used tweezers to pick up a shard he moved it over to a pile of material that looked like coarse ground pepper iron filings the pathologist explained as the shard passed over the pile a few metallic granules leaped and clung to the sliver greer glanced to the others i believe what were dealing with whats lodged in these brainsare dense aggregates of magnetite crystals magnetite jack asked no one else looked particularly surprised lornas brother merely looked ill and like hed rather be anywhere but here like magnets sort of lorna said zoë explained all brain tissue including our own has magnetite crystals laced naturally throughout it crystal accumulations can be found in the cerebral cortex the cerebellum even the meningeal layers that cover the brain lorna nodded the magnetite levels in avian brains are even higher its believed that these magnetic crystals are one of the ways that birds orient themselves to the earths magnetic field during migrations its how they get to where theyre going each year without getting lost its also found in bees fish bacteria and other organisms that navigate by internal compass then why do we have it in our brains jack asked lorna shrugged no one knows but there are theories zoë interjected newest research suggests that biomagnetism may be the foundation for life on this planet that magnetism is the true bridge between energy and living matter for example piezoelectric matrices can be found in proteins enzymes even dna basically all the building blocks of life lorna lifted an arm and cut her off okay now youre losing even me regardless of all that greer interrupted weve never seen this level of magnetite in any animal nor such precise symmetry and pattern of deposition i took the liberty of examining the inclusion under a dissecting microscope the structure is composed of smaller and smaller crystals breaking down into tinier and tinier identical parts like fractals kyle said exactly greer said jack had to refrain from scratching his head what were fractals the pathologist continued but those magnetic inclusions or nodes are only half the story he led them back to the exposed brain he used the tip of his tweezers to draw lines from one magnetite inclusion to another each node is linked by a microscopic web of crystals from one to the other forming an interconnected array and wrapped throughout this webbing is a dense region of neurons as would be expected dr carlton metoyer said the others turned to the head of acres carlton explained its been proven that magnetic stimulation of the brain results in the growth of neurons and new synaptic connections if this magnetic array formed during embryonic development the lowgrade and constant magnetic stimulation would produce a richer region of neurons locally jack remembered the earlier discussion and this would make the animals smarter individually to some degree but it also adds validity to dr polks theory of some wireless interconnectivity more neurons more electrical stimulation locally if i had to hazard a guess id say the transmission triggering the synchronization is electromagnetic a weak em pulse shared among the animals lorna shook her head struggling through it all theres still so much more we need to know then ill let you all get back to your own research greer said but theres one last thing what carlton asked the pathologist shifted to the other side of the table another tray rested there a tiny object lay inside it was clearly manmade a plastic capsule the size of a pea through its clear surface tiny electronics were visible i thought youd like to see one of the microchips embedded in the animals lorna crinkled her brow microchips are you saying theyre tagged greer turned to her mri scans showed each animal had such chips implanted under the skin we had thought they were id chips used to mark each animal like they do for dogs and cats but i compared this one to the tags used here on our animals this baby is much more sophisticated its packed full of electronics can i see it jack asked the pathologist picked it up and passed it over jack studied it closer though he couldnt tell much without further study his internal radar buzzed a warning from the complexity and degree of miniaturization it looked military grade maybe a transponder or a gps tracker as he thought that the lights suddenly extinguished the windowless room fell into pitch darkness everyone held their breath waiting for the emergency generators to kick in finally carlton snapped peevishly i thought we had the power glitch fixed jack tensed his internal warning system went from a low buzz to a full klaxon of alarm he remembered his assessment a moment ago a tracker he pictured the explosion at the trawler someone had been attempting to cover their tracks but not all of those tracks had been obliterated some led here certainty grew inside him its not a power outage jack said coldly into the darkness were under attack chapter in the darkness lorna stumbled away from the necropsy table and hit a warm body arms caught her held her she knew it was jack by the musky mix of sweat and iodine light bloomed on the far side of the table as zoë freed her cell phone and used the light of the screen to push back the darkness the phone wasnt good for much else the storm had knocked out the areas cell towernot that they had good service here anyway they all gathered closer to the phones glow like moths to a flame carlton stood with his hands on his hips maintaining his usual aplomb agent menard what makes you think this is some form of attack versus a power glitch jack answered swiftly and forcefully until i know better dr metoyer im assuming the worst whoever firebombed that trawler could be coming after the remaining animals that chip removed from the cub looked like a tracking tag one that could lead them here thats a stretch agent menard carlton dismissed besides who would go through so much effort lorna felt the tension in jacks body which had gone rock hard he still hadnt let her go her brother eyed her with a dour expression under kyles judgmental gaze she finally slipped out of jacks arms on her own maybe we should listen to the agent zoë said as she retreated next to her husband take precautions what could it hurt all faces turned to jack this room has no windows he said which means its a blind spot to any surveillance of the facility just to be cautious everyone should stay here while i check out whats going on greer spoke up what about just leaving he pointed to the far side of the room theres a service ramp that leads out from here no theyd have the place surrounded by now the exit would be watched then what do we do zoë asked her fear growing as large as her eyes for now you all hole up down here is there some place to keep out of sight maybe barricade the walkin cooler the pathologist said but theres no way to lock it from the inside kyle spoke up let me look at it after spending four years in engineering school i should be able to finagle a way to secure it from the inside jack nodded good then everyone else grab weapons scalpels knives scissors syringes whatever you can find and retreat there im going to make for my truck i have a rifle and a shotgun in a lockbox out there greer had found a pair of emergency flashlights clicked one on and passed the other to jack in case you need it the group began to disperse under the pathologists direction gathering anything sharp lorna followed jack out of the circle of light and into the gloom as he headed toward the door a small batterypowered exit sign glowed weakly above the doorway ahead what about my tranquilizer gun she said the one i went hunting with i dropped it back at my office its closer than going outside she didnt want jack confronting some assault team while totally unarmed he nodded good idea ill go with you she knew jack would argue so she pressed it takes skill to safely load the syringe cartridges with m and it did just a few drops could kill a man in seconds still he seemed ready to balk ill go just as far as the office she promised its only one flight up then ill head straight back here she passed him and reached the door before he could stop her cmon lets go she pulled open the door but he blocked her from stepping out she was ready for him to push back to refuse to let her go instead he slipped out ahead of her keep behind me no talking she followed his broad back into the hallway as the door closed the hallway went pitchblack jack reached and fumbled for her hand his grip was huge rough with calluses but his hard hold helped settle her in the darkness he led her in the direction of the nearby stairwell why doesnt he use his flashlight they reached the dark stairs and began to ascend faint light filtered as they neared the first floor landing windows let in some meager glow from the stars after the pitch darkness below even this little bit of illumination was welcome he continued down the hall her office and lab were only a few doors down halfway there a muffled crash echoed sounding like it came from the front of the building her fingers tightened on jacks hand no one else was supposed to be here jack hurried toward her office door he pushed it open swung an arm out and scooped her into the room ahead of him she rushed inside as he softly closed the door framed against the frosted glass of the doors window she saw him lift a finger to his lips she hurried to her desk bumping her knee against it in the dark she had left the rifle case on top of her desk she fumbled for it undid the latches and quickly assembled the two halves marines might be able to break down their weapons in the dark but not her she struggled for a breath but finally the stock snapped into place behind her jack kept watch on the door she grabbed two syringe cartridges and plucked the vial of m from its velvetmolded compartment in the case it was stupidly dangerous to attempt this in the dark but she had no choice she might not be able to assemble a rifle blindfolded but she had years of experience with needles and drug bottles she quickly filled the two syringes and loaded them into the rifle as she turned jacks silhouette slipped back from the window through the frosted glass darker shadows swept past out in the hallway eerily silent she had not even heard a footfall one shadow stopped outside the door lorna froze holding her breath her heart pounded against her ribs then the shadow moved on she could guess where they were headed the kennel ward lay in that direction still they would be disappointed when they got there theyd find mostly empty cages while the lamb was still down there the other rescued animals were up another level on the second floor still caged in the genetics lab after lornas testing but how long would it take to find the others especially if the intruders were using electronic trackers would the devices even work inside after ten seconds jack crossed to her moving unerringly in the dark she tried to give him the rifle but he pushed it back into her chest his words were a breath against her ear stay here stay hidden he squeezed her fingers tighter to the rifle communicating silently she understood the game had changed what was a possibility before was now a terrifying reality they were under siege he refused to leave her unarmed while alone from the firm grip on her fingers this was one argument she wasnt going to win he didnt wait for any acknowledgment and moved back toward the office door he eased the door open and slipped out once in the hall he pulled the door silently closed lorna stared at his silhouette out there suddenly not wanting him to leave but jack had no choice his shadow retreated heading in the opposite direction from the intruders but how many more were out there jack hated leaving lorna alone but he dared not wait he hurried down the dark hall toward the nearest exit he should never have allowed her to come with him the others locked up in the cooler had the best chance of avoiding any encounter with the assault team and he didnt harbor any delusions that these were ordinary thieves these were professional killers likely with military backgrounds his mind ran over their potential objectives and he didnt like the conclusions he came to clearly this nighttime raid was a cleanup operation a continuation of what was started with the trawlers explosion the primary objective had to be the collection and elimination of the remaining animals but what then how extreme was the order how thorough a cleanup was necessary to cover their tracks he feared the truth as he reached the end of the hall a set of swinging double doors led out to the main lobby and the front entrance he knew better than to attempt to exit that way he remembered how swiftly and silently the team had moved down the dark hallway the intruders had to be employing some form of nightvision equipment and someone was surely guarding all the exits knowing that he wanted to get as close to the parking lot before abandoning the cover of the building any open window would do still he wanted to know what he faced he edged to the double doors a pair of narrow wirereinforced windows allowed him to spy into the shadowy lobby the main entrancea set of glass doorslay directly opposite his position he saw no movement no suspicious shift of shadows inside or outside but he wasnt fooled he began to turn away then stopped if it hadnt been so dark he might have missed it in the center of the lobby half hidden by a sofa a small blinking red light drew his eye the waxing and waning glow illuminated a fivegallon steel canister on the floor the hairs on the back of his neck shivered at the sight bomb jack pulled back and swallowed his fear at least he had his answer concerning the ultimate objective of this raid the assault team wouldnt be satisfied with just eliminating the animals this was a total clean sweep no one was meant to survive jack pictured the others hidden in the building both those below and lorna locked in her own office he had felt the tremble in her body as he whispered for her to stay she had put her trust in him a trust now proven to be sadly misplaced holing up here would only get them all killed blown up during the firestorm to come he had only one choice if it was a war they wanted turning back to the swinging door he shifted his weight to one leg and kicked out with the other the door swung open and he tossed the flashlight into the lobby while flicking it on with his thumb the blazing light tumbled in a wheeling arc into the pitchdark lobby jack trusted that whoever was watching this door was using nightvision scopes he didnt have a flashbomb to blind naked eyes but the sudden burning flare of the flashlight through the nightvision scopes would achieve the same end to momentarily blind any spying eyes while at the same time drawing attention to the lobby jack turned on a heel and headed to the side of the hallway to a window that led out toward the parklike grounds between the building and the parking lot if this was going to be a war he needed weapons he yanked the window open punched out the screen and climbed into the bushes just outside he ducked into cover the distraction would only buy him a minute at most it would have to be enough he shoved through the bushes and sprinted toward the dark parking lot off to the side in the direction of the front door he heard a muffled order crack out angry pissed jack kept low as he ran praying the others kept their heads down too especially lorna but he made a mistake underestimated his opponent a sharp detonation blasted behind him startled he tripped on the wet grass and fell headlong he caught himself and shoulderrolled to the side he stared back toward the building fire and smoke spat out the front of the facility broken glass rained down as far as jacks position he sat in the grass stunned theyd blown the bomb he had only hoped to distract the others while he fled the building blinded they must have feared an escape out the front door and overreacted triggering the bomb it was overkill like swatting a fly with a wrecking ball from this response jack knew two things about the leader of this assault team the bastard was ruthless and determined jack rolled back to his feet and set off for his truck if they were to survive he would have to be the same chapter duncan approached the fiery ruins of the facilitys main entrance he had a gas mask held in place as he pushed through the smoke the heat seared his face clearly defining where nervedead skin ended and healthy tissue started he evaluated the damage ahead the incendiary charge had sent a ball of fire and superheated air through the front of the building flames licked through the toxic smoke but the charges concussive force was only moderate glass had blown out and a part of the drop ceiling had caved in but structurally the building remained intact duncan had studied the schematics of the facility the place was built like a concrete bunker meant to withstand hurricanes and floods it had been a calculated risk one charge would not knock it down thats why duncan had ordered another ten charges set around the building his goal was not to blast the facility to the ground but to burn it down to the foundation already the fires from this single charge had spread into the second level he hadnt planned to prematurely set off the charge but the sudden flare of light in the lobby had blinded him even ripping off his nightvision goggles hadnt dimmed the flash it felt as if his retinas had been permanently burned angry and fearful that the scientists were making a break for the main exit he had reacted on impulse and blown the charge to plug the hole here no one could be allowed to escape reaching the doors he stared into the fireravaged lobby smoke swirling soot and collapsed debris made visibility difficult one of his men had already dismantled the buildings sprinkler and alarm systems he searched for bodies for whoever tried to make a break for the exit half the lobby was covered in the collapsed drop ceiling if there were bodies under there hed never know satisfied that no one could have survived the firestorm he retreated luckily this facility was remote and isolated he doubted anyone would have spotted the brief fireball rolling into the sky still the premature explosion upset his timetable shortened it with fires spreading his team would have to clear out of the building sooner than projected once clear of the smoke he crossed back to his secondincommand the man had a hand pressed to an ear clearly listening to a report from the team inside duncan waited for him to sign off then asked whats the word the team reached the kennel ward found one of the animals a sheep we decapitated it as ordered the team has the head and is moving out what about the others duncan knew from the transponders that there should be at least another four specimens his second shook his head no sign korey is splitting his team three men are heading down to the morgue to attend to the carcasses recovered from the swamp duncan pictured the two cats the other three are going to split up and canvass floor by floor room by room well find the others duncan slowly nodded the order from lost eden cay was to salvage what they couldspecifically the skulls of the specimensand burn the rest it seemed the problems on eden had been growing worse his superiors had little patience with the mishap here duncan needed to perform but it was more than that it was a matter of pride his blood and flesh had gone into the babylon project he would not see it fail the animals were the intellectual property of ironcreek industries what was in their skulls belonged to the company and in turn belonged to him he recognized that if his team couldnt find the missing animals the flames would still claim them nothing would remain still he wouldnt be satisfied until he had the heads of all the animals plus there remained one other objective what about the scientists duncan asked have they secured at least one for questioning again that irritating shake of a head no sir duncan sighed and kept watch on the building he hoped he hadnt inadvertently blown them all up but either way hed know soon enough keep that net tight around the building duncan said if koreys team doesnt flush them out of hiding the fires soon will chapter lorna crouched low in her office she clutched the rifle to her chest since the explosion it was getting more difficult to breathe smoke rolled under the door and continued to fill the small space terror kept her breathing sharp and shallow she fought back tears not all of them due to the sting in the air she pictured jack caught in the blast she had no way of knowing if he was alive or dead either way she was on her own she had only two choices left to her stay and suffocate or move and risk being caught it was really no choice but where to go she wasnt about to head out into the main hall any attempt to reach her brother and her colleagues in the pathology lab would mean crossing paths with the intruders the others should be safe down there for the moment if they kept quiet the walkin cooler was the size of a doublecar garage and steelreinforced it should withstand any smoke and fire for a while but that didnt apply to her she glanced over a shoulder a second door at the back of her office led to her adjoining lab where she spent most of her workday from there she could sneak her way lab by lab away from the flames but she knew she had to do one thing first igor and the others were still up in the genetics lab a floor above hers she could not let them burn there was a small service stair that led from this floor up to the next she could reach it if she crossed her lab still a part of her only wanted to hide to let someone rescue her she fought against it knowing it was born of shock that such panic hadnt served her in the past and it wouldnt now move she slowly rose from her crouch drawing some strength from the weapon in her hands she wasnt totally defenseless keeping a watch on the main office door she retreated to the other once she was moving the terror abated somewhat she placed a palm against the lab door to make sure it wasnt hot satisfied she eased it open and searched the lab tables benches and biogenic equipmentmicroscopes catheters micropipettes incubators cell fusion unitsfilled the space along with books and piled lab reports one entire wall was filled by a doubledoor refrigeration unit along with a bench holding a long bank of stainlesssteel dewars bottles containing cryotubes of frozen embryos sperm and eggs of endangered species it was her lifes work the facilitys frozen zoo despite her terror a part of her feared the loss of all her hard work it could be duplicated eventually but it would take many years and not all of it would be recovered she could only hope the fires didnt spread here and that the liquid nitrogen would keep the embryos frozen long enough for a fireresponse team to arrive unable to do anything else she crossed the dark space and headed toward the service stair that led to the second floor she strained to listen for any sign of the intruders the pounding rush of blood in her ears made it hard to hear she stepped carefully one hand holding her rifle the other reaching out as she moved through her lab luckily she knew the place well enough that she could have crossed it blindfolded she reached the door that led up to the next level again she tested it it was warmer than the one into her office but still not hot she was headed toward the fires but it should take her only a few moments to rush up grab the animals and head back down and away she edged the door open found the stairwell empty and hurried up the narrow flight to the second floor the genetics suite encompassed most of this level the door into the lab was only a step away holding her breath and steeling herself she rushed across and through the door once inside she leaned back against the closed door she did it across the dark and quiet lab a soft questioning chirp called to her igor the parrot knew she was here she pictured eyes staring toward her out of the darkness a slight chill danced over her skin she remembered the strange intelligence the bird had demonstrated earlier she stepped away from the wall and shook away the chill these were innocent creatures cruelly used and at heart they were still animalsonly more so she crept cautiously down the length of the suite being on the top floor the genetics lab was equipped with a few skylights which lessened the gloom a bit she found igor still in his cage in the conference room off the main lab the cub and twin capuchins had been temporarily housed in transport cages not much different from plastic airline carriers the cages were used to temporarily hold and move various subjects undergoing testing reaching them she realized a dilemma how was she going to carry them all in their carriers the cub and monkeys were no problem but shed need a third arm for igors cage slipping into the conference room she crouched by igors cage now be quiet she whispered lifting a finger to her lip shh he seemed to understand and matched her tone uttering under his breath igor help igor thats the plan little fella he must smell the smoke she unlatched the small door she couldnt haul the cage but she could carry the bird igor hopped up on the inside of the door cocking his head back and forth as she pulled the door open the parrot came with it as if he knew her intent he climbed to a wobbly perch atop the thin door she held out her arm without any prompting he hopped from the door to her arm and scrambled up it using his beak on her sleeve to tug up onto her shoulder he quickly sidled next to her head she felt the tremble in his body the explosion and smoke surely had him spooked he plainly trusted her to get him out of hereand she intended to do just that with igor balanced on one shoulder she slung her rifle over the other out in the lab she collected the two carriers bagheera had slunk to the back of her cage and silently hissed at her mouth open tongue curled baring immature fangs the two capuchins clung to the front of the cage each with one arm small masked faces pinched out at her her charges in hand she headed back across the lab to the service stair the carriers made her ungainly especially with the rifle but she had to manage at least as far as the main floor even if it meant setting them all loose out a window she would they stood a better chance out there than in here as proof the smoke in the stairwell was already thicker the air hotter it was like climbing down a chimney she hurried trying to move as quietly as possible the animals also remained silent as if sensing the danger the only sound was a deep rumble in igors chest almost like a moan she only heard it because he was squashed up against her ear she worried about toxins in the smoke birds were almost all lungs and air sacs and thus more susceptible to poisons she was happy to leave the stair and return to her lab the room was cooler likely due to the thawing frozen zoo she noted a disturbing condensation in the air she knew the cause the liquid nitrogen used to keep her samples frozen was constantly evaporating shedding gas normally this was ventilated out of the room but with the power off it was building up in here left unventilated nitrogen would eventually displace the oxygen and become deadly worried she crossed to the lone window in her lab she set the carriers down and cranked the window open a river breeze blew in igor shivered claws dug into her shoulder its okay she shushed as she finished were going she intended to head through dr changs biometrics lab which neighbored hers then to the veterinary suite at the back of the facility she wanted to get as far from the flames as possible then find a place to hole up and hide but that was not to be stop the sudden shout made her jump it came from behind her igor lost his grip and slid halfway down her shirtfront before catching hold with his beak she reacted instinctively and grabbed igor with both hands and tossed him out the window he fell like a frozen turkey without feathers he couldnt fly but it was only a short drop to the grass though she didnt see him land she heard a tiny squawk of protest she prayed it wasnt heard turnaround slowlya shadowy shape stepped from the doorway to her office too distracted by the worrisome condensation she hadnt noticed the open door drop the weapon or ill shoot it took her a moment to realize he meant the tranquilizing rifle she hurriedly shrugged it off her shoulder let it clatter to the floor and lifted her palms in the air she was trapped chapter jack crouched behind a broadleaf bush it had taken longer than hed hoped to reach the parking lot sticking to cover at all times hed had to circle through the fringe forest to get here without being spotted he dared not risk discovery until he was armed with more than his bare hands from his hiding spot he stared toward his truck it lay only thirty yards awayacross open ground there was no cover hed be totally exposing himself to make matters worse the parking lot was gravel without care his boots would crunch loud enough to be heard across the mississippi he had no choice rising up on his toes he shoved out between two bushes like a flushed rabbit and sprinted toward the truck he expected to hear the crack of rifle with every step but the night stayed quiet with attentions focused on the facility no one must be looking out here reaching the edge of the lot he skidded in the wet grass then carefully stepped flatfooted across the gravel as quietly as possible he crossed to the back of the agency truck and dropped out of sight he crouched one hand on the ground behind the truck bed and took a moment to collect himself the truck was a ford f raptor with a crew cab and custombuilt shell in back the weapons lockbox was in the rear compartment before he could move something wet and cold touched his exposed wrist he jerked back with a noisy crush of gravel a dark shape shimmied out from under the truck it was a doga blackandtan hound a tail whipped back and forth behind it it took him an extra moment before recognition struck himfollowed by shock burt he whispered how could that be he struggled to make sense of it hed left the dog with his brother back at the station house then he remembered the phone call randy had said he was going to head over here rather than wait at the station acres lay on the way back home so where was randy jack turned to the levee and searched along the private entry road that led from the river to the parking lot he saw no sign of his brothers truck and that beatup chevy was hard to miss as he looked hoping for some other possible explanation jack pictured randy stumbling upon the assault team blindly waltzing his ass into a firestorm jack sank to a knee his vision darkened at the edges as he recognized the truth burt wouldnt have left randy unless he had no choice the dog must have caught jacks scent and retreated to the truck he covered his eyes as if that would shut out the truth god no a part of him wanted to run out toward the road calling his brothers name but that would only get him killed too burt slunk next to him belly to the ground his tails tip tentatively wagging a submissive posture asking for forgiveness for reassurance jack reached a hand and rested it on burts flank good boy he mouthed quietly he had to get moving nowor he never would with his heart weighted like a stone he climbed to his feet and used a key to open the security shell in back there was no overhead lamp to alert anyone equipped with night vision he climbed into the back reached the weapons locker and fumbled in the dark with another key to unlatch and pull the lid open inside the lockbox held his service weapon a heckler koch p doubleaction pistol along with his remington shotgun he strapped on the pistol but ignored the shotgun instead he reached for the third weapon inside hed confiscated it from garland chase an aa combat autoassault shotgun set on auto shooting three hundred shells per minute it could shred his truck to shrapnel as his brother would describe it it was one meanass motherfucker jack remembered the explosion he grabbed the weapon the bastard running this assault might be ruthless but he never met a cajun with his blood up jack would teach the bastard what it meant to be hunted he hopped out of the truck careful of the gravel and patted his thigh a silent command for burt to follow out in the fields and bayous he and burt had always made a meanass teamand now they had the proper firepower to match cmon boy lets go hunting chapter with her hands in the air lorna faced the gunman as he came forward he wore a heavy set of goggles over his eyes obscuring most of his face the lack of human features made him all the more menacing even more than the assault rifle pointed at her chest he waved her to the side with the tip of his weapon get back from the window she obeyed and retreated to the side bumping against a bench he kept his weapon pointed at her and lowered himself to one knee beside the two plastic crates on the floor he quickly peered into each one then stood up he touched two fingers to his throat and spoke in a clipped military cadence alpha one ive secured one of the scientists a woman she has the animals two of them she tossed another out a window on the west side lorna silently cursed so hed witnessed that there was a pause then he spoke again the bird thats right ill check he flipped up his goggles and touched a switch on his helmet a lamp flared above his forehead the brightness blinded her with the rifle still pointed at her chest he ducked his head out the window and quickly scanned the lawn and bushes outside the window lorna held her breath he pulled his head back and stared back at her with his goggles off he looked no more human under the helmet lamp his face was all shadows and stubble but his eyes shone at her cold and merciless she kept perfectly still under that predatory gaze but he ignored her and continued his radio communication no sign of the parrot another pause as he listened to orders yes sir decapitate the specimens here collect the heads understood lorna went cold as he dropped his free hand to his belt and unsheathed a viciouslooking steel dagger he lowered to a knee but he kept those dead eyes on her he continued to speak into the radio ill wait for takeo before moving the woman the soldierand there was no doubt he was a mercenary commando of some sortducked and pointed his helmet lamp into one of the crates his dagger flashed menacingly in the sharp light as if sensing the threat a frightened chitter rose from the capuchins even past the thunder of her heart a maternal surge of fury flooded lorna she rode that wave and burst forward in her hands was a steel thermos when the soldier had searched out the window she had grabbed the bottle from the bench at her elbow and twisted the cap off onehanded behind her back she hurled the contents into the face of the soldier caught by surprise he widened his eyes the splash of liquid nitrogen struck him across the bridge of his nose she twisted to the side as his gun reflexively fired a flurry of rounds blasted past her glass shattered from shelves plaster exploded then gun and dagger toppled from his fingers both hands flew to his face his corneas had been flashfrozen on contact his eyeballs burst and wept down his face blind and in agony he fell to his back a scream strangled in his throat she watched him gasp out a mist of condensation he must have inhaled some of the liquid nitrogen as it splashed sucked it into his nose and mouth and down into his throat and lungs he writhed and clawed at his face and neck struggling against the pain fighting to breathe with frozen lungs lorna held back her own stunned horror before it paralyzed her shed never killed a person beforeand though the soldier still fought she knew he was a dead man a living corpse she stumbled on numbed legs past his agonized form and reached the two crates she knew she didnt have much time others were on their way she lifted one crate to the window opened the gate and upended the carrier the two capuchins clung inside scared and confused she shook the cage trying to dislodge them one lost its grip and pulled its conjoined twin with it the stunned pair tumbled into the dark sorry little ones she hated to abandon them but their best chance of survival was away from here she returned to the second crate and hauled it to the open window spooked by the gunfire the frightened cub leaped out as soon as the gate was open she dropped the crate and retrieved her rifle she considered going for the assault rifle but the soldier writhed on top of it she couldnt get any closerboth guilt and terror kept her back but there was one thing she still wanted during his violent struggles the soldier had knocked the goggles off his helmet she picked them up off the floor and pulled them over her eyes the dark room suddenly snapped into a greenphosphorus clarity able to see in the dark she considered hopping out the same window fleeing after the animals but shed be exposed out in the open the intruders were well equipped and likely had the grounds under surveillance the small animals might escape that net she would not her best chance of survival still lay inside to keep hidden for as long as possible with the animals free her only responsibility was to herselfand the others still trapped below she fled her lab and headed toward the rear of the facility now able to see she moved swiftly with more confidence she needed to reach the veterinary clinic her domain if she could reach there she had a plan out front duncan listened to the garbled moans die over the radio he had no idea what had happened to his man the one who had found the woman and the animals but hed clearly been incapacitated in some manner another of koreys team came on the radio his voice was raspy with static but the anger came through clear fielding is down dead no sign of the woman crates are empty duncan touched his throat mike find her he closed his eyes for a moment and sucked on a limeflavored life savers if the crates were empty she must have tossed the others out with the bird the specimens were loose on the grounds opening his eyes he turned to his secondincommand connor reed he knew the man had been listening to the radio chatter connors face was a hard mask he ran a hand over the stubble of his red hair the younger man had been with duncans unit going back to boot camp hed been the one who led the charge and blew away the mutated chimp that had mauled him in baghdad whos on the west exit duncan asked gerard is at the tree line with a sniper scope go join him search for those specimens shoot anything that moves out there yes sir he said and ran off duncan knew connor would not fail him the man was as brutal and unrelenting as a machine once let loose he would lay down a swath of destruction two years ago connor had wiped out an entire somalian rebel villagemen women children even the stray dogsall to avenge a comrade whod lost a leg to a roadside bomb hed get the job done here with the same ruthless efficiency as connor disappeared around the corner duncans radio crackled to life again alpha one korey here reporting from the morgue go ahead duncan said have you secured the carcasses of the two cats yes sir their heads are on the way up but we believe weve also discovered where the other targetsthe scientistsare holed up found some sort of big meat locker down here its locked tight but i thought i heard movement inside duncan brightened at the news permission to blow the doors sir though i cant guarantee there wont be target casualties duncan understood the mans caution they needed at least one of them alive he weighed the risk of killing everyone inside and decided it was worth it he knew there was at least one person still running loose the woman that was good enough do it he ordered yes sir duncan returned his attention to the smoking ruin of the front of the facility fires burned deeper inside glowing through the pall no one was coming out this way and duncan had a man posted at the entry road it was time to end this he pulled out his sidearm the heft of the sig sauer pistol helped weight and center his determination he headed toward the least smoky window there was a woman loose in there scared on the run likely armed he smiledor at least half his face did he didnt want her killed at least not until he was done with her got answers from her and maybe a little more besides with his scarred face few women would give him a second glance except in horror and even fewer would ever satisfy him unless paid or at the point of a gun he headed for the building determined to find this woman the hunting would make the prize all that much sweeter afterward he would get all he could out of this woman then put a bullet in her skull chapter jack kept to the forest he wanted to move more quickly as he circled toward the rear of the complex he had traveled out and around intending to come at the place from the back he knew any eyes would be focused toward the facility not over their shoulders still he dared not make a sound he forced himself to move silently to place each foot with care burt shadowed him moving just as quietly recognizing that this was a hunt jacks heart thundered against such caution urging him to run headlong back toward the facility guns blazing moments ago he had heard gunfire muffled and indistinct coming from somewhere inside acres he recognized the rattle of an assault rifle he pictured lorna bleeding sprawled in death he fought against despair as he approached the southern side of the facility from fifty yards away he took a position under the low limbs of an old black oak half shrouded by spanish moss and studied the building and grounds the pathology lab lay to the rear of the facility in the basement level the others had holed up there but are they all still there and what about lorna he pictured her reacting to the fire if she wasnt still in her office the flames and smoke would likely drive her toward the back of the place meaning everyone should be close by at least he prayed so he studied the building more closely a concrete ramp led down to a steel rollup door large enough to drive a pershing tank through the pathologist had mentioned the back entrance earlier jack didnt intend to use that big door instead he focused his attention to a smaller service entry beside it as he recalled from the pathology floors layout the door led into a side office that would be his point of entry sliding back behind the oaks trunk jack knelt beside burt he dared not make for that door not yet as sure as a catfish loved mud there had to be at least one man watching the rear of the building but where was he with the woods dark as pitch the bastard could be anywhere jack gave burt a scratch behind an ear while jack might not have nightvision gear he had another way to extend his senses one of the best hunting dogs in all the state of louisiana time to flush out that bird jack waved an arm and gave a soft command hup burt took off like a shot since a pup the hound had been taught to roust birds out of field and forest jack had trained him with clipped pigeons and with the help of randy and tom hed established a flushing pattern with burt a precise zigzagging run that would clear a field of birds as efficiently as a lawn mower the memory of training with his two brothers brought a pang of grief as sharp as a knife to the belly he bit against that pain and followed down the center of burts switchbacking pattern the hound ran the woods back and forth pivoting exactly at the range of a decent rifle shot the river breeze blew in his face perfect for hunting jack followed moving from tree to tree listening to the dark wood he tuned out the whispering rush of his dog running back and forth burt was twenty yards aheadthen he heard it a snap of a branch to the right a heavy footfall someone turning jack set his back against a tree and pinpointed the location in his minds eye he let out the soft whistlechirp of a carolina wren one of the regions most common and vocal birds burt knew the signal and went silent jack pictured the hound dropping flat to the ground as trained he waited for a full minute long enough for the guard to turn his attention back to the facility satisfied hed held back long enough jack slipped around the tree and with even more caution than before he crept toward the location burt had exposed the edge of the woods appeared ahead starlight bathed the open grounds beyond brighter than the dark bower of the woods silhouetted against that backdrop stood a darker shadow a guard had taken a position at the edge of the forest a sniper rifle at his shoulder the weapon looked like an m a semiautomatic rifle if anyone had come out that rear door or dared approach it this lone gunman wouldve dropped them in a heartbeat pistol in hand jack moved like a ghost through the woods glad to have the wind in his face the river breeze would help mask any scent and muffle any telltale noises still when jack was two yards away something must have prickled the hairs on the others neck the guard turned jack moved fast he dared not shoot the crack of his pistol through the open air would be like a cannon blast out here he lunged before the other could react jack twisted the weapon out of his startled grasp while sweeping the mans leg and dropping him to the ground jack followed him down landing both knees square on his rib cage squashing air out preventing a scream jack jammed the pistol under his chin and fired like with a pillow the skull and helmet muffled the blast to a harsh pop still too loud fearing any response he leaped up whistled for burt and sprinted toward the building he ran across the open ground and hit the ramp at full clip he flew down it half tumbling he came close to running headlong into the steel rollup door but caught himself at the last moment he twisted to the side entry he tested the knob locked he had expected no differentonly hoped for at least a small break it wasnt to be he holstered his pistol and shrugged off the other weapon from his shoulder the aa assault shotgun was not a subtle weapon then again maybe it was high time for subtlety to end he backed three steps and pointed the barrel at the doors dead bolt before he could pull the trigger a spat of distant gunfire erupted off to the west from the clear ring of the blasts the shots had come from outside jack glanced that way what was going on what were they shooting at he turned farther and realized someone was missing burt jack went cold the hound seldom broke his field training not unless something really irresistible struck his nose a dead fish a rotting squirrel to make matters worse burt loved to roll in those rich stinks as he listened the spat of gunfire died off the night went quiet again jack turned back to the door unlike burt he didnt have the luxury of curiosity or subtlety he lifted the shotgun and fired lorna heard something loud blast beneath her she couldnt tell if it came from inside or outside shed been hearing periodic gunfire as she fled across the neighboring labs toward the veterinary clinic listening to the blasts she was glad she had opted to stay inside versus taking her chances outside she never would have survived a part of her heart went out to the animals she had let loose were they the targets of all this gunplay knowing shed done all she could she continued until she reached the veterinary wing the clinic was currently under renovation with the surgical suite undergoing a muchneeded update because of the construction there were no animals housed here lucky for that with rifle in hand she pushed carefully into the main treatment room of the clinic she stayed low her senses stretching outward for any hidden dangers in the dark the smell of fresh paint and wood dust struck her through her nightvision goggles she made out the central exam station with an attached wet table and overhanging surgical lights to the left a bank of empty stainlesssteel cages covered one wall while the other side opened into a scrub area and the halfrenovated operating room all seemed quiet she crept only a couple of steps into the room and turned to a smaller door on her immediate left marked with posted hazard symbols she tugged it open inside stood a bank of green oxygen tanks five in total the set of tanks supplied the clinic and other labs with its piped oxygen she knew by memory which tank fed the surgical suite and unhooked its regulator from the wallthen twisted the valve to on a fierce hissing flowed from the open tank she left the others untouched trembling with fear she closed the door and retreated toward the operating room on the other side of the roombut not before first stopping to raid the veterinary lab in the corner she only had one last preparation to make but did she have enough time with the shotgun blast still ringing in his ears jack kicked open the outer door the small office beyond barely had enough room for a work desk and filing cabinet he moved quickly to his right a closed door led to the pathology lab directly ahead stretched an office window that looked out onto the open floor jack noted a few wobbling glows out there flashlights they speared toward the office drawn by the shotgun blast never stopping jack grabbed the desk chair with one hand and flung it through the window glass shattered at the same time he dove to the door shouldered it open and rolled out into the cavernous room beyond he spotted two men standing ten yards away they were in full camo with flashlights in one hand pistols in the other drawn by the exploding office window they were a fraction too slow in turning toward jack sweeping around with his shotgun jack pulled the trigger and held it a barrage of shells sprayed out like a machine gun the rounds blasted the two men across their midsections ripping them nearly in half flashlights went flying not knowing how many more men were down here jack leaped for the cover of a steel equipment locker he stared across the room toward the hall that led toward the walkin cooler a glow came from that hallway as he watched the light clicked off damn it at least one more man was still down here before he could even calculate a strategy two shots fired the pair of discarded flashlights went dark the last man was a crack shot taking out the last lights not good jack was now blind he pulled back undercover as he did so he heard boots pounding across the cement floor the ring of a heel hitting one of the steel drains he blindly pointed his weapon and strafed in the general direction the muzzle flash would give away his position but he had no choice he kept firing until the drum magazine emptied a sharp cry of surprise cut through the barrage jacks ears strained as the echoes died away was the man down even as he thought it the steps resumed out of the dark more stumbling erraticbut they were heading away jack dropped the shotgun and grabbed his pistol across the room a door opened and slammed closed the man had fled out of here suspicion rang through jack these were trained killers not cowards what would make the man flee like that he stepped out of hiding and kept his pistol pointed toward the doorwhen the world exploded chapter duncan listened to the muffled blast fade away it came from a floor below he had tried to raise koreys team down there but hed gotten no answer worrisome but not his primary concern the place was surrounded no one was getting in or out duncan stood over fieldings dead body his face was a bloody ruin his eyes gone his lips blackened as if flashfrozen duncan had already noted the liquid nitrogen tanks in the room and could surmise what had taken place fielding must have underestimated the woman and let his guard down stupid duncan felt no sympathy for the mans agonizing death another of duncans unit an asianamerican named takeo came up behind him second floor is swept no sign of the woman duncan didnt acknowledge him he wasnt surprised another teammate spoke by the lab door do you want me to go check on the others down in the morgue that could wait youre both with me he ordered with the place surrounded nothing else mattered hed be out of here in two minutes with at least one prize in hand then hed burn this fucking place to the ground and be done with it where to sir takeo asked duncan didnt answer he had noted a stack of cards by the labs computer dr lorna polk from his intel on this place he knew she was the staff veterinarian she ran this cryogenic lab and the veterinary facility from the schematics the veterinary wing lay toward the rear of this level farthest away from the fires panicked she wouldve fled to a place of security a place she knew duncan stepped over fieldings corpse and headed in that direction he moved cautiously the body was a good lesson he would not underestimate dr polk follow me jack picked himself up the blast had knocked him off his feet across the dark lab a fire glowed it raged down the hall that led to the walkin cooler smoke poured into the main room he gave the open pathology lab a quick scan and saw no sign of the assault team but the man who had fled would alert others jack didnt have much time he ran toward the fires as he rounded into the hall smoke choked the passageway ahead flames danced up the walls to either side at the far end the steel door to the meat locker had been blown off he heard a woman crying through the smoke the assault team must have learned the scientists were holed up in here and had tried to blow their way inside but someone had been heavyhanded with the c jack rushed forward heedless of the spreading flames as he sidestepped the blackened door an arm thrust through the smoke and stabbed at his face jack leaned back catching a flash of silver as a blade passed in front of his nose its me he hissed out agent menard through the pall of smoke lornas brother appeared holding a scalpel in one hand his other arm was cradled to his waist from the angle of his hand hed broken his wrist kyle pushed forward unapologetic about nearly blinding him he had only one thought wheres lorna jack shook his head and his heart sank he had hoped she wouldve made it down here somehow and joined the others i dont know he said what do you mean you dont know kyle looked like he was ready to lash out again with the scalpel i left her upstairs locked in her office jack moved past kyle drawn by a womans sobbing he had to get these people moving inside the cooler he found the neurobiologist zoë trent kneeling over her husband he lay on his side in a pool of spreading blood a thick steel pipe pierced his chest impaled through by the force of the blast the man wasnt moving wasnt breathing the pathologist greer knelt on the other side a finger to the mans throat he glanced to jack and shook his head a cold fury flashed through him kyle spoke at his shoulder guilt rang in his voice if i hadnt locked this place up so tightly if they didnt have to blow it then youd all be dead jack said and knew it to be true carlton metoyer stood over zoë his face sunken and much older he tried to get her moving hes gone my dear he said softly we must go noooo the woman moaned and clutched her husbands hand jack had no time for niceties he stepped forward and bodily picked her up she struggled against him he carried her away from her husband and down the fiery hall the womans thrashing died down to a limplimbed moaning she hung on to him as if drowningand maybe she was but jack was in no position to pull her back reaching the main floor he passed her to greer and carlton get her out of here out the back the way should still be clear for a few more minutes make for the woods and keep moving they didnt argue too shellshocked and scared kyle hung back as they headed away my sister jack pointed after the others go ill find her still he hesitated jack shoved him after the others trust me ill get her he promised or die trying lorna knelt at the entrance to the surgical suite wearing her nightvision goggles she had a clear view across the treatment room to the entryway she had been staring for so long her eyes felt dry and sandy but she dared not even blink and it proved fortunate without warningnot a footstep not a whisperthe door swung open two shapes burst inside staying low and splitting to either side weapons at their shoulders a third followed standing taller something about his posture set her heart to pounding harder lorna leaned out of direct sight and picked up the flint striker from the floor she normally used the tool to ignite the bunsen burner in her veterinary lab minutes ago she had picked it up from the lab benchalong with the portable propane tank that fueled the burner this far out they had no naturalgas lines with her other hand she lifted the loose air hose that rested in her lap normally the hose connected the anesthetic machine to the oxygen bib on the wall she had disconnected the anesthetic machine but left the hose running up to the wall where plumbed pipes ran from here to the oxygen tanks in the mechanical room afterward she had spent two minutes backfilling that line with propane gas lifting the hose now she unpinched its end and raised the striker with a fast squeeze the flint scraped spit out a spark and ignited the leaking gas flames spat out the hose end she pinched it closed again and watched a blue flame shoot down the propanefilled hose the glow rushed up to the wall bib and vanished away she pictured the fire continuing sweeping through the pipes a flaming arrow headed straight toward the hissing drew duncans attention as soon as he stepped across the threshold snake was his first thought jumping immediately to a bestial threat but it came from the left from behind a closed room plastered with a pair of hazardouswarning emblems blood rushed to his temples and pounded there across the room a tiny flicker of flame flared in his nightvision equipment it could mean only one thing ambush he didnt have time to warn the others who had flanked right and left he lunged away from the hissing door shouldering into takeo his other teammate stood directly in front of the door when it exploded a blue fireball shattered the door off its hinges it struck the unsuspecting man in the back splitting in half a secondary explosion followed duncan managed to roll takeos body between him and the blast shrapnel blew along with the tumbling clang of a green oxygen tank with the din still ringing duncan pushed takeo off him the asian man rolled to his knees dazed stunned he turned toward duncan as if looking for an explanation shrapnel peppered his face blood flowed he was missing one ear then the man slapped a hand to his neck his fingers removed a dart from under the angle of his chin a tranquilizer dart deafened by the blast duncan hadnt even heard the shot takeos head fell back he garbled something choking up a thick white froththen went rigid and fell back to the floor before duncan could move something struck him square in the throat like a punch to the larynx he scrabbled and knocked the dart off furious at being caught off guard despite his forewarning it seemed he had still underestimated dr polk but there was nothing he could do now except curse her fuck you bitch lorna watched the second man drop she could tell he fought against the tranquilizer but even a pinprick of m could be fatal and shed shot them both in the throat where blood vessels were rich and unloaded enough drugs to drop a rhino still she waited for thirty seconds until there was not even a twitch but she dared wait no longer across the room the flames spread making the nightvision goggles a hindrance she swept them off cautiously stepped out and headed toward the exit she didnt want to risk being trapped here by the fire she also wanted another weapon her rifle had held only the two cartridges she was out of ammunition she crossed to the first man and scooped his rifle from the floor it was heavy muscular and unfamiliar she studied the weapon as she sidled past the second manbut as she stepped away something snagged her ankle jerked her leg and flipped her face forward to the ground duncan rose as the doctors face struck the floor she cried out and tried to roll over dazed her chin split and bloody with a savage grin he climbed on top of her swung his sig sauer and cracked the pistols butt against the back of her skull under him her body went slack out cold only she wasnt playing possum like hed been doing a moment ago in the end who underestimated who dr polk duncan rubbed his throat it still stung from the impact of the dart hed likely be hoarse for days but nothing worse the dart had struck his throat mike blunting the needle enough that it only lodged shallowly into a thick callus of scar tissue not a hard target considering most of his neck was wrapped in leathery scars from that old attack he flipped her over she was still breathing good he also noted she was quite the looker and blond just the way he liked them satisfied with his trophy he leaned down and hauled the woman up and over a shoulder he clamped a hand on her buttocks to hold her and headed back through the facility intending to vacate the building the same way he came in riding on the adrenaline he quickly reached the main hall smoke choked the passageway out there he spotted a body in camo gear sitting and leaning up against one wall a hand lifted as he appeared beckoning a voice croaked out to him sir it was korey the assaultteam leader the man had been down in the morgue supposedly blowing his way into a meat locker to fetch one of the scientists fat lot of good that did he plainly screwed it up leaving duncan to take matters into his own hands korey groaned and dropped his arm too weak to hold it up the man sat on the floor in his own bloodand shit from the smell of itholding a fist to a belly wound it looked like hed taken a cannonball through his gut help someone must have gotten the drop on koreys team duncan glanced back down the smoky hall suddenly feeling eyes on him it was time to get out of here ignoring the wounded man he hurried to the open window he had what he came for fuck the rest reaching the window he hunkered down and climbed through the window with the woman once outside he touched his throat mike and called up his secondincommand connor prepare the team to move out sir you have your orders ill meet you out front he headed in that direction what about the escaped specimens connor asked weve still not found them these tracking transponders are shit in close quarters that was true the gps was only good for pinning down a location to a quarter square mile or so with so much forest and brush it was a needleinahaystack situation out there connor continued all weve spotted so far is some stray dog dog duncan then remembered the hound from the chevy the one whod startled him fire entered his voice did you kill the motherfucker no bastard ran off too bad then abandon the search he ordered with finality once clear blow this place to hell understood he hurried toward the truck parked out front whatever pride had fueled his need to apprehend all the animals had cooled he had a good enough trophy in his arms the remaining animals were weak and immature they wouldnt survive long on their own in the wild and besides he had what he needed for damage control the woman could tell them what was learned here and who else knew that should satisfy his superiors at lost eden cay then the woman would be his to dispose of as he pleased and he intended to be pleased chapter jack knelt in the smoky hall beside a man bleeding to death it was one of the enemy maybe the very one he had shot earlier the soldier hadnt gotten far from the gaping wound in his gut he didnt have long to live the soldier stared at jack with glazed pained eyes knowledge of his death shone there jack had seen it often enough in the battlefield he placed his trust in that shine knowing that in such moments absolution was often sought there was a woman here jack pleaded blond a doctor do you know where she is jack had already wasted too much time as he fled the lower level he was forced to balance between caution and panic he feared stumbling headlong into an ambushhe would be no good to lorna if he was dead but he also sensed that time was running out where could she be the man croaked a single word never taking his eyes off jack as if needing even this tiny bit of companionship at the end captured jack tensed biting back a curse where did they take her the soldier struggled to answer but his eyes rolled back jack gripped the mans free hand where he begged eyes fluttered back to stare at him the mans head fell to the left he stared toward an open window a slight breeze stirred the smoke there they took her out jack asked no answer jack reached to the soldiers chin and turned the mans face toward him open eyes stared blankly the man was gone he gave the soldiers hand a final squeeze and shoved to his feet following the only bread crumb left to him jack rushed to the window he stuck his head out and searched the grounds he saw no one he quickly clambered out the window and landed in the wet grass off to the east the sky was beginning to brighten he heard a truck engine roar to life from the front of the building pistol in hand he ran in that direction his chest tightened with a cold certainty the assault team was pulling out as dawn beckoned and they had lorna he reached the corner of the building and caught taillights through the smoke a truck bounced out of the yard and onto the road heading toward the river jack lifted the pistol but he held back from firing he could just as easily hit lorna frustrated he lowered his gun and sprinted toward the neighboring parking lot the rolling smoke from the fires which now licked up from the roof of acres helped hide his flight he pounded across the gravel and reached his truck he yanked the door leaped inside and keyed the ignition popping into gear he smashed the accelerator the engine roared and gravel spat out behind the spinning tires the ford leaped forward as jack fought the steering wheel he spun the truck fishtailing in the gravel and took off after the other he couldnt let them get away ahead taillights sped down the winding entry road jack flattened the gas pedal to the floor steering onehanded he lowered the side window and stuck out his pistol he fired at the other truck low toward the tires he didnt truly expect to hit them but he hoped to get their attention to startle them enough to either slow down or lose control he hit a pothole as he fired a third time throwing his aim high the rear window of the other truck splintered with cracks jack silently cursed he had to be more careful ahead brake lights flashed for a secondthen the truck sped faster from a moonroof in the other vehicle a figure climbed into view bearing aloft a rifle shots blasted back at him jack ducked low but didnt slow his windshield spattered with cracks a slug puffed into the passenger headrest the other trucks brake lights flared again the driver had to slow to make the turn onto the levee road that ran alongside the mississippi jack kept his boot pressed hard on the accelerator if he could ram them from behind send them sailing over the far side of the levee he had a chance of stopping them the distance closed between them the other truck began to swing for the turn cmon jack urged more speed out of the v engine focused on the other truck he almost missed seeing a man step from behind a tree alongside the roads shoulder he lifted a grenade launcher to his shoulder and pointed it at jacks truck jack should have known that the assault team wouldnt leave their rear flank unprotected they had posted some man at the entrance someone with serious firepower this all flashed through jacks head as he watched the rocket launcher fire exploding with a spat of flame and smoke a spatter of thunder woke lornaso loud it felt like nails hammered into her skull she cried out as much in pain as confusion she tasted blood her body was being thrown about as if she were on a boat in a storm it took her a long agonizing moment to realize she was in the backseat of an suv the thunder was gunfire coming from a shooter standing next to her halfway out an open moonroof she tried to lift her hands to her pounding head but found them tied behind her back she was thrown against the passenger window as the truck made a sharp turn onto the levee road memory flooded back to her the attack the bloodshed the ambush in the clinic she stared out the window toward acres another truck barreled up the entry road coming straight at them looking ready to tbone right into the side of this vehicle lorna recognized the other truck jack then flames flashed by the side of the road drawing her eye to a soldier standing there with a smoking weapon jacks truck exploded the front end jackknifed into the air riding a fireball it flipped onto its rear fender and toppled over onto its cab glass and fiery metal rained down the blast was so loud she didnt know she was screaming until it was over someone grabbed her shoulder and shoved her back into her seat a hand slapped her face momentarily blinding her shut the hell up through tears she glanced one last time out the window the suv was speeding down the levee road she could not see jacks truck any longer but a moment later a muffled detonation erupted farther away from the road a massive swirl of fire climbed into the dark sky acres she closed her eyes too numb to scream she pictured her brother and her colleagues she prayed theyd gotten outbut even that hope was dashed with the hoarse words from the driver connor order daughtery to do a final sweep of the area before he takes off kill anyone still alive chapter deaf jack lay on his back in prickly brush he had trouble focusing his eyes the world swam in and out of focus fires raged to one side smoke rolled over him smelling of oil he turned his head enough to see the fiery wreckage of his service truck on the road he remembered the soldier with the rocket launcher jack had reacted on pure instinct as the weapon fired no thought just action he had popped the door and thrown himself away from the truck the blast wave still caught him and flung him like a rag doll through the air into the weeds must have blacked out a bit he lay a moment longer unsure if he could move it hurt to breathe busted a rib at least then he heard the heavy tread of boots rushing his way jack pawed around him for his pistol but he had lost it he struggled up despite the complaint from his beaten body he would not die on his back a figure rose up before him the soldier had traded his rocket launcher for an assault rifle the weapon pointed at his face you are one tough bastard to kill he growled jack lifted his arms he knew there would be no mercy no use begging not that he would instead with his arms up he flipped the guy off with both hands this earned a respectful sneer still the man leveled the rifle jack kept his eyes open ready for what was to come a loud crack sounded jack frowned as the gunman fell face forward blood spewing out his nose and almost landed in jacks lap behind the soldier stood a wet dog of a figure randy his brother tossed aside the thick tree limb hed used to club the gunman he glanced around swiping a hand through his soakingwet hair then turned his attention back to jack so wheres burt a half hour later jack and his brother still combed the woods around the burning building they had to move with care the firebombing had turned the research facility into a blazing torch lit by flames shadows danced throughout the woods making the search all the more difficult and nerveracking randy had explained about the attack on the road being forced into the river but you couldnt drown a cajun that easily he swam downstream a fair spell and crept back when he heard all the gunfire traipsing the woods now jack couldnt ask for a better partner the two brothers hadnt hunted together for years but they fell into an easy and familiar stride with each other one taking the lead then the other silently signaling sticking to the darker shadows over the past years a wall had grown between them built by secrets and jacks selfimposed estrangement as they traipsed the woods jack recognized how much he missed the simple camaraderie of family how quickly that wall could drop if hed let it but for now he had a job still to do it wasnt just burt whom the two hunted they watched for any straggling members of the assault team jack had confiscated the rifle from the mercenary randy had clubbed unfortunately his brother had hit the man with all his strength and caved in the back of the guys skull killing him instantly i was pissed randy had explained he told jack about the roadside ambush the crash into the mississippi fuckers almost drowned my ass the death was unfortunate jack wouldve liked to interrogate the man to discover where the others had taken lorna with the soldier dead he had hoped to find another replacement out here but with the sun now rising their search came up emptyhanded they had circled the entire facility the attackers must have evacuated the area following the firebombing now what randy asked we find burt and get the hell out of here with the area secure jack cupped his mouth and whistled sharply randy did the same calling out burts name the fires roar fought to drown their efforts jack circled out again whistling and calling more boldly this time halfway back around a loud crunching and snapping erupted from the deeper forest jack tensed raising his rifle in that direction instead of the dog their calls drew four others out of the woods lornas brother and her colleagues came stumbling forward they looked haggard and ragged but happy to see them that is all except one kyle came at jack as if he was going to attack his eyes searched to either side then toward the smoldering fire his voice was a tearful croak lorna no jack assured him but he didnt blunt the truth she got out but the others took her took her he echoed before jack could explain a baying howl rose from deeper in the woods to the west randy brightened mon dieu thats burt his brother set off into the forest jack followed leading the others he wasnt about to leave the hound here with the sky brightening someone would quickly spot the column of smoke pouring into the sky an emergency response team would be closing down on the place with sirens blazing by that time he wanted everyone togetherand on the same page as they crossed through the forest kyle kept step with him cradling his broken wrist why did they take my sister to interrogate her jack said bluntly to cover their tracks theyll want to know how much was learned about those animals kyle grew pale then what jack glanced to him the question didnt need to be acknowledged they both knew what would happen afterward instead he answered the question buried behind the other theyll keep her alive at least for another day carlton joined him how do you know that agent menard because this was meant as a surgical strike to get in and out fast it didnt turn out that way with the deaths and all the mess here theyll retreat as far as possible before questioning her likely to their base of operations wherever that might be id guess somewhere beyond the us border carlton stated why do you say that jack asked he suspected the same but he wanted to hear the doctors estimation what was done to those animals the way they were treated no lab on us soil would be allowed to perform such abominations but to circumvent such rules and regulations american companies and corporations frequently set up clandestine labs just outside our borders in mexico the caribbean south america in fact there are thousands of such unsanctioned labs around the world jack digested this information hed come to the same conclusion mostly from the fact that the trawler had tried to enter the country through the bayou it definitely had the feel of an attempted border crossing so what do we do kyle asked jack faced the others needing their cooperation if were right lornas best chance for survival hinges on the kidnappers continuing belief that were all dead theyll feel more secure less panicked if they think theyre holding the only witness can you all do that he got nods all around even from zoë her eyes were puffy and red but also raw with fury her grief had turned to a hard anger over here randy called he had run ahead of the others following burts bawl jack hurried forward he found the family hound circling a tall cypress his tongue lolling his tail high and proud randy stood with his hands on his hips and stared up into the cypress what the hell did that old dog go and tree jack looked up into the branches something stirred there then called down threateningly and stridently igor jack took a step back in surprise movement drew his eye elsewhere in the tree a pair of small brown faces peered down at him through clusters of cypress needles a feline hiss rose from another branch jack gaped at the animals trying to fathom this discovery hed assumed they were all killed in the fire lorna zoë said her eyes widening she must have released them before getting captured carlton stared up both amazed and intrigued bonded they must have stuck together out here he took off his glasses and rubbed his nose i wonder if the terror of their flight bolstered that strange connection of theirs adrenaline flaming their neurons to a whole new level of synchronization as the others spread around the tree burt bumped into jacks leg wanting acknowledgment jack now understood what had drawn the hound off into the woods he remembered lorna had used burt to hunt for the cubs littermate back in the bayou and if jack knew one thing about hounds it was that they never lost their nose for a good scent jack patted the hound on the side good boy burt good boy kyle was not impressed what about lorna youve still not told us what your plan is to find her thats because i didnt have one kyles face sank but i do now jack assured him for the first time since the power was cut off at acres jack felt a surge of confidencenot enough to wash away his bonedeep fear for lorna but it was enough what do you mean kyle pressed how are we going to find her jack pointed up the tree with their help act three beasts of eden chapter for once in her life lorna had no fear of flying she stared at the sweep of sunlit blue water below the small plane the sea stretched to the horizon in all directions interrupted by a scatter of islands to the south she felt no anxiety as the plane sped due south no sweating palms no palpitating heart she only felt numb like a looped film reel she kept picturing jacks truck exploding followed a heartbeat later by acres disappearing into a hellish fireball all dead while she should fear for her own life at the moment she felt nothing hollowed out and empty even the pounding in her head seemed a distant thing a gooseeggsize knot had grown behind her left ear a vague ringing persisted on that side tinnitus she diagnosed secondary to the injury theyd offered her a minimal amount of medical care but mostly theyd been on the move her kidnappers had driven her to a clearing in the bayou as the sun rose a helicopter had flown her to a waiting ship anchored beyond the barrier islands in the gulf of mexico then shed been transferred onto a seaplane theyd been in the air for over three hours heading as near as she could tell into the western caribbean possibly toward cuba she turned from the window as the man who had captured her ducked out of the cockpit into the main cabin the plane sat six passengers and was luxuriously appointed in leather with mahogany accents whoever was financing this operation had deep financial pockets the man with the scarred face joined her and her two guards he had showered aboard the ship and his hair was fixed by gel into a greasy look she studied the scars over his face and neck as if reading a map hed been attacked by some animal maybe a lion from the severity of his old injuries he had never introduced himself but she had heard one of the men call him duncan he didnt acknowledge her as he sat down next to a muscular man with a leathery face and red hair scalped into a military cut hed been assigned to watch over her not that there was much for him to do her hands were cuffed but at least in her lap now she had not offered any resistance she was at their mercy and so far they hadnt treated her too roughly she figured shed learn more by being compliant than by screaming and thrashing still as duncan joined them that hollowness inside her began to fill with a burning vitriol it dripped like bile into her heart and spread the bastard sat down ignoring her he turned to the redheaded commando still no word from daughtery he should have reported in by now what do you want me to do when we get to the island roust up some eyes and ears in new orleans i want to know what happened back there after we left yes sir but you know daughtery always a bit of a loose cannon probably ended up in the french quarter got himself drunk on bourbon street and is sleeping it off with some whore if so ill cut off his left nut the next time i see him might not make a difference to rein him in youll have to cut em both off duncan acknowledged this by raising one eyebrow as if seriously considering this option he finally leaned back but looked little placated his hard eyes gazed somewhere beyond the cabin of the seaplane she kept a sidelong watch on him not trusting him he must have sensed her attention without moving a muscle his gaze hardened on her with a sigh he leaned forward she noted the slack on the left side of his face likely nerve damage he reached to a pocket and slipped out a roll of tropicalflavored life savers and offered her one she shook her head he shrugged popped one in his mouth and sighed you impress me dr polk she tried not to flinch at the use of her name she had no id on her he must have noted some reaction his lips thinned to a ghost of a satisfied smile he had purposely used her name to unsettle her it had worked he continued by my estimation you alone took out at least three of my men she heard no anger in his voice no threat of revenge impressive he said and smart i hope youll prove as smart once we reach the island my superiors and i will have some questions for you cooperation will be rewarded and if she didnt cooperate the threat was plain in his eyes instead of further unsettling her the intimidation only helped center her she spoke for the first time there was no use begging for her life she knew it was forfeit instead she wanted answers for the bloodshed and death whats behind all this she asked she tried to sound confident but she had to struggle not to let a quaver enter her voice the genetic changes in the animals all youve done to cover it up what are you all doing out here duncan took her questions in stride a part of her hoped hed refuse to answer but he showed no reluctance in responding which unnerved her more than his threat a moment ago if she had any question of surviving this ordeal it was dashed by his candor we call it the babylon project babylon he read the confusion in her face named for where it all began in a word were involved in biowarfare or more specifically i should say bioweapon systems as youll soon see what you stumbled upon is merely a scratch on the surface of larger ambitions when were done the way wars are fought will be forever changed for the first time true fear filtered through to her this was no mere smuggling operation tied to a clandestine research project it was much bigger before more could be explained the pilot came over the radio cutting them off well be landing in five minutes everyone buckle up lorna turned to the window again the seaplane dipped toward the set of islands she had noted before most appeared to be sandbars supporting a tree or two the grouping formed a gentle arc centered on a larger wooded island shaped like a dumbbell they looked to be two islands that had fused together long ago by a bridge of sand and mangrove forest the seaplane dove toward the western half of the island a deep cove scooped out an arc of white sand beyond the beach a whitewashed villa climbed in a series of stacked tiers up a steep forested hill a series of blue pools spilled from one level to the next as the seaplane banked and angled for a descent into the cove she got a birdseye view of the islands eastern half it appeared deserted and untamed thousands of such small islands and cays dotted the caribbean many were privately owned and shifted national allegiances as easily and as often as one changed hairstyles if someone wanted to set up a private research facilityone that was isolated and beyond the rules and regulations of modern societyhere was a perfect place to do it the seaplane swept cleanly into the cove and dipped to the water fountains sprayed from the twin floats as the craft landed and glided toward a stone pier ahead white sand sparkled against the blue water palms and mangroves shadowed the interior a flutter of native doves took wing from the dense forest disturbed by their approach it appeared to be paradisebut she knew it held a darker secret a black heart kept out of direct view lorna let out the breath shed been holding she turned from the window to find duncan studying her he lifted an arm toward the island his eyes danced with amusement the irony of his next words were not lost on her welcome to eden dr polk chapter jack had returned to his workplace towing the others with him he had everyone sequestered in the computer lab of the new orleans border patrol station house the red brick facility had a long history going back to the twenties when the agencys main goal was to capture deserting crewmen and prohibitionera smugglers bringing rum in from the caribbean but times had changed as part of homeland security now the station housed one of the most advanced surveillance and computer units in the country employed to protect the borders against terrorists and their weapons as jack paced the secure room he rubbed his temples trying to hold his head from splitting apart since hed arrived here his skin had begun to burn with a fever and an ache smoldered deep in his bones ready to catch fire he had dryswallowed three aspirins and waited for them to kick in he didnt have time to be sickand this tension wasnt helping how long do we need to stay here zoë asked jack lowered his hands from his head no more than a day by that time lornas fate would be sealed it would no longer be necessary to maintain the ruse that everyone had perished at acres the first emergency response helicopter had arrived on scene a quarter hour after jack had found burt in the woods he had been relieved to see the cpb emblem on the choppers side the stations helicopters were often firstresponders jack had waved the chopper down he knew the pilot well and quickly explained the necessity to keep their fate under wraps afterward jack coordinated with law enforcement to maintain that blanket morning news shows were already reporting on the tragedy and the lack of survivors shortly after that the local nbc affiliate received an email claiming the firebombing was the work of a new animalrights terrorist group it was surely bogus likely planted by whoever orchestrated the assault still it served jack equally well the terrorist angle had the news organizations chasing their own tails no one questioned the lack of witnesses or survivors afterward jack had moved everyone here including burt and the animals from the trawler randy slouched in an office chair his eyes closed with burt curled at his feet the other animals were recovering from mild tranquilizers dr greer had removed their tracking tags under local anesthesia the tags rested on a nearby table secured in a copper faraday cage to prevent them from being tracked all except one that was being analyzed by a computer forensics expert brought in from the local fbi office with magnifying glasses fixed to his face he had deactivated the tag he also confirmed jacks earlier suspicion this isnt commercial grade id say military or paramilitary either way someone with money as they waited for further details carlton joined jack cradling a mug of coffee in his hands if your man is right it confirms a suspicion whats that jack asked glad for the diversion all thats happened this is beyond a simple corporation sidestepping rules and regulations regarding animal research this has the fingerprints of something larger possibly with government backing as in our government carlton looked upon him as if he were a naive child underground projects are financed all the time by the us government including grants from darpa the defense departments researchanddevelopment agency but you should know that over the past few years rumors have persisted in the scientific community of projects so black that people disappear into them and are never seen again and you think we stumbled onto one of them carlton sighed i dont know but theres another worrisome trend in regard to private defense contractors i assume with your military background that youre familiar with blackwater jack nodded blackwater was a private corporate security force contracted by the us government to serve in iraq and afghanistan basically they were mercenaries jack had worked alongside several members of blackwater in iraq he had no beef with any of them though there was a certain level of resentment among us troops both armies fought in the same terrain but the blackwater mercenaries were both better equipped and better paid in fact most were former soldiers recruited after leaving the service even jack had been approached and considered it then the scandals broke out about blackwater testimonials of secret assassination programs weapons smuggling massacres of civilians even the deaths of federal witnesses in the end jack had opted to protect the homeland here why bring up blackwater he asked because the corporation earned over a billion dollars in government contracts since and theyre only one of six hundred such firms operating in the two theaters of war im well aware he growled urging the man to get to the point then what you might not know is that such contracting is no longer limited to just paramilitary firmsthe scientific community has also been coopted hundreds of research groups have hopped on the bandwagon large and small and from what ive heard the competition is not only fiercebut also cutthroat jack hadnt known about this detail he pictured the animals the assault force the brutality with such vast sums of money involved carlton continued the scandals of blackwater are spreading like a virus through these scientific communities accusations of corporate espionage vandalism outsourcing of research to thirdworld countries to avoid regulations the list goes on and on jack understood the doctors concern such a description certainly fit with all that had happened a door swung open behind him lornas brother had returned from the medical ward his arm was in a plaster cast from hand to elbow his gaze was glassy from painkillers randy stirred and opened one eye toward kyle great he mumbled under his breath so one of the polks has rejoined us guess that means someones gonna try to kill me again kyle scowled at randy whatre you talking about jack stepped between them his head pounded he didnt need any more aggravation especially from randy whatever wall had dropped between the two brothers out in the woods had risen back up in the light of day randy just keep your mouth shut for once his brother glowered and crossed his arms im just saying whenever menards and polks mix someone in our family gets killedor nearly killed in my case kyles face went a deep red so then what about my sister you and your brother are here swilling coffee and stuffing your faces with doughnuts while shes still in danger therere doughnuts randy asked sitting straighter kyle shook his head and turned his wrath on jack he lifted his arm im all fixed up so what are we going to do about lorna you said you had a way of finding her calm down i do or hope i do he glanced over to the computer forensics expert how kyle pressed his voice lost its angry edge and took on a more plaintive tone jack picked up the faraday cage holding the surgically removed tags with these when the power had been cut off at acres jack had been examining one of the tags as the lights blacked out he had pocketed it for safekeeping wanting to examine it in more detail later but when he abandoned lorna in her office he did more than just leave her with the tranquilizer rifle i planted one of these tags on lorna in her pocket the tension in kyles face softened with hope my god zoë mumbled you think we can use it to track her thats what im counting on the forensic expert must have heard their talk i think i can make it work he called over its definitely a form of gps technology if all the tags use this same technology i should be able to find her though it might take a while ill have to hunt satellite by satellite he swung around to face them it would be faster if i had some general idea where to begin looking jack contemplated all hed learned from carlton and his own suspicions mexico or somewhere off the coast he guessed maybe the caribbean they wouldnt be too far but definitely south of the us border carlton nodded his agreement kyle sagged again thats a lot of territory to cover i should know the oil company im contracted with has platforms up and down the gulf coast thats good to hear jack said because if im right we may need to use one of those rigs as a base of operations kyle glanced to him his eyes lost some of their glaze calculating and taking strength from the fact that he could be useful still his main concern remained and he mumbled it aloud is she still alive chapter lorna marched down the dock toward the villa behind her the man named connor gripped a pistol in his hand but he didnt even bother pointing it at her what was the use where could she go theyd even taken her cuffs off rubbing her wrists she followed behind duncan the scarred man led the way toward a covered breezeway at the end of the dock the air was fragrant with sea salt and the cinnamon scent of the mangrove forest she noted a few beach chairs out on the sand and a row of yellow sea kayaks it looked like any other island resort until you looked closer at the edge of the beach shadowed by the palms stood men in camouflage gear with shouldered rifles up higher an elaborate antennaanddish array covered the villas roof far more than necessary for phone and satellite television service there was also an eerie silence here no reggae music no laughter only the gentle wash of waves on the beach the atmosphere felt charged as if a storm were brewing maybe it was the tension in the face of the guard who met them at the breezeway she noted a flicker of fear in his eyes as he pulled duncan aside for a private conversation waiting lorna stood on the dock under the baking midday sun the ringing in her ear had disappeared but the motion of turning her neck to scout her surroundings triggered a stab of pain from the goose egg at the back of her skull still if she hadnt stopped she might have missed it a blue tarp lay spread at the far end of the beach it looked like it covered some beach craft except she saw duncan glance that way too only then did she notice the black stain running from the tarp to the water like a trail of oil but lorna knew it wasnt oil focused she noted a pale white shape sticking out from under the sheet a human hand duncan rejoined them he faced connor they had another infiltration last night it swam in killed polaski wounded garcia before it was shot how could it have caught them off guard what about the tracking tags i dont know im off to talk to malik about that he left word for me to join him in the lab connor pointed a thumb at lorna what about her duncan shrugged bring her along lock her up in one of the holding pens down there until im ready for her they set off again passing down the breezeway and across an expansive patio the lounge chairs and teak tables were empty except for a pair of darkskinned men wearing lab smocks one smoked a cigarette listlessly holding the filter toward his palm in a european fashion his companion sat with his head in his hands the villas main floor was all windows that faced the cove heavy hurricane shutters had been closed over them giving the place a barricaded feel passing through a pair of tall french doors the interior was gloomy but plainly luxurious ivory damask curtains furniture constructed from roughhewn mahogany and rosewood probably harvested locally and limestonetiled floors all the hues were muted with splashes of vibrancy from animalprint pillows and an occasional painting on the wall duncan led them through the front pavilion and down a long hallway when the doors and windows were open the hallway must serve as an extension of the breezeway carrying the tropical sea breezes deeper into the house to either side of the main hall opened various rooms including a kitchen where a trio of cooks prepared a meal the smell of baking bread and a simmering garlic stew stirred her stomach reminding her of how long it had been since shed had anything to eat but they didnt stop for a snack they headed straight back to where the hall ended at a library study it looked like something out of the british museum a tantalizing mix of leatherbound books and collected artifacts conch shells antique seafaring tools including a sextant and windlass from a sailing ship one wall displayed massive plates of fossilized seabeds snapshots of an ancient world populated by trilobites prehistoric fish and sea fans a bear of a man met duncan there rising from a seat by a cold fireplace he had been staring out a set of open windows the man wore hiking pants and boots along with a loose camo jacket he appeared to be in his early sixties but remained well muscled with saltandpepper hair and a face that sun and wind had polished to a tanned smoothness he had the stamp of exmilitary probably navy from the sailing cap resting on the arm of his chair but he carried himself with some sense of affluence too lorna guessed the man owned the villa in fact he seemed as much a part of this room as any of the artifacts he crossed and shook duncans hand swallowing the scarred mans palm and fingers in his paw sir duncan said biting back his surprise i hadnt expected you to be here i thought youd still be at the ironcreek presentation in dc not much reason after losing our cargo the older man glanced at lorna his only reaction was a deepening of a crease between his eyes then he ignored her she sensed he didnt give women much shrift she had met her share of such men i flew in this morning the big man explained just in time for the commotion here duncan sighed through his nose i was just heading down to talk to dr malik about the incident hes waiting for you the man lifted an arm to the wall of books and artifacts well talk afterward yes sir a section of the bookshelves slid open to reveal that the main hall continued past the libraryand into the side of the mountain lornas heart beat faster connor nudged her toward the opening she had no choice but to follow duncan into the buried section of the complex the door sealed behind her with a dread finality will i ever see the sun again connor spoke stepping closer to duncan in a conspiratorial way whats bryce bennett doing here duncans voice was a black glower malik must have been keeping our boss informed about the problems here i told him not to bother the boss but that just proves you cant trust a raghead not even one on our side duncan continued down a short passageway it dumped into a large circular work space broken into stations with additional rooms and passageways radiating deeper underground whitesmocked technicians worked at various stations some glanced at herthen quickly away again it seemed the villa was a front for this underground complex the perfect facade to hide what lay beneath it as she entered she looked around much of the main room was nearly a match to dr metoyers genetics lab only tenfold larger and better equipped it housed an extensive array of thermocyclers gel boxes hybridization ovens incubators even a licor dna analyzer there were also a bay of clean hoods and banks of shakers and centrifuges and at the back a full electron microscope suite and microarray facility there was nothing this lab didnt haveand couldnt do the scientist in her grew jealous while another part paled at how much all this must cost and what it implied someone had spent a fortune to hide this lab beyond us jurisdiction and control duncan led her across the room and down another hall take dr polk to one of the holding pens in back he ordered as he ducked through a side door i need to have a word with dr malik connor poked her in the back to keep her moving as she continued a hall window opened on her left and revealed a view into a surgical suite it was sparsely furnished with a stainlesssteel table and overhead halogens on a dual swing arm a middleaged man dressed in scrubs stood in the room from his swarthy complexion and thick black hair he looked arabic or maybe egyptian duncan stepped into the room through another door from the storm clouds building on the mans brow he was not happy lorna slowed mostly because of what lay on the table connor didnt press her he was staring too how did this specimen get all the way over to our side of the island duncan said jumping straight in with no pleasantries i thought you were constantly monitoring them we were the man said irritated matching the others heated tone it had to be dr malik lorna guessed he was the scientific head of this facility while duncan ran security the two had clearly locked horns in the past malik pointed to the table the other specimens must have cut the tag out of this one with something sharp maybe a stone ax let me show you the doctor stepped to the side allowing lorna to see fully for the first time what lay on the table she covered her mouth in shock blocked by malik all she had seen before were legs and a lower torso from the fur and small body she had assumed it was an orangutan or some other great ape but as malik moved out of the way she knew she was wrong the arms were less furred and the chest bore a clear set of bullet holes but it was the face and head that made her gasp out loud matted coarse hair framed a bare face with a protuberant jaw and maxilla but not as prominent as an ape it was flatter also the eyes were larger rounder the forehead taller and ridged lorna had seen pictures of early man of hominid species like australopithecus or homo habilis the resemblance was unmistakable what lay on the table was no ape she remembered the throwback traits seen in the animals from the trawler a turning back of the evolutionary clock her vision darkened with the implication of what lay on the table they werent just researching with animals she turned to connor and couldnt keep the disgust or horror from her voice youve been experimenting on humans chapter jack stood in the office of his sector chief bernard paxton it had been paxton who had handpicked jack a year ago to lead the special response teamthough at the moment he looked like he might be regretting that decision paxton stood on the opposite side of his desk he was in full dress uniform after speaking to the press all morning navy blue slacks with black piping and matching shirt hed oiled his dark hair and even donned his ceremonial ike jacket but he left it unbuttoned and loose as he leaned over the desk a detailed map of the gulf of mexico was spread on the table paxton tapped a finger on the map thats where you picked up dr polks signal from the tracker you planted on her jack nodded those are the coordinates lost eden cay somewhere in that cluster of islands paxton heard the hesitation in his voice but you cant be absolutely certain we only caught a few seconds of signalthen lost it jack bunched a fist as he stood stiffbacked the fbi consultant had finally picked up a signal off a military gps r satellite orbiting twelve thousand miles over the gulf the reading had seemed solid strong enough to pinpoint a location about a hundred miles off the coast of cuba then the reading had simply vanished you lost the signal and never picked it up again his boss asked her kidnappers might have taken her inside somewhere blocked from satellite pickup or according to the fbi guy the kidnappers might be employing some form of local electronic jamming equipment keeping the island locked down jack refrained from voicing one other possibility he pictured lornas body being dumped overboard into the ocean that would also block the signal paxton sighed expressively loud then thats unfortunate this set of islands flies the nicaraguan flag we cant go storming their beach based on a ghost of a contact that we cant replicate sir paxton held up a hand its beyond our jurisdiction i can open diplomatic channels begin a dialogue but itll take a day at least a day we dont have jack thought and swore silently he fought to keep in control he wanted to pound on the desk scream at his boss demand an immediate response but such an outburst would do more harm than good he didnt want to get kicked off this case let me work my magic his boss continued give me a few hours to make some calls in the meantime have that fbi agent keep tracking that signal if we can solidify that trace it would help my case in the meantime jack get some rest you look like shit jack felt like it too but didnt say so his head pounded his throat burned as a fever took hold he had no time to coddle a flu or cold aspirin and antihistamines would keep him propped up at least for another day after that it wouldnt matter grab a cot out back and take a nap paxton said thats an order yes sir he said and turned in frustration back toward the office door jack his boss called ill do everything i can he nodded knowing the man would he headed back down to the computer room to give the others the bad news reaching the basement facility he took a moment to compose himself then entered faces turned hopefully in his direction at the moment the only ones here were those who had survived the assault at acres kyle stood up from a stool when are they heading out to find lorna jack didnt answer randy read his brothers expression and understood motherfuckers were not going kyle glanced to randy then back to jack he visibly paled and sank back to his seat the kid checked his watch it had been five hours and twentytwo minutes since the rescue helicopter had found them in the woods they all knew time was running out for lornaif it hadnt already a fire grew inside jack stoked as much by fever as by frustration he read the despair in the others expressions and refused to give in to it to hell with it he closed the door behind him and pointed an arm at his brother randy get off your ass and call the thibodeaux brothers tell em were going hunting again randy stood up a question forming on his lips before it could be asked jack swung his arm to lornas brother kyle you said you could get us on one of those oil platforms if we wanted kyle nodded and stood back up not a problem when now jack swiftly ran logistics through his burning mind he knew a pilot and at least two of his special response teammates who could keep their mouths shut and would do what was asked of them that should be enough in fact the smaller the strike force the better they had to get in under their radar and secure lorna before anyone knew better carlton stood with zoë and greer the head of acres understood what was not being spoken aloud the animals are about to be transported to the new orleans zoos veterinary hospital well go with them and keep our heads down and well continue researching what we can over there zoë nodded paul her voice cracked around her husbands name he backed up our data to an offsite server well be able to pick up where we left off carlton placed a comforting hand on her shoulder well update you if we learn anything that will help jack gazed at the expectant faces staring back at him then lets get moving chapter standing in the holding pen lorna now knew what a pit bull on death row must feel like under the glare of stark bare bulbs she studied her confinement the rest of the subterranean laboratory had been as sleek and antiseptic as a modern hospital not here the cell floors had been cut out of native rock and trenched to help wash down urine and feces the walls were damp cement blocks sealed by a chainlink gate she stood in more of a dog run than a prison cell without even a stool to sit on lorna paced the tenfootbyfour enclosure another dozen identical runs ran the length of the lowroofed room all of them were empty but she could imagine the usual inhabitants she ran a hand along the wall felt the scratches in the cement she remembered the dead body on the surgical table from the high forehead and flat face it had to have once been human but like the animals from the trawler it had reverted to some earlier form a genetic throwback to a prehistoric form but to what end duncans description returned to her bioweapon systems she had no explanation of what that meant but now knew with cold certainty that this outfit had moved beyond animal research into human experimentation and isolated out here who would question it or even know about it it wouldnt even be that hard to find test subjects the caribbean area was rife with human trafficking in poor countries like haiti people were regularly sold into slavery sometimes by their own relatives authorities in the region knew about such trafficking but they would look the other way for the right price she heard a door open across the room voices reached her i put her over here bring her out she recognized duncan from his raspy harsh voice malik wants to attend her interrogation it seems her background as a veterinarian has intrigued dr raghead lorna absorbed his words her hands went instantly damp she moved away from the chained gate as the two men stepped into view her bodyguard unlocked the gate with a key duncan stood back with his arms crossed cmon the man named connor ordered he didnt even bother with his holstered sidearm lorna took a deep shuddering breath it took all her strength to obey she didnt want to be dragged kicking and screaming out of the cell for the moment she had no recourse but to cooperate duncan fixed her with that dead gaze of his his face a frozen mask of scar tissue and barely suppressed anger without a word he turned and led them out of the kennel and back down to the main lab only now the circular room was empty except for dr malik he stood at one of the genetic workstations and turned as they approached lorna hesitated at the threshold connor shoved her from behind she stumbled into the room close to falling on her face malik scowled is that bloody necessary he scolded his words had a british lilt to them but the accent was plainly middle eastern he waved to lorna join me over here dr polk duncan accompanied her to the workstation while connor hung back up close malik appeared older than she originally estimated though his dark skin was unlined and his thick hair salted with gray he had to be in his late fifties he still wore the same surgical scrubs from before but he had donned a starched white lab coat that reached to midthigh he motioned her to a chair i must apologize for dragging you into all of this she remained standing duncan grabbed her shoulder hard guided her to the chair and pushed her into it maliks frown deepened but he kept silent ask your questions duncan said lets get this over with malik sighed for the sake of the security of our intellectual property rights i must ask what you and your colleagues in new orleans learned from the specimens in your possession lorna could not look them in the eye her gaze dropped to the equipment around her she took in the labels purelink genomic digestion buffer novex zymogram gel kits a spotlight hybridizer behind malik stood a stack of two incubators and an inverted microscope station with two micromanipulator controls for viewing and working with embryo dishes she recognized the setup as an in vitro fertilization lab was this the origin of all the bloodshed and horror she lifted her face only to have the back of a hand strike her hard across the mouth blood flew from her lips the knot behind her ear rang with the impact echoing the pain of the blow tears welled in her eyesless from pain than fury thats enough malik said duncan ignored him and loomed over her answer his questions or there will be worse lorna saw the promise in his eyes malik began again but lorna cut him off wiping the blood from her split lip she had already decided not to withhold any information what was the use we found additional chromosomes in all the animals she started and we discovered the structural changes in the brain a network of magnetite crystals impressive malik said considering how little time you had with the specimens what else duncan asked the threat plain in his voice she didnt hold back and we learned that the animals were somehow able to link up neurologically and we came to believe this networking enhanced their intellectual capacity malik nodded confirming what was conjecture before thats as far as we got lorna said who else knows about what you learned duncan pressed lorna guessed this was coming it was the only reason shed been dragged here the only reason she was still alive to discover if the information had leaked out of acres her only hope of staying alive was to shadow the truth i cant say for sure she said but we regularly back data up to an offsite server its done automatically malik looked at duncan a half scowl twisted the commandos lips shouldnt matter at least not immediately with everyone dead it will buy us a window of time to clean this up well still need it purged as soon as possible malik said mr bennett will insist on it wheres the backup stored duncan asked her i dont know she answered truthfully acres contracted with an outfit in baton rouge duncan lifted his hand again ready to test her veracity needing to be convincing she cowered back and protected her face all i know is the name southern compusafe but they have servers throughout louisiana she didnt know if that last bit was true but if this bastard believed the data was bottled up at one site hed just order the facility blown up in that scenario she would not be needed to live she had to remain useful duncan lowered his hand momentarily believing her his gaze went long as he weighed his options she had to direct those options as best she could she continued talking rapidly allowing the terror buried deep inside her to shine out the only way to access the stored data is through a series of security clearances an employee id password followed by a series of challenge questions unique to each employee but i have no idea how to gain access remotely this last bit was true duncan seemed not to hear her his gaze remained fixed in that thousandmile stare malik spoke up how long would it take to get a secure satellite uplink to this compusafe one that cant be traced back to us duncan spoke in a monotone at least four hours he glared at lorna but it will only take a few calls to confirm if dr polk is telling us the truth lorna wanted to shrink from that gaze but she held firm then it seems well have her company for a bit longer malik said which is just as well id like to pick her brain concerning the trouble weve been experiencing in the field of late she doesnt need to know about that duncan said it never hurts to have a fresh perspective on a problem and what can it hurt malik lifted an eyebrow toward the commando that is unless youre worried about the security here if youre afraid she might escape duncans face darkened lorna found herself warming to the doctor until his next words besides dr polk and i will have plenty of time to talk as i prepare her something about that statement sent a chill through her even duncan looked momentarily disgusted prepare for what lorna asked malik crossed and patted her on the shoulder reassuringly a minor procedure while we have you here it seemed a shame to waste an opportunity to freshen our genetic stock supply what do you mean lornas stomach clenched around a knot of worry she flashed to the body on the surgical table malik patted her shoulder a final time and stepped from her side fear not were just going to harvest a few of your eggs chapter lorna held back tears as the technician stepped away carrying vials of her blood in colorcoded tubes nervous sweat dampened her body she rubbed a finger along the bandage taped to the tender crux of her elbow the medical ward looked like a gynecologists office from hell a battery of ultrasound and surgical equipment surrounded her the exam table she sat on reclined and had stirrupsbut there was no padding no attempt at comfort it was all cold stainless steel but most disturbing of all were the thick leather straps meant to secure a patient it confirmed her suspicions that most of the human subjects here were forced to cooperate likely obtained from modernday slavers a booming business in the caribbean a shudder passed through her as she wondered how many women had been strapped here forced to endure unimaginable violations finally her guard connor came forward lets go she didnt resist she allowed herself to be manhandled off the table and toward the exit it hurt to walk besides drawing blood the technician had collected a painful bonemarrow biopsy from her hip she felt the ache with each step but she knew the worst was yet to come the preoperative tests were to evaluate hormone levels along with a genetic assay pending those results the stirrups and straps awaited her connor kept hold of her elbow and marched her from the room and through a door into an adjoining office dr malik sat behind the desk writing in a chart behind him rose a bookshelf crammed with texts and journals from the ragged and dogeared look to the research library the volumes werent for show malik closed the chart as she was shoved into the room he had a small pair of reading glasses perched on his thin nose and stared over them at lorna please have a seat he said and waved to a chair his focus shifted to her bodyguard sergeant reed that will be all for now ill summon you when were done connor didnt move and seemed ready to set down roots commander kent said i should stay with the prisoner duncan had given those orders before leaving to investigate her claims about a backup of their research at compusafe malik let out a long sigh that wont be necessary but if it would make you happy you can stand guard at the door connor scowled looking ready to argue his fingers tightened on her elbow malik waved dismissively at the guard outside the door if you dont mind buried down here there are no windows our guest wont be going anywhere my office is as good as any jail cell connors scowl deepened but his fingers released their clamp lorna suspected his grip would leave bruises maybe even fingerprints he stepped back ill be right outside the door malik seemed to have already dismissed him his gaze focused on lorna dr polk please have a seat we have much to discuss some of which i suspect youll find illuminating lorna was happy to accept his offer after all that had happened and the ache in her hip she didnt trust her legs she sank into the seat and gazed around the rest of the office to the left the wall was covered with various lcd monitors centered on a larger fiftyinch plasma screen most were dark though four showed various views of the subterranean facility including the gynecology room he must have been watching it all disgusted she turned away diplomas and awards covered the other wall lorna studied them anything to help her understand the man behind the desk many of the mounted certificates were in foreign languages including several in arabic she recognized one in frenchuniversité pierre et marie curieand beneath it a credential from the centre national de la recherche scientifique this last was the largest research organization in france no matter his ethics dr malik was no crackpot we should have your tests completed within the hour the man said and leaned forward let me explain what will happen from here just so theres no anxiety lorna couldnt tell if the man was being purposely dense about her situation or particularly cruel he continued after the tests well design a genetically specific combination of lupron and menopur along with an experimental folliclestimulating hormone normally it takes days before the ovary will be fit for harvesting eggs but with the technique ive developed it will require only a couple of hours so we have time to talk lorna finally found her voice what are you planning on doing with my eggs trust me they will be put to good use well use them for a new embryo hybridization project were about to start what sort of embryos lorna pictured the body on the table thats not an easy question to answer and before we get to that i must first be honest with you ive reviewed your file my file with your background and experience in genetics and breeding i could find good use for you here at my lab it would be a waste to discard such a valuable researcher out of hand and if you remain cooperative theres no reason you couldnt remain on the island as a prisoner id prefer the word colleague malik said and its far better than the alternative perhaps if you better understood our methodologies and goals youd have fewer qualms she wasnt so sure about that but she saw no reason not to hear the man out the longer he was talking the longer she remained alive go on she said wanting to know anyway what exactly are you all doing here malik settled back as if satisfied with this concessionor maybe he merely liked to have someone to talk to what are we doing to even begin to answer that well have to go back to the very beginning are you familiar with the book of genesis lorna struggled past this odd non sequitur as in the bible a nod in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god lorna didnt know what to make of this statement a twinkle entered maliks eye excuse my bit of hubris i must be overly affected by our supreme benefactor bryce bennett hes a deeply religious man its one of the quotes he often spouts in regard to our work hereand one of the reasons he chose this island for his facility lost eden cay malik smiled inwardly and shook his head truly how could he not locate it here i dont understand what does all this have to do with your genetic experiments all in good time first let me start with my definition of the grand beginning the scientific basis of all creation bennett has his word of god i have something entirely rooted in the scientific method and what is that are you familiar with fractals again lorna was taken aback by the non sequitur what is this guy talking about still at the same time she recalled hearing that word before her brother had used it in reference to the pattern of magnetite crystals found in the dissected feline brain she knew something about fractals but nothing beyond the basicsand definitely not how fractals were involved here she merely shook her head wanting to hear what the researcher had to say ah well by definition fractals are jagged irregular geometric forms generated by a repeated pattern of that same shape or in other words theyre large shapes that can be broken down into smaller and smaller versions of itself lorna frowned she remembered jon greers description of the magnetite nodes in the animals brains how the matrix was made up of smaller and smaller crystals i see youre confused let me show you what i mean malik said and tapped at his computer keyboard to lornas right one of the monitors bloomed to life all geometric shapes can be defined by a single algorithm or mathematical equation heres a rather simple one it was just an ordinary triangle malik tapped again but if you have the computer multiply it several times adding one to another it grows to this on the screen several of the trianglespositioned at various angles and on different planesnow formed a complex polygon she shrugged unimpressed i know malik conceded not much to look at but lets have the computer take that same triangle and repeat it a hundred thousand times shrinking some enlarging others changing inclination but basically just repeating the same triangle over and over again here is what you get lornas eyes widened its forming a mountain range exactly a landscape composed of millions of repetitions of the same shape in this case triangles this is how computers today generate such detailed backgrounds in movies and video games just countless repetitions of the same basic algorithm or fractal to produce a more complex one but what does all this have to do with malik cut her off because this phenomenon isnt just found in mountains and coastlines its found throughout the natural world take a tree for example if you look at the branching of any tree its just a repetition of the same basic pattern unique to that species of tree on the screen she watched a simple shape appear a single line with two branching offshoots forming a y then more and more y shapes branched out from the first and multiplied into a fully dimensional tree this same fractal basis of the natural world is found everywhere from the structure of galaxies down to the tiniest snowflake from the flow of ocean currents up to the shape of clouds in the sky its all around us and in us in us fractals make up our bodies they can be found in the growth of blood vessels the pattern of alveoli in our lungs the shape of our kidneys even the branching of the dendrites in our brain but its so much more than that when you look deeper theyre even in the way our bodies function its been shown that fractals define how we walk the beating pattern of our hearts the rates of respiration of our lungs likewise scientists are now using fractal science to evaluate brain function studying the fractal pattern hidden within eegs and they found it malik must have noted the look on her face and smiled thats right some neurophysiologists are even coming to believe that the evolution of intelligence grew from fractals that intelligence came about because of the repetitious growth of a smaller constant in other words there might be a fundamental fractal of intelligence a primary seed from which all intelligence grew similar to that sprouting tree i just showed you can you imagine if we could harness that fractal learn to control that power lorna thought back on the animals from the trawler and their strange intelligence thats what youve been experimenting on youre looking for that fractal exactly and were close to a breakthrough lorna heard the raw desire in his voice before malik could explain further a quiet knock on the door drew their attention around the lab technician who had drawn her blood entered he was a stick insect of a man all legs and arms with a receding hairline that made his features look squashed beneath that high forehead loathing swelled at the sight of him along with fear were they already done with her tests what is it edward dr malik i wanted to let you know that ive completed the scan on the subject his tiny eyes flicked to her then away again both blood and marrow i find no evidence of contamination very good how long until the hormone levels are back from the lab half an hour thank you the man bowed his way back out of the office malik folded his fingers atop his desk thats good news there should be no reason your eggs wont be perfectly suited for the next phase of our experiments lorna shied away from that reality and asked a question that was nagging her following the technicians pronouncement what contamination were you searching for in my blood ah yes well with your exposure to the test subjects we needed to make sure you werent exposed to a nasty bloodborne protein that the subjects produce a side effect of their alteration im afraid one we dont quite understand a selfreplicating protein thats produced in their blood but is toxic to us toxic thats correct the proteins appear to be benign in our altered specimens but once transmitted to others it triggers flulike symptoms the protein spreads through the blood like a wildfire and crosses the bloodbrain barrier once there it hyperexcites the neurons to a dangerous extreme initially the excitement produces an amazing but temporary heightening of senses quite astounding actually better eyesight smell taste touch across the board initially we researched a way to use this effect to enhance soldiers in the field but in the end we had to give up why he shrugged unfortunately hyperexcitement of the neurons quickly burned out a subjects brain no way to avoid it or cure it everyone infected died within fortyeight hours of exposure chapter jacks head pounded with each thrum of the choppers rotors the bright sunlight reflecting off the gulf below didnt help even sunglasses did little to dull the stabbing brilliance seated beside the pilot he closed his eyes queasiness churned through him he normally never experienced vertigo or motion sickness but at the moment his stomach repeated every roll and lift of the helicopter he pressed his damp palms against his knees he swallowed back bile almost there the pilot reported through the headphones jack opened his eyes and spotted the oil platform ahead it looked like a rusted black dinosaur struggling out of a tar pit the bullseye was painted on the helipad drill crews scurried like ants below lornas brother pushed forward from the backseat and leaned between jack and the pilot jack twisted to face kyle the kid shared the passenger cabin with randy and two of jacks men mack higgins and bruce kim mack looked like the brand of truck hed been named after he was massively framed with a shaved head and prominent forehead that looked like the hood of a semi at the moment he chewed on the stub of a cigar unlit as he studied the oil rig below his partner was a wiry koreanamerican with lanky black hair that shadowed his dark eyes with his olive complexion and boyish appearance he looked like bruce lees younger brotherand was just as good a fighter jack had handpicked the pair and left his secondincommand scott nester to cover their asses back in new orleans scott would also keep jack abreast of any official response from sector chief paxton but otherwise they were on their own out here almost randy just heard from his friends kyle said their boat is already heading south jack nodded that would be the thibodeaux brothers the pair had borrowed a private charter boat from one of their cousins normally used for deepsea fishing in the gulf once at the oil rig the team in the chopper would split up jack would head out in a seaplane with his men while randy and kyle would take the helicopter and meet the thibodeaux brothers boat the planned assault on the lost eden cay would be a coordinated twoprong attack at dusk jack had studied nautical and satellite maps of the arc of islands he had them both folded under his left thigh he had planned on studying them again on the way out to the rig but his pounding head and churning stomach discouraged it the plan was not a complicated one get in find lorna get out according to the satellite maps the main villa lay on the western side of the island as the sun set jack and his men would lead an amphibious assault on the far side where it would be darker where eyes would be less likely to be watching from a mile out his team would do a seadrop in scuba gear their weapons in dry sacks they would use personal tow scooters to swiftly propel themselves underwater to the islands eastern shore and head overland from there to hide their beach landing randy and the others would limp their charter boat into the villas cove on the other side of the island to draw attention away from jacks team the thibodeauxs had a cache of weapons including rocketpropelled grenade launchers loaded aboard the boat jack hadnt bothered to ask how the thibodeauxs had acquired such a mass of weaponry he knew better than to inquire the thibodeaux family claimed roots that reached back to the eighteenth century to a bloodline of caribbean pirates that plagued the islands and according to some stories the thibodeaux clan hadnt entirely shed their notorious past so jack didnt care how the brothers obtained this cache of firepower but he was glad they had the charter boat would stand by out in the cove feigning a blown engine smoke pouring from the engine compartment ready to come in guns blazing to aid in jacks assault if necessary but one detail remained unknown was lorna still alive with all the flurry of preparations jack had kept himself distracted from his fears for her but on the ride here with nothing to divert his attention a fire built in his gut while it had only been a day since they first met at the trawler she had found a place in his heart maybe it was their shared past but it felt like more than that he pictured her sea blue eyes her sandy blond hair bleached white by the sun at the tips he recalled the way she chewed her lower lip when concentrating the rare smile that broke through her serious demeanor like a flash of sunlight on a cloudy day these memories and others popped like flashbulbs in his head but he also remembered her from another lifetime across a dark parking lot on her back shadows falling on her amid harsh laughter he had saved her back thenbut hed also failed her just as much with that last memory a sudden fierceness choked through him blinding him and pushing back the nausea it was a ferocity that hed never felt before in his life hed experienced fierce firefights and bloody ambushes in iraq but as he pictured lorna a deep and primal well of savagery burned through him he wanted to gnash things with his teeth to grind bone to rip things with his bare hands all to protect hernot as a boy any longer but as a man blind to all else he jumped as the skids of the chopper struck the rigs helipad he hadnt even noted their descent doors popped open and the others piled out jack remained a moment in his seat he let the blood flow through him felt it crest then recede he finally shouldered open the door and joined the others he didnt dismiss what he had felt but he also would not let it rule him he had a job to do but a part of him also shied away from looking too intimately at the source behind that rage to the tender emotion buried deep that had ignited it now was not the time not until she was safe chapter lorna stood with dr malik before one of the wall monitors on the screen rotated a threedimensional scan of a brain it reminded her of the mri done on igors brain after all the bloodshed and fire that seemed a lifetime ago she tried to concentrate on maliks explanation but a pall of grief and defeat weighed her down the doctors words sounded hollow and distant here is the best image we could muster of the brain anomaly found in the test subjects malik pointed a finger at the five nodes on the screen colored a distinct blue to distinguish them from the surrounding gray cerebral tissue the number and pattern of the nodes were identical to those discovered during igors mri back at her lab but maliks scan had much better resolution not only did the nodes stand out crisply but so did the fine branching of magnetite crystals that connected the nodes together as it rotated the pattern looked to have the same crystalline structure and shape as a snowflake are you familiar with fractal antennas malik asked lorna fought through her despair to answer it took her an extra beat to croak out a no do you own a cell phone the strange question pierced the fog in her head curiosity focused her sharper of course then you already own a fractal antenna in the last decade scientists have learned that antenna arrays patterned after fractals have an amazing ability to broadcast along a wider range of frequencies with a greater strengthtosize ratio this breakthrough allowed manufacturers to shrink antennas down to microscopic sizes yet still function like antennas a hundredfold larger its revolutionized the industry thats the power hidden within fractals malik pointed to the screen and thats what were looking at here a fractal antenna grown from natural magnetite crystals in the brain lorna studied the snowflakelike pattern and remembered her own crude analogy to a satellite dish she also recalled the strange synchronization of eegs and its this fractal antenna that allows the animals to link up neurologically exactly the pattern of magnetic crystallization seen here is definitely fractal in nature the entire neural matrix is made up of the repetition of the same basic crystal shape like the triangle multiplying into a mountain malik nodded but this is only the tip of that mountain initially this scan was the best we could discern using standard techniques such methods only allowed us to look so far even zooming down with an electron microscope only revealed a crystal made up of hundreds of even tinier crystals it was like with those russian nesting dolls every time you thought youd reached the smallest crystal it would open up to reveal even smaller versions of itself inside it went on and on stretching beyond our ability to detect maliks voice cracked with frustration lorna remembered the raw desire in the researchers eyes as he described his search for a fundamental fractal that was the root of all intelligence no matter how hard we looked the primary fractal kept retreating out of reach growing smaller and smaller eventually disappearing beyond where we could scan down a spooky hole no one dared follow lorna pictured the white rabbit from alice in wonderland bounding down his rabbit hole and though we werent able to go down that hole i could guess what was down there lornas interest piqued sharper what the strange world of quantum physics following fractals smaller and smaller it eventually leads to the subatomic world in fact some physicists now believe that the science of fractals could explain away some of the spookiness of quantum theory such things like nonlocality and entanglement how a subatomic particle can be at two places at once how light behaves both like a wave and a particle when you get that small things get weird but fractals may hold the answer to explaining it all lorna didnt see where this was going her impatience must have been plain to read so let me show you what i learned myself from that research something practical yet amazing i scanned this same brain again but this time not looking for crystals but for the magnetic energy produced by those crystals though i might not be able to see the physical crystals i could still measure the electromagnetic signature from those invisible crystals like the light from distant stars lorna said maliks eyes widened caught by surprise yes a perfect analogy though we cant see a sun or a planet we can detect the light that reaches us so you repeated the scan looking for energy instead of crystals i did and this is what i found he pointed a remote control at the screen and pressed a button the blue snowflake suddenly bloomed outward becoming a cerulean storm within the specimens skull lorna gasped and covered her mouth in shock its everywhere malik smiled proud of his discovery each node is like the seed of a fractal tree the crystals spread outward into branches then into tinier stems and on and on lorna pictured the fractal tree she had been shown earlier how a single y grew into a threedimensional tree the crystals were doing the same in the brain spreading outward while growing tinier and tinier at the same time until they were no longer visible with any scanning tool but they could still be detected by the electromagnetic radiation coming off the hidden crystals energy rising out of the subatomic world malik waved her back to her seat by his desk so ive shown you how far down this fractal puzzle burrows how it roots down into the quantum world so now lets consider the opposite how far this fractal tree stretches outward you already know these specimens are capable of linking up of networking together she nodded and understood where he was going you believe by linking together that same fractal tree is branching out further into the world correct the fractal tree is growing beyond the confines of a single skull and growing stronger lorna remembered igor reciting the mathematical constant pi which begs the question where will it end if it can spread nearly infinitely down into the subatomic world can it spread infinitely outward if so what might be the result what level of supreme intelligence might be created in her minds eye lorna pictured the roots of this fractal tree disappearing into the world of quantum energy feeding on that infinite source of power yet she also pictured those tree branches expanding ever outward maybe it was the earlier biblical analogies that had started this discussion that drew one last comparison from her its almost like the tree of knowledge from the book of genesis malik gave a dismissive snort now youre sounding like mr bennett her voice grew firmer drawing strength from certainty fearful of what manner of intelligence would be born from this experiment it made her go cold you have to stop what youre doing she said malik sighed as he sank into his desk chair plainly disappointed as a fellow scientist i had hoped youd be more openminded she was saved further admonishment by a knock on the door the genetics technician stepped again into the room bearing aloft a steel tray holding three large syringes malik brightened again ah edward are the hormonal tests completed yes doctor and i have the drug cocktail prepared for the subject maliks gaze shifted back to her then it seems we must continue our discussion a little later dr polk see if i cant persuade you to look at this more rationally versus leaning on the bible but i guess thats expected when youre working on an island named eden lorna placed a hand on her belly fearing what was to come behind the technician appeared the familiar bulk of her bodyguard connor must have read the panic in her face a hand settled to his holstered sidearm discouraging any fight from her after your injections malik said youll want to lie down for at least a half hour im afraid whats to come will not be pleasant accelerating the follicle stimulation of your ovaries can be a bithe chose his next word carefullytaxing lornas fear sharpened into a knife in her gut afterward well talk again well have a couple of hours before your ovarian tissue will be ready for harvesting before thats done ill show you what we intend to do with your eggs he waved her off with no choice lorna stood up it took an extra moment for her blood to follow her vision darkened at the edges connor came forward and grabbed her elbow impatiently as she was hauled away she got one last look at the monitors on the wall the brain scan continued to rotate on the screen showing the magnetic storm raging within that skull despite her terror about what was in store for her a part of her went cold and determined at the sightand its implication god had banished man from the garden of eden for daring to trespass upon the tree of knowledge but what if man learned to grow his own tree where might it end she didnt know the answer she knew only one thing for certain someone had to stop them chapter bon dieu you dont look so good little brother jack couldnt argue with randys assessment he felt like someone had poured molten lead into his joints while leaving his skin to alternately burn or go damp with a cold sweat he had drugged himself with some nondrowsy theraflu and hoped it would be enough to sustain him for another twentyfour hours ill be fine he said to randy as much as to himself his brother stood a few yards from a small astar helicopter as it warmed up its engine rotors whirling up to full speed the roaring whine cut like a rusty hacksaw into his skull the chopper would be airlifting randy and kyle over to the thibodeauxs boat currently steaming toward lost eden cay off to the side kyle stood with his arms crossed anxious to get moving one fingernail digging into his plaster cast like a dog worrying a bone he had wanted to join jacks assault team to go directly after his sister but his broken wrist precluded him from accompanying them not that jack would have let kyle anyway he needed men he could trust men with military training in covert operations still kyle looked ready to claw his cast off and join jacks men mack higgins and bruce kim waited a couple decks below down by the wellhead with the drill crew even farther down a seaplane floated at the foot of the offshore platform ready to fly the assault team over to the island and dump them and their gear a mile offshore you have the timetable jack asked randy his brother tapped a finger against his skull mais oui its all in here jack didnt like the sound of that hed just spent the past half hour going over the assault plan in the office of the rigs geologist for this to work each group would have to act in perfect synchronization kyle stepped forward and cast a scowl in randys direction dont worry i have it all written down well wait for your signal before approaching the island jack nodded glad at least that someone good with numbers was going to be aboard the thibodeauxs boat he had full confidence in randy and his friends when it came to a downanddirty bar fight but as to sticking to timetables cajuns seldom wore wristwatches randy merely shrugged whatever well be where we need to be and ill make sure they are kyle added now it was randys turn to glower je vais passer une calotte he threatened under his breath there was definitely no love lost between these two men jack hoped that old angerburied deep between their two familiesdidnt boil up into a problem for this mission just get on board the chopper jack said ill touch base by radio when were in the air the two men turned to the helicopter they kept a wary distance from each other as they walked away jack dismissed them from his mind and headed for the stairs that led down from the elevated helipad he wanted to be out of direct earshot when the helicopter took off his head pounded with each rising beat of the rotors as he climbed down the steep stairs finally sheltered from the rotorwash he was assaulted again by the smell of oil and axle grease from the rig the farther down he went the worse it got until he swore he could taste grease on the back of his tongue fighting down a gag he stopped on a landing that fronted the open gulf a fresh breeze blew in his face he sucked down a few cold gulps to clear his head as he did so the astar helicopter lifted off overhead and flew over the waters he watched the chopper swing souththen his cell phone vibrated in his pocket now what he pulled it out and checked the caller id he didnt recognize the number except it was a new orleans area code unsure who it was he answered it brusquely a familiar voice responded as calm and gentle as if this were an invitation to high tea agent menard im glad i could still reach you dr metoyer jack let both his surprise and impatience ring out i know you must be in a hurry carlton metoyer said but i believe i have information that may have a bearing on your mission jack stepped back into the freshening breeze off the gulf to listen what is it its about what was done to the animals with all that happened back at the lab we never had time to review our dna analysis on that extra chromosome found in those animals jack recalled that lorna had mentioned something about an extra chromosome she believed it was the cause of the strange mutation in the animals once we got settled at the audubon zoo here zoë and i had a chance to run through those results the chromosome proved to bear some shocking characteristics something you should know about go ahead but im pressed for time of course agent menard let me get to the point i dont know how familiar you are with genetic code specifically with junk dna jack sighed earning a flare of his stabbing headache biology was not my strong suit doctor no worries this is biology as im sure you already know dna is a vast storehouse of genetic information the human code is three billion letters long but what you must understand is that only a very small percentage of dnathree percentis actually functional the other ninetyseven percent is genetic garbage basically baggage weve accumulated and been carrying around for millennia so why are we dragging it along good question recent studies now suggest that not all junk dna is pure garbage researchers have noted that specific regions of junk dna match base pair for base pair with old viral code jack checked his watch not sure where this was going carlton continued there are two theories of why we carry around this ancient viral code one scientific camp says its there to protect us against a new viral attack basically genetic memory lying in wait until its needed again the other camp says its merely old viral code that became absorbed into our dna over the course of millennia literally the baggage of evolution ive come to believe maybe its both especially as these bits of viral code can be found in dna across animal species from the lowliest burrowing mole to us humans its like were carrying these identical chunks from some ancient source and keeping it for some future reason jack heard an edge of excitement enter the doctors voice whats the point here doctor yes of course im rambling weve been studying the genetic code of that foreign chromosome and zoë had the brilliant idea to compare the sequence to various data banks including the human genome project within an hour we had a hit what do you mean the genetic code of the extra chromosome we found the exact same code already buried in our junk dnaand not just ours but most animals what the extra chromosome in these test subjects matches a set of old viral codes locked in all animal dna including our own okay but what does all that mean it means that animal kindat least vertebratesmight have been exposed to this extra code before sometime in our evolutionary past we dealt with it and it became an inert part of our genome only now weve encountered it again in active form active ill let zoë explain she has the better grasp on this before jack could object the phone was fumbled and a new voice spoke hi jack sorry to bother you how are you holding up zoë okay i just need to keep busy to be useful his ear picked up the strain the tears hidden behind her words it drew an ache from his heart echoing his fear for lorna tell me what you learned zoë her voice grew firmer moving away from that well of grief before we left acres my husband paul had been studying the dna highlighting certain sequences of code what we call genetic markers it was plain what he suspected the markers were unmistakable unmistakable of what jack asked the markers clearly suggest this foreign chromosome is viral in origin viral wait are you saying the chromosome is a virus were coming to believe so most viruses invade a cells nucleus then hijack the hosts dna by meshing with it in some manner its why so many pieces of viral code make up our junk dna only this virus doesnt only hijack a hosts dna it became its own chromosome again jack felt a sweeping chill he began to get an inkling of why carlton had called we assumed someone had been genetically engineering these animals zoë continued that they were taking foreign genetic material and artificially inserting it into these animals the same way we can insert a glowing gene of a jellyfish into a mouse egg and breed mice that can glow but it was an assumption we jumped to prematurely after these results its possible that the animals might have been merely exposed to this virus infected with it they then passed the genetic code to their offspring who were born with these strange changes jack now understood why hed been called he stared across the empty gulf waters no wonder the kidnappers chose an isolated island for their experiments this virus he said you think it might be contagious it could be we dont know weve already put the animals here in strict quarantine but we thought you should know before you reached the island to take precautions thanks well do that jack was suddenly all too conscious of his flu symptoms but he didnt have time to worry about it he had a job to do the tromping of boots on the steel stairs drew his attention away from the gulf mack higgins climbed up to the landing he still chewed on the stump of a cold cigar his eyes widened at finding jack there just a second zoë jack lowered the phone and nodded to mack what is it pilot says were all fueled up jack nodded and lifted the phone again is that all you have zoë only one last thing there was a long pause her voice came back brittle with anger and hurt find lorna bring her home and make those bastards who killed paul pay i promise zoë on both counts he hung up lowering the phone he faced mack we set to go pilot needs another ten minutes to run a final preflight check then well have the thumbsup but you should know i just got off the horn with jimmy back at the station paxtons blowing a gasket over there knows were awol and off the grid jack grimaced it was bad news but not unexpected paxton was no fool jacks venture threatened to get them all canned if not tossed into prison its not too late for you and bruce to head back he offered mack grinned rakishly around his cigar what would be the fun of that jack clapped him on the shoulder in thanks and motioned him back toward the stairs what about word from the fbi agent any sign of dr polks gps signal macks demeanor darkened not a blip or a ping out there boss jack swore inwardly if only he had more proof that lorna was out there not just for paxton but for himself too as he headed down the stairs doubt began to fray the edges of his resolve what if she wasnt even on the island or what if she was already dead he swallowed back those fears they would do him no good she had to be aliveand somehow he knew that to be true but that didnt mean she wasnt in bad trouble and unfortunately he felt that just as strongly and that fear grew with every passing minute we still bugging out of here in ten mack asked jack shook his head no were out of here now chapter lorna must have passed out one minute she was heaving bile into a bucket beside the treatment table and the next she was on her back on the same table smelling salts passed under her nose the ammonia smell felt like a kick to the face she batted away the technicians hand what are they doing to me the ovarystimulating drugs had been injected intravenously nausea swept through her even before the last needle had slipped out of her vein she fought it for a full ten minutes but eventually her stomach gave out they must have expected that side effect and kept an emesis pan bedside she filled it three times until she was left dryheaving as the smelling salts brought her back around she struggled to sit up the room spun id lie down a voice said beside her she turned and recognized the broadshouldered gentleman from the villas study seated next to her he still wore the same hiking pants and khaki vest this was bryce bennett the man behind the operations here up close he appeared even larger his tanned face looked like finegrained leather his blue eyes like pale ice he waved the technician out of the room i had chemotherapy for lymphoid cancer ten years ago bryce said leaning forward got it from exposure during my years as a submariner back when soldiers were still watching atomic tests from the sidelines so i know what youre feeling right about now but youll get your sea legs back in a few more minutes at least the other women did lorna stared around she was momentarily alone in the treatment room with the man not that she could do anything she felt as weak as a newborn with pneumonia but with each breath she did feel her head clearing what are you doing here she asked she meant it to mean why had the big man bothered to come down here but the single question encompassed so much more why were they putting her through this what was the purpose of all of this he took her question literally i came here after speaking with dr malik something you said intrigued me i thought we could share a few minutes before theyre ready to continue the procedure what about about eden she didnt know what to make of that and remained silent bennett sighed and leaned back in his chair she noted a silver crucifix pinned to his jackets lapel it flashed as he shifted back into his seat but lets start at the beginning i started this project because of a paper produced by the chief scientific advisers of the pentagon a group calling themselves the jasons he lifted an eyebrow at her to see if shed heard of them she merely kept her face blank giving him nothing ten years ago the jasons fiercely advocated for the military to invest greater resources into what they all called human performance modification they were concerned that our enemies were getting the upper hand foreign powers were already doing pharmaceutical research into performance enhancement such drugs could produce troops who were smarter stronger and better able to handle the rigors of war you can imagine the alarm bells that raised among the pentagon top brass bennett chuckled at the thought the advisers went on to warn the brass that the us was falling way behind and as a matter of national security they recommended two things to increase research funding and to monitor those foreign studies abroad and believe me following this report money flowedand it flowed in all directions one of my competitors in the defense contracting business is already actively testing drugs as a way to improve memory and cognitive performance in troops lorna began to understand where this was headed she pictured the brain scan back in maliks office she also recalled the description duncan had used for the project bioweapon systems following those guidelines money also went into monitoring other projects abroad it was during a coordinated attempt to coopt foreign researchers as moles that we were approached by dr malik a door opened behind bennett as if summoned by his name malik swept into the treatment room at his heels followed the chief of security duncan was red in the face making his scars stand out more prominently from their demeanors it was plain theyd been arguing bennett turned to them whats wrong duncan spoke first weve lost one of the cameras in the compound it might just be a mechanical glitch malik quickly added or it could be one of his creatures took out the camera if they were smart enough to cut out the tracking device in order to sneak over here and kill one of my men then theyre smart enough to knock out a camouflaged camera what about the other cameras bennett asked what are they showing nothing out of the ordinary malik insisted their activity appears routine no sign of any hyperaggression i still say such outbursts are isolated aberrations and can be eradicated and i say we go in with assault rifles and purge the place bennett held up a hand that would set us years behind duncan have the security doubled at the gate between the two islands and send an armed team to check on that camera well decide what to do from there lorna listened to this exchange in silence back in vet school shed learned that it was better to keep quiet and let the client do most of the talking more information came out that way but duncan didnt fail to note her presence he glared at her as if this were all her fault sir i also heard word from our computer tech it looks like the new orleans facility does indeed contract with compusafe to back up their computers theres a good chance their data was saved to an outside server were still tracking where that might be keep looking bennett growled we cant risk losing our technological advantage yes sir duncan headed away again lorna was glad to see him go bennett turned his attention to malik doctor youve arrived at an opportune time i was just going over how the babylon project got started how you sensed the winds were changing and threw your hat on our side of the ring yes such a change also allowed me to continue my research only this time with sufficient funding we call that a winwin situation bennett said indeed bennett faced lorna do you know why we call our work here the babylon project she shook her head because it started in the biblical region of babylon dr malik was already under way with his project twenty years ago a secret weapons project hidden beneath the baghdad zoo he was doing biowarfare research with a virus he discovered in a small kurdish village in the mountains near turkey you may have heard of saddam destroying kurdish villages back in during that attack he bombarded this village too and many others with mustard gas and sarin nerve agent he also bleached the local wells all to cover up what they found there what did they find lorna asked hoarsely her throat sore malik answered all the children in the village had been born strangely regressed during the prior year lorna pictured the hominids and could guess what the doctor meant by regressed the children were kept hidden by the superstitious villagers believing their lands to be cursed this certainty also grew after similar genetic abnormalities appeared in the villages goats and camels eventually word spread especially when the adult villagers began to get sick succumbing to strange fevers that left them hypersensitive to light and noise lorna recalled malik describing a toxic protein i was called in to investigate i did dna tests and found all the children bore a chromosomal defect an extra chromosome thats right but it wasnt a chromosome it was an invader a virus that injected its own dna into a cell nucleus and took up residence there lorna finally sat up this time the room only spun a little the nausea was also quickly receding though a cramping ache had begun to throb in her lower back likely rising from her drugassaulted ovaries a virus she asked thats right and from what weve been able to tell of its evolutionary origin weve encountered it before as proof malik went on to describe how remnants of this code still existed in our dna buried and dormant just a fragment of junk dna in fact this ancient exposure may be why all animal species carry some level of magnetite crystals in their brain like broken pieces of a mirror stuck in our head a remnant left behind from this previous encounter millennia ago malik continued but these villagers exposed themselves anew along with their livestock when they dug a new well far deeper than theyd ever gone due to a decadelong drought once the water was flowing they quickly contaminated themselves and their livestock with this virus she understood and this virus inserted its dna spreading through their cells it seems to concentrate in very active cells lymph gastrointestinal cells bone marrow but also germ cells in ovaries and testicles and in doing so it passed its dna to their offspring exactly right but in the cells of adult animals it remained dormant inactive it only switched on inside a fertilized egg the virus began to express itself as the embryo grew changing the architecture of the brain to meet its ends in early embryonic development it triggered the brain to form those magnetite deposits and then it grew in a fractal manner in tandem with the developing brain lorna pictured again that fractal tree spreading ever outward the viral dna also continues to produce proteins as an offspring grows we believe the protein acts as a neurostimulator basically keeping the neurons more excited generating additional energy to power and maintain this fractal antenna but its this same protein that kills those who dont have the neurological capacity to handle it those who dont have this magnetic architecture in their brains truly insidious when you think about it how do you mean lorna asked maybe this deadly feature also serves an evolutionary advantage a way for the new generation to wipe out the old lorna went cold at this possibility either way malik said we do know another effect of these proteins under electron microscopy we studied the rest of the hosts dna specifically we examined the region of our junk dna that corresponded to the viruss genetic code this region was puffy and unbundled suggesting active transcription and translation and what does that mean bennett asked scrunching his brow lorna knew the answer her stomach churnedbut not from the injected drugs this time malik explained such an appearance suggests that ancient region of dna had become active again in other words what was junk was no longer junk how could that happen lorna pressed i could go into detail about messenger rna reverse transcriptase but suffice it to say that these proteins stimulated and awakened this ancient dna i believe that awakening this old code is one of the reasons these animals end up being genetic throwbacks that by turning on the dna carried in the genome for millennia it somehow also dredged up each animals genetic past reawakening evolutionary features locked for millennia within that junk dna like some sort of genetic tradeoff lorna said malik crinkled his brow at her not understanding she laid it out the virus triggers a leap forward neurologically but to balance it out theres also a corresponding evolutionary leap backward maliks eyebrows rose on his forehead id never considered that bennett nodded hassan maybe you were right about dr polk she might bring a fresh outlook to your problem i agree they both faced her if youre feeling settled enough to walk bennett said its time you truly got a taste of eden and the serpent that plagues us chapter lorna followed malik back to his office her legs wobbled with each step and she came close to falling on her face after first sliding off the exam table bennett caught her and offered her his arm she hated to take it but the only other choice was to be carried there at least moving helped clear her head by the time she reached the chair in front of his desk she felt strong enough to let go of bennetts arm and move to the seat the burning ache in her lower back had also dulled to a low throb she sank to the chair as malik took a remote and pointed it at the wall of screens this is a live highdefinition camera feed from the habitat we set up on the neighboring island the animal reserve is connected to ours by a land bridge but weve set up an electric fence between the two islands and maintain aroundtheclock guards the other island is a perfect test field for evaluating how this new intelligence manifests in a realworld setting the center plasma monitor bloomed to life the clarity was such that it looked more like a window into another worldand perhaps it was the view opened into a clearing in a primeval forest crude palmthatched huts circled the edges and in the center a fire pit glowed with embers a pair of naked figures crouched near the pit they were the size of large children naked but covered mostly in fur the male rose to his feet as if sensing their observation he searched around his nose was broad and flat his forehead high and prominent shadowing his eyes his jaw protruded looking like it had been crudely sculpted halfway between ape and man despite her weakness lorna rose again to her feet fascinated despite her personal repugnance concerning the research here she recognized the creature here was a living example of the body shed seen earlier a hominidlike version of early man as if wary the male helped the female to her feet her breasts hung heavy she held a hand to her belly which bulged shes pregnant lorna said surprised due any day malik agreed were lucky to catch a view of the female she normally stays hidden and only comes out at night i named her eve bennett said with a vague note of fatherly pride in his voice malik rolled his eyes a bit at the conceit of his choice of names shes the first of them to conceive in the wild weve normally orchestrated all breeding via artificial insemination in the lab were very curious what sort of offspring shell give birth to how old is she the male is eight the female seven the shock must have been plain on lornas face the specimens mature at a very fast rate malik explained behind the figures a large dark shape crept out of the shadowy forest it kept low to the ground padding on wide paws tail straight back ears laid flat it stalked toward the unsuspecting figures it was an ebonyfurred version of the sabertoothed jaguar killed in the bayou a juvenile from the looks of it still this youngster had to weigh over a hundred pounds most of it muscle its eyes squinted toward the two targetsthen in an explosion of muscle it charged at them lorna took a step back in horror the male suddenly swung around the cat skidded to a stop and promptly rolled onto its back baring its throat and wiggling happily on the ground the female bent down one hand supporting her lower back and rubbed the cats chin a tender smile suffused her face her features were a more softly sculpted version of the males the cats tail swished in contentment bennett stepped to lornas side and so the lion shall lie down with the lamb malik explained less philosophically theyre all bonded the habitat was established a year ago at first there were a few deaths but over time the specimens established and grew into an interconnected family of sorts connected we suppose by their mental affinity sharing at a level we cannot comprehend lorna heard the longing in his voicenot out of any desire to experience it but more out of a desire to understand and harness it as she watched another three figures entered the clearing one carried a crude spear the other two hauled a small pig between them we stock the island with deer and pigs bennett said to keep them fed they also have wildgrowing coconut and mango trees and a freshwater spring malik added but other than that and the makeshift shelters weve left them to fend for themselves to see how they adapt to coexist and use their strange intelligence to solve problems we set up weekly challenges and tests and evaluate their performances behind the trio of hunters a pack of a dozen dogs burst out of the forest lean with bushy tails and sharp ears they looked like miniature wolves each the size of a cocker spaniel the dogs swept into the clearing but rather than moving like a tumbling riotous pack there was a strange coordination to their movement they gave the clearing one full run then swept eerily to a standstill dropping simultaneously to their haunches like a flock of birds settling to a perch another handful of hominids appeared from the huts drawn out by the commotion lorna counted at least ten it many ways bennett said this place truly is eden all gods creaturesgreat and smallliving in harmony malik had a less biblical take on the matter what were seeing is a demonstration of fractal intelligence where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts we believe the group has developed a hivelike intelligence where the individuals in the habitat act like one living unit it may be why they havent developed the ability to speak they each know the others thoughts and perhaps thats the way the world once was bennett said before we were cast from eden rather than dismiss the biblical analogies this time malik nodded mr bennett might be right perhaps what were looking at is the source of the mythology of an earlier earthly paradise the proverbial garden of eden various versions of that story persist in cultures around the world why is that perhaps it rises from some race memory of such a prior union just as we still carry magnetite crystals in our brainfractured pieces of this old neural networkmaybe we do somehow recall this earlier paradise and maybe its more than just memory lorna said finding herself inadvertently caught up in the wonder of what she was seeing malik turned to her for elaboration she nodded to the screen for the past decade animal researchers and human psychologists have been exploring the humananimal bondthe strange and deep affinity humans have for animals no one really knows the source of this affinity we do know it goes beyond mere affection or need for companionship new studies show the human body physically responds to the presence of animals in a positive manner what do you mean by positive bennett asked she offered some examples people who own animals have lower cholesterol levels and a lessened risk of heart disease just petting a cat causes an immediate drop in blood pressure bringing companion animals into hospitals and hospices accelerates healing times and boosts immune responses in patients yet it remains a mystery why we have this bodily reaction she pointed to the screen maybe that is the answer maybe more than just a race memory of eden resides in us maybe our bodies physically remember it too memory locked in both mind and body thats an intriguing view dr polk and you may be right perhaps there remains some weak connection some residual vibration from the fragments of magnetite crystals that persist connecting us all together malik sighed and frowned at the figures on the monitor still its the body part that has been plaguing us here she understood putting the details together in her head the genetic throwbacks she said to malik then turned to bennett you mentioned the pentagons interest in the performance enhancement of humans you still havent gotten it right with such mutational throwbacks you cant bring your research forward bennett nodded thats right its the holy grail of our research malik said a human birth without turning back the evolutionary clock does the pentagon even know youre doing these human studies bennett shrugged they know not to look too closely its why we shipped only animals on the trawler to demonstrate our progress in order for our funding to continue flowing were so close to fully realizing our goal can you imagine if we could tap into this resource soldiers who are not only smarter but with unit cohesion like no other army but that isnt our only obstacle malik said he stared grimly as the hunters tossed the pig onto the hot coals of the fire pit it seems our eden has its serpent too what do you mean let me show you malik pointed his remote at the other monitors that surrounded the plasma screen image after image appeared most were pictures of bloody wounds sustained by various men and women some in white lab coats others in workers coveralls or khaki uniforms but one screen played a video filmed at night hued in shades of silver a shapeone of the hominidsbounded down a dark beach and leaped upon a guard smoking a cigarette it tore at the mans throat with tooth and nail the savagery was shocking even after the guard was down the creature continued to claw at the mans face ripping away a chunk of his cheek that happened last night bennett said bouts of hyperaggression malik explained they flare up with no warning no provocation no explicable reason one of them might appear gentle one day but would suddenly attack a technician the next its one of the reasons we decided to isolate the colony to the far island they were growing too dangerous to keep here our head of security would have preferred to destroy them but there is still so much we can learn by studying them from a safe distance she pictured duncans map of scars is that what happened to his face was he attacked duncan bennett shook his head he was injured much earlier back when we were first salvaging specimens got badly mauled spent a week in a coma and countless hours under a surgeons knife just to get back some semblance of a face no wonder the bastard hates them so much she thought bennett continued but thats the nature of the beast i personally believe our aggression problem here at eden arises because our test subjects have an unnatural connection to wild animals such contact defiles gods plan corrupts what little bit of humanity remains in them if we could purge that wed be better off and i cant discount that malik added there remains a feral edge to them that we cant tame maybe it does rise from this merging of animal and man to that end weve restricted our next phase of research to human studies only its why we need plenty of fresh genetic material lorna didnt like the sound of that the ache in her ovaries reminded her where they would harvest the new genetic material but wed appreciate hearing any insight you might have in regard to the serpent in our midst malik said mr bennett and i have already discussed utilizing your talents lorna suddenly sensed all this was some sort of test a practical exam of her usefulness to survive she had to prove herself if she failed at any point her life was forfeit perhaps it would be best if you showed what were working on now bennett said in other words part two of her exam was about to begin lorna eyed the center monitor the village was covering the pig with leaves and stones she watched a version of igor up in a tree cutting down palm fronds with his beak the sight of the featherless parrot reminded her of all shed lost of the hopelessness of her situation something in the forest must have made a noise suddenly all eyesdog cat bird mansnapped in that direction shifting like a single organism the entire habitat froze in place they all seemed to be staring directly at the camera straight at her her body went cold malik placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder as if that contact broke some spell the village snapped out of its fixed focus and resumed their coordinated effort but lorna could not shake the menacing intensity of that attention dont worry malik said you wont have anything to do with them that place is off limits isolated to their habitat theyve become progressively insular dangerous to anyone outside their interconnected family it would be suicide to step foot in there despite the danger posed she could not stop staring at the screen still she understood the security issue having been involved with the new orleans zoo she knew the obstacles and challenges when it came to safely housing wild animals especially predators she was glad someone was keeping a close eye on that place chapter duncan stood on the stretch of sand that connected the two islands he sucked on a cherry life savers but not even the sweetness could dispel the bitter taste at the back of his throat he hated to put his men at needless risk especially when malik couldnt recognize a failure when it was biting him in the ass across the sand a trio of his commandos approached the forest on the far side they were armed with xm lightweight assault rifles outfitted with mm grenade launchers duncan wasnt taking any chances he never did malik had thought him overly paranoid when he designed the security measures to isolate the other island a twelvefoot electric fence split the land bridge in half coils of concertina barbwire topped the gate and rolled out into the water hed also mined the seabed to either side with antipersonnel charges that would explode and shred the shallows with razorsharp flechettes additionally hed tagged all the beasts over there and monitored their movements around the clock there should have been no accidents no surprises certainly no deaths duncan had seen the body on the beach the mans face was gone stripped to the bone staring at the mutilation he had flashbacks about his own attackand that only stoked his anger to a hot fire even his own men gave him a wide berth seeing something in his face that scared them and he was okay with that he wanted his men to remain wary across the way the trio of men vanished into the forest duncan listened to their chatter he didnt have to be down at the beach but he felt it was his duty he wanted to be here in case there was trouble he never sent his men into a firestorm that he wasnt willing to follow them into it was why his men respected him were loyal to him he listened to the mens chatter over the radio in his ear they kept their talk to a minimum but he wasnt satisfied he touched his throat mike keep silent out there hand signals only sound out if theres trouble he got confirmation from all three he resumed his pacing as he waited each minute dragged his jaw muscles began to ache finally a new voice spoke in his ear commander kent the team is about to enter the blackedout zone the speaker was posted back at the villas security nest monitoring all the camera feeds ill lose them from here but ill keep tracking their id tags understood keep me updated duncan kept his gaze fixed on the forested hill across the way during his engineering of the compound he had installed an additional precaution in case of emergency he had sowed the island with napalm bombs with a press of a button he could burn the other island down to the dirt at the moment he was tempted to do that fry the whole place be done with it the security technician spoke again in his ear the team has reached the tree blind where the broken camera was posted impatient duncan pressed his throat mike to open a channel to his team report in whats going on out there what did you find the voice came back in a wary whisper cameras trashed looks like someone took a rock to it smashed it to bits so hed been right all along a mechanical glitch my ass duncan planned on laying into malik once he got back to the villa but that could wait he didnt want his men out there any longer than necessary replace the camera he ordered and hump your asses back here double time will do before he could even sign off the security nest cut in commander kent im receiving a distress call from a commercial charter boat theyre reporting an engine fire he closed his eyes and sighed heavily like i need this now he spoke into his radio where are they the beach patrol says the boats about half a klick from the cove blowing black smoke how do you want me to respond duncan didnt like this warning bells rang in his head he wanted to check this out himself hold tight before responding to the boat ill be right up aye sir duncan stared at the dark forest beyond the gate the others should be heading back by now the security nest could continue monitoring their status until they were safe he turned his back on other island and headed up the stone stairs toward the villa he wanted to see this foundering boat for himself by maritime law they could not ban the ship from seeking shelter to do so would only draw attention to the island still that didnt mean he had to roll out the welcome mat he touched his mike again tell the beach patrol to keep heavy watch on that boat until i get there and order the gun battery in the crows nest to maintain a fix on that target during the construction of the villa hed had a m bushmaster cannon built into a bunker atop the highest floor of the villa it fired two hundred rounds a minute with the velocity to shred through armor might seem like overkill but it was a reasonable precaution considering that the seas around here continued to be hounded by modernday pirates raiders who attacked small islands pillaged unsuspecting estates and slaughtered or kidnapped anyone unlucky enough to be around duncan refused to be caught by surprise if whoever was out there wanted to make trouble hed make them regret it chapter five meters underwater jack sped above a line of reefs into the islands shallows his fingers gripped the handles of a portable mako underwater scooter and powered toward the shoreline he adjusted the pitch of the units propeller to keep him a foot above the seabed to either side mack and bruce paced him zipping through the shallow waters they all wore black neoprene wet suits each of them hauled oilskin dry sacks holding clothes and weapons m carbines and h k doubleaction pistols jack had also packed his remington shotgun he didnt hold out any hope that such firepower was sufficient for a fullout frontal assault the weapons were meant as a last resort this missions success or failure hinged less on firepower than on stealth to that end jack had coordinated with the thibodeauxs boat the others should have raised a distress signal by now drawing attention to the far side of the island while jacks team snuck in the back door as an added precaution he had studied the satellite maps and opted to make landfall on the wooded island to the north with the villa on the southern island this smaller island would be less likely to be watched or so he hoped jack slowed his scooter as the seabed rose under him twenty yards off the beach he powered the propeller off and let the scooter drop to the sand below he carefully floated to the surface and peeked his mask above the surf to scan the shoreline a thin strand of beach fringed a dark wall of forest mostly palms and mangrove trees near the water with caribbean pines and walnuts up higher with the sun setting on the far side of the island the woods were thick with shadows he watched for a long minute for any sign of movement all seemed quiet mack and bruce joined him hovering to either side he shed his air tanks weight belt and swim fins holding his breath he grabbed his dry sack then signaled for the others to follow with a kick of his legs he propelled himself toward shore staying underwater for as long as possible finally with sand rasping the belly of his wet suit he surged up and lunged for the beach in seven steps he was out of the water and into the shadows of the woods bruce followed next his lithe shape barely making a splash he dove over the sand and rolled into the shadows on the right not even leaving a footprint on the other hand mack stormed the beach like an amphibious landing craft he lunged out of the water and pounded low across the sand hitting the woods to the left once under shelter they kept silent beyond their hiding places the waves slowly washed away most evidence of their landfall jack shivered as he waited now that he was no longer moving his skull began to ache again the smells of the forest filled his head moldy leaf rot wet sand some spicyscented flower his feverish eyes burned making even the shadows seem too bright all his senses stretched outward wary for any sign that their landing had been spotted but no alarm sounded no shouts rose satisfied he motioned for the others to get ready they stripped out of their wet suits and into rough duty uniforms in green and black weapons were freed radios fixed to ears and throats once outfitted jack lifted an arm and dropped it like an ax in the direction of the land bridge that separated the two islands the bridge lay not far from the villa using the cover of this island should allow them to creep almost to the doorstep of the place from there they would need information he planned to ambush one of the outlying guards to interrogate the man under threat of great bodily harma threat that would be realized if the man didnt cooperate jack had no time for subtlety he intended to find out if lorna was here and if so where she was being kept jack again felt that bonedeep surge of fierceness his vision narrowed as he headed into the dappled forest his men moved silently to either side no matter where lorna was he would find her lorna stood before a closed door it read authorized personnel only malik swiped his id card bennett stood behind her they were accompanied by lornas assigned bodyguard the redheaded connor who wore his usual hard scowl the guard posted himself at the door as the lock disengaged and lorna and the two men entered a nondescript anteroom a second door led into the next room but it couldnt be opened until the first door was closed like an air lock malik turned to lorna what youre about to see may seem callous at first glancebut it is necessary in order to maintain their purity bennett added malik gave a half shrug or in other words to isolate variables to strip any possibility that contact with animal minds is contributing to the psychotic breaks demonstrated by the first generation of specimens to that end let me show you the second generation of our research lorna suddenly quailed against stepping across that threshold fearful of discovering what new horrors lay hidden here malik opened the doorwayand lorna was shocked to hear childish laughter accompanied by the clapping of small hands music also wafted out the theme song from sesame street the incongruity of laughter in this house of pain set her teeth on edge fear grew sharper inside her come with me malik said and led her inside lorna had no choice but to follow trailed by bennett malik continued his dialogue sounding vaguely nervous maybe even embarrassed though theyre isolated here we treat them very well lorna stepped into what could pass for an ordinary dayroom in any preschool a chalkboard covered one wall beanbag chairs dotted the floor in a rainbow of colors crayon drawings decorated a corkboard and in a corner a plasma television showed a furry puppet conversing with big bird but it was the children in the room who drew lornas full attention dozens of children sat on chairs or sprawled on rugs raptly staring at the television screen each looked around the same age or at least the same size they stood no taller than her waist but these were not toddling babies their fully developed features suggested maturity beyond their size and from the downy fluff on cheeks and limbs they were clearly related to the inhabitants on the other island but rather than being naked the children wore matching blue jumpers how old are they lorna whispered choked by shock from sixteen months to two years malik answered as she stepped farther into the room one child turned toward her then the others all swung to face her it reminded her of the synchronization witnessed on the camera like a flock of birds startled into sudden flight or a school of fish turning on a dime she remembered maliks term a hivelike intelligence was that the source of this behavior she knew flocking was still poorly understood some scientists wondered if there might not be some electromagnetic connection between birds in a flock or fish in a school to get them to act so perfectly in unison but the latest consensus seemed to suggest that each individual was responding to microsignals from its neighbors and responding in a preprogrammed fashion looking at the behavior here lorna wondered if it might not be a combination of both the faces eventually swung back to the screen as a new song began to play on the television theyre innocents bennett said kept isolated here from any corruption bonding only among their own kind malik nodded were monitoring their iq scores with nonverbal tests and watching for any signs of aggression so far their iq levels are rising every week and theyve demonstrated no aggression but that might be too early to judge aggression really only manifested after puberty with the others still were hopeful what are you going to do with them lorna asked fearful of the answer as fast as they mature well be collecting eggs from the older females in another six months theyll be nearing sexual maturity by then lorna went cold contemplating such a violation of these little ones from those eggs were going to attempt to destroy the active sections of junk dna that seems to be triggering these throwbacks to try to breed it out of the next generation malik rubbed his hands as if anxious to proceed were so close to a breakthrough that could change the world bennett nodded thats why we could use your help malik concurred your expertise with the breeding of exotic animals and handling genetic material is perfectly suited to aid us in the last leg of our work the subtext was plain it was an offer she couldnt refuse not if she wanted to live but how could she agree these were not exotic animals close to extinction in fact they werent animals at all one of the children a little girl wandered from her beanbag and lifted her arms up in a universal gesture lorna leaned down and picked her up the child was heavier than she expected thicker boned but her tiny hand lifted and the girl began to suckle a thumb her small head settled to lornas shoulder while bright eyes followed the alphabet lesson on the television brought to you by the letter w lorna could feel the child visibly relaxing a slight tremble in her small body quieted with each breath lorna sensed the deprivation of these children the lack of warm contact it raised a question in her mind she glanced to malik what happened to this childs mother to all their parents malik sought to assuage her youve seen them theyre housed at the habitat when we populated the other island we separated the youngest specimens here weve built this nursery with copper wiring in the walls to confine this groups neural network to this handful of rooms to isolate them from contamination while their brains are still pliable lorna pictured the violence caught on video of one of the hominids attacking a guard by maliks own admission these werent dumb animals though they didnt have the power of speech they were plainly highly intelligent communicating among themselves in ways no one could fully understand she began to suspect the reason for such an attack for such savagery she was carrying it in her arms maternal instinct was strong in most animals in a communal setting that instinct would be magnified the loss of each child would be felt by the whole such abuse could drive them into a maddened state combine that with heightened intelligencegrowing every week according to malikthe danger posed by the compounds inhabitants would intensify no wonder the security measures were so strict heaven help anyone who set foot over there five minutes after hitting the beach jack led his team through a grove of pines he had quickly sought higher ground but continued to parallel the beach as he circled toward the land bridge in his head he kept his position by fixing the suns position the angle and direction of shadows still he wanted to getter a better lay of the land spying a limestone outcropping that might suit his need he lifted a fist mack and bruce dropped into shadows to either side rifles fixed to their shoulders jack clambered up the rocky boulder sunlight dappled its surface for the first time he had a good view across the island all the way to the cove on the western side he noted a white speck out there it trailed black smoke against the setting sun he hoped randy and the thibodeauxs had enough smoke canisters to maintain their ruse he turned his attention to the immediate landscape below he spotted the spit of sand connecting this island to the other a glint of steel concerned him it looked like some barricade split the bridge the structure hadnt been on any of his satellite maps but the surveys had been old and the detail poor he frowned at the barricade but knew he had no other recourse he would face that challenge when he reached it still its presence nagged at him why construct a barricade between the two islands frustrated he backed to the edge of the boulder intending to hop downwhen a stuttering spat of rifle fire erupted exceptionally loud from his perch he spotted a flock of doves explode out of the forest taking flight halfway between his post and the bridge he crouched expecting the foliage to shred around him believing hed been spotted but a moment later the rifle fire turned into bloody screams they rang out brightly through the air then the screaming cut off with a note of finality silence followed as if the forest were holding its breath jack slipped off the boulder and back down into the shadows keeping as quiet as possible a cold certainty set in he pictured the barricade something else shared this small island with them he didnt know what that might be but he knew one thing for sure he was on the wrong side of that fence chapter duncan leaned his fists on the curved desk of the monitoring station the security nest had been built into a bunker in the hillside it offered immediate access both to the villa and to the subterranean lab behind him bulletproof windows offered a sweeping view of the cove and the foundering fishing charter as it limped within a pall of smoke into their waters it was not his most immediate concern the gun battery atop the villa kept the boat under a tight watch instead his attention remained fixed to the dark screen he listened to the static in his earpiece straining for any sign of his scouting party the horrific screams over the radio still echoed in his ears he couldnt tell how many throats issued those cries were any of his men still alive play the tape again duncan said the technician seated at the desk manipulated a toggle and the dark screen fuzzed with a blur of brightnessthen stopped on a crisp image of a freshwater spring bubbling out of the side of a forested hillside camera a had been positioned near the islands sole watering hole it was one of twelve cameras posted at key positions areas that offered the best vantage for observing the test subjects daily routine duncans team had managed to install the new unit the image wobbled as the camera was quickly positioned and secured he caught a glimpse of an arm waved in front of the camera testing its function then the hand jerked back and one of his men sprinted past the camera his rifle was on his shoulder his cheek pressed tightly to the stock though there was no sound transmitted over the camera feed the gun rattled and smoked as it was fired then the man disappeared out of view a moment later the image cracked and went black duncan straightened taking in a sharp deep breath it was more than his mens fate that worried him he stared across the remaining eleven cameras they displayed various views of the island a crude latrine a rocky ledge a shallow cave and three cameras alone focused on the main village habitat it all looked peaceful except there was not a single sign of any of the inhabitants their conspicuous absence left only one conclusion they know about the video cameras he mumbled all of them his mind worried on that implication so then why only take out one camera the answer was simple enough the bastards had set a trap intended to lure men to the site but why to exact revenge he didnt think so the act was too calculated too purposeful he pictured again the rattle of the assault rifle another possibility asserted itself and grew more certain as he considered it the broken camera was not meant to lure menbut weapons duncan shifted to a computer monitor it displayed a map of the island tiny red dots moved in real time across the screen they represented the tracking tags of the fourteen apemen and the twentythree other specimens but none of those tags had come near the spring at the time of the attack as he stared at the screen he noted several of the tags remained fixed in place some in the village huts two in the cave the rest in the jungle duncan reached out and counted the number of immobile tags twelve thirteen fourteen the same number as the apemen that couldnt be a coincidence there could be only one other explanation theyve removed their tags he said aloud sir the technician jolted and pointed to the live feed from one of the cameras youd better see this duncan joined him at the monitor the screen displayed a view of a jungle clearing as he stared he saw nothing at first then a shift of shadows at the edge of the glade drew his eye shapes crept through the forest two maybe three he squinted were they the missing inhabitants then one of the shadows slipped into a dappling of sunlight the figure wore trousers a camouflage jacket and carried an assault rifle at first he thought it might be one of his men still alive but the gear was wrong duncan knew all of the men who had crossed the bridge into that hellish place this wasnt one of them someone else was over there he weighed the possibilities ever since the trouble in haiti raiders had been growing bolder in the region could that be who they were on the monitor the mysterious party disappeared into the jungle what do you want done the technician asked duncan turned to the computer monitor the chaotic motion of the red blips had stopped as he stared they began to move again all of themconverging toward the trespassers like a tightening noose his lips thinned with grim satisfaction the fools had picked the wrong island to land on sir keep monitoring duncan said this problem should take care of itself in a few moments but it didnt address another worry how the hell did a raiding party get onto that other island in the first place duncan swung to the arc of windows overlooking the sea the smoking boat continued to limp into their cove that had to be the answer hed heard of birds that would fake a broken wing to lure a cat away from a nest the same was going on here the distressed ship had been used to draw their attention to get them to drop their guard anger stoked to a burn deep in his chest time to grind that bird under a heel call up the gunner in the bunker duncan ordered still staring down at the cove tell him to open fire on that boat chapter jack sensed them before he saw them he lifted a fist to stop his teammates over the course of the trek hed grown attuned to the forest the hushed whisper of a sea breeze through pine needles the briny scent of loam and salt the pattern of shadow and sunlight then suddenly a change a quiet crackling rose from the woods all around like a smoldering fire sweeping down on them off the wind his nose picked up a distinctly musky smell a flock of small swallows burst through the branches to the left something was out there and closing in jack lowered to a wary crouch and swung up his remington he preferred to hunt with a shotgun in woodland conditions in such tight quarters the scattering punch of a shotgun served better than the precision of a rifle mack and bruce took up positions to either side they kept their backs toward each other weapons pointed out jack searched the shadows the rustling went immediately quiet as if a switch had been thrown he waited it would be easy to attribute the noises to an overactive imagination except that overripe odor remained on the breeze a prickling spread down the back of jacks neck he felt eyes upon themmany eyes studying him as intensely as he watched the forest as he strained all his senses his headache flared and his vision tunneled for a moment a strange static filled his skull as if his body were a radio tuner straining for a signal then a cracking of branches exploded to the right for some reason he knew to glance up a shadow passed overhead and fell heavily down toward jack and his men they had to scatter out of the way it struck the ground in the center of their group blood splattered in all directions jack stared disgusted and stunned a headless corpse lay on the ground the arms had been ripped off at the sockets leaving only a torso and legs blood continued to ooze from the wounds what the hell he noted the black khaki camouflage uniform it was the same gear as the assault team that had attacked acres he turned his attention back toward the shadowy forest the woods remained dead quiet so silent he could hear the waves washing the beach off in the distance the static in his head dulled to a low humbut as he strained with every sense on fire the buzz slowly grew in volume here they come jack whispered to his men lorna continued to carry the female child in her arms while sesame street played on the dayrooms television so you think last nights attack was an attempt to reach the young ones here bennett asked lorna shrugged why else would they attack this island you said they have plenty of food water and shelter so why swim over during the night and ambush a guard on the beach you may be right malik said but that doesnt explain the hyperaggression displayed before we relocated the adults to the other island this cant be all about the young ones both men turned to her they focused a bit too intensely as if expecting a solution from her some insight into their problem she knew if she failed to impress them failed to prove her usefulness her days on the island would come to a swift end these bouts of aggression she started you said that the attacks came without provocation malik nodded thats right last year an adult specimen was calmly completing an iq test when suddenly he whipped around and mauled the technician monitoring the test the specimen was of course killed in order to weed out the troublemakers and nothing provoked that attack not that we could judge what about procedures done elsewhere in your labs specifically painful tests malik rubbed his chin in thought we do examinations all the time i still dont understand your point she again pictured the strange flocking behavior she had witnessed earlier you said these specimens share a hive mentality that thoughts are spread across their magnetic network so why not pain too in other words what one feels they all might feel if thats the case if you provoke one specimen an entirely different one might lash out in a reflexive reaction bennett stared at malik had you considered that possibility no but its an intriguing angle the researchers eyes narrowed with contemplation but he looked unconvinced ill have to review the records lorna pressed you have to stop thinking of them as individuals there is only one intelligence out there spread fractally among the group they are a single psyche stretched across multiple minds and for years youve been abusing that psyche torturing it on multiple fronts she stared at malik waiting for him to object to her assessment of his cruelty his silence spoke volumes she continued under such prolonged and sustained abuse is it any surprise you began to see psychotic breaks but youve been tackling this the wrong way trying to weed out this problem by culling only the violent ones these breaks arent arising from individuals in the group theyre coming from the whole from the hive mind that youve abused to the point of psychosis bennett and malik shared a worried look so youre suggesting the entire hive mind out there might be psychotic malik said his voice cracking with disappointment driven insane maybe even worse what do you mean worse bennett asked if what dr malik described is true about their iqs the entity youve created out there isnt just insanebut brilliantly insane beyond our comprehension beyond rehabilitation pure rage and madness coupled with cunning and guile she shook her head youve created a monster jack stared down the length of his shotgun at the woods his skull felt as if it were on fire the corpse behind him reeked of blood and bowel why had they tossed it at jacks group as a threat a distraction then why didnt they just attack as he studied the forest he sensed them on all sides jack and his men were surrounded trapped he again considered the corpse his mind working fast why throw it here then he suddenly knew he glanced over to the body remembering the rattle of automatic fire it sounded like it had come from more than one gun whatever was out there had dispatched the trained soldiers as easily as swatting flies if they wanted to take out jacks team they could do so just as easily but instead they threw the body here and he knew why as a message jack called to mack and bruce lower your weapons to demonstrate he dropped his shotgun from his shoulder held it at arms length and crouched to set it on the ground are you nuts sir mack asked do it if you want to live mack grumbled under his breath but obeyed jack knew the corpse was tossed here as a warning to show that their lives were forfeit if they didnt surrender he also sensed that whatever shared this island knew jacks team was different from the commandos as the weapons were dropped shadows shifted and a shape slipped into view much closer than jack had suspected only a couple of meters others stirred out there too some larger some smaller jack mack hissed at him stand down he warned mack complied but he was not happy about it the shape moved closer at first jack thought it was a large chimpanzee or a small gorilla but as it stepped into the sunlight it walked upright like a man no shambling or knuckle dragging it cocked its head as it came forward jack noted an ear was missing leaving a long jagged scar down one side this was no surgical wound but one lost in combat as it stepped closer yet again its flattened nostrils flared as it took in jacks scent naked the creature was covered in furand blood though smaller by a couple of feet its body was heavyboned and layered with muscles jack suspected the creature could rip him apart with its bare hands but for the moment there was an uneasy truce large shining eyes stared at him jack noted the intelligence there but there was no warmth no welcome those eyes remained as cold as a winter star jacks blood settled into the pit of his stomach as another realization struck him he remembered lornas description of genetic throwbacks he knew what faced him was not any animalbut was once a man another of the creatures his face knotted in a snarl of threat appeared behind the first he carried a lightweight assault rifle likely confiscated from the dead body behind jack to the left a blackfurred tiger shoved into view lips rippled back to reveal fangs as long as daggers all their gazes fixed on jack the combined focus set his head to aching his skull bones to vibrating he had to resist pressing his palms against his ears the first creature came forward until he stood directly in front of jack he leaned closer and sniffed at his clothes hands reached up and gripped jacks shirt fingers dug in and the arms jerked wide ripping open his shirt buttons went flying with jacks chest and belly bared he felt exposed and vulnerable the bandages that lorna had dressed over his wounds stood out starkly against his naked skin hands reached again and tore those away too taking with it some hair and a bit of scabbing jack winced but made no move to shove the other away fresh blood dribbled down his stomach to the left mack swore under his breath his hands still in the air on the right bruce remained in a fixed crouch a pack of small wolves faced his teammates jack saw bruces eyes dart toward the weapon on the ground dont jack warned between clenched teeth bruce obeyed but his gaze remained fixed on the rifle ready to leap at the first provocation jack couldnt let that happen the manbeast before jack cocked his head and leaned close sniffing at the trails of blood down his chest taking in long deep breaths his small head then tilted back eyes slightly closed as if tipping that scent deep inside him over the creatures head jack noted the others doing the same even the cats eyes slipped to halfmast as if taking in his scent for a moment a rich smell of blood filled his own nostrils almost overpowering in its intensity then it was gone the examiners face rose before him hands gripped his shoulders and dragged him down until jack was nose to nose with the beastly form jack smelled its fetid body noted each eyelash heard the rasp of its breath fingers remained clamped on his shoulders he felt the raw muscular power in that grip but it was the eyes that held jacks full attention pupils dilated as jack stared it was like peering down into a dark well he sensed that the abyss had no bottombut it was far from empty something strange stared back out at him the static in his head ratcheted up to a volume that threatened to crack his skull it felt like his brain was trying to squeeze out his ears as he rode a wave of agony his sight suddenly narrowed until he seemed to be hanging over that bottomless abyss he was trapped there for a breaththen the beast shoved him away and jack stumbled back into a tree the pressure in his skull receded to a dull throb the creature turned and headed away the other beasts swung like one body and vanished back into the forest jack remained standing trembling what the hell just happened the beast who had confronted him glanced back before disappearing cold eyes stared at him then down to the shotgun at his feet the message was clear mack stumbled over to jack what now boss he crouched and retrieved his weapon we go with them what bruce asked aghast theyll tear us to pieces jack knew his teammates warning was not without merit for the moment he had passed some test of fire here what that test was he didnt knowand passing it scared him as much as it relieved him but he was also under no delusion this was no warm welcome they simply shared a common enemy nothing more he remembered the coldness in that attention and knew that the uneasy truce would last only as long as this war after that it would end lets go jack said they hadnt taken more than a couple of steps when a rattling roar rose from the other island jack rushed forward to a break in the hillside forest through the branches he got his first view of the villa on the other island from a concrete bunker atop it the black snout of a massive gun smoked and chattered but it wasnt aimed toward them it fired toward the cove still hidden out of sight behind the shoulder of the other island but he could guess the target of that savage barrage the thibodeauxs boat chapter duncan stood before the arc of windows in the security nest overhead the gun battery blasted away from its bunker the chugging roar of the chainfed autocannon rattled the bulletproof windows down below rounds chewed across the water toward the smoking boat in the cove at the first sign of trouble the fishing charter had opened throttle and shot toward the beach its bow lifted high pushed out of the water by some powerful engines more than expected from an ordinary fishing boat this observation was further supported when the first rounds of the cannon pinged harmlessly off the sides of the boat the crafts hull had to be reinforced with armor plating gunrunners and smugglers often disguised assault craft as ordinary fishing boats the villas cannon could pierce light armor even bring down slowflying aircraft but distance and angle fought against them then something strange happened from the stern end of the fishing charter a zodiac raft dropped into the water it shot away like a black rocket riding two pontoons the bushmaster cannon found its main target again and rattled the bow of the fishing boat the armored craft heaved to the side skidding sideways through the water exposing its flanks while protecting the smaller raft rounds ricocheted off the hullthen moved higher toward the bridge glass shattered from the ships windows men flattened themselves to the deck out in the water the zodiac hightailed it toward the northern edge of the cove it bounced across the waves as guards along the beach opened fire return shots sparked from the raft accompanied by the smoking trail of a rocketpropelled grenade it struck the beach and exploded throwing sand high and shredding a palm tree as guards scattered from the beach the pontoon boat continued its flight across the waters looking like it was trying to circle out and head toward the sandy spit that connected the two islands before duncan could assess that threat a greater concern arose a man popping into view atop the bridge of the fishing charter balanced a long weapon on one shoulder he knelt down and angled the black tube of a rocket launcher toward the villa motherfuck duncan twisted away from the window as smoke blasted out the back of the weapon a rocket roared straight at himor rather at the gun battery above him either way he didnt want to be here he dove toward the door lorna stood frozen with malik and bennett in the nursery ward the child in her arms clung to the collar of her blouse and trembled violently as gunfire rattledthen a gutpunching blast boomed down to them muffled by rock the explosion still shook the walls everybody held their breath then the first child began crying in seconds it spread like wildfire among the children a daycare workera roundbellied chinese womantried in vain to console the group but they refused to calm down the girl in lornas arms buried her tiny face and continued to tremble were under attack malik said stay here bennett moved toward the door but before he could take two steps it banged open connor burst into the room and crossed quickly toward them sir are you okay whats going on commander kent radioed down the boat in the cove opened fire on us believes theyre pirates pirates lorna tried to fathom such a thing she had heard stories from kyle about roving bands of marauders who plied the gulf waters and hijacked ships at sea or ransacked homes along the coasts even an oil rig in the gulf had once been attacked bennett continued toward the door take me to duncan he said i should keep everyone here bullshit im not some child to hide in a hole malik joined his boss if theres a problem i need to get back to my lab secure our viral samples in case this problem escalates if we lose those samples weve lost everything bennett nodded do it malik waved to the daycare worker in the room come with me ill need a hand connor made a halfhearted attempt to block them sir bennett strongarmed the guard out of the way and reached the exit keep dr polk here he glanced back to her well continue our discussion as soon as this fire is stamped out malik followed his boss connor stood for a moment then cursed and stomped off after them he didnt even glance back as he secured the door and left lorna alone with the door sealed the rattle of the raging firefight muffled to a dull popping still she could tell it had begun to escalate alarm bells joined the cacophony along with distant muffled screams what was going on she didnt know but her mind fought for some way to turn this chaos to her advantage if she could break out reach a radio maybe even a boat but what then even if she could get off the island what hope was there to escape through pirateinfested waters as she held the child the others drew toward her like moths to a flame needing reassurance growing quiet she had to protect them but was there another way out of here with her heart pounding she hurried to an open door at the rear of the nursery she popped her head through seeking some means of escape rows of raised cribs lined both sides of a long narrow room only these cradles were made of steel and had lids that locked despite the danger anger stoked inside her how could anyone be this callous with these innocent children large moist eyes stared at her tracking her as she searched the rooms alone now she no longer had to mask her emotions fear turned to fury she used it allowed it to spread like a fire through her belly she had wilted under panic once beforebut never again these bastards had stolen everything from her her life her brother her friends even jack this last thought sapped some of her will if jack could not stop them what hope was there for her she searched the remainder of her confinement other than a small lavatory and bathroom there was no other exit from the dormitory she was trapped here they all were not knowing what else to do she returned to the center of the room the children gathered around her some clung to her legs others sucked thumbs a few softly sobbed she settled to the floor with them a small boy climbed into her lap joining the girl the two clung to each other the pair reminded her of the conjoined capuchin monkeys back at the lab but she knew these twothe entire group in factwere merged at a level beyond mere flesh more children nestled around her every pop and rattle of gunfire trembled through the group like a pebble dropped into a pond she did her best to reassure them she reached out and touched each one where contact was made they seemed to relax caramelbrown eyes shone at her tiny fingers clung to her to each other they smelled warmly of baby powder and sour milk despite her fear and physical discomfort a trickle of peace spread through her she couldnt say where it originated from herself from the children it didnt matter the peace inside her was not one of slothful contentment but of determined resolve a steadying of her keel as panic drained certainty grew well get out of here she promised as much for her benefit as the children we all will but how duncans head still rang from the rocket impact blood trickled from one ear and down his neck moments before the blast he had run out of the security nest and dove into the limestone tunnel that connected the command bunker to the villa he had managed to slam the door behind him as the rocket struck the gun battery in the upper bunker still the concussion had blown the door off its hinges and tossed him down the tunnel with his eyes burning he fought through the smoke and back into the security nest glass crackled underfoot half the windows overlooking the bay had shattered into the room he found the technician in a pool of blood on the floor duncan checked for a pulse but failed to find one he crossed to one of the broken windows the chatter of automatic weapons echoed up to him punctuated by grenade blasts he spotted the fishing charter in the harbor half obscured by smoke the firefight continued to rage between the boat and the beach it was a hellish barrage tracer rounds flashed through the growing smoke screams rang out still he sensed the fishing boat was playing a game of distraction maintaining a holding pattern out there rather than launching a full frontal assault but why duncan turned to the nest of monitors most were dark but a few flickered with grainy images movement on one drew his eye he shifted closer the screen showed the fence between the two islands also something new the black zodiac raft from earlier had beached itself nearby a stray round must have shredded one of the pontoons deflating it the boat wasnt going anywhere now the pirates were lucky to have made it as far as the beachand luckier still to have missed the flechette mines buried in the seabed alongside the land bridge closer to the camera five men huddled by the fence nearby two bodies lay on the sand in a growing pool of blood from the black camouflage jackets the dead bodies were duncans men anger curled his fingers into fists who the hell were these raiders one of the attackers shifted closer to the hidden camera he momentarily turned his face into full view shaded by a ball cap a jolt of recognition shot through duncan that ball cap hed seen it before and its owner out on the bayou road the cajun in the chevy truck duncan struggled to comprehend how that man could be here it made no sense hed watched the truck dump into the mississippi even if the man had survived the river why was he here how had he tracked duncan to lost eden cay answers slowly sifted through his shock the cajun had mentioned something about a brother being at acres that was why the bastard had been on the road so late why he had stopped to ask for directions if that bastard was here now that meant someone else probably survived the assault on the lab duncan realized he still hadnt heard from the soldier he had left behind to canvass the area and clean it up had he been captured forced to talk duncan knew better than that his men would never talk regardless these bastards had found the island they would live to regret that as his initial shock faded duncan digested this information he watched the cajun tilt his ball cap and stare across the fencerow toward the other island as if expecting company duncan remembered the armed figures caught on camera earlier clearly this team was attempting to rendezvous with the other to join forces for a surgical strike to sneak in the back door while the firefight raged out front but what was their end goal it wasnt a difficult question this had all the earmarks of a rescue operation duncan unclipped his radio and called up his secondincommand connor sir his second spoke rapidly bennett is headed up i couldnt stop him duncan didnt care what about the woman ive got her holed up in the nursery shes not going anywhere not good enough go in there he ordered put a bullet in her head chapter lorna sat with the children as muffled gunfire continued trapped here she had to bide her time she didnt know which side of the firefight she should be rooting for the devil she knew or the pirates who were attacking suddenly all of the children went tense and glanced toward the dayrooms main door as if responding to a signal beyond her senses they were all on their feet at once rising like a startled flock of crows their manner set her on edge their tension contagious a loud bang drew lornas attention to the exit she recognized it as the outer anteroom door slamming shut someone was coming the children retreated toward the back she got caught in the flow of them and followed or maybe she was dragged small hands clutched her pant legs and drew her with them they reached the dark room with its rows of locking cribs as they passed the threshold lorna caught a glimpse of the inner anteroom door swinging open but she didnt see who entered as she ducked away the apprehension of the children continued to keep her heart pounding her senses sharp a voice called out where the hell are you it was connor something in his voice pushed her heart into her throat along with exasperation she heard a distinct threat the children continued to draw her away as if they sensed the same tapping into some empathic connection lorna held her breath and continued with them but there was nowhere to hide in the nursery not unless she wanted to cram herself into one of the cribs at last the tide of bodies reached the center of the room and fingers released her the children scattered in all directions moving with surprising speed obeying a cue beyond her they ducked behind and under the heavy steel cribs lorna followed their example seeking what shelter she could she dropped to a knee behind a crib but kept an eye on the doorway a couple of children hid under the crib with her they shifted their tiny bodies next to her trembling with fear connor crossed past the doors threshold and headed to check on the bathroom first she saw his hand drop to a holstered pistol at his waist his thumb broke the snap securing the gun dont make this any more difficult than necessary he shouted come out and ill make this quick and painless she remained where she was it was all she could do there was nowhere else to run jack moved through the forest heading down the hillside toward the sandbar that connected the two islands mack and bruce continued to flank him farther out and ahead he caught glimpses of shadowy shapes some small some large a living mass flowing downhill gathering momentum and growing in number all headed toward the sandbar at last the forest broke apart into a scatter of palms and stretches of sand light shone brighter here glinting sharply off the water as the sun sat on the horizon a figure detached from the shadows ahead it was the creature who had confronted jack earlier distinguishable by his missing ear and scarred face an arm pointed toward the open beach jack shifted forward and joined him he immediately recognized the source of the creatures distress a tall fence wrapped in concertina wire blocked the way ahead jack noted a generator on the far side electrified he wagered movement drew his attention beyond the fence to the other island only now did he note the raft beached over there figures hid in the shadows on the far sidebut were they friend or foe there was only one way to find out as he stepped into the open he noted smears of crimson across the sand on that side like bodies had been dragged away the plan of attack had been for randy to rendezvous at the land bridge the zodiac looked like the one from the thibodeauxs boat but it had been shot up had anyone survived jack moved from shadow into sunlight exposing himself he kept his weapon at his shoulder wary ready to leap back a call shouted at him jack randy stumbled into view across the way waving a rifle over his head jack lowered his own weapon thank god his relief was shortlived a growling roar rose to the right a small twoman jet boat tore around the shoulder of the island and shot toward the land bridge the soldier in the passenger seat stood with an assault rifle balanced on the windshield the muzzle flashed and rounds chewed across the sand toward jacks toes he fled back into the shelter of the forest across the fence randy did the same as jack ducked away a second jet boat roared in from the other direction joining its partner the two boatsone on each side of the land bridgesped back and forth sweeping a tight patrol making it impossible to pass as jack stared at the two sharks out there he felt his plan falling apart someone already knew about this attempted backdoor assault they were dropping the ax cutting off access splitting their teams the element of surprise was now gone that thought raised a new fear lornas survival depended on a speedy extraction delay meant death his fingers tightened on his shotgun was he already too late lorna stayed hidden behind the crib fear sharpened her breathing she heard connor bang open the door to the bathroom off the dayroom searching for her it wouldnt be long until he came to check in the nursery as she struggled for some recourse a squeal suddenly erupted out in the dayroom bright with terror connor cursed harshly fucking monkeys her heart clenched the bastard must have found one of the children hiding out there the squeal turned into a cry of pain beyond the doorway connor appeared again he held aloft a small boy by his neck the child struggled and strangled legs kicking his mouth frozen open in a cry of pain and panic lorna felt the two children clutched to her side tremble violently sharing the boys terror and pain out in the dayroom connor pointed his pistol at the boys belly come out now or ill make this monkey suffer for you stunned by such cruelty lorna was too shocked to react connor shifted out of view still searching for her now or never lorna couldnt let the boy die for her she had to stop this even if it meant her own life she began to push upbut small hands gripped hers and held her down there was an urgency to their attention beyond mere fear of being abandoned they moved her hand to the legs of the raised crib she felt casters at the bottom wheels to help rearrange the cradles as necessary it took her a moment to understand she flipped the locks on the casters and moved to the back of the crib pushing with her legs she shouldered into it it took some effort to get it moving constructed of steelmore a cage on wheelsthe crib was heavy and unwieldy wheels squeaked but she called out to cover the noise im coming dont shoot she dug in with her toes and maneuvered the crib out of its line and got it wheeling down the center of the room toward the door she fought for more speed as if sensing her need small bodies crawled out of hiding and hurried to the crib hands grabbed the steel legs and helped her push with surprising strength a part of lornas mind struggled to understand on her own she would never have thought to use the crib as a battering ram but fear was a powerful motivator and necessity the mother of all invention run all that through the combined intellect of the frightened children and this means of defense arose as they worked together the crib sped even faster connor appeared again facing the nursery door lorna shot out of the room with her battering ram pushing with all her strength a prayer frozen on her lips connors eyes widened in surprise unable to get out of the way he tossed the boy aside and fired wildly at her she ducked as rounds ricocheted off the cribs steel front then the battering ram struck connor square in the chest his body went flying arms wide he landed on his back and his pistol skittered across the linoleum floor lorna didnt stop she rammed the crib forward keeping its momentum going and smashed it into connor yet again as the front casters hit his sprawled body she heaved up and sent the crib crashing down on top of him she dove to the side and retrieved his pistol it felt heavy and hot but the weight helped center her she kept it pointed at connor but he wasnt moving except for a twitch in one arm she searched around it took her a moment to realize she was freeand armed the children gathered to one side eyes wide upon her she read the hope there along with the residual fear she couldnt abandon them lets go she said and headed toward the door the children flocked behind her trusting her fully she prayed it wasnt misplaced chapter whats your plan from here bennett asked good question duncan thought he shook his head still calculating struggling to wrap his mind around the strange nature of this assault he felt control slipping away from him duncan stood with bennett in front of the bank of monitors in the security nest someone had thrown a blanket over the dead technicians body another computer expert was attempting to bring up the other feeds on the monitor in front of them duncan continued to watch video from the camera posted between the islands two jet boats were patrolling either side of the land bridge duncan had ordered the boats into position after spotting the cajun from the bayou it was lucky he did moments ago he had watched a figure appear on the opposite side of the fence stepping from the forest onto the spit of sand the impossibility of it still jarred him from the clothing and gear it had to be one of the men hed spotted earlier in the forest somehow the man had survived his overland route to reach the land bridge how was that even possible an answer came as the computer technician slid out from beneath the console he wiped his hands as he stood up the computer should reboot the tracking software in a moment as promised a neighboring dark screen went blue then a map of the other island pixelated into view give it a second to start picking up the tracking signatures the tech added as they watched small red blips began to blink into existence as each tracking tag came online marking the location of each animal over there more and more bloomed on screen duncan swore bennett glanced to him then back to the computer monitor that cant be good rather than their usual random distribution around the islands landmarks all of the blips clustered at the base of the land bridge the entire menagerie had converged there duncan could only think of one reason why theyre going to try to break through the barrier and you dont know who that stranger is bennett asked the one out there with them no and the mans survival confounded him but hes got to be working with that group from the zodiac i wager this is all a private attempt to rescue dr polk it was the only thing that made sense duncan had already explained to bennett about the cajun in the ball cap if they had any real government backing duncan continued thered be a stronger response warships and helicopters in some ways i think this is just a fishing expedition to see if dr polk is still alive but who knows how long that will last a government response could already be mustering what do you recommend a scorchedearth policy bennetts eyes widened he glanced to duncan for clarification if these bastards know about lost eden cay others will too weve lost control were now too exposed we have to accept that reality and deal with it aggressively how aggressively we evacuate burn both islands to the bedrock kill everyone still out there leave no trace with no trail back to us we can start again somewhere else itll be a setback but we wont be dead in the water bennett sighed with a note of resignation he turned to the blasted windows that overlooked the cove and mumbled so the lord god banished him from the garden of eden duncan pressed him sir another sigh followed i see your point we dont have any choice after all the problems here a clean start might be good malik is already securing the last of our viral samples and all his records we can be ready and at the helipad in fifteen minutes better make that ten duncan warned what about dr polk ive already taken care of that problem bennett looked resigned but hed get over it duncan was paid big money to make the hard decisions and carry them out whats the immediate plan of action bennett asked changing the subject duncan nodded to the video feed to close that back door to make sure we have no more surprises during our evacuation i have a team headed down to ambush the group from the zodiac the bastards will be pinned down against the fence and the jet boats what about the other side duncan stared at the cluster of red blips on the computer monitor it was time to put an end to maliks failed experiment to raze it to the ground as a precaution hed seeded the entire island with napalm charges over a hundred the resulting firestorm would destroy all life in a matter of minutes and anyone who tried to escape would be picked off by the sharpshooters in the jet boats reaching to a pocket duncan removed a radio transmitter hed taken it from his office safe before coming up here two buttons glowed on the unit one was tuned to the buried charges on the other island the second would ignite a pair of massive bombs built into the infrastructure of the villa one in the upper building the other in the subterranean lab with the blast equivalent to fortyfour tons of tnt the bombs would blow the top off the island literally wiping it from the map but that would have to wait he flipped the trigger guard over the first button bennett gaped at the transmitter what youre blowing up the other island now no time like the present duncan pressed the button that takes care of one problem chapter jack felt the tremble under his feet then the blast hit him sounding like the earth cracking behind him he swung around to watch the top of the island blow away in a spiral of smoke and fire more charges blew in a series boom boom boom eruptions of flames chased around the island in a descending spiral adding to the hellish maelstrom the firestorm continued to blast its way toward the beach a tower of black smoke climbed into the sky jack smelled the distinct odor of napalm theyre torching the place mack shoved next to him he had to yell to be heard above the continuing detonations what now bruce took matters into his own hands it was death to remain in the forest the only escape lay across the land bridge the man dove out onto the open strand staying low he blasted away at one of the jet boats but the vehicles never stopped moving swerving and spinning chaotically making for nearimpossible targets rounds that reached them merely pinged off their reinforced hulls return fire peppered the shore sand exploded around brucethen a round hit his shoulder and spun him blood spraying crap a shift in winds blew hot smoke over their position the stink of napalm burned jacks lungs with no choice he sprinted out of hiding toward bruce his teammate was down on one knee bruce shifted his weapon to his good shoulder and continued to fire mack flanked jack shooting at the other jet boat behind them the firestorm swept toward the beach each boom sounded closer across the land bridge randys group laid down a suppressive salvo too recognizing the danger jacks team was facing but they made no headway pinned down as they were from both sides the stretch of sand was impossible to cross theyd be mowed down before they could even reach the fence jack grabbed bruce ready to haul him back but back to where as he turned a charge detonated only a handful of yards into the forest trees blew high in a column of flame the blast knocked jack onto his back scorching across him his vision narrowed to a tunnel he choked on smoke mack barreled into him and rolled him into the waters edge as gunfire ripped across the sand nearly taking his head off half in the water jack recognized the hard truth there was no escape from the security nest duncan watched the napalm charges blast along the top of the island and spiral down toward the beach razing to ash all in their fiery path in engineering the demolition he had timed the charges to blow in sequence to ensure maximum incineration he smiled as he watched the trio of men struggle in the sandtrapped between flames and gunfire they were doomed bennett stood at his shoulder but he took a step back hed seen enough dear god god had nothing to do with this the charges continued to explode into whirlwinds of flame one after the other adding to the conflagration spreading relentlessly toward the water as he lorded over the destruction with a deep sense of satisfaction he noted movement in the forest figures darted into view from their naked shapes they had to be his missing inhabitants his smile grew harder apparently the forest had grown too hot even for them but theyd find no salvation out in the open still something about their manner jangled a warning there were only four of them so where were the others he leaned closer what were they up to still seated in the water half dazed jack noted movement at the edge of the smoky forest four figures stepped into the open they split into pairs and headed to either side each pair hauled a sling of woven palm fronds between them the slings were weighted down with black metal canisters that looked like small pony kegs each pair swung their slings and tossed their cargoes high into the air the canisters toppled end over end one toward each jet boat as they flew the entire bestial force burst out of the forest and onto the bridge men and women massively muscled cats vicious packs of wolfish dogs some creatures jack couldnt recognize one giant loped past him knuckling on pairs of curved razorsharp claws others followed streaming past behind the force the last of the napalm charges reached the beach and exploded in a wall of flames jack rolled into the water to keep from burning twisting he watched one of the flying canisters fall toward the jet boat the nimble craft sped clear but accuracy wasnt necessary the canister exploded in midair jack heard a matching blast behind him fiery napalm washed over the sea and flooded the jet boat men screamed as they became living torches jack swung around to discover the other boat burning too impressed jack sat up in the water the creatures must have dug up two of the napalm charges near the beach waited until the timed series of blasts got close enough then flung the bombs so theyd blow on cue but not all of that dark army escaped unscathed lagging behind the others a tiger burst out of the blasted forest its body was on fire trailing flames as it ran blind and enraged it flew straight at jack he dove under its claws coming close to getting eviscerated the fiery cat splashed deeper into the shallowsthen the water exploded under it the cats bulk got tossed high shredded apart within a column of seawater and blood a sting burned jacks left arm a slivered blade protruded from his biceps he recognized the shrapnel a flechette the bastards had mined the waters too jack yanked out the sliver and hobbled to his feet weaving and unsteady they had to keep moving with an open furnace burning behind him jack crossed to his teammates the back of macks jacket was a charred ruin bruces left arm dripped blood but they were alive jack pointed after the bestial pack gunfire erupted there coming from the trio of assault weapons they carried electricity sparked from the fencethen the gate fell open at last the way was open duncan went cold as he watched the dark army flood across the land bridge he could not believe what hed just witnessed the bastards had taken out his men with his own napalm charges half awed half horrified duncan watched as one of the apemen raised an assault rifle and fired at the camera the monitor went black duncan turned to bennett the older man had gone pale as a ghost theres no stopping them makes no difference duncan assured him theyll find no refuge here we stick to our plan by the time they force their way through our lines well be long gone what do you mean duncan picked up his transmitter from the table one button had gone dark but another still glowed waiting to explode the massive bombs buried here ill set the villa to blow in half an hour duncan said that should give you time to collect malik and get to the helipad ive already alerted the pilot he should have the rotors spinning by the time you get to the hilltop the older man still looked stunned but he was no wilting flower bennetts gaze focused again he nodded do it duncan lifted the transmitter he set the timer for thirty minutes then flipped up the trigger guard with his finger hovering over the button he stared again at bennett one last chance as answer bennett swung toward the door and headed out satisfied duncan pressed the button there was no turning back now bennett stopped at the door what about you are we holding the chopper for you no im going to make for the seaplane duncan had one last issue to address through the blasted window the firefight between the fishing charter and the beach continuedbut it had devolved into furious spats he couldnt risk the boat escaping the coming detonation it was time for this war to go airborne what about the rest of the islands personnel bennett asked duncan was glad the two were alone at the moment he needed all his forces to remain here until the last moment to keep the beasts at bay long enough for them to make a clean escape bennett continued to stare at him waiting for an answer he gave it to him we can always hire more men chapter lorna ushered the last of the children through the anteroom that separated the nursery from the main lab complex it acted like an air lock requiring three trips to get all of the children through scared while separated the children required constant consoling and reassurance she understood their acute distress according to malik the nursery area was shielded with copper wiring in the walls to insulate the nascent intelligence from contamination so each time she left a group outside in the hallway and went into the nursery to fetch the next set the hive bond between them was momentarily broken severed by the copper shielding she could only imagine the terror if half her brain were suddenly cut away she eventually got them all back together united in the hallway they clustered even more tightly needing contact both physical and mental still they dared not linger any longer than necessary lorna removed the pistol from the waist of her pants she had to find her way back to the main lab then from there to the villa hush now stay with me she headed down the hall with the children in tow wary of the new surroundings they moved as if on ice unsure of their footing not trusting it would support them some of them had probably never been outside the nursery still the group traveled in silence as if sensing the danger she traced her way back as best she could recall the nursery was buried in the deepest level of the lab complexto further shield the children with natural rock but also to limit access only to those with the highest clearance she was grateful for that with the war going on no one seemed to be here at last she reached a familiar set of steps she held up a hand for the children to wait at the foot of the stairs while she investigated moving as silently as possible she crept up the steps to the landing above the passage at the top ran straight past the surgical suite where lorna had first seen one of the hominids at the end of the hall should be the main lab muffled voices reached her her fingers tightened on the pistol how many were in the lab if it was lightly manned she might be able to force her way through at gunpoint she would have to try the only way to reach the villa and escape was through maliks lab no matter the circumstances she had to move fast she waved the children up to her hurry now the group scurried up the steps and poured into the hall with herbut something went wrong the first boy up the stairs suddenly winced and clapped his hands over his ears then the others froze too she knelt among them whats wrong the children remained in frozen postures of pain and fear she didnt have time for this she had to get them moving bending down she scooped a small girl out of the group and stood up rather than melting into her like before the girl remained a hard knot in lornas arms she had no time to discern the source of their distress she crossed down the hall with the girl the others followed but a low whine escaped them like steam from an overheated kettle hands remained clamped to ears what was bothering them out in the woods randy held his brother at arms length christ jack youre as hot as a streetcar in july and you look half dead no i take that back you look fullon dead jack didnt argue his vision remained pinched his head throbbed with every ragged beat of his heart but more disturbing was that both of his hands had gone strangely numb but at least hed reached the main island and with allies too as strange as they may be whats wrong with them kyle asked lornas brother stood a step away with one of the thibodeaux brothers tbob had come with randy while peeyot remained on the fishing charter kyle clutched his cast against his chest it had been wrapped in duct tape to keep it dry and he carried a sig sauer pistol in his other fist from the way he held it he was familiar with the weapon two other menblack cajun cousins of the thibodeauxsalso hid in the forest the pair shouldered shotguns and had hand axes tied to their belts all eyes focused on the beasts hidden in the shadows with them why did they all just stop like that kyle pressed jack stared around the sun had sunk into the horizon leaving the woods dark firelight from the burning island behind them flickered into the edge of the forest dancing shadows all about still he could easily pick out the one he had come to mentally call scar the apparent leader of this dark army the normally animated figure had frozen in placeas had all of them man and beast moments ago jack and randys teams had joined forces in the woods after dealing with the initial shock from randys men jack had wanted to keep moving to maintain the momentum of their overland assault but the entire dark army had simply stopped in their tracks frozen in various positions scar stood with his head cocked as if he were listening to a song only he could hear the same seemed to be true of the others before jack could fathom what was going on scar suddenly turned to him studied him with those cold black eyes then without any signal his entire group set off again before leaving scar acknowledged one other a fellow manbeast a onearmed figure who was scarred even worse than their leader he looked older and most of his disfigurements were linear suggesting the scars came from surgical experiments jack also noted a saucer of metal strapped to his chest like some thick crude shield scar touched the others shoulder they gazed at each otherthen the onearmed figure turned and ran off into the jungle in a different direction without any other explanation scar continued up the wooded slope beasts both small and large spread out in a wide swath covering the hillside four cats flanked to either side a phalanx of wolfdogs led the way and the giant slothlike creature loped to one side jack also noted for the first time a trio of black foxes the size of dobermans these last moved so swiftly they seemed more shadow than substance the trio vanished into the woods along with the beasts a dozen of scars men and women kept pace carrying crude weapons spears cudgels stone axes three of them also bore automatic weapons jack followed behind the group trusting they knew the way better than he did but that path would not be easy theyd traveled less than thirty yards up the hill when a barrage of gunfire shredded the forest ahead the muzzle flashes lit up the shadows tracer rounds speared through the dark woods an ambush bodies got cut down near the front torn nearly in half a round burned past jacks ear he dropped to a knee taking shelter behind the trunk of a tree a step away kyle tackled randy to the groundand not a moment too soon a grazing round tagged the bill of his ball cap and flipped it off his head randy cursed as kyle rolled off him but it wasnt directed at lornas brother that was my favorite hat ill buy you a new one if youll just shut the hell up kyle said randy glanced over to the kid as if truly sizing him up for the first time more rounds tore over their heads the pair crabbed sideways to a rocky outcropping and took shelter there together jack had lost sight of mack and bruce but a raking spat of return fire from nearby suggested they were okay jack lifted his own shotgun ready to charge up the hill then the screaming started indifferent to their own safety the dark army hadnt slowed they used the dead bodies of those in front as bloody shields and overran the snipers positions even more disturbing was the eerie silence of their attack gunfire escalated taking on a panicked note a rock came rolling and bouncing down the slope as it passed jacks position he was horrified to see it was a helmeted head then as suddenly as it all started it was over the army flowed onward drawing jack and his group in its wake keep going he called out stay with them they moved up through the slaughterhouse blood turned the ground to mud some soldiers still lived a few attempted to crawl away missing legs dragging entrails a frightened soldier leaned against a tree half his face gone he pointed a pistol at them and kept squeezing the trigger but he was out of bullets they hurried past him after a minute jack began to stumble and trip his legs full of lead his breathing grew ragged and hot but rather than growing numb to his surroundings his senses remained strangely sharp he smelled the sweet dampness of a flower he brushed against he heard the crunching snap of pine needles underfoot even the twilight forest seemed too bright to his eyes then after another ten yards the villa appeared ahead they took up wary positions at the edge of the woods and jack studied their target with all of its lower windows sealed behind steel shutters the villa looked like a fortress under siege a bunker near the top was a blasted ruin teak furniture on the open patios had been chopped to kindling by machinegun fire from the thibodeauxs boat scar suddenly appeared next to jack they eyed each other again jack felt like his skull was splitting in two scar reached to jack and gripped his forearm the gesture seemed like both a thankyou and a threat jack understood theyd both reached their goal after this final assault all bets were off chapter lorna kept the children lined along one side of the hallway she edged up to the set of swinging doors that led into the main lab room voices reached her how much time is left lorna recognized maliks accent she also heard the panic in his voice she used the tip of her pistol to ease open the door and peek through bennett stepped across her view his back to her he kept his voice low less than twenty minutes so hurry up malik stood by a bank of computers he was shoving hard drives into a metal suitcase a portable dewar flask for transporting cryogenic samples stood next to it what about the rest of my team the doctor asked expendable bennett said his voice pained thats why i sent everyone out we keep this evacuation on a needtoknow basis lorna struggled to understand why were they leaving why this sudden urgency she attempted to fold this new reality into her plans of escape could she somehow use this to her advantage bennett checked his watch pack up everything and lets move malik snapped his briefcase shut passed it to bennett then grabbed the cryogenic bottle from the tabletop we have to get these viral samples into a secure lab within twelve hours or risk losing everything understood well make arrangements en route they turned and headed toward a far door but it was not the one leading into the villa an emergency exit sign glowed over the doorway where did it lead as if hearing her question malik asked the tunnel to the helipad is it secure its out of the direct line of fire and the pilot is armed lorna stayed hidden for the first time since her arrival here hope bubbled through her theres another way out if she maintained a safe distance and followed them out this back door she could take the children into hiding in the woods and wait for this war to end but her luck wasnt holding a harsh voice barked behind her she turned to find a stick figure of a man standing by the entrance to the surgical suite she recognized the technician edward the one who had drawn her blood injected her with hormones she also recognized the rifle pointed at her what are you doing here he called out loudly he eyed the kids and kicked the closest one drop your pistol and move into the lab lorna had no choice she let the pistol clatter to the floor the children came rushing up to her she backed through the swinging doors into the main lab she turned to find malik and bennett stopped and staring at her dr polk bennett said his voice full of surprise suspiciously so lorna noted a flinch of guilt pass over his features maliks eyes widened upon seeing the clutch of children sticking close to her legs what luck bennett glanced to him i could use a couple of these specimens the doctor explained theyd be perfect seeds for the new facility lornas stomach sank toward her feet shed delivered them straight into the hands of the monster edward pushed into the room behind her he had confiscated her pistol and pointed it at her he took in the scene with a glance the briefcase the dewar flask his eyes flicked up to the emergency exit sign where are you going he asked malik took a step forward crouching slightly with a hand on his hip he eyed the remaining children as if trying to pick out a ripe melon i wont lie to you edward you deserve at least my honesty the island is going to blow up in about seventeen minutes edward stumbled forward the tip of the pistol wavered with his shock what lorna felt equally stunned she now understood their furtive urgency dont worry malik said your work wont be in vain edward swung his pistol toward the two men take me with you im afraid thats not possible no room especially now we need these specimens malik straightened from his crouch a tiny pearlhandled pistol had appeared in his hand as if by magic he pointed it at edwards face and fired the shot was loud stinging her ears edward fell backward tipping like an axed tree even bennett gasped at the coldblooded murder malik turned to his boss but he kept his pistol aimed at lorna we could each take one specimen a breeding pair would trim at least a year off our new startup bennett checked his watch knowing he had no time to argue he growled pick which ones and lets go his gaze briefly brushed across lornas the guilt that had flickered before now shone steadily lorna suspected he normally kept himself above such dirty work purposely diverted his eyes from the bloody reality of this project but such innocence was no longer possible the same couldnt be said of malik working in the trenches from the start he was covered in blood up to his elbows im afraid well have to leave you here dr polk youll have your freedom forhe checked his own watchanother fifteen minutes malik bent down and grabbed a boy by the arm and dragged him into the air carrying him like a sack of groceries well need a female too take that one he pointed his pistol bennett bent down and gently scooped the child in one arm his gaze fixed to lorna im sorry as they backed away a massive explosion ripped through the space the blast lifted her off her feet and tossed her backward she slid across the floor a flaming book tumbled past her nose trailing ash more debris blasted into the space she fought to raise up to an elbow children had been blown to the far wall bennett and malik lay sprawled facedown lorna searched around for a weapon edwards body had rolled against a table there was no sign of her pistol but his rifle was still tangled over his shoulder if she could reach it but malik was already pushing up off the floor bennett heaved over to his back he had sheltered the girl with his body and still clung to her lorna began to sidle toward the riflewhen something massive bounded out of the fiery doorway and landed in a crouch she stared in disbelief at the monstrous tiger the beast roared black tongue curled exposing sabersharp fangs malik scuttled away like a crab bennett froze in place only yards from the monster lorna recognized the tiger from the video feed on the other island the psychotic bunch must have broken free of their prisonand plainly had come for revenge she now understood why bennetts group was blowing this place to kingdom come more shapes piled in behind the first pouring out from the short tunnel that connected to the villa flames and smoke obscured their shapes but some walked upright on two legs off to the side malik had backed to the emergency exit he had somehow kept hold of the dewar cryogenic flask he hugged it to his chest and dove out into the tunnel bennett was trapped pinned down by the monstrous army one of the hominids came forward he was missing an ear and his face was massively scarred lorna recognized him from the video feed he had been the one with the pregnant female the one bennett had named eve that would make him adam she thought he came at bennett with a long spear the man didnt bother to move or struggle there was nothing he could do then the children suddenly rushed forward moving like a flock of starlings protecting a nest they piled on top of bennett joining the girl in his arms and shielding his body with their own adam stood over them more hominids appeared behind him through the doorway a heavily muscled shape bulled into the room knuckling on claws a giant sloth theyd gone extinct ages ago the genetic throwback settled to its haunches fur along one flank had been burned to the skin and still smoked its large eyes scanned the room then joined the others in staring down at the knot of children bennett finally sat up as confused as lorna at the behavior of the children the young ones continued to stand between the monsters and the man all their small eyes locked gazes with the elders a silent negotiation seemed to be under way then voices echoed from the demolished doorway half deafened by the blast she couldnt make out the words only that it sounded like english another figure stepped through the smoke on two legs only it wasnt a hominid lorna choked on her shock at the impossibility of it she struggled to her feet jack chapter relief welled through jack as he heard his name called out he blinked tears from his stinging eyes and stumbled farther inside the room it looked like some mad scientists workshop flaming debris dotted the floor and curled smoke into the room jack squinted strainingthen spotted a figure rising from the floor lorna he rushed toward her she came at him reaching her he crushed her in his arms he took her scent deep into his chest her heartbeat pounded against his ribs her cheek tender and soft nestled against his neck he needed to make sure she was real and not a feverish delusion he clung harder to her but she broke the embrace too soon fighting him in desperation her face stared up wideeyed and full of worry with his shirt ripped open she placed a hand against his bare chest her palm was ice against his skin youre burning up he took her hand down and clasped her fingers just a fever flu doesnt matter she didnt look convinced but for the moment she had a larger fear her fingers tightened on his hands jack the island theyve planted bombs here set to blow in another ten minutes or so he tensed picturing the exploding napalm charges so it wasnt just the one island the bastards were cleaning house and burning all bridges behind them we have to get off this island she said he took her by the hand and led her back toward the door but more of scars forces had piled into the room blocking the way out jack stepped forward and confronted him he had to get the message across we must go he waved an arm toward the door now scar ignored him his gaze remained fixed upon a cluster of children standing in the room the brood stared straight back at him in a silent war of wills jack didnt have time for this he stepped between scar and the children finally the mans eyes snapped angrily in jacks direction agony ripped into jacks skull gasping he blacked out and fell to his knees fleeting images flashed through his head a spray of blood a flash of a scalpel a cinch of leather straps a splay of a dissected body with each image came a bolt of pain then he felt his body tugged to the side the pressure in his head popped and drained away his vision returned lorna knelt beside him are you okay jack touched his forehead expecting to feel shattered bone i think so he looked up scar had returned the full brunt of his black attention upon the group of kids jack recognized a hard truth whatever truce had existed between them before had ended he turned to lorna theyre not going to let us go malik wheezed as he ran up the last of the steps a doorway opened ahead brighter than the dark tunnel as he fled toward his salvation he clutched the cryogenic jar tightly to his chest after saddam firebombed and bleached the original source this was the last of the virus supply with it i can start again with or without bennett from this frozen seed whole armies could be born and it didnt matter who financed his work there would always be governments willing to pay the price if not the united states then another country and as a free agent he could command any price reaching the tunnels end he ducked through to the outside the sun had set but the western skies still glowed a deep orange the helipad sat atop the highest point of the hilltop a circle of asphalt painted like a yellow bullseye held back the forest he sprinted toward it along a crushed stone path even from here he heard the low drone of the helicopters engine as he topped the rise he spotted the rotors spinning he reached the asphalt and called for the pilot a man in a flight jacket stood on the far side staring down at the beach he flicked away a cigarette with a flash of ash turned and crossed briskly to the chopper malik met him at the open door wheres mr bennett the pilot asked malik put on his best face of concern and regret dead caught in an ambush the pilot glanced toward the tunnel as if wagering if he should confirm the story malik made an overly grand motion of checking his watch were down to less than ten minutes we either go now or never with a concerned glance at his own wrist the pilot finally nodded load up i want to put some distance between us and that blast malik climbed into the backseat while the pilot settled behind the stick in seconds the engine roared and the blades cut faster through the air with a lurch of his stomach the skids lifted off the asphalt simply breaking physical contact with the island calmed maliks hammering heart he cradled the frozen prize in his lap and stared out the window trees dropped away under him the expanse of the sea spread wide with all the promise of the world he allowed a smile to form the pilot called back shouting to be heard whats that smell malik didnt know what he was talking about he sniffed deeply fearing a gas leak or maybe smoke they didnt have time for a maintenance check what are you carrying the pilot yelled smells like an animal took a dump back there brought to his attention malik finally noted a rank smell he had failed to distinguish it earlier too accustomed to the odor he smelled it all the time down in the labs it got into your clothes hair even your pores he sniffed at his shirt it was freshly laundered as he lifted his head the odor grew stronger it wasnt coming off him fear swamped over him he swung around to the small storage space behind his seat his heart pounded as he peered over the edge of the seat a bestial face stared back at him with a savage leer the creature had crammed itself into the tight space it must have climbed aboard when the pilot was out smoking malik noted the old surgical scarsbut also the diskshaped object strapped to its chest a flechette mine a year ago duncan had tested the blast effect on a male specimen who had dared to punch one of his men malik had seen the body afterward all the flesh had been shredded off the boneand according to duncan the specimen had lived for a full minute afterward horror filled him no malik begged please as the creature smiled coldly a hand lifted to the center of the mine and pressed the trigger lorna heard a distant explosion at first she feared it was the island blowing up but nothing worse transpired we should have at least eight minutes she estimated but what were they going to do with those last minutes standing with jack she continued to watch the silent war being waged between the children and their elders she didnt understand it but she suspected the two intelligencesone nascent and pure the other tortured and brokenfought for dominance or maybe it was something less brutal a probing for compatibility having grown apart maybe a merger wasnt even possible what would it be like to experience this reunion to see your children again but be unable to connect at that deeper level finally some impasse broke one of the children reached and took hold of bennetts hand the older man stared down at the small form his face was bloody his nose broken when he hit the floor moving with that strange flocklike synchronization the children suddenly stepped forward and openly confronted the larger mass of beasts and men the young ones looked unnaturally calm joining hands in a web that lorna knew went beyond flesh lorna helped jack to his feet as the mass of children brushed up to her a small girl extended a tiny hand lorna took it but she kept a grip on jacks fingers too taking a cue from the children lorna allowed herself to be led toward the army massed at the door the one she named adam stood his ground then a child in the leadthe tiniest boy from the looks of himreached out toward the scarred figure adam looked down a mix of grief and agony played across his face instead of taking that hand he danced back as if fearing the boys touch but for whose safety his own or the childrens following adams example the wall of beasts parted and opened a path out of the room they were being let go or maybe cast out either way the tiny boy took the lead and the children headed out drawing bennett lorna and jack with them within a few steps lorna found herself back in the villas study it seemed like days since she had last passed through here more of the beasts took refuge here but they allowed the group to pass unmolested moving on lorna spotted a group of men farther down the hall one of them broke away and ran toward her lorna she could not believe it kyle after seeing jack she had hoped her brother might still be alive but she had been afraid to ask fearing the answer kyle shoved jack aside to hug her dont ever do that again she wasnt sure exactly what that was but she nodded i promise over kyles shoulder she watched jack cross to his own brother he spoke rapidly gesturing randy stiffened twisted around and headed off with the others toward the front door one of the men already had a radio at his lips jack returned to them stepping quickly tbob is radioing for more pontoon boats theyll meet us at the beach well have to hurry if were going to outrun the explosion explosion kyle asked rather than explaining jack swung away as he turned he lost his balance she reached for him but he tilted and crashed headlong to the floor jack she rushed to him dropping to her knees she had known something was wrong while holding hands jack had been trembling quaking with what appeared to be microseizures she already feared the worst kyle helped turn him over through his burning skin she felt tremors rising up growing worse his muscles quivered and spasmed his eyes had rolled back into his head whatever last reserve he had been riding had finally given out she laid a palm on his cheek with her touch his eyes snapped back into view they focused weakly on her his lips moved she leaned closer to hear his breath brushed her ear his words were few toms gone she pulled back at first not understanding this reference to his younger brother then she saw something in jacks eyes something that perhaps had always been there something she had tried best not to see dismissing her own feelings as echoes of another boy another love toms gone a tear rolled down from the corner of his eyelid he had wanted to get this out before it was too late perhaps to say even more jack but he was already gone his eyes glazed as his body lifted up in a backbreaking arc his limbs contorted into a fullblown seizure lorna sprawled on top of him help hold him down kyle grabbed his head two men ran up in gear that matched jacks what can we do the larger of the two asked bennett answered from two steps away nothing his eyes met hers across jacks quaking body ive seen it before too many times hes infected lorna had suspected the same when she first hugged jack she remembered maliks description of the protein found in the blood and saliva of the genetically altered animals how it selfreplicated crossed the bloodbrain barrier and burned through the cerebral cortex like a wildfire theres no hope bennett said she wasnt going to accept that she stood up and pointed an arm toward the door get him to the boats what are you going to do kyle asked lorna turned and headed back toward the labs bennett called over to her no one ever survived lorna ran back through the gauntlet of beasts bennett was wrong someone had survived chapter under a pall of black anger duncan hiked toward the isolated deepwater cove a boathouse sat over the water and a rocky quay ran out to the moored seaplane a small cessna workhorse the setting sun had turned the cove to hammered bronze far from the fighting the peace of this small oasis calmed him helped him put his thoughts and plans in order he carried a backpack filled with cash and gold coins that hed taken from bennetts safe hed planned on safeguarding it until they were all back in the states but those plans had swiftly changed as he had trekked over the ridge from the main cove to this smaller one he had watched bennetts helicopter take off from the hilltop satisfied that all was secure duncan had continued downthen seconds later a resounding blast had echoed over the island he had turned in time to see the chopper tip on its nose stirring up a cloud of smoke debris rained down trailing fire then the helicopter plummeted in a death spiral and crashed back to the hilltop the site continued to glow like a warning beacon in the night duncan understood that fiery message it was over bennett and malik should have been aboard that flight along with all hope for restarting the babylon project he didnt know why the chopper blew a grenade another rocket or just an unlucky spray of bullets it didnt matter duncan took the new reality in stride he was a survivor and had the scars to prove it with over a hundred grand in cash and gold on his back hed start over he had originally planned to use the seaplane to bomb the fishing charter he even had a satchel bomb slung over his shoulder as he reached the rocky shore he let it drop abandoning it it no longer mattered if the other boat escaped the coming detonation he would be long gone before any word reached the outside world all that concerned him now was getting the hell off this rock he crossed toward the stone quay picking up his pace he still had five minutes plenty of time to fly out of the cove and beyond the blast radius but he didnt want to cut it too close he reached the stone jetty and hurried down it but as he neared the boathouse something raised the hairs on his neck he stopped as if knowing the trap had been sensed a sleek shape stalked from behind the boathouse it stood as tall as his waist black fur bristled down its back ending at a bushy tail orangered eyes glowed at him duncan recognized it as one of the giant foxes from the other island black ghosts one of his men had named them he reached to his belt and pulled out his pistol refusing to give in to panic he aimed and fired but the monster lived up to its nickname and flowed to the side rounds sparked off the stone duncan backed away but there was no safety in that direction the island was about to blow he stopped his brain urged him to run at the beast emptying the clip at it he had to reach the seaplane but his heart quailed against running at the carnivorous beast sweat beaded and his hands grew slick he had no choice duncan steadied his pistol with both hands arms straight out bunching his legs he sprinted straight at the monster he squeezed the trigger again and again some rounds missed but a few struck home a front leg shattered under a bullet lurching the beast to the side another round blasted through its left ear yet another struck it square in the chest the beast toppled over on its side he didnt stop firing he emptied his clip into it duncan continued at full sprint ready to hurdle the body from there it was only steps to the seaplane then something heavy struck him from behind and sent him crashing headlong into the stones he took the brunt of the fall on his shoulder by turning at the last moment a large shadow bounded past him another of the foxes he immediately understood their hunting strategy the first fox had been a decoy allowing the other to take him down from behind he stared at his attacker as it loped and turned toward him duncan discarded the one clip and slapped in another but he had learned his lesson he remembered there had been three foxes on the other island he whipped around and found the last fox standing directly behind him eyes shining it lunged before he could fire it bit into his wrist bones crunched the pistol dropped from his fingers duncan punched with his free arm but the beast had latched on hard the second fox joined the attack running up and snapping like a bear trap onto his leg the two monsters then backed in opposite directions stretching him like a wishbone his shoulder and hip joints screamed as the ligaments in the sockets tore they were trying to tear him apart again he was wrong a shadow loomed next to him it was the third fox still alive it limped on its three good legs blood flowed from the gunshot wounds he realized the tugofwar was not meant to tear his limbs off but to hold him steady the third fox snarled baring sharp teeth as long as fingers no it dove into his exposed belly teeth ripped through clothes skin and muscle then burrowed deeper he felt teeth inside him they were going to eat him alive but yet again he was wrong the fox backed away withdrawing its muzzle soaked in blood but the beast hadnt come out without a prize it retreated stepbystep dragging out a loop of intestine relentlessly gutting him agony and terror welled up duncan finally understood the truth there was a horror beyond his worst nightmare the foxes hadnt come to eat him theyd come to play chapter lorna burst out of the villa and sprinted across the patio toward the expanse of beach she had found what she needed in the lab behind her the strange army of beasts followed as if drawn by her urgency she spotted the others at the waters edge two zodiac rafts floated in the shallows children were being loaded into the boats while jacks two teammates hauled his limp form was he still alive she ran faster knowing time was running out as she reached the edge of the beach something snagged her wrist and hauled her around to stop all that kept her on her feet was the viselike grip on her arm the scarred male hominid had hold of her she tried to yank her arm away but his grip was iron he twisted her around she was ready to scream for helpwhen a shape stepped from behind a flowering bush it was another of the hominids the female her breasts were huge her belly still big only she carried an infant in her arms now a newborn from the look of it she had swaddled it in a banana leaf it was eves child the woman had given birth the female came to her and held out her baby lorna shook her head not understanding eve came closer pushing the baby into her arms no the male shoved lorna roughly from behind eves eyes pleaded with her lorna finally raised her arms and took the child eve turned and hid her face in her mates chest he waved lorna toward the beach toward the boats they wanted her to take the child she backed a step shifted the tiny baby under one arm she motioned to them come with us her plea fell on deaf ears the pair retreated together back toward the forest the other beasts followed lorna stumbled after them its not safe come with me the male turned and snarled at her making it plain the discussion was over eve glanced back before vanishing into the shadows tears flowed down her face but lorna also read the peace in her expression there would be no changing their minds lorna kyle had spotted her and waved hurry up with no choice lorna cradled the child to her bosom and ran for the rafts kyle waited and helped her through the shallows he frowned at her burden is that a baby lorna ignored him she waded over to jacks boat half the children were there along with bennett she passed the child up to the older man as she climbed into the boat with them bennett lifted a questioning eyebrow eves child she explained bennetts eyes widened as he glanced down at the baby the other children gathered closer the zodiacs pilot gunned the outboard engine and tore away from the beach the other raft followed the water in the cove was as smooth as glass the boats took advantage and gathered speed shooting across the surface the fishing charter had already begun steaming away and had almost cleared the cove lorna turned to jacks sprawled body the larger of his two companions sat with his slack form in the bottom of the boat hes still breathing the man growled for now she placed a hand on jacks shoulder even through his clothes she felt the feverish heat of his body he continued to quake under her touch locked in a continual seizure it was burning him up before she could get a better assessment of his condition a rumbling shook across the still waters of the cove hang on the pilot yelled lorna turned as the villa blew apart shattering outward in a massive explosion most of it vaporizing into a thick black column of smoke the column pushed high into the sky glowing at the core with hellish fires a hot wind washed over them as they raced away but it wasnt over a secondary blast erupted even stronger than the first the entire top of the hill blew off this time shoving the smoky column higher curling it into a fiery mushroom cloud debris pounded into the water some boulders as large as minivans but the two rafts had fled far enough away all that reached them was a large swell it picked up their boat and sped them even faster out to sea lorna continued to stare as the island burned she finally turned to the pilot fearing for jack she had never taken her hand off him i need to get him over to that ship what she intended was too dangerous to attempt here she prayed it wasnt already too late bennett stared over at her what are you going to do with him like i said no ones ever survived duncan did bennett was taken aback by her statement lorna needed to talk it through you said he was attacked back in iraq by one of the earlier incarnations of these altered forms but he survived so what made him different bennett shook his head you told me duncans injuries were so severe that he spent a week in a coma thats the difference this deadly protein hyperexcites the brain so the only way a brain could protect itself during such an assault was to turn itself off until the infection ran its course i think thats why duncan never got sick bennett frowned then what are you going to do with jack lorna took a deep breath and stared over at the larger boat stating it aloud made it seem insane but she had to face it she turned to jack and answered bennetts question im going to send him into a medically induced coma chapter youre going to do what to my brother randys voice cracked with disbelief lorna followed jacks body down into the ships hold mack carried him in his arms his other teammate was receiving first aid for a bullet wound the captain had offered lorna the use of his cabin randy dogged her steps as jacks only kin here she had confided in him he had a right to know but from his terrified expression maybe such honesty wasnt appreciated im going to drug him lorna said send him into a coma and keep him there until a medevac helicopter arrives the ship had already radioed for help but it would take hours for anyone to reach them jack would be dead by then she had confirmed the prognosis with bennett once the seizures started patients died within the hour it had to be attempted randy reached to his forehead as if looking to adjust a ball cap that wasnt there his eyes shone with worry kyle followed behind him my sister knows what shes doing randy turned on him shes a vet and a darned good one they reached the captains cabin mack manhandled jack inside out in the hall lorna turned to them randy you should stay out here i promise ill do everything i can to save him randy faced her balanced between fury and fear he lunged at her she took a startled step back but he only grabbed her in a bear hug take care of my little brother he whispered in her ear biting back tears he straightened i know theres bad blood between our families but jack trusts you so i do too lorna nodded kyle took randys shoulder wanna beer while we wait randy sagged nodded and turned with kyle back toward the stairs lorna joined mack in the captains cabin the big man had jack sprawled across the bed need a hand he asked i could use the company she said smiling wanly not wanting to be alone he sank to the bed beside jacks head she placed the drug bottle down on the bedside table it was labeled sodium thiopental she had taken it from the maliks surgical supplies it was a common anesthetic used in animals and considering maliks research she knew the lab would have a supply but she intended to do more than just anesthetize jack with it for years thiopental had also been used by medical doctors to send patients into an induced coma though the drug propofol was employed more commonly today thiopental was still useful in cases of brain trauma or swelling the drug triggered a marked decrease in neuronal activity which was the effect lorna needed most right now jacks brain was on overdrive she had to turn that engine off working quickly she prepped jacks arm and established a tourniquet ready she picked up a syringe that she had preloaded with the thiopental she met macks gaze over his body you can do this he said swallowing back her fear she inserted the needle aspirated blood to make sure she had a good stick then released the tourniquet slowly she pushed the plunger and sent the man she was growing to love into a coma half an hour later lorna stood on the stern deck of the ship mack continued to watch over jack she had needed to get some air at least for a minute her body trembled with exhaustion and stress standing by the rail she took deep breaths and stared out at the dark sea stars glistened overhead but the moon had not yet risen the scratch of a match made her jump she turned and found bennett seated on a deck chair lost in her own thoughts she had failed to see him in the dark he brought the match to his pipe the tobacco glowed ruddily as he puffed it to life he stood up and joined her hows he doing lorna sighed i dont know his fevers dropped the anesthetic has quieted his spasms but i dont know if hes still even in there hes been seizing for a long time bennett exhaled a stream of smoke youre doing all you can do they stood quietly for a long moment she needed to change the subject hows the baby sleeping we found some formula the captains wife has a fourmonthold lucky for that bennett turned to her eves baby is a little girl by the way how about the rest of the children theyre all sleeping in there with her i think they recognize one of their own and want to welcome her into the fold or maybe its just plain childish curiosity hard to say silence stretched again but bennett was full of questions why do you think eve gave her up he asked lorna had pondered the same question she couldnt say for sure but she could guess i think its the same reason they let us go or rather let the children go what do you mean the babys pure its neural net is still infantile i think back at the villa the older ones recognized that the children were equally uncorrupted in that moment of confrontation the two hive minds met one was pure and innocent while the other had been tortured into psychosis i think the older hive mind recognized that the younger ones were lost to them that they could only offer poison and pain she remembered the agony and grief in adam when one of the little ones had offered his hand so they did the only thing they could she said as a final gift and sacrifice they let them go what about afterward do you think they knew they were going to be killed she pictured eves last expression it had been full of peace and acceptance i think they did bennett spent a long introspective moment with his pipe he finally got around to the true question that had been troubling him why did they protect me it doesnt make sense the monsters were going to kill me you may know that answer better than i he stared at her tears glinted in his eyes he needed some direction she didnt know if he deserved it but she took her example from the kids they protected me too she said though they cant bond to us as intimately as they can with each other i think they possess a strong sense of empathy they sensed something in you worth saving but what could that be all that i did all that i turned a blind eye to and sometimes not even a blind eye he shook his head i dont know i cant read your heart but maybe they recognized the possibility of redemption in you and amid all that bloodshed they couldnt let it be destroyed bennett turned from her he covered his face with his hands his shoulders shook what have i done he sobbed softly thats just it its not what you did but what you have yet to do as those words passed her lips she took them to heart herself for so long shed let her past define her to isolate her to keep her trapped in a limbo of her own guilt no longer jacks last words came back to her toms gone it was time for her to truly see that to act on it she prayed she still had the chance chapter the uptown campus of tulane university rose amid clusters of turnofthecentury mansions magnoliashaded parks and college housing complexes it was only a short ride on the st charles streetcar from lornas garden district home still for the past three days she seldom left the neurology department on the fourth floor of the tulane medical center she paced the hall outside the room anxious for the neurologist to finish his exam jack had been airlifted here from the thibodeauxs fishing boat lorna had gone with him during that flight explaining to the doctors about his treatment she glossed over many details but was honest about his condition half the hospital departments had been through jacks room once here he had been switched to a propofol infusion to maintain his coma his eeg was monitored around the clock and his body was hooked to a battery of equipment but today was critical the doctors had been weaning him off the infusion all morning slowly allowing him to wake while closely monitoring his eeg for any sign of continuing seizure activity so far so good but a bigger question remained what was left of jack the neurologist seemed confident that there was no permanent brain damage but after such an injury he could make no guarantees jack could remain in a vegetative state or fully recover but the doctor had warned that the more likely result was somewhere in between so they waited randy sat down the hall with jacks mother and father kyle had gone down to the cafeteria to fetch them all more coffee none of them had slept in the trenches these past days they had all grown closer during their vigil lorna had finally shared the whole story of that night with tom of the loss of her baby the attempted rape jacks rescue and its tragic conclusion once she started it had poured out of her there had been many tears on all sides but in the end just as much healing you were just a child his mother had said taking her hand you poor thing such a burden to bear all these years the door to the room finally swung open and a cluster of white coats and nurses flowed out the neurologist came over lorna tried to read some clue from his face jacks family joined her weve taken him off the infusion the doctor explained with a sigh but were going to maintain a lowdose benzodiazepine drip as he wakes well also be monitoring his eeg and vitals can we sit with him lorna asked the doctor frowned at the large group one at a time he admonished them with a finger and not for too long lorna turned to the family jacks mother patted her arm you go on in dear youre family now too besides if my boy wakes he should see a pretty face first lorna wanted to argue but she allowed herself this moment of selfishness she hugged jacks mother then hurried through the door inside a nurse stood by a bank of monitoring equipment lorna crossed and sat on a bedside chair she had spent the night in that same seat holding jacks hand talking to him praying she stared over at his pale face she watched his chest rise and fall lines and tubes ran from under his sheets to machines that beeped and blinked she leaned forward and took his hand jack his hand twitchedcausing her heart to jump but was it in recognition or were the seizures starting again fearful hopeful she stood up still grasping his hand she leaned over him and stared down his chest rose heavily then he sighed loudly his lids fluttered open but his eyes remained rolled back jack she whispered down at him she placed her other palm on his cheek please he blinked slowlyonce twicethen she found him staring back up at her hey he whispered groggily she squeezed his hand hey yourself a ghost of a smile shadowed his lips they just stared at each other his eyes seemed to drink her in then his fingers tightened on hers with surprising strength his expression became a mask of regret what i said before he said hoarsely his voice raw with exhaustion and maybe something more she stopped him she understood the guilt buried in those two words toms gone it had haunted both their lives but it was time to free that ghost she leaned down brushed her lips against his and whispered into his breath but were here chapter three months later jack was speeding down the waterway in his cousins airboat the wind whipped his hair his only companion burt sat in the bow his tongue lolling his ears flapping jack guided the craft with deft ease and a light touch on the stick he sat high in the pilots chair the height allowed him to see over rushes reeds and bushes it felt good to get away from the city from the station house he was also tired of needles rehabilitation appointments and psychological tests besides a residual numbness in his left hand and the need to take a lowdose anticonvulsant tablet once a day he had fully recovered still the best therapy of all could be found out here as the midday sun glared off the water he took a deep breath of the rich bayou air heavy and humid redolent with brackish water yet sweetened by sedges and summer flowers as he raced deeper into the swamplands he again appreciated the stark and primeval beauty of these wide and trackless lands he watched whitetailed deer bound away from the roar of his boats propellers alligators slipped deeper into nests raccoons and squirrels skittered up trees rounding a bend he slowed the airboat and let the engine die he needed a private moment to collect himself he let the boat gently rock as he listened to the life around him some considered the swamps to be a desolate and quiet place that couldnt be further from the truth he closed his eyes taking in the buzz of gnats the chorus of frogs the distant bark of a bull gator and woven throughout it all birdsong from hundreds of warbling throats after the events of last spring jack took moments like this to stop and appreciate the wonders around him it was as if he had new eyes in fact all his senses seemed sharper not because of any residual effect from his illness but simply because of his renewed appreciation for life this particular moment was especially significant for him his life was about to change in ways he couldnt imagine and he needed to prepare for it but he also sensed the pressure of time lorna was waiting for himsecretly summoned out here under mysterious circumstancesand he dared not keep her waiting any longer than necessary she still had much work to do over at acres as the new facility was under construction better get going he said to burt his hound thumped his tail in agreement taking a final deep breath jack started up the airboats engine and shot down the waterways and channels it was a maze through here but he knew the way by heart skirting around an island he reached a channel that ran straight toward a large log home newly rebuilt after the fires he flew straight for the pier then at the last moment angled the craft broadside and raked the bow to a perfect stop alongside the dock a familiar round shape dressed in coveralls and an lsu ball cap rose from a chair and helped him tie off the airboat burt bounded onto the dock and greeted him like an old friend bout time you got here jack your little filly was growing restless thought i might have to tie her down with a final tug he cinched the mooring rope to the piers stanchion thanks joe where is she where do you think he waved beyond the log home to the grounds of what was formerly known as uncle joes alligator farm shes off with stella and the kids lorna stared in amazement at the sight she never grew tired of it she stood on the observation deck above the spread of ponds and elevated walkways a glass of lemonade sweated on the log rail below children ran and played bounded and jumped several hung from trees the ponds no longer held any alligators theyd all been moved including elvis who now was a star attraction at the audubon zoo in the city to support his acquisition a major marketing campaign was under way its slogan could be found emblazoned on billboards buses and streetcars all across new orleans it was only two words elvis lives stella climbed the steps with the youngest child in her arms only three months old the girl was already walking on her ownthough she plainly still liked to be carried eve is getting heavy stella said hiking the child higher in her arms i can see that were weaning her off the bottle like you suggested but shes fighting it they always do lorna smiled and nodded below i have to say youre doing a great job they all look so happy stella matched her grin oh they have their usual scrapes and bruises like any kids but ive never seen a more loving bunch you should see how they dote on igor bagheera and the two little monkeys they keep stuffing them with treats lorna laughed she had never doubted the brood would find a good home here but she was surprised how quickly they had adjusted to their new environment and circumstances before leaving the thibodeauxs boat lorna and the others had made a pact to keep the existence of the children secretat least until they were strong enough and the world ready enough to handle such news the thibodeauxs had proved skilled at getting the children through the bayou in secret no one appeared to be any the wiser and when it came to keeping things hidden from sight there was no better place lorna had only confided in two otherscarlton and zoëknowing shed need their help in establishing this secret sanctuary it had been an easy sell acres had been started to protect and nurture endangered species lorna watched the children play was there any species more endangered more at risk to help matters the project had the backing of an open checkbook from a silent partner after reaching us shores bennett had turned himself over to the authorities he did not hold back exposing all the crimes done in his name opening the balance sheets to ironcreekbut as promised he had remained silent about the children he told authorities that the facility on lost eden cay had been a viral lab undergoing human trials that a weaponized organism had gotten loose and that it became necessary to burn it all down afterward bennett had been moved to a highsecurity facility while he assisted the justice department in rooting out other guilty parties both within the government and out in the private sector his testimony continued to shake up washington hopefully for the better but bennetts largesse didnt end there through the use of dummy corporations and financial channels that made lornas head spin he secretly financed both the rebuilding of acres and the establishment of this secret sanctuary lorna understood the motive behind this generosity bennett had started down a path to his own redemption if she ever doubted it she only had to turn around at bennetts personal request a message had been carved into the lintel above the new homes doorway matthew she had to look up that particular bible verse when she did so it left her smiling she found it entirely fitting let the little children come to me and do not hinder them for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these lorna stared across at the joyful play and youthful innocence her smile grew as she took it all in while this might not be heaven it was definitely a little slice of eden footsteps sounded behind her she turned to find jack crossing toward her burt trotting at his side the shock must have been all over her face she hadnt known he was coming stella retreated toward the house with eve in her arms jack took her place he was dressed in a crisp black suit his hair wet and combed back like hed just stepped out of the showerthough he still had a days worth of stubble over his chin and cheeks she was confused what are you doing here he lifted his arms to encompass this new eden where better than here she still didnt understand for what as answer he dropped to one knee epilogue spring baghdad iraq two young men hurried through the alzawraa gardens toward the main gates of the baghdad zoo the smaller of the two sped ahead of his older brother he called back impatiently yalla come on makeen makeen followed but with less enthusiasm he had no particular desire to ever set foot in the zoo again the place still haunted his nightmares but many years had passed he had a girlfriend a job at a video store and hoped to save one day for his own car yet more than all that today was his little brother bari s sixteenth birthday an auspicious day a party was planned in the park later his mother had spent the past week preparing this birthday picnic the apartment still smelled of baking bread and cinnamon with the promise of a full stomach even nightmares lost their power bari hurried through the gates his younger brother showed no hesitation over the years bari often visited the new zoo but whenever makeen tried to talk to him about what had happened his brother said he didnt remember and maybe he truly didnt bari hadnt seen the monster not up close that black beast of shaitan even to this day makeen sometimes woke with his bedsheets tangled soaked with sweat a scream trapped in his throat picturing eyes aglow with a smokeless fire as he crossed the gardens he lifted his face to the sun and burned away such dark thoughts on a bright morning like today amid the bustle of the earlymorning visitors what was there to fear he found bari dancing at the entrance you move like a constipated camel makeen i want to see the new baby chimp and you know the crowds gather later makeen followed he didnt understand his brothers love for all things furry but on this special day hed tolerate it they wound through the various exhibitsbirds camels bearsand headed straight toward the chimp enclosure he strode quickly with his brother matching his stride thankfully their path did not take them past the old lion cages subhanallah he thought to himself allah be praised at last they reached their destination the monkeyandape exhibit had been refurbished after the bombing it was a popular site after the war a few escaped apes had been recaptured and returned to the new exhibit for iraqis such continuity was important it held special significance for the besieged city a symbol of recovery and stability so the birth last year was doubly special an older chimpanzeeone recovered in the streetshad given birth to a baby a child born bald it had caused a media sensation declared an omen of good fortune makeen didnt understand that even a year later the naked chimp continued to draw large crowds bari hurried to a separate entrance off to the side it led into a small nursery ward over here makeen i cant believe youve not seen it indulging his brothers enthusiasm he walked into the enclosure a short hall ran past a cage enclosed behind glass at this early hour they had the ward to themselves with his arms crossed makeen stared into the exhibit a fake tree sprouted from a sandy floor its limbs draped in ropes tire swings and woven slings at first he failed to spot the star of the exhibit then something as black as oil dropped from above and landed in the sand with its back to the glass it looked like a tiny bareassed old man its skin was all wrinkled like a suit cut too large rather than being charmed a wave of revulsion swept through makeen the creature held a long stick in front of it and beat at the sand bari got excited look how close it is ive never seen it up against the window his brother rushed forward and placed a hand against the glass trying to have an intimate moment with the chimp get away from there makeen yelled louder than he intended allowing his fear to ring out bari turned and rolled his eyes dont be a shakheef makeen the creature ignored them both and continued to dig at the sand with his stick lets head back to the gardens makeen said moderating his tone before mother feeds your picnic feast to the birds bari sighed with much exaggeration theres so much more to see another day you always say that he said in a heavy sulk and headed off makeen remained a moment longer he stared at the small chimp struggling to calm his heart what was there to fear he moved closer to the window and looked down at what the creature had drawn in the sand with its stick it had scratched a series of numbers makeen frowned clearly it was mimicking something it had seen still a shudder passed through him he remembered reading in the local newspaper about how quickly this chimp was growing how it had escaped its first cage by stacking boxes to reach a grate it had even fashioned a crude spear by chewing a tree branch to a sharpened point as if sensing makeens suspicion the chimp swung around and stared him full in the face he fell back the naked visage was terrifying to behold like a wizened black fig come to life with fat lips and huge yellow eyes that gaze locked onto him makeen gasped and covered his mouth in those yellow eyes he recognized a familiar and frightening sheen of intelligence aglow with a black smokeless fire he stumbled back in horror as he fled the chimps lips curled into a hungry smile baring all its teeth authors note to readers truth or fiction i always try to root my books in the real world while dabbling in topics that intrigue me so i thought id take this moment to draw the line between truth and fiction in this novel so here we go baghdad one of the seeds for this story came from reading a book about the efforts to rescue the baghdad zoo following the iraqi war the zoo was badly damaged during a firefight between american forces and the republican guard afterward there was extensive looting and many of the animals escaped into the city if youd like to read more about the harrowing efforts to protect the zoo and rebuild it check out babylons ark by lawrence anthony with graham spence acres lornas place of employment the audubon center for research of endangered species is a real facility located in a remote location alongside the mississippi river its not open to the public but you can read many details about the staffs wonderful efforts to preserve endangered species on the internet they do indeed have a frozen zoo where genetic material is stored in an effort to help sustain and protect this fragile heritage and the researchers there have been doing cuttingedge work into cloning as a means of preservation of course all the characters depicted in this book are fictitious and ive taken great liberties in regard to the floor plan of the actual facility all creatures great and small the claims concerning animal intelligence especially in regard to parrots may sound farfetched but they are based on facts a great book in which to read about this subject is the parrot who owns me by joanna burger youll be amazed also the hunting habits of jaguars are based on real science and all the details about the humananimal bond discussed in this novel are true and were learning more and more about this astounding connection every year genetics all the chromosomal details are accurate including the fact that geneticists have discovered old pieces of viral code in our junk dna but what about genetic throwbacks is such a thing possible if you have any doubts check out this article about a snake born in china with a fully functional reptilian leg growing out of its side httpwwwtelegraphcoukearthwildlifesnakewithfootfoundinchinahtml fractals this subject fascinates me and ive barely scratched the surface in this book about the subject fractals are found everywhere and to better visualize and to understand the full extent go seek out a pbs nova special titled fractals hunting the hidden dimension also the details regarding the power and growth of fractal antennas are real all things brainy its true that all animalsincluding humanshave strange magnetite crystals seeded throughout their brains scientists believe that they are still used for migration in birdsbut why do we have them i had to explore this further as to jacks bloodborne illness i based his infection on bovine spongiform encephalopathy mad cow disease this scourge is caused by a selfreplicating protein called a prion it crosses the bloodbrain barrier and triggers madness of course i just juiced up that protein for this novel also its a small detail but true the human brain does continually produce about twelve watts of electricity enough to power a flashlight things that go boom all of the weapons depicted in this book are real including flechette mines and gars wicked aa combat shotgun to witness the latter in action there are many videos on youtube war room the jasons are a real think tank who advise the military they did indeed produce a paper recommending that the us military invest greater resources into human performance modifications they suggested further research into drugs genetics and the neurological fusion of cybernetic computers all in order to manipulate the human brain and produce better soldiers also the abuses related about private defense contractors are real and currently under investigation similarly these corporations have been moving into scientific circles including establishing labs outside the united states to circumvent laws and oversight location location location if you couldnt tell i love new orleans ive visited the
