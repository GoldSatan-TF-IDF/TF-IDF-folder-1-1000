police jean burchill rebuss current partner museum curator then why are you here depends what you mean rebus said mean the woman frowned behind her glasses mean by here he explained here in this room here in this career here on the planet she smiled her name was andrea thomson she wasnt a doctor shed made that clear at their first meeting nor was she a shrink or a therapist career analysis was what it had said on rebuss daily sheet career analysis rm with ms thomson which had become andrea at the moment of introduction which was yesterday tuesday a get to know session shed called it she was in her late thirties short and largehipped her hair was a thick mop of blond with some darker streaks showing through her teeth were slightly oversized she was selfemployed didnt work for the police fulltime do any of us rebus had asked yesterday shed looked a bit puzzled i mean do any of us work fulltime thats why were here isnt it hed waved a hand in the direction of the closed door were not pulling our weight we need a smack on the wrists is that what you think you need detective inspector hed wagged a finger keep calling me that and ill keep calling you doc im not a doctor shed said nor am i a shrink a therapist or any other word youve probably been thinking in connection with me then what are you i deal with career analysis rebus had snorted then you should be wearing a seat belt shed stared at him am i in for a bumpy ride you could say that seeing how my career as you call it has just careered out of control so much for yesterday now she wanted to know about his feelings how did he feel about being a detective i like it which parts all of me fixing her with a smile she smiled back i meant i know what you meant he looked around the room it was small utilitarian two chromeframed chairs either side of a teakveneered desk the chairs were covered in some limecolored material nothing on the desk itself but her legalsized lined pad and her pen there was a heavylooking satchel in the corner rebus wondered if his file was in there a clock on the wall calendar below it the calendar had come from the local firehouse a length of net curtaining across the window it wasnt her room it was a room she could use on those occasions when her services were required not quite the same thing i like my job he said at last folding his arms then wondering if shed read anything into the action defensiveness say he unfolded them again couldnt seem to find anything to do with them except bunch his fists into his jacket pockets i like every aspect of it right down to the added paperwork each time the office runs out of staples for the staple gun then why did you blow up at detective chief superintendent templer i dont know she thinks maybe it has something to do with professional jealousy the laugh burst from him she said that you dont agree of course not youve known her some years havent you more than i care to count and shes always been senior to you its never bothered me if thats what youre thinking its only recently that shes become your commanding officer so youve been at di level for quite some time no thoughts of improvement she caught his look maybe improvement is the wrong word youve not wanted promotion no why not might be im afraid of responsibility she stared at him that smacks of a prepared answer be prepared thats my motto oh you were a boy scout no he said she stayed quiet picking up her pen and studying it it was one of those cheap yellow bics look he said into the silence ive got no quarrel with gill templer good luck to her as a dcs its not a job i could do i like being where i am he glanced up which doesnt mean here in this room it means out on the street solving crimes the reason i lost it is well the way the whole inquirys being handled you must have had similar feelings before in the middle of a case she had taken her glasses off so she could rub the reddened skin on either side of her nose many a time he admitted she slid the glasses back on but this is the first time youve thrown a mug i wasnt aiming for her she had to duck a full mug too ever tasted copshop tea she smiled again so youve no problem then none he folded his arms in what he hoped was a sign of confidence then why are you here time up rebus walked back along the corridor and straight into the mens toilets where he splashed water on his face dried off with a paper towel watched himself in the mirror above the sink as he pulled a cigarette from his packet and lit it blowing the smoke ceilingwards one of the lavatories flushed a door clicked its lock off jazz mccullough came out thought that might be you he said turning on the tap how could you tell one long sigh followed by the lighting of a cigarette had to be a shrink session finishing shes not a shrink size of her she looks like shes shrunk mccullough reached for a towel tossed it in the bin when hed finished straightened his tie his real name was james but those who knew him seemed never to call him that he was jamesy or more often jazz tall midforties cropped black hair with just a few touches of gray at the temples he was thin patted his stomach now just above the belt as if to emphasize his lack of a gut rebus could barely see his own belt even in the mirror jazz didnt smoke had a family back home in broughty ferry wife and two sons about his only topic of conversation examining himself in the mirror he tucked a stray hair back behind one ear what the hell are we doing here john andrea was just asking me the same thing thats because she knows its a waste of time thing is were paying her wages were doing some good then jazz glanced at him you dog you think youre in there rebus winced give me a break all i meant was but what was the point jazz was already laughing he slapped rebus on the shoulder back into the fray he said pulling open the door threethirty dealing with the public it was their third day at tulliallan the scottish police college the place was mostly full of recent recruits learning their lessons before being allowed out onto public streets but there were other officers there older and wiser they were on refresher courses or learning new skills and then there were the resurrection men the college was based at tulliallan castle not in itself a castle but a mockbaronial home to which had been added a series of modern buildings connected by corridors the whole edifice sat in huge leafy grounds on the outskirts of the village of kincardine to the northern side of the firth of forth almost equidistant between glasgow and edinburgh it could have been mistaken for a university campus and to some extent that was its function you came here to learn or in rebuss case as punishment there were four other officers in the seminar room when rebus and mccullough arrived the wild bunch di francis gray had called them first time theyd been gathered together a couple of faces rebus knew ds stu sutherland from livingston di tam barclay from falkirk gray himself was from glasgow and jazz worked out of dundee while the final member of the party dc allan ward was based in dumfries a gathering of nations as gray had put it but to rebus they acted more like spokesmen for their tribes sharing the same language but with different outlooks they were wary of each other it was especially awkward with officers from the same region rebus and sutherland were both lothian and borders but the town of livingston was f division known to anyone in edinburgh as f troop sutherland was just waiting for rebus to say something to the others something disparaging he had the look of a haunted man the six men shared only one characteristic they were at tulliallan because theyd failed in some way mostly it was an issue with authority much of their free time the previous two days had been spent sharing war stories rebuss tale was milder than most if a young officer fresh out of uniform had made the mistakes they had made he or she would probably not have been given the tulliallan lifeline but these were lifers men whod been in the force an average of twenty years most were nearing the point where they could leave on full pension tulliallan was their lastchance saloon they were here to atone to be resurrected as rebus and mccullough took their seats a uniformed officer walked in and marched briskly to the head of the oval table where his chair was waiting he was in his midfifties and was here to remind them of their obligation to the public at large he was here to train them to mind their ps and qs five minutes into the lecture rebus let his eyes and mind drift out of focus he was back on the marber case edward marber had been an edinburgh art and antiques dealer past tense because marber was now dead bludgeoned outside his home by assailant or assailants unknown the weapon had not yet been found a brick or rock was the best guess offered by the city pathologist professor gates who had been called to the scene for a ple pronouncement of life extinct brain hemorrhage brought on by the blow marber had died on the steps of his duddingston village home frontdoor keys in his hand he had been dropped off by taxi after the private viewing night of his latest exhibition new scottish colorists marber owned two small exclusive galleries in the new town plus antiques shops in dundas street glasgow and perth rebus had asked someone why perth rather than oilrich aberdeen because perthshires where the wealth goes to play the taxi driver had been interviewed marber didnt drive but his house was at the end of an eightymeter driveway the gates to which had been open the taxi had pulled up at the door activating a halogen light to one side of the steps marber had paid and tipped asking for a receipt and the taxi driver had uturned away not bothering to look in his mirror i didnt see a thing hed told the police the taxi receipt had been found in marbers pocket along with a list of the sales hed made that evening totaling just over his cut rebus learned would have been twenty percent not a bad nights work it was morning before the body was found by the postman professor gates had given an estimated time of death of between nine and eleven the previous evening the taxi had picked marber up from his gallery at eightthirty so must have dropped him home around eight fortyfive a time the driver accepted with a shrug the immediate police instinct had screamed robbery but problems and niggles soon became apparent would someone have clobbered the victim with the taxi still in sight the scene lit by halogen it seemed unlikely and yet by the time the taxi turned out of the driveway marber should have been safely on the other side of his door and though marbers pockets had been turned out cash and credit cards evidently taken the attacker had failed to use the keys to unlock the front door and trawl the house itself scared off perhaps but it still didnt make sense muggings tended to be spontaneous you were attacked on the street maybe just after using a cash machine the mugger didnt hang around your door waiting for you to come home marbers house was relatively isolated duddingston village was a wealthy enclave on the edge of edinburgh semirural with the mass of arthurs seat as its neighbor the houses hid behind walls quiet and secure anyone approaching marbers home on foot would have triggered the same halogen security light they would then have had to hide in the undergrowth say or behind one of the trees after a couple of minutes the lamps timer would finish its cycle and go off but any movement would trigger the sensor once again the scene of crime officers had looked for possible hiding places finding several but no traces of anyone no footprints or fibers another scenario proposed by dcs gill templer say the assailant was already inside the house heard the door being unlocked and ran towards it smashed the victim on the head and ran but the house was hightech alarms and sensors everywhere there was no sign of a breakin no indication that anything was missing marbers best friend another art dealer called cynthia bessant had toured the house and pronounced that she could see nothing missing or out of place except that much of the deceaseds art collection had been removed from the walls and each painting neatly packaged in bubble wrap was stacked against the wall in the dining room bessant had been unable to offer an explanation perhaps he was about to reframe them or move them to different rooms one does get tired of the same paintings in the same spots shed toured every room paying particular attention to marbers bedroom not having seen inside it before she called it his inner sanctum the victim himself had never been married and was quickly assumed by the investigating officers to have been gay eddies sexuality cynthia bessant had said can have no bearing on this case but that would be something for the inquiry to decide rebus had felt himself sidelined in the investigation working the telephones mostly cold calls to friends and associates the same questions eliciting almost identical responses the bubblewrapped paintings had been checked for fingerprints from which it became apparent that marber himself had packaged them up still no one neither his secretary nor his friends could give an explanation then towards the end of one briefing rebus had picked up a mug of tea someone elses tea milky gray and hurled it in the general direction of gill templer the briefing had started much as any other rebus washing down three aspirin caplets with his morning latte the coffee came in a paper cup it was from a concession on the corner of the meadows usually his first and last decent cup of the day bit too much to drink last night ds siobhan clarke had asked shed run her eyes over him same suit shirt and tie as the day before probably wondering if hed bothered to take any of it off betweentimes the morning shave erratic a lazy runover with an electric hair that needed washing and cutting shed seen just what rebus had wanted her to see and a good morning to you too siobhan hed muttered to himself crushing the empty beaker usually he stood towards the back of the room at briefings but today he was nearer the front sat there at a desk rubbing his forehead loosening his shoulders as gill templer spelled out the days mission more doortodoor more interviews more phone calls his fingers were around the mug by now he didnt know whose it was the glaze cold to the touch could even have been left from the day before the room was stifling and already smelled of sweat more bloody phone calls he found himself saying loud enough to be heard at the front templer looked up something to say john no no nothing her back straightening only if youve anything to add maybe one of your famous deductions im all ears with respect maam youre not all ears youre all talk noises around him gasps and looks rebus rising slowly to his feet were getting nowhere fast his voice was loud theres nobody left to talk to and nothing worth them saying the blood had risen to templers cheeks the sheet of paper she was holding the days duties had become a cylinder which her fingers threatened to crush well im sure we can all learn something from you di rebus not john anymore her voice rising to match his her eyes scanned the room thirteen officers not quite the full complement templer was working under pressure much of it fiscal each investigation had a ticket attached to it a costing she darent overstep then there were the illnesses and holidays the latecomers maybe youd like to come up here she was saying and give us the benefit of your thoughts on the subject of just exactly how we should be proceeding with this inquiry she stretched an arm out as if to introduce him to an audience ladies and gentlemen which was the moment he chose to throw the mug it traveled in a lazy arc spinning as it went dispensing cold tea templer ducked instinctively though the mug would have sailed over her head in any case it hit the back wall just above floor level bouncing off and failing to break there was silence in the room as people rose to their feet checking their clothes for spillage rebus sat down then one finger punching the desk as if trying to find the rewind on lifes remote control di rebus the uniform was talking to him yes sir glad youve decided to join us smiles all around the table how much had he missed he didnt dare look at his watch sorry about that sir i was asking if youd be our member of the public nodding to the opposite side of the table to rebus di gray will be the officer and you di rebus will be coming into the station with what could turn out to be some vital information pertaining to a case the teacher paused or you could be a crank laughter from a couple of the men francis gray was beaming at rebus nodding encouragement whenever youre ready di gray gray leaned forward on the table so mrs ditchwater you say you saw something that night the laughter was louder the teacher waved them quiet lets try to keep this serious shall we gray nodded turned his eyes to rebus again you definitely saw something yes rebus announced coarsening his voice i saw the whole thing officer though youve been registered blind these past eleven years gales of laughter in the room the teacher thumping the tabletop trying to restore order gray sitting back joining the laughter winking across at rebus whose shoulders were rocking francis gray was fighting hard against resurrection i thought i was going to wet myself tam barclay said lowering the tray of glasses onto the table they were in the larger of kincardines two pubs lessons finished for the day six of them forming a tight circle rebus francis gray jazz mccullough plus tam barclay stu sutherland and allan ward at thirtyfour ward was the youngest of the group and the lowestranking officer on the course he had a tough spoiled look to him maybe it came from working in the southwest five pints one cola mccullough was driving home afterwards wanted to see his wife and kids i do my damnedest to avoid mine gray had said no joking barclay said squeezing into his seat near wet myself grinning at gray blind these past eleven years gray picked up his pint raised it heres tae us whas like us nobody rebus commented or theyd be stuck on this damned course just got to grin and bear it barclay said he was late thirties thickening around the waist saltandpepper hair brushed back from the forehead rebus knew him from a couple of cases falkirk and edinburgh were only thirty minutes apart i wonder if wee andrea grins when she bares it stu sutherland said no sexism please francis gray was wagging a finger besides mccullough added we dont want to stoke johns fantasies gray raised an eyebrow that right john got the hots for your counselor better watch you might make allan jealous allan ward looked up from the cigarette he was lighting just glowered that your sheepfrightening look allan gray said not much to do down in dumfries is there except round up the usual ewes more laughter it wasnt that francis gray had made himself the center of attention it seemed to happen naturally hed been first into his seat and the others had congregated around him rebus sitting directly opposite gray was a big man and the years told on his face and because he said everything with a smile a wink or a glint in his eye he got away with it rebus hadnt heard anyone making a joke about gray himself yet though theyd all been his target it was as if he were challenging them testing them the way they took his comments would tell him everything he needed to know about them rebus wondered how the big man would react to a jibe or joke directed against him maybe hed have to find out mcculloughs mobile sounded and he got up moving away his wife oddson gray stated he was halfway down his pint of lager didnt smoke told rebus hed given up a decade back the two of them had been outside during a break rebus offering the packet ward and barclay smoked too three out of six it meant rebus could feel comfortable lighting up shes keeping tabs on him stu sutherland was saying proof of a deep and loving relationship gray commented tipping the glass to his mouth again he was one of those drinkers you never saw them swallow it was as if they could hold their throat open and just pour the stuff down you two know each other sutherland asked gray glanced over his shoulder to where mccullough was standing his head bowed towards the mobile phone i know the type was all gray said by way of answer rebus knew better he rose to his feet same again two lagers three ipas on his way to the bar rebus pointed towards mccullough who shook his head he still had most of his cola didnt want another rebus heard the words ill be on the road in ten minutes yes he was on the phone to his wife rebus had a call he wanted to make too jean was probably finishing work right around now rush hour the journey from the museum to her home in portobello might take half an hour the barman knew the order this was their third round of the evening the previous two nights theyd stuck to the college premises first night gray had produced a good bottle of malt and theyd sat in the common room getting to know one another tuesday theyd met in the colleges own bar for an afterdinner session mccullough sticking to soft drinks and then heading out for his car but at lunchtime today tam barclay had mentioned a bar in the village good rep no trouble with the locals was the way hed put it so here they were the barman looked comfortable which told rebus hed dealt with intakes from the college before he was efficient not overfriendly midweek only half a dozen regulars in the place three at one table two at one end of the bar another standing alone next to rebus the man turned to him up at the cop school are you rebus nodded bit old for recruits rebus glanced at the man he was tall completely bald his head shining gray mustache eyes which seemed to be retracting into the skull he was drinking a bottle of beer with what looked like a dark rum in the glass next to it force is desperate these days rebus explained next thing theyll be pressganging the man smiled i think youre having me on rebus shrugged were here on a refresher course he admitted teaching old dogs new tricks eh the man lifted his beer get you one rebus offered the man shook his head so rebus paid the barman and deciding against a tray hoisted three of the pints making a triangle of them between his hands went to the table came back for the last two including his own thinking best not leave it too late to phone jean he didnt want her to hear him drunk not that he was planning on getting drunk but you could never tell this you celebrating the end of the course the man asked just the beginning rebus told him st leonards police station was midevening quiet there were prisoners in the holding cells waiting for next mornings court appearance and two teenagers being booked for shoplifting upstairs the cid offices were almost empty the marber inquiry had wound down for the day and only siobhan clarke was left in front of a computer staring at a screen saver in the form of a banner message what will siobhan do without her sugar daddy she didnt know who had written it one of the team having a bit of a laugh she surmised it referred to john rebus but couldnt quite work out the meaning did the author know what a sugar daddy was or did it just mean that rebus looked after her watched out for her she was annoyed to find herself so irritated by the message she went into the screensaver options and clicked on banner erased the present message and replaced it with one of her own i know who you are sucker then she checked a couple of other terminals but their screen savers were asteroids and wavy lines when the phone on her desk started ringing she considered not answering probably another crank wanting to confess or ready with spurious information a respectable middleaged gent had called yesterday and accused his upstairs neighbors of the crime turned out they were students played their music too loud and too often the man had been warned that wasting police time was a serious matter mind you one of the uniforms had commented afterwards if id to listen to slipknot all day id probably do worse siobhan sat down in front of her computer lifted the receiver cid ds clarke speaking one thing they teach at tulliallan the voice said is the importance of the quick pickup she smiled i prefer to be wooed a quick pickup rebus explained means picking up the phone within half a dozen rings how did you know i was here i didnt tried your flat first got the answering machine and somehow sensed i wasnt out on the town she settled back in her chair sounds like youre in a bar in beautiful downtown kincardine and yet youve dragged yourself from your pint to call me i called jean first had a spare twentypence piece im flattered a whole twenty pee she listened to him snort so hows it going he asked never mind that hows tulliallan as some of the teachers would say we have a new tricksold dog interface scenario she laughed they dont talk like that do they some of them do were being taught crime management and victim empathy response and yet you still have time for a drink silence on the line she wondered if shed touched a nerve how do you know im not on fresh orange he said at last i just do go on then impress me with your detective skills its just that your voice gets slightly nasal after how many ill guess four the girls a marvel the pips started sounding hang on he said putting in more money another spare twenty pee a fifty actually which gives you plenty of time to update me on marber well its all been very quiet since the coffee incident i think it was tea whatever it was the stains not budging for what its worth i think they overreacted sending you into purdah im wasting money here she sighed sat forward the screen saver had just kicked in i know who you are sucker scrolling right to left across the screen were still looking at friends and associates couple of interesting stories an artist marber had fallingsout with not unusual in the business apparently but this came to blows turns out the artist is one of these new scottish colorists and leaving him out of the exhibition was a definite snub maybe he whacked marber with his easel maybe and the second story that one ive been saving up to tell you did you ever see the guest list for the preview yes turns out not everyone who turned up was on the list what we had were people whod signed marbers guest book but now weve printed off a list of the people who actually got invites some of them were at the exhibition hadnt bothered to rsvp or sign the book this artist was one of them rebus guessed god no but a certain m g cafferty was she heard rebus whistle morris gerald cafferty big ger to those in the know was the east coasts biggest gangster or the biggest one they knew about cafferty and rebus went back a long way big ger a patron of the arts rebus mused he collects paintings apparently what he doesnt do is smack people over the head on their doorsteps i bow to your superior knowledge there was a pause on the line hows gill doing much better since you left is she going to take it any further not if i finish this course that was the deal how about the lplate siobhan smiled by lplate rebus meant the latest addition to cid a detective constable called davie hynds hes quiet studious industrious she recited not your type at all but is he any good dont worry ill slap him into shape thats one of the prerogatives now youve been promoted the pips were sounding again do i get to go now a concise and helpful report ds clarke seven out of ten only seven im deducting three for sarcasm you need to address this attitudinal problem of yours or the sudden hum on the line told her his time was up it was taking some getting used to being addressed as ds she sometimes still introduced herself as detective constable clarke forgetting that the recent round of promotions had been kind to her could jealousy be behind the message on her screen silvers and hood had stayed the same rank as had most of the rest of cid narrowing the field nicely girl she told herself reaching for her coat back at the table barclay lifted a mobile phone and told rebus he could have borrowed it thanks tam ive actually got one are the batteries dead rebus lifted his glass shook his head slowly i think francis gray said john just prefers things done the oldfashioned way isnt that right john rebus shrugged tipped the glass to his lips above the rim he could see the bald man standing sideways against the bar watching the group intently good morning gentlemen the voice boomed entering the room six of them already seated at the same oval table a dozen or more boxfiles at one end the end where the teacher would sit case management dci retd tennant i trust were all feeling bright as buttons no thumping heads or churning stomachs to report another boxfile was slammed down onto the table tennant dragged his chair out causing its feet to grate against the floor rebus was concentrating on the grain of the tables wood trying to keep it in focus when he did finally look up he blinked it was the bald guy from the bar dressed now in an immaculate chalkstripe suit white shirt and navyblue tie his eyes seemed little pinpricks of devilment as they alighted on every member of the previous nights drinking party i want all those cobwebs blown away gentlemen he said slapping his hand down on one of the files dust rose from it hanging in a beam of light which was streaking through the window behind him its sole purpose to fry the eyeballs of last nights drinkers allan ward whod hardly said three words in the bar but whod moved quickly from pints to shots of straight tequila was now sporting a pair of bluetinted wraparound sunglasses and looked like he should be on the ski slopes rather than stuck in this airless room hed smoked a cigarette with rebus outside after breakfast hadnt said a thing but then rebus hadnt felt much like talking either never trust a man when you cant see his eyes tennant barked ward turned his head slowly towards him tennant didnt add anything just waited him out ward reached into his pocket brought out a pouch and slipped the sunglasses into it thats better dc ward tennant said there were a couple of surprised looks around the table oh yes i know all your names know what thats called its called preparation no case can succeed without it you need to know who and what youre dealing with wouldnt you agree di gray absolutely sir no use jumping to conclusions is there the look gray gave tennant rebus knew tennant had struck a chord he was showing that he had done his research not just names but everything else in their files no sir gray said coldly there was a knock at the door it opened and two men started carrying in what looked like a series of large collages it took only a moment for rebus to realize what they were the wall of death photographs charts news cuttings the sort of stuff you pinned to the walls of an inquiry room the material was mounted on sheets of cork boarding and the men placed these against the walls of the room when theyd finished tennant thanked them and told them to close the door when they left then he got up and walked around the table case management gentlemen well youre old pros arent you you know how to manage a murder inquiry no new tricks to be learned rebus remembered tennants words to him last night at the bar hed been on a fishing expedition wondering how much rebus would say thats why im not going to bother with new tricks instead how about sharpening up the old ones eh some of you will know about this part of the course ive heard it called resurrection we give you an old case something dormant unsolved and we ask you to take another look we require you to work as a team remember how that used to be once upon a time you were all team players these days you think you know better he was spitting out the words now circling the table maybe you dont believe anymore well believe this for me youll work together as a team for me he paused and for the poor bloody victim he was back at his end of the table opening a file bringing out a series of glossy photographs rebus was remembering regimental sergeant majors hed known in his army days he was wondering if tennant had served in the forces youll remember your cid training here how we put you in teams we called syndicates and gave you a case to work on you were videotaped tennant pointed upwards cameras were watching from the corners of the room thered be a whole squad of us watching and listening in another room feeding you tidbits of information seeing what youd do with it he paused that wont happen here this is just you lot and me if i tape you its for my own satisfaction as he started his walk around the table again he deposited one print in front of each man take a look his name is eric lomax rebus knew the name his heart missed a beat beaten to death with something resembling a baseball bat or pool cue hit with such force that splinters of wood were embedded in the skull the photo landed in front of rebus it showed the body at the scene of crime an alleyway illuminated by the photographers flash raindrops falling into puddles rebus touched the photo but didnt pick it up afraid that his hand might tremble of all the unsolveds still moldering in their boxes and storerooms why did it have to be this one he focused on tennant seeking a clue eric lomax tennant was saying died in the center of our biggest ugliest city on a busy friday night last seen a bit the worse for wear leaving his usual pub about five hundred yards from this alley the alley itself used by ladies of the night for kneetremblers and god knows what else if any of them stumbled across the body they didnt come forward at the time a punter on his way home phoned it in weve still got the tapes of his call tennant paused he was back at the head of the table and this time he sat down all this was six years ago october glasgow cid handled the original investigation but came to a slow stop gray had looked up tennant nodded towards him yes di gray i appreciate that you were part of that inquiry it doesnt make any difference now his eyes scanned the table fixing each man in turn but rebuss gaze had shifted to francis gray gray had worked the lomax case i dont know any more about this case than you do gentlemen tennant was telling them by the end of the morning you should know more than me weve got a session each day and if some of you want to continue in the evening after your other classes you wont find me complaining the door will always be open were going to sift the paperwork study the transcripts see if anything was missed were not looking for cockups as i say ive no idea what were going to find in these boxes he patted one of the files but for ourselves and eric lomaxs family were going to have a bloody good go at finding his killer which do you want me to be good cop or bad cop what siobhan was busy looking for a parking spot didnt think shed quite heard him good cop bad cop dc davie hynds repeated which one am i jesus davie we just go in and ask our questions is that fiesta pulling out do you think siobhan braked flashed her lights the fiesta moved from its curbside spot hallelujah siobhan said they were at the north end of the new town just off raeburn place narrow streets lined with cars the houses were known as colonies split into upper and lower halves exterior stone stairs giving the only clue that these werent normal terraces siobhan stopped again just in front of the space preparing to reverse into it then saw that the car behind was nosing in stealing her precious parking place what the she sounded her horn but the driver was ignoring her the rear end of his car was jutting out into the street but he seemed happy enough was reaching over to the passenger seat to pick up some papers look at this sod siobhan said then she undid her seat belt and got out of the car hynds following he watched her tap on the drivers window the man pushed open his door getting out yes he said i was backing in here siobhan told him pointing to her own car so so id like you to move the man pressed the button on his ignition key locking all the doors sorry he said but im in a hurry and possession is ninetenths of the law that may be so siobhan was opening her warrant card holding it up before him but i happen to be the other tenth and right now thats the part that matters the man looked at the card then at siobhans face there was a dull clunk as the cars locks sprang open again the man got in and started his ignition stand there siobhan told hynds gesturing to the spot the mans car was leaving dont want any other bugger trying that trick hynds nodded watched her making for her own car i think this means im the good guy he said but not loud enough for her to hear malcolm neilson lived in one of the upper colonies he answered the door wearing what looked like pajama trousers baggy with vertical pink and gray stripes and a fishermans thick pullover he was barefoot and sported wild frazzled hair as if hed just pulled his finger out of a light socket the hair was graying the face round and unshaven mr neilson siobhan asked opening her warrant card again im ds clarke this is dc hynds we spoke on the phone neilson leaned out from his doorway as if to look up and down the street you better come in then he said closing the door quickly after them the interior was cramped living room with a tiny kitchen off plus maybe two bedrooms maximum in the narrow hallway a ladder led up through a trapdoor into the loft is that where you my studio yes he glanced in siobhans general direction out of bounds to visitors he led them into the chaotic living room it was splitlevel sofa and stereo speakers down below dining table above magazines were strewn around the floor most with pictures and pages torn from them album sleeves books maps empty wine bottles with the labels peeled off they had to be careful where they put their feet come in if you can get in the artist said he seemed nervous shy never meeting his visitors eyes he smeared an arm along the sofa clearing its contents onto the floor sit down please they sat neilson seemed content to crouch in front of them sandwiched by the loudspeakers mr neilson siobhan began as i said on the phone its just a few questions about your relationship with edward marber we didnt have a relationship the artist snapped how do you mean i mean we didnt speak didnt communicate youd had a fallingout the man rips off his customers and his artists both how is it possible to have a relationship under those circumstances just to remind you that mr marbers dead siobhan said quietly the artists eyes almost met hers for an instant what do you mean its just that you talk about him in the present tense oh i see he grew thoughtful siobhan could hear his breathing it was loud and hoarse she wondered if he might be asthmatic do you have any proof she asked at last that he was a cheat neilson considered this then shook his head its enough that i know it from the corner of her eye siobhan noticed that hynds had taken out his notebook and was busy with his pen the doorbell rang and neilson bounded to his feet with a muttered apology when hed gone siobhan turned to hynds not even the offer of a cuppa what are you writing he showed her it was just a series of squiggles she looked at him for an explanation concentrates the mind wonderfully if they think everything they say is likely to be recorded learn that in college he shook his head all those years in uniform boss you learn a thing or two dont call me boss she said watching as neilson led another visitor into the room her eyes widened it was the parkingspace thief this is my um neilson was attempting introductions im malcolms solicitor the man said managing a thin smile siobhan took a moment to recover mr neilson she said trying for eye contact this was meant to be a casual chat there was no need for nice to formalize things though dont you find the solicitor stepped through the debris my names allison by the way and your surname sir hynds inquired blithely in the fraction of a second it took the solicitor to recover siobhan could have hugged her colleague william allison he handed a business card to siobhan she didnt so much as glance at it just handed it straight to hynds mr allison she said quietly all were doing here is asking a few routine questions concerning the relationship professional and personal which may have existed between mr neilson and edward marber it would have taken about ten minutes and that would have been the end of it she got to her feet aware that hynds was following suit a quick learner she liked that but since you want to formalize things i think well continue this discussion down at the station the solicitor straightened his back come on now no need for she ignored him mr neilson i assume youll want to travel with your lawyer she stared at his bare feet shoes might be an idea neilson looked at allison im in the middle of allison cut him off is this because of what happened outside siobhan held his gaze without blinking no sir its because im wondering why your client felt the need of your services i believe its everyones right to neilson was tugging at allisons sleeve bill im in the middle of something i dont want to spend half the day in a police cell the interview rooms at st leonards are quite cozy actually hynds informed the artist then he made a show of studying his watch of course this time of day its going to take us a while to get through the traffic and back again afterwards siobhan added plus the waiting time if a rooms not available she smiled at the solicitor still makes things nice and formal just the way you want them neilson held up a hand just a minute please he was leading the solicitor out into the hallway siobhan turned to hynds and beamed onenil to us she said but is the referee ready to blow she shrugged a reply slid her hands into her jacket pockets shed seen messier rooms couldnt help wondering if it were part of an act the eccentric artist the kitchen was just behind the dining table and looked clean and tidy but then maybe neilson just didnt use it very much they heard the front door close neilson shambled back into the room head bowed bills decided um that is fine siobhan said settling once again on the sofa well mr neilson sooner we get started and all that eh the artist crouched down between the speakers they were big and old woodveneered sides and brown foam grilles hynds sat down notebook in hand siobhan caught neilsons eye at last and offered her most reassuring smile so she said just why exactly did you feel the need to have a solicitor present mr neilson i just i thought it was the done thing not unless youre a suspect she let this sink in neilson muttered something that sounded like an apology sitting back in the sofa beginning to relax siobhan started the interview proper they both got cups of hot brown liquid from the machine hynds grimaced as he took his first sip couldnt we all chip in for a coffeemaker he asked its been tried before and and we started arguing about whose turn it was to buy the coffee theres a kettle in one of the offices you can bring your own mug and stuff but take my advice keep everything locked up or itll go walkies he stared at the plastic cup easier to use the machine he mumbled exactly she pushed open the door to the murder room so whose mug did di rebus throw hynds asked nobody knows she admitted seems its been here since they built this place could even be that the builders left it no wonder he got the boot then she looked at him for an explanation attempted destruction of a historical artifact she smiled made for her desk someone had borrowed her chair again looking around the nearest spare was rebuss hed taken it from the farmers office when the old dcs had retired that no one had touched it was testament to rebuss reputation which didnt stop her pushing it across the floor and making herself comfortable her computer screen was blank she hit a key bringing it back to life a new screen saver was flickering across her vision prove it then point me out she looked up from the screen scanning the room two primary targets dc grant hood and ds george hiho silvers they had their heads together standing by the far wall maybe they were discussing the following weeks rota swapping assignments grant hood had had a thing about her not that long back she thought shed managed to damp those flames without making an enemy of him but he did like his boxes of tricks computers video games digital cameras it would be just his style to start sending her messages hiho silvers was different he liked his practical jokes had made her his victim before and though he was married he had a reputation hed propositioned siobhan half a dozen times over the past few years she could always depend on him for some lurid suggestion at the christmas party but she wasnt sure hed know how to change a screen saver he could barely change misspelled words when he was typing his reports other candidates dc phyllida hawes on temporary transfer from gayfield square newly promoted detective chief inspector bill pryde neither of them seemed to fit the bill when grant hood turned his head in her direction she pointed at him he frowned shrugged his shoulders as if to ask what she wanted she indicated her computer screen then wagged her finger he broke off his conversation with silvers and started towards her siobhan tapped a key so that the screen saver disappeared replaced with a fresh page from the wordprocessing software got a problem hood asked she shook her head slowly i thought i had the screen saver what about it he was at her shoulder now studying the screen it was slow to shift could be your memory he said nothing wrong with my memory grant i mean the memory on the hard disk if its filling up everything slows down she knew as much but pretended she didnt oh right ill check it if you like only take two ticks wouldnt want to keep you from your little chitchat hood looked over to where george silvers was now perusing the wall of death a montage of photos and documents relating to the case stuck to the far wall with blutac hihos turned malingering into an art form hood said quietly hes been over there half the day says hes trying to get a feel for events rebus does the same thing she stated hood looked at her hihos no john rebus all george silvers wants is a quiet life until his pension maxes out whereas whereas rebus will be lucky to still be around to collect his is this a private confab or can anyone join in davie hynds was standing not three feet away hands in trouser pockets to indicate that he was at a loose end grant hood straightened up slapped a hand onto hyndss shoulder and hows the new boy shaping up ds clarke so far so good hood whistled making a show of reappraising hynds thats high marks coming from ds clarke davie youve obviously wangled your way into her affections with an exaggerated wink he moved off heading once more for the wall of death hynds took a step towards siobhans desk is there some history between you two why do you say that dc hood obviously doesnt like me itll take a while thats all but am i right is there a history she shook her head slowly keeping her eyes on his you reckon yourself a bit of an expert dont you davie how do you mean as an amateur psychologist i wouldnt say she was resting against the back of rebuss chair lets give you a test what did you make of malcolm neilson hynds folded his arms i thought wed covered this by which he meant their conversation as siobhan drove them from neilsons home back to st leonards they hadnt learned very much from the meeting neilson admitting it was no secret he wasnt on speaking terms with the art dealer hed further admitted being annoyed that hed suddenly been excluded from the new colorists that bugger hastie couldnt paint a living room wall and as for celine blacker i quite like joe drummond though hynds had interrupted siobhan had given him a warning look but neilson wasnt listening anyway celines not even her real name he was saying in the car siobhan had asked if hynds knew anything about painting i did read up on the colorists a bit hed admitted case like this thought it might come in handy now he rested his knuckles against the edge of siobhans desk leaning in towards her hes not got much of an alibi he stated but did he act like a man who might need one hynds considered this he called his lawyer yes but that was a moments panic once we actually got talking didnt you think he relaxed he was pretty confident siobhan gazing into the middle distance found herself locking eyes with george silvers she pointed to her computer screen then wagged the finger at him he ignored her went back to his pretense of studying the wall detective chief superintendent gill templer was suddenly standing in the doorway noise abatement society been leafleting again she bellowed a quiet office is one that isnt working hard enough she narrowed in on silvers think youre going to solve the case by osmosis george there were smiles but no laughter the officers were trying to look busy but focused templer was heading relentlessly for siobhans desk how did you get on with the artist she asked her voice dropping several decibels says he was in a few pubs that evening maam got a takeaway and went home to listen to wagner tristan und isolde hynds confided then when templer turned her laser glare on him he blurted out that neilson had wanted a solicitor present at the interview did he now the beams switched to siobhan itll go in my report maam but you didnt think it worth mentioning the side of hyndss neck was reddening as he realized hed dropped siobhan in it we dont think it really means anything his voice fell away as he found himself the center of attention again thats your judgment is it well i can see im completely surplus to requirements dc hynds templer announced to the room thinks hes competent to make all the decisions around here hynds tried for a smile failed but just in case hes wrong templer was moving towards the doorway again gesturing into the corridor seeing how were down a di the big house have let us borrow one of theirs siobhan sucked air between her teeth as a body and face she recognized walked into the room di derek linford templer stated by way of introduction some of you may already know him her eyes turned towards hiho silvers george youve been staring at that wall long enough maybe you can bring derek up to speed on the case eh with that templer left the room linford looked around then walked stiffly towards george silvers shaking the proffered hand christ hynds was saying in an undertone i felt like i was on her petri dish for a minute back there then he noticed siobhans face what is it what you were saying before about grant and me she nodded her head in linfords direction oh davie hynds said then fancy another coffee out at the machine she gave him an edited version of events telling him that shed gone out with linford on a couple of occasions but leaving out the fact that linford had started spying on her she added that there was bad blood between linford and rebus too with the former blaming the latter for a severe beating hed been given you mean di rebus beat him up siobhan shook her head but linford blames him all the same hynds gave a low whistle he seemed about to say something but now linford himself was walking down the corridor sorting out some loose coins in his hand change for fifty pee he asked hynds immediately reached into his own pocket allowing linford and siobhan to share a look how are you siobhan fine derek how are you better he nodded slowly thanks for asking hynds was slotting coins home refusing linfords offer of the fiftypence piece was it tea or coffee you were after i think im capable of pushing the button myself linford told him hynds realized he was trying too hard took half a step back besides linford added knowing this machine it hardly makes any difference he managed a smile but it didnt quite reach his eyes why him siobhan asked she was in dcs templers office gill templer had just got off the phone and was scribbling a note in the margin of a typewritten sheet why not it struck siobhan that templer hadnt been chief super back then she didnt know the full story theres she found herself echoing hyndss word history templer glanced up between di linford and di rebus siobhan went on but di rebus is no longer part of this team templer lifted the sheet of paper as if to read it i know that maam templer peered at her then whats the problem siobhan took the whole office in with a sweep of her eyes window and filing cabinets potted plant a couple of family photographs she wanted it she wanted someday to be sitting where gill templer was which meant not giving up her secrets which meant seeming strong not rocking the boat nothing maam she turned towards the door reached out for the handle siobhan the voice was more human i respect your loyalty to di rebus but that doesnt mean its necessarily a good thing siobhan nodded keeping her face to the door when her bosss phone rang again she made what she felt was a dignified exit back in the murder room she checked her screen saver no one had tampered with it then she had a thought and walked the short distance back across the corridor knocking on the door putting her head around without waiting templer put a hand across the receivers mouthpiece what is it she asked her voice once again iron cafferty siobhan said simply i want to be the one who interviews him rebus was slowly circling the long oval table night had fallen but the slat blinds remained open the table was strewn with stuff from the boxfiles what it lacked as yet was some order rebus didnt think it was his job to impose order yet that was what he was doing he knew that come the morning the rest of the team might want to rearrange everything but at least hed have tried interview transcripts reports from the doortodoor inquiries medical and pathology forensics and scene of crime there was a lot of background on the victim as was to be expected how could they hope to solve the crime until they had a motive the areas prostitutes had been reluctant to come forward no one had claimed eric lomax as a client it didnt help that there had been a series of murders of glasgow prostitutes and that the police had been accused of not caring nor did it help that lomax known to his associates as rico had operated on the fringes of the citys criminal community in short rico lomax was a lowlife and even on this mornings evidence rebus could see that some of the officers on the original inquiry had felt that all his demise did was erase another name from the game one or two of the resurrection men had mooted similar feelings why give us a scumbag to work on stu sutherland had asked give us a case we want to see solved which remark had earned him a roasting from dci tennant they had to want to see all their cases solved rebus had watched tennant throughout wondering why the lomax case had been chosen could it be random chance or something altogether more threatening there was a box of newspapers from the time a lot of interest had been shown in them not least because they brought back memories rebus sat himself down now and leafed through a couple the official opening of the skye road bridge raith rovers in the uefa cup a bantamweight boxer killed in the ring in glasgow old news a voice intoned rebus looked up francis gray was standing in the open doorway feet apart hands in pockets thought you were down the pub rebus said gray sniffed as he came in rubbed a hand across his nose we just ended up discussing all this he tapped one of the empty boxfiles the lads are on their way over but looks like you beat us all to it it was all right when it was just tests and lectures rebus said leaning back in his chair so he could stretch his spine gray nodded but now theres something for us to take seriously eh he pulled out the chair next to rebuss sat down and concentrated on the open newspaper but you seem to be taking it more seriously than most i just got here first thats all thats what i mean gray still wasnt looking at him he wet a thumb and turned back a page youve got a bit of a rep havent you john sometimes you get too involved oh aye and youre here for always toeing the line gray allowed himself a smile rebus could smell beer and nicotine from his clothes weve all crossed the line sometime havent we it happens to good cops as well as bad maybe you could even say its what makes the good cops good rebus studied the side of grays head gray was at tulliallan because hed disobeyed one order too many from a senior officer then again as gray had said my boss was is and will forever be a complete and utter arsehole a pause with respect that final phrase had cracked the table up the problem with most of the resurrection men was they didnt respect those above them in the pecking order didnt trust them to do a good job make the right decision grays wild bunch would be returned to duty only when theyd learned to accept and respond to the hierarchy see gray was saying now give me a boss like dci tennant any day of the week guy like thats going to call a spade a shovel you know where you stand with him hes old school rebus was nodding at least hes going to give you a bollocking to your face and not go shafting you from behind now gray found himself at the newspapers front page he held it up for rebus to see rosyth bid brings hope of jobs yet were still here gray said quietly we havent quit and they havent made us why do you think that is wed cause too much trouble rebus guessed gray shook his head its because deep down they understand something they know that they need us more than we need them now he turned to match rebuss gaze seemed to be waiting for rebus to say something in reply but there were voices in the corridor and then faces in the doorway four of them toting a couple of shopping bags from which were produced cans of beer and lager and a bottle of cheap whiskey gray rose to his feet quickly took over dc ward youre in charge of finding us some mugs or glasses dc sutherland might as well shut the blinds eh di rebus here has already got the ball rolling who knows maybe well wrap this up tonight and put archie tennants gas at a peep they knew they wouldnt but that didnt stop them trying starting with a brainstorming session that went all the better for the loosening effects of the alcohol some of the theories were wild and got wilder but there were nuggets among the dross tam barclay made a list as rebus had suspected would happen the separate clusters of paperwork on the table soon collided restoring chaos to the whole he didnt say anything rico lomax wasnt expecting anything jazz mccullough stated at one point how do you reckon wary men tend to change their routine but heres rico cool as you like at his usual spot in his usual bar on the same night as always there were nods of agreement their thinking had been some gangland fallingout an organized hit we all spoke to our snitches at the time francis gray added a lot of pieces of silver crossed a good many undeserving palms result zip doesnt mean there wasnt a contract on him allan ward said still with us allan gray said sounding surprised is it not time you were tucked up in bed with your teddy tell me francis do you buy your oneliners wholesale only theyre well past their sellby there was laughter at this and a few fingers pointed at gray as if to say the lad got you francis he definitely got you rebus watched grays mouth twist itself into a smile so thin it could have graced a catwalk i can see this is going to be a long night jazz mccullough said bringing them back to earth after a can of beer rebus excused himself to visit the toilet it was at the end of the corridor and down a flight of stairs as he left the room he could hear stu sutherland repeating one of the earlier theories rico was freelance right as in not affiliated to any gang in particular and one of the things he was good at if the rumors are true was getting the various soldiers off the battlefield when things got too hot rebus knew what sutherland was talking about if someone did a hit or got into any other trouble which necessitated them getting out of town for a while it was ricos job to find a safe haven he had contacts everywhere council flats holiday homes caravan sites from caithness to the border the western isles to east lothian caravans on the east coast were a specialty rico had cousins who ran half a dozen separate sites sutherland wanted to know whod been hiding out at the time rico had been hit could one of the safe houses have been breached a visit with a baseball bat ricos punishment or had someone been trying to find out a location from him it wasnt a bad notion what troubled rebus was how six years on theyd go about finding out by the stairwell he saw a shadowy figure heading down cleaner he thought but the cleaners had been round earlier he started to descend but then thought better of it walked the length of the opposite corridor there was another set of stairs down at its end now he was on the ground floor he walked on tiptoe back towards the central stairwell keeping in against the wall pushed open the glass doors and surprised the figure who was skulking there evening sir dci archibald tennant spun round oh its you spying on us sir rebus could see tennant considering his options id probably do the same thing rebus said into the silence under the circumstances tennant tilted his head upwards how many are in there all of us mcculloughs not bunked off home not tonight in that case i am impressed why dont you join us sir couple of cans of beer left tennant made a show of checking his watch wrinkled his nose time i was turning in he said id appreciate it if you didnt mention bumping into you wouldnt that be going against the team ethos sir beginning to smile enjoying tennants discomfort just this once di rebus maybe you could play the outsider step out of character you mean this elicited a smile from the older man tell you what ill leave it to your judgment shall i he turned and pushed his way out of the colleges main doors the path outside was well lit and rebus watched him all the way then stepped beneath the staircase where the public telephones were his call was answered on the fifth ring rebus kept his eyes on the stairs ready to hang up if anyone came down its me he said into the receiver i need a meet he listened for a moment sooner if you can manage it what about this weekend its nothing to do with youknowwhat he paused well maybe it is i dont know he nodded as he learned that the weekend was out of the question after listening to a few more words rebus hung up and pushed open the door to the toilets stood there at the sink running the water it was less than a minute before someone else came in allan ward offered a grunt before making for one of the cubicles rebus heard the door lock ward loosen his trouser belt waste of time and brain cells wards voice bounced off the ceiling complete and utter waste of manpower i get the feeling dci tennant has failed to sway you rebus called fucking waste of time taking this as a yes rebus left ward to his business friday morning they were back on the lomax case tennant had asked for a progress report several pairs of eyes had gone to francis gray but gray himself stared levelly at rebus johns put in more hours than any of us he said go on john tell the man what weve found rebus took a sip of coffee first gathering his thoughts mostly what weve got is conjecture not much of it new the feeling is someone was waiting for the victim they knew where hed be what time hed be there thing is that alley was used by the working girls yet none of them saw anyone hanging around not the worlds most reliable witnesses are they tennant interrupted rebus looked at him they dont always want to come forward if thats what you mean tennant shrugged by way of an answer he was circling the table rebus wondered if hed noticed that there were fewer hangovers this morning sure some of them still looked like their faces had been drawn by kids armed with crayons but allan ward had no need of his designer sunglasses and stu sutherlands eyes were dark ringed but not bloodshot you think its a gang thing tennant asked thats our favored explanation same as it was with the original inquiry team but tennant was facing rebus from the other side of the table but rebus obliged there are problems if it was a gang hit how come no one seemed to know the cid in glasgow have their informers but nobodyd heard anything a wall of silence is one thing but theres usually a crack somewhere sometime down the road and what do you glean from that it was rebuss turn to shrug nothing its just a bit odd thats all what about lomaxs friends and associates they make the wild bunch look like the seven dwarves there were a couple of snorts from the table mr lomaxs widow fenella was an early suspect rumor was shed been playing around behind hubbys back couldnt prove anything and she wasnt about to tell us francis gray pulled his shoulders back shes since hitched her wagon to chib kelly he sounds delightful tennant said chib owns a couple of pubs in govan so hes used to being behind bars do i take it thats where he is now gray nodded a wee stretch in barlinnie fencing stolen goods his pubs do more business than most branches of currys fenella wont be pining plenty men in govan know what she likes for breakfast tennant nodded thoughtfully di barclay you dont look happy barclay folded his arms im fine sir sure barclay unfolded the arms again while attempting to find space beneath the table to cross his legs its just that this is the first weve heard of it heard of mrs lomax and chib kelly tennant waited until barclay had nodded then turned his attention to gray well di gray isnt this supposed to be a team effort francis gray made a point of not looking at barclay didnt think it pertinent sir theres nothing to show that fenella and chib knew one another when rico was around tennant pushed out his lips satisfied di barclay i suppose so sir what about the rest of you was di gray right to hold back on you i cant see that it did any harm jazz mccullough said to nods of agreement any chance we can question mrs lomax allan ward piped up tennant was standing right behind him i dont think so not much chance of us getting a result then is there tennant leaned down over wards shoulder i didnt think results were your forte dc ward whats that supposed to mean ward was beginning to rise to his feet but tennant slapped a restraining hand on the back of his neck sit down and ill tell you when ward was seated again tennant left his hand where it was for a few seconds then moved away once more circling the table this case might be dormant but its not extinct you prove to me that you need to check on something maybe interview someone and ill fix it up but i will need to be persuaded in the past dc ward youve been a mite overenthusiastic as far as interview technique is involved that was a piece of lying junkie scum ward spat and since his complaint was not upheld we must naturally concede that you did nothing wrong though tennant beamed a smile in wards direction rebus had seldom seen a face look less amused then tennant clapped his hands together to work gentlemen today id like to see you get through the interview transcripts work in pairs if it makes it easier he pointed to where a clean white marker board had been placed against the wall i want the path of the original inquiry laid out for me along with comments and criticisms anything they missed all the side roads especially ones you feel they should maybe have ventured down a little farther as stu sutherland let out a perceptible groan tennant fixed him with a stare anyone who doesnt see the point of this can head back downstairs he checked his watch the uniformed recruits will be starting their threemile run in the next quarter of an hour plenty of time to change into your vest and shorts ds sutherland im fine sir sutherland said making a show of patting his stomach bit of indigestion thats all tennant glowered at him then left the room slowly the six men turned back into a team again sharing out the piles of paperwork rebus noticed that tam barclay kept his head down keen to avoid eye contact with francis gray gray was working with jazz mccullough at one point rebus thought he heard gray say know what barclays is rhyming slang for down south but mccullough didnt take the bait after almost an hour had passed stu sutherland closed another file and slapped it down onto the pile in front of him then got up to stretch his legs and back he was over by the window when he turned to face the room were wasting our time he said the one thing we need is the one thing well never get and whats that sherlock allan ward asked the names of whoever it was rico was hiding in his various caravans and safe houses at the time he got whacked why would they have anything to do with it mccullough asked quietly stands to reason rico helped gangsters disappear if someone wanted to find one of them hed have to go through rico and before they got round to asking the whereabouts they decided to smash his brains in mccullough was smiling maybe they underestimated how hard theyd hit him sutherland stretched out his arms looking for someone to back him up or maybe hed already told them tam barclay added just came out with it did he francis gray growled threatened with a baseball bat maybe thats just what he did rebus said trying to direct grays flak away from barclay i havent seen anything in here he jabbed a report saying rico wouldnt give in to threats and intimidation could be he gave up the name thinking it would save his neck what name gray asked anyone turn up dead about the same time he looked around the table but received only a few shrugs for his trouble we dont even know he was protecting anyone back then the very point i was trying to make stu sutherland said quietly if ricos job was helping people disappear tam barclay said and someone got to them chances are they just stayed disappeared permanently meaning weve hit a brick wall you put your feet up if you want to gray said stabbing a finger in barclays direction its not like were hanging on your every brilliant deduction at least i dont hide information from the group difference is in the big bad city we actually do stuff like this all day what keeps you busy in falkirk barclay having a quick chug with the lavvy door locked or maybe you like to live dangerously keep it open while youre on the job youre full of it arent you thats right champ i am while you on the other hand are practically drained there was a moments silence then allan ward started laughing joined by stu sutherland tam barclays face darkened and rebus knew what was going to happen barclay leapt from his chair sending it flying back he had one knee up on the table and was readying to launch himself across it straight at francis gray rebus reached out an arm to stop him giving stu sutherland time to lunge forward and hold him in a bear hug gray just sat back smirking pen tapping against the tabletop allan ward was slapping his hand against his thigh as if he had a frontrow seat at barnum and bailey it took them a while to notice that the door was open and andrea thomson was standing there she folded her arms slowly as something like order was restored to the room rebus was reminded of a classroom settling at the approach of authority difference was these were men in their thirties forties and fifties men with mortgages and families men with careers rebus didnt doubt that there had been enough to analyze in that momentary scene to keep thomson busy for the next few months and she was looking at him phone call for di rebus she said i wont ask she said what was going on back there they were walking along the corridor towards her office thats probably wise he told her i dont know how the call ended up coming through to my phone i thought it was easier just to come and fetch you thanks rebus was watching the way her body moved shifting from side to side as she walked it reminded him of a very awkward person trying to do the twist maybe shed been born with some slight spinal deformity maybe a car crash in her teens what is it he pulled his eyes back but too late you walk funny he stated she looked at him i hadnt noticed thanks for pointing it out she opened her door the phone was off the hook lying on the desk rebus picked it up hello in his ear he heard the hum of the open line he caught her eye and shrugged must have got fed up he said she took the receiver from him listened for herself then dropped it back into its cradle who did they say they were rebus asked they didnt was it an external call she shrugged so what exactly did they say just that they wanted to talk to di rebus i said you were along the corridor and they asked if no she shook her head concentrating i offered to get you and they didnt give a name rebus had settled into the chair behind the desk her chair im not an answering machine rebus smiled im just teasing whoever it was theyll call back at which point the phone rang again rebus held his hand out palm facing her just like that he said he reached for the receiver but she got to it first her look telling him that this was still her office andrea thomson she said into the phone career analysis then she listened for a moment before conceding that the call was for him rebus took the receiver di rebus he said i had a careers adviser at school the voice said he dashed all my dreams rebus had placed the voice dont tell me he said you werent tough enough to make it as a ballet dancer i could dance all over you my friend promises promises what the hell are you doing spoiling my holiday claverhouse andrea thomson raised an eyebrow at the word holiday rebus responded with a wink deprived of her chair shed slid one buttock up onto the desk i heard youd offered your chief super a cuppa and you called for a quick gloat not a bit of it much though it pains me to say it we just might require your services rebus stood up slowly taking the phone with him is this a windup i wish it was seeing her chance andrea thomson had reclaimed her empty chair rebus walked around her still holding the phone in one hand receiver in the other im stuck out here he said i dont see how i can might help if we tell you what we want we me and ormiston im calling from the car and wheres the car exactly visitors car park so get your raggedy arse down here pronto claverhouse and ormiston had worked in the past for the scottish crime squad number branch based at the big house otherwise known as lothian and borders police hq the scs dealt with big cases drug dealing conspiracies and coverups crimes at the highest level rebus knew both men of old only now the scs had been swallowed up by the drug enforcement agency taking claverhouse and ormiston with it they were in the car park all right and easily identified ormiston in the drivers seat of an old black taxicab claverhouse playing passenger in the back rebus got in beside him what the hells this great for undercover work claverhouse said patting the doorframe nobody bats an eye at a black cab they do when its in the middle of the bloody countryside claverhouse conceded as much with a slight angling of his head but then were not on surveillance are we rebus had to agree that he had a point he lit himself a cigarette ignoring the no smoking signs and ormistons willful winding down of the front windows claverhouse had recently been promoted to detective inspector and ormiston detective sergeant they made for an odd pairing claverhouse tall and thin almost skeletal his figure accentuated by jackets which he usually kept buttoned ormiston shorter and stockier oily black hair ending almost in ringlets giving him the appearance of a roman emperor claverhouse did most of the talking reducing ormiston to a role of brooding menace but claverhouse was the one to watch hows tulliallan treating you john he asked now the use of his first name seemed portentous to rebus its fine rebus slid his own window down flicked out some ash which other bad boys have they cornered this time round stu sutherland and tam barclay jazz mccullough francis gray thats about as motley as a crew could come i seem to fit right in theres a surprise ormiston snorted no tip for you driver rebus said flicking his nails against the plexiglas screen which separated him from ormiston speaking of which claverhouse said it was a signal ormiston turned the ignition crunched into first gear and started off rebus turned to claverhouse where are we going were just having a chat thats all ill get detention for this claverhouse smiled ive had a word with your headmaster he said it would be okay he leaned back in the seat the cab clanked and rattled doors juddering rebus could feel each spring beneath the frayed leather seat cover i hope youve got breakdown insurance rebus complained im always covered john you know that they were leaving the college grounds turning left towards the kincardine bridge claverhouse turned to face the window taking in the view its about your friend cafferty he said rebus bristled hes not my friend claverhouse had spotted a thread on the leg of his trousers he picked it up now as though it were more pertinent than rebuss denial actually its not big ger so much as his chief of staff rebus frowned the weasel he caught ormiston watching him in the rearview thought he could make out a certain reticence mixed with excitement the pair of them believed they were onto something whatever it was they needed rebuss help but werent sure they could trust him rebus himself knew the rumors that he was too close to cafferty that they were too much alike in so many ways the weasel never seems to put a foot wrong claverhouse continued when cafferty went away that should have been the end of him in edinburgh rebus nodded slowly during caffertys time in jail the weasel had kept his city warm for him just wondering claverhouse mused if with cafferty back behind the wheel our friend the weasel maybe feels a bit aggrieved from drivers seat to backseat so to speak some people prefer to be chauffeured you wont get to cafferty through the weasel ormiston noisily cleared his nostrils the sound of a snuffling bull maybe aye maybe no he said claverhouse didnt say anything just held his body very still even so his partner seemed to get the message rebus doubted hed hear another word from ormiston until claverhouse gave the nod cant be done rebus felt it necessary to stress now claverhouse turned his head and fixed him with a stare weve got some leverage the weasels sons been a bit naughty i didnt even know he had one claverhouse blinked slowly in lieu of nodding it took less energy his names aly whats he done started a little business of his own morningside speed predominantly but also a bit of billy whizz and wacky baccy youve charged him rebus asked theyd left the bridge far behind and were on the m heading east the oil refinery at grangemouth would be off to their left in the next few minutes that depends claverhouse was saying by way of an answer it was like a polaroid developing in front of him rebus saw the full picture now youll do a trade with the weasel thats what were hoping rebus was thoughtful he still wont go for it then alys going down could be a long one too rebus looked at him how much stuff did you catch him with we thought it would be best if we showed you which was just what they did west edinburgh a commercial estate just off gorgie road the place had seen better days rebus got the idea the only growth industry would be in security protecting vacated premises from vandalism and arson the warehouse was ringed by a chainlink fence twentyfourhour guard detail on the gate rebus had been there before years back a weapons haul in the back of a truck the truck inside the warehouse this time round didnt look so different except that it had been stripped many of its component parts laid out in order on the concrete floor doors and panels had been unbolted and unscrewed all the wheels had been jacked up and removed their tires taken off a couple of boxes provided a makeshift step rebus climbed up and peered inside the cab the seats werent there and the flooring had been sliced away to reveal a secret compartment now empty rebus climbed down again and walked around the back of the lorry to where the haul now lay the whole lot displayed on a length of lightblue tarpaulin not all the packages had been opened as yet a chemist one of the forensics crew from the labs at howdenhall was working with test tubes and solutions hed dispensed with the white coat and was dressed for the cold in a brightred ski jacket and woolen tammy hed labeled about half the clearwrapped packets there were maybe fifty left to go through nearby ormiston was snuffling again rebus turned to claverhouse who was warming his hands by blowing on them better watch ormy doesnt get too close to the drugs he could end up hoovering the lot claverhouse smiled ormiston muttered something rebus didnt catch it looks like a fair haul rebus commented who ratted him out nobody we got a lucky break thats all knew aly had been doing a bit of dealing youd no idea he was shifting quantities like this not a scooby rebus looked around it was much more than a fair haul they all knew it bulk like this it was a pr coup yet there was nobody here but himself the two sdea men and the chemist drug runs from the continent were usually a job for customs and excise its aboveboard claverhouse said reading rebuss face carswell gave us the nod carswell was the assistant chief constable rebus had had runins with the acc before does he know about me he asked not yet lets see if ive got this you stopped a lorry found a heap of illegal substances its enough to put the weasels son away for ten years he broke off how does the weasels son tie in exactly alys a lorry driver longdistance a specialty you were tailing him we just had an inkling arsehole was smoking a joint in a rest area when we stopped him no customs involvement claverhouse shook his head slowly stopped him on spec docket showed hed been delivering computer printers to hatfield bringing back a load of software and computer games claverhouse nodded towards the far corner of the warehouse where half a dozen pallets sat aly started shitting it the minute we introduced ourselves rebus watched the chemist pouring himself some tea from a flask and you want me to do what exactly talk to his dad see if i can fix a deal you know the weasel better than we do maybe hell listen to you just two fathers having a little chat rebus stared at claverhouse wondering how much the man knew a little while back when rebuss daughter had been put in a wheelchair the weasel had found the culprit handed him over to rebus in a warehouse not unlike this one cant do any harm can it claverhouses voice was a soft echo bouncing off the corrugated walls he wont shop cafferty rebus said quietly but his own words lacked the power to resonate like claverhouses lateral thinking it had been davie hyndss idea interviewing the deceaseds friends and business acquaintances was all well and good but sometimes you got a clearer picture by going elsewhere another art dealer i mean hed said so siobhan and hynds found themselves in a small gallery owned by dominic mann it was located in the citys west end just off queensferry street and mann hadnt been there long soon as i saw the place i knew it was a good location siobhan glanced out of the window bit of a backwater for shops she mused offices to one side a solicitors to the other not a bit of it mann snapped vettriano used to live quite near here maybe his luck will rub off on me siobhan was looking puzzled so hynds stepped in i like his stuff selftaught too some of the galleries dont like him jealous if you ask me but as i always say you cant argue with success id have represented him like a shot siobhan had turned her attention to a nearby painting it was bright orange titled incorporation and priced at a very reasonable which was just a shade more than her car had cost how about malcolm neilson mann rolled his eyes he was in his midforties with bottleblond hair and a tight little twopiece suit in a color siobhan would have called puce green slipon shoes and a palegreen tshirt the west end was probably the only safe place for him malcolm is a nightmare to work with he doesnt understand words like cooperation and restraint youve represented him then only the once a mixed show eleven artists and malcolm quite ruined the private view pointing out imagined defects to the clients does anyone represent him now probably he still sells overseas i imagine theres someone somewhere taking their cut ever come across a collector called cafferty siobhan asked innocently mann angled his head thoughtfully local is he fairly only he sounds irish and i have a few enthusiastic clients in the dublin area edinburghbased in that case i cant say ive had the pleasure would he be interested in joining my mailing list hynds who had been flicking through a catalogue closed it im sorry if this sounds callous sir but would edward marbers demise benefit other art dealers in the city how so well his clients will have to go somewhere i see what you mean siobhan locked eyes with hynds they could almost hear the working of dominic manns brain as the simple truth of this hit home hed probably be busy late into the evening enlarging his mailing list every cloud he said at last not bothering to finish the sentence do you know the art dealer cynthia bessant siobhan asked my dear everyone knows madame cyn she seems to have been mr marbers closest friend dominic mann appeared to pout that could be true i suppose you dont sound too sure sir well its true they were great friends siobhans eyes narrowed there was something mann wasnt saying something he wanted to have prized out of him suddenly he clapped his hands does cynthia inherit i wouldnt know sir but she did know marbers will left portions of his estate to various charities and friends including cynthia bessantand the residue to a sister and two nephews in australia the sister had been contacted but had said that it would be difficult for her to come to scotland leaving marbers solicitor and accountant to deal with everything siobhan was hoping theyd charge well for their services i suppose cyn deserves it more than most mann was musing sometimes eddie treated her like his bloody servant he looked at siobhan then at hynds im not one to speak ill of the dead but eddie wasnt the easiest friend anyone could have the occasional tantrum or rudeness but people put up with it the question came from hynds oh he was charming too and he could be generous mr mann siobhan said did mr marber have any close friends closer than ms bessant i mean manns eyes twinkled you mean lovers siobhan nodded slowly this was what mann had wanted to be asked his whole body seemed to writhe with pleasure well eddies tastes i think we can guess at mr marbers proclivities hynds interrupted aiming for levity siobhan fixed him with a stare no guesses she wanted to hiss mann was looking at hynds too he held his hands against his cheekbones my god he gasped you think eddie was gay dont you hyndss face sagged well wasnt he the art dealer forced a smile my dear wouldnt i have known if he was now hynds looked to siobhan we got the impression from ms bessant i dont call her madame cyn for nothing mann said hed stepped forward to straighten one of the paintings she was always good at protecting eddie protecting him from what siobhan asked from the world from prying eyes he looked around as though the gallery were filled with potential eavesdroppers then leaned in towards siobhan rumor was eddie only liked shortterm relationships you know with professional women hynds opened his mouth ready with a question i think siobhan told him mr mann means prostitutes mann started nodding moistening the corners of his mouth with his tongue the secret was out and he couldnt have been more thrilled ill do it the weasel said he was a small gaunt man always dressed just this side of ragged on the street hed be taken for a transient someone not worth bothering or bothering about this was his skill chauffeured jaguars took him around the city doing big ger caffertys work but as soon as he stepped from them he got in character again and became as conspicuous as a piece of litter normally he worked out of caffertys cabhire office but rebus knew they couldnt meet there hed called from his mobile asked to speak with the weasel just tell him its john from the warehouse theyd arranged to meet on the towpath of the union canal half a mile from the cab office it was a route rebus hadnt taken in many a year he could smell yeast from the local brewery birds were paddling in the canals oily water coots moorhens hed never been good with names ever do any ornithology he asked the weasel i was only in hospital once appendicitis it means birdwatching rebus said though he suspected the weasel knew this as well as he did the twoshortplanks routine part of his image inviting the unwary to underestimate him oh aye he said now nodding then tell them ill do it i havent told you what they want i know what they want rebus looked at him caffertyll have you killed if he can yes i dont doubt it you and aly must be pretty close his mum died when he was twelve shouldnt happen to someone that young the way he was staring out over the narrow debrisstrewn stretch of water he might have been a tourist in venice a bicycle came towards them along the path the rider nodding a greeting as they made room for her to pass at twelve rebuss own daughter had been living with her mother the marriage over i always did the best i could the weasel was saying there was no emotion in the voice but rebus didnt think the man was acting any longer did you know he was dealing course not id have stopped him otherwise bit hypocritical in the circs fuck you rebus i mean least you could have done was give him a job in the firm your boss has always got a vacancy for a pusher aly doesnt know about me and mr cafferty the weasel hissed no rebus smiled without humor big gers not going to be too happy is he either way youre shafted he nodded to himself if the weasel ratted out his boss he was dead meat but when cafferty found out that his most trusted servants son had been dealing on his turf well the weasel was a marked man either way i wouldnt like to be there rebus went on lighting a cigarette he crushed the empty packet and tossed it onto the ground then toed it into the canal the weasel looked at it then crouched down and fished it out slipping it still wet into a greasy coat pocket i always seem to be picking up other peoples shite he said rebus knew what he meant he meant sammy in her wheelchair the hitandrun driver i dont owe you anything rebus said quietly dont fret thats not the way i work rebus stared at him whenever hed met the weasel in the past hed seen what exactly caffertys henchman a piece of lowlife someone who served a certain function in the big picture fixed unchanging but now he was being offered glimpses of the father the human being until today he hadnt even known the weasel had a son now he knew the man had lost a wife raised the kid himself through the difficult teenage years in the distance a pair of swans were busy preening themselves thered always been swans on the canal story was the pollution kept killing them and the brewery kept replacing them so no one would be any the wiser they were only ever apparently changeless lets go get a drink rebus said the diggers wasnt really called the diggers its given name was the athletic arms but because of its proximity to a cemetery the name had stuck the place took pride in its beer a polished brass advert for the nearby brewery initially the barman had looked on the weasels request as a joke but when rebus shrugged he went and filled the order anyway pint of eighty and a campari soda the barman said now placing the drinks before them the campari sported a little paper umbrella and maraschino cherry trying to be funny son the weasel said fishing both out and depositing them in the ashtray a second later the rescued cigarette packet joined them there they found a quiet corner and sat down rebus took two long gulps from his glass and licked foam from his top lip youre really going to do it its family rebus youd do anything for your family right maybe mind you you put your own brother away didnt you rebus glanced towards him he put himself away the weasel just shrugged whatever you say they concentrated on their drinks for half a minute rebus thinking of his brother michael whod been a smalltime dealer he was clean now had been for a while the weasel spoke first alys been a bloody fool doesnt mean i wont stand by him he lowered his head pinched the bridge of his nose rebus heard him mutter something that sounded like christ he remembered the way hed felt when hed seen his daughter sammy in the hospital hooked up to machines her body broken like a puppets you all right he asked head still down the weasel nodded the crown of his head was bald the flesh pink and flaky rebus noticed that the mans fingers were curled almost like an arthritics he had barely touched his drink while rebus was finishing his ill get us another he said the weasel looked up eyes reddened so that more than ever he resembled the animal which had given him his nickname my shout he said determinedly its okay rebus assured him but the weasel was shaking his head thats not the way i work rebus and he got up kept his back straight as he walked to the bar he came back with a pint handed it over cheers rebus said good health the weasel sat down again took another sip of his drink what do you suppose they want from me anyway these friends of yours i wouldnt exactly call them friends im assuming the next step is a meeting between me and them rebus nodded theyll want you to feed them everything you can get on cafferty why what good will it do them the mans got cancer thats why they let him out of the barl in the first place all caffertys got are some doctored x rays build up a case against him and we can ask for a new set of tests when they show up negative he goes back inside again and suddenly theres no crime in edinburgh no drugs on the street no moneylending the weasel offered a weak smile you know better than that rebus didnt say anything concentrated on his beer instead he knew the weasel was right he licked more foam from his lip and made up his mind look he said ive been thinking the weasel looked at him eyes suddenly interested the thing is rebus shifted in his seat as if trying to get comfortable im not sure you need to do anything right now how do you mean i mean you shouldnt agree to anything not straightaway aly needs a lawyer and that lawyer can start asking questions the weasels eyes widened what sort of questions the way the drugs boys found the lorry and searched it it might not have been entirely aboveboard theyve kept the whole thing quiet from the likes of customs and excise could be theres some technicality somewhere rebus held up his hands at the look of hope which had bloomed on the weasels face im not saying there is mind of course not i cant say one way or the other understood the weasel rubbed his chin nails rasping over the bristles if i go to a lawyer how do i stop big ger finding out it can be kept quiet i doubt the sdea will want to make a noise the weasel had brought his face a little closer to rebuss as if they were conspirators but if they ever got a whiff that youd said anything rebus leaned back and what exactly have i said a smile spread across the weasels face nothing mr rebus nothing whatsoever he reached out a hand rebus took it felt soft pressure as the two men shook they didnt say anything but the eye contact was enough claverhouses words just two fathers having a little chat claverhouse and ormiston dropped him off at tulliallan there hadnt been much conversation on the trip back rebus i dont think hes up for it claverhouse then his sons going to jail it was a point claverhouse reiterated angrily and often until rebus reminded him that he was trying to convince the wrong man maybe ill talk to him claverhouse had said me and ormie maybe we could be more persuasive maybe you could when ormiston pulled on the hand brake it sounded like a trapdoor opening rebus got out and walked across the car park listening to the cab moving away when he stepped into the college he headed straight for the bar work had finished for the day did i miss anything he asked the circle of officers a lecture on the importance of exercise jazz mccullough replied it helps work off feelings of aggression and frustration which is why youre all doing some circuit training rebus pointed at the group and made a stirring motion ready to take their drinks orders stu sutherland was as usual the first to reply he was a brawny redfaced son of a highlander with thick black hair and slow careful movements determined to hang in until pension time hed long since grown tired of the job and wasnt afraid to admit as much ill do my share hed told the group nobody can complain about me not doing my share the extent of this share had never really been explained and no one had bothered to ask it was easier just to ignore stu which was probably the way he liked it too nice big whiskey he said now handing rebus his empty glass having ascertained the rest of the order rebus went up to the bar where the barman had already starting pouring the group were sharing some joke when francis gray put his head round the door rebus was ready to add to the order but gray spotted him and shook his head then pointed back into the hallway before disappearing rebus paid for the drinks handed them out and then walked to the door francis gray was waiting for him lets go walkies gray said sliding his hands into his pockets rebus followed him down the corridor and up a flight of stairs they ended up in a subpost office it was a pretty accurate mockup of the real thing with a range of shelves filled with newspapers and magazines packets and boxes and the glassfronted wall of the post office itself they used it for hostage exercises and arrest procedures whats up rebus asked see this morning barclay having a go at me for keeping information back not still eating you is it credit me with some sense no its something ive found something about barclay gray just looked at him picked up one of the magazines it was three months out of date he tossed it back down francis ive a drink waiting for me id like to get back before it evaporates gray slid a hand from his pocket it was holding a folded sheet of paper whats this rebus asked you tell me rebus took the sheet and unfolded it it was a short typewritten report detailing a visit to edinburgh by two cid officers from the rico lomax inquiry theyd been sent to track down a known associate richard diamond but had spent a fruitless few days in the capital by the last sentence of the report the authors feelings had got the better of him and he proffered grateful thanks to our colleague di john rebus st leonards cid for endeavors on our behalf which can only be described as stinting in the extreme maybe he meant unstinting rebus said blithely making to hand the sheet back gray kept his hands in his pockets thought you might want to keep it why so no one else finds it and starts to wonder like me why you didnt say anything about what about being involved in the original inquiry whats to tell a couple of lazy bastards from glasgow all they wanted was to know the good boozers headed back after a couple of days and had to write something rebus shrugged doesnt explain why you didnt bring it up but maybe it does explain why you were so keen to sift through all the paperwork before the rest of us had a chance meaning what meaning maybe you wanted to make sure your name wasnt there rebus just shook his head slowly as if dealing with a stubborn child where did you disappear to today gray asked a wildgoose chase gray waited a few seconds but could see he wasnt going to get any more he took the sheet from rebus and started folding it so do i slip this back into the case notes i think you better im not so sure this richard diamond he ever turn up again i dont know if hes back in circulation hes someone we should be talking to isnt he could be rebus was studying the sheet watching the way gray was sliding his fingers along its sharp edges he reached out his own hand and took it folded it into his pocket gray gave a little smile you were a late entrant to our little gang werent you john the sheet they sent me with all our names on it yours wasnt there my chief wanted rid of me in a hurry gray smiled again its just coincidence then tennant coming up with a case that both you and me worked rebus shrugged how can it be anything else gray looked thoughtful he gave one of the cereal boxes a shake it was empty as hed expected story is only reason youre still on the force is that you know where the bodies are buried any bodies in particular rebus asked now how would i know a thing like that it was rebuss turn to smile francis he said i even have the photographs and with a wink he turned back and headed for the bar cynthia bessants flat made up the entire top floor of a bonded warehouse conversion near leith links one huge room took up most of the space there was a cathedral ceiling with large skylights an enormous painting dominated the main wall it was maybe twenty feet high and six wide an airbrushed spectrum of colors looking around siobhan noted that it was the only painting on display there were no books in the room no tv or hifi two of the facing walls comprised sliding windows giving views down onto leith docks and west towards the city cynthia bessant was in the kitchen area pouring herself a glass of wine neither officer had accepted the invitation to join her davie hynds sat in the center of a white sofa meant to accommodate a football team he was making a show of studying his notebook siobhan hoped he wasnt going to sulk theyd had words on the stairwell starting when hynds had mentioned his relief that marber hadnt been in his words an arsebandit what the hell difference does it make siobhan had snapped i just i prefer it thats all prefer what that he wasnt an dont siobhan had raised her hand dont say it again what davie lets just drop this youre the one who started it and im finishing it okay look siobhan its not that im its finished davie okay fine by me hed grunted and now he sat with his nose in his notebook taking in nothing cynthia bessant sauntered over to the sofa and joined him there proffering a smile she took a slug from her glass swallowed and exhaled much better she said hard day siobhan asked deciding at last to sit down on one of the matching chairs bessant started counting off on her fingers the taxman the vat man three exhibitions to organize a greedy exhusband and a nineteenyearold son whos suddenly decided he can paint she peered over the rim of her glass not at siobhan but at hynds is that enough to be going on with plenty id have said hynds agreed his face breaking into a smile as he suddenly realized he was being flirted with he glanced towards siobhan to gauge her annoyance not forgetting mr marbers death siobhan said bessants face creased in pain god yes the womans reactions were slightly exaggerated siobhan was wondering if art dealers always put on a performance you live by yourself hynds was asking bessant now when i so choose she replied dredging up a smile well were grateful you put aside some time to talk to us not at all its just that we have a few more questions siobhan said to do with mr marbers private life oh could you tell us how often he resorted to prostitutes mrs bessant siobhan thought she could see the woman flinch hynds glared at her his eyes seemed to say dont use her to get at me but now bessant was speaking eddie didnt resort to anything well how would you put it there were tears in bessants eyes but she straightened her back trying for resilience it was how eddie chose to order his life relationships always got messy thats what he said she seemed about to say more but stopped herself so did he cruise coburg street or what she looked at siobhan in mild distaste and siobhan felt a little of her own hostility ebb away hyndss eyes were still on her but she refused to meet them he used a sauna bessant said quietly regularly as often as he needed we werent quite so close that he felt he had to share every detail did he shop around bessant took a deep breath then sighed she remembered she was holding a glass of wine and tipped it to her mouth swallowed best way to get through this is to tell us everything cynthia hynds said quietly but eddie was always so so private in that way i understand youre not breaking any confidences you know arent i she was looking at him he shook his head youre helping us try to find whoever killed him she thought about this nodded her head slowly the tears had cleared from her eyes she blinked a couple of times focusing on hynds for a moment siobhan thought they were going to hold hands theres a place not too far from here whenever eddie dropped in i knew he was either on his way there or on his way home siobhan wanted to ask if she could tell the difference but she stayed silent its up a lane off commercial street do you know what its called hynds asked she shook her head dont worry siobhan said we can find it i just want to protect his name bessant said imploringly you do understand hynds nodded slowly siobhan was rising to her feet if it has no bearing on the case i cant see a problem thank you cynthia bessant said quietly she insisted on seeing them to the door hynds asked if shed be okay dont worry about me she said touching his arm then with the door open she shook his hand siobhan stood just over the threshold wondering whether to stretch out her own hand but bessant had turned back into the room davie hynds pulled the door closed think shell be all right he asked as they descended the echoing stairs the walls were brick painted pale yellow the steps themselves were metal vibrating tinnily bloody creepy place to live check on her later if you like siobhan paused once youre off duty this is a new side of you im seeing hynds said stick around she told him ive got more sides than john rebuss record collection meaning hes got a lot of records more than a few siobhan admitted back on the street she sought out a newsagents and bought an evening paper opened it to the classifieds buying or selling hynds asked she stabbed her finger at a list headed saunas then ran the same finger down the page checking addresses paradiso she said vip suites tv and onstreet parking hynds looked the address seemed right it was two minutes away by car were not going there he asked too right we are shouldnt we give them some warning dont be soft itll be fun the look on hyndss face told her he didnt quite believe this the commercial aspect of commercial street had long ago withered but there were signs of rejuvenation civil servants now had a sparkling glass edifice to call home at victoria quay small restaurants had appeared though some had already been forced to close catering to suits and expense accounts farther along the road the queens old yacht britannia attracted tour parties and a huge new redevelopment was penciled in for the surrounding industrial wasteland siobhan guessed that cynthia bessant had bought her warehouse conversion in the hope of being one of the early settlers in what would become edinburghs equivalent of londons docklands it was entirely possible that the placement of the sauna paradiso was no accident either it seemed to siobhans thinking that it was placed halfway between the money and the working girls in coburg street the working girls kept their prices low but attracted the dregs sauna paradiso was after the more upmarket punter its frontage had been boarded over and painted a mediterranean blue with palm trees and surf prominent the vip suites were again advertised it had probably been a shop of some kind at one time now it was an anonymous door with a square of oneway mirrored glass in its center siobhan pressed the buzzer and waited yes came a voice lothian and borders cid siobhan called out any chance of a word there was a pause before the door opened inside the cramped space was mostly taken up with armchairs men had been sitting there dressed in blue toweling robes nice touch siobhan thought the blue matched the paintwork the tv was on showing a sports network some of the men had been drinking coffee and soft drinks now they were on the move heading for a doorway at the back where siobhan guessed their clothes were hanging up just to the side of the front door was a reception desk a young man seated on the stool behind it evening she said showing him her warrant card hynds had his open too but his eyes were elsewhere scoping the room is there any problem the young man asked he was skinny wore his dark hair back in a ponytail there was a ledger book in front of him but it was closed now a pen sticking out of it siobhan brought out a photo of edward marber it was recent taken on the night hed died he was in his gallery a sheen of sweat on his face a nice big smile for the camera a man with not a care in the world and about two hours to live you probably dont go in for second names around here siobhan said he mightve called himself edward or eddie oh we know he was a customer do you now the young man glanced at the picture and whats he done someone killed him the young mans eyes were on hynds who was over at the back doorway did they now he said his mind elsewhere siobhan decided enough was enough okay youre not telling me anything that means i have to talk to all the girls find out who knew him you better call your boss and tell him the place is shutting down for the night she had his attention now this is my place he said she smiled sure it is every inch of yous a born entrepreneur he just looked at her she held the photograph in front of his nose take another look she said a couple of the saunas customers dressed now brushed past averting their eyes as they escaped to the outside world a womans face appeared at the back doorway then another whats going on ricky the young man shook his head at them then met siobhans gaze i might have seen him he admitted but that could just be because his face was in the paper it was siobhan agreed nodding i mean we get a lot of faces in here and you take down their details siobhan was looking at the ledger just the first name plus the girls how does it work ricky punters sit in here choose a girl ricky nodded what goes on once theyre in a suite is their business maybe they just want a back rub and a bit of chat how often did he come in siobhan was still holding up the photograph couldnt tell you more than once the doorbell rang ricky ignored it hed missed his morning shave started rubbing the back of his hand against his chin more men carrying their jackets shoes not quite laced were making to exit as they pulled open the door the clients outside a couple of drunken businessmen stumbled in laura on tonight one of them asked he noticed siobhan and proffered a smile his eyes running the length of her the phone started ringing ricky will be with you in a minute gentlemen siobhan said coldly as soon as hes finished helping me with my inquiries christ the man hissed his friend had flopped into a chair was asking where the burdz were the first man hauled him back to his feet polis charlie was the explanation come back in ten minutes ricky called out but siobhan doubted the men would be back not for a while i seem to be bad for business siobhan said with a smile hynds appeared at the inner doorway its a bloody maze back there stairs and doors and i dont know what theres even a sauna would you believe how are we doing ricky here was just about to tell me if mr marber was a regular hynds nodded reached over and picked up the stillringing phone sauna paradiso dc hynds speaking he waited then looked at the receiver hung up he said with a shrug look he came in a few times ricky burst out im not always on shift you know daytime or evenings evenings i think what did he call himself ricky shook his head eddie maybe hynds had a question did he take a shine to any one girl in particular ricky shook his head again another phone was sounding the theme to mission impossible it was rickys mobile he unclipped it from his trouser belt held it to his ear hello he listened for a few moments his back straightening its under control he said then he looked up at siobhan still here yes siobhan knew it was the owner of the sauna maybe one of the girls had called him she held out a hand she wants to talk to you ricky said then he listened again and shook his head eyes still on siobhan do i need to show them the books he blurted this out as hynds started prizing a hand beneath the ledger rickys free hand came down and stopped him i said i can handle it ricky said more firmly before terminating the call his face had hardened ive told you what i know he said clipping the phone back on his belt his free hand still resting on the closed ledger mind if i talk to the girls siobhan asked be my guest ricky said his face breaking into a smile when siobhan stepped over the threshold she knew the place was empty she saw shower cubicles lockers a wooden coffin of a sauna stairs down to the rooms where the girls worked no windows the downstairs was below ground level she peered into one room it smelled perfumed there was a deep bath in one corner lots of mirrors the lighting was almost nonexistent sounds of grunts and moans a tv high up on one wall playing a hardcore video back out in the corridor she noticed a curtain at the far end walked towards it and pulled it open a door emergency exit it led out into a narrow alley the girls were gone done a runner hynds confirmed so what do we do now we could charge him with possession of illegal videos we could hynds acknowledged he glanced at his watch or we could call it a day siobhan started climbing the narrow stairs the saunas phone was ringing again ricky was about to answer but thought better of it when he saw siobhan whos your boss she asked solicitors on his way ricky told her good she said making for the exit i hope he charges through the nose the resurrection men had moved from the bar to the breakout area and from alcohol to soft drinks a lot of the probationers at tulliallan would be staying through the weekend but those who were allowed would be heading home jazz mccullough and allan ward had left already ward complaining of the long drive ahead the others were trying to rouse themselves or maybe it was that there was nothing about the weekend that they couldnt live without the breakout area was an open lounge of leather chairs and sofas just outside the lecture theater rebus had known men get too comfortable there and end up falling asleep waking stiffly next morning got plans john francis gray asked rebus shrugged jean was off to a family wedding south of the border shed asked if he wanted to go but hed declined how about you he asked ive been away five days pound to a penny things have started to break drip or leak youre a bit of a diy man then christ no why do you think things go wrong in the first place there was tired laughter at this five days theyd been at tulliallan they felt like they knew each other suppose ill go watch my team tomorrow tam barclay said whos that falkirk barclay nodded need to get yourself a proper grownup team gray commented would that be one from glasgow francis where else rebus got to his feet well ill see you all first thing monday morning unless we see you first gray answered with a wink rebus went to his room to pack a few things the room itself was a comfortable box with en suite bathroom better than many a hotel hed stayed in only the cid were assured single rooms a lot of probationers were doubling up such were their numbers rebuss mobile was where hed left it charging at one of the wall sockets he poured himself a small laphroaig from his secret stash and switched on the radio tuning it to some station with pulsing dance music then he picked up his mobile and punched in some numbers its me he said keeping his voice low how come i havent heard from you he listened as the person at the other end complained about the lateness of the hour when rebus said nothing to this the person then asked where he was in my room thats just the radio you can hear when do we get to meet monday the voice said where and how leave that to me any luck so far thats not what i want to talk about there was silence on the line then monday and this time the phones backlit screen told him the connection had ended he retuned the radio switched it off making sure the alarm function wasnt set he had his bag open but suddenly wondered what the rush was there was nothing awaiting him in edinburgh but an empty flat he picked up his goingaway present from jeana portable cd player shed added some cds too steely dan morphine neil young hed brought a few others van morrison john martyn he fixed the headphones on and pushed the start button the swelling opening of solid air filled his head pushing out everything else he leaned back against the pillow decided the song was definitely on the shortlist for his funeral knew he should write the shortlist down after all you never could tell siobhan answered her door it was late but she was expecting company eric bain always called first to make sure it was all right it usually was bain worked at police hq the big house he specialized in computer crime the two had become good friends nothing more than that they talked on the phone sometimes ended up at one anothers flat sharing latenight milky coffee and stories youre out bain called through from the kitchen out of decaf he meant siobhan was back in the living room putting some music on oldsolar a recent purchase good latenight music middle cupboard top shelf she called got it eric the officers at fettes called him brains had told siobhan early on that his favorite film was when harry met sally letting her know where he stood and that if she wanted things to go any further the first move would have to come from her of course none of their colleagues believed it erics car had been spotted parked outside at midnight and next morning both police stations had been buzzing it didnt bother her didnt seem to bother eric he was coming into the living room now carrying a tray containing cafetière a jug of steamed milk two mugs he set it down on her coffee table next to some notes shed been writing been busy he asked just the usual she noticed the grin on his face what is it he shook his head but she dug her pen into his ribs its your cupboards he confessed my what your cupboards all the tins and jars yes theyre arranged with the labels facing out so it just spooks me thats all he wandered over to her cd rack pulled a disc out at random opened its case see what you put your cds back in the case so theyre the right way up he snapped the case shut opened another it makes them easier to read siobhan said not many people do it im not like other people thats right he kneeled in front of the tray pushed down on the cafetières plunger youre more organized thats right a lot more organized she nodded then jabbed him with her pen again he chuckled poured milk into her mug just an observation he said adding coffee to both mugs handing hers over i get enough grief at the office mr bain siobhan told him you working this weekend no got plans he slurped from his mug angled his head to read her notes you were at the paradiso a little vertical frown appeared between her eyes you know the place only by reputation it changed hands about six months back did it used to be owned by tojo mcnair he has a couple of the bars down leith salubrious establishments no doubt sticky carpets and weak beer what was the paradiso like she considered the question not as seedy as id expected better than having the girls walking the streets she thought this over too before nodding agreement there was a plan afoot to zone off part of leith turn it into a safe area for streetwalkers but the first choice had been an industrial estate badly lit and the scene of an attack a few years before so now it was back to the drawing board siobhan tucked her feet beneath her on the sofa eric slumped in the chair opposite whos on the hifi he asked she ignored this and asked her own question instead who owns the paradiso nowadays well that all depends on what he patted the side of his nose with his index finger do i have to thrash an answer out of you siobhan asked smiling above the rim of her mug i bet youd do it too but he still wasnt telling i thought we were friends we are no point coming round here if you dont want to talk he sighed sipped some coffee leaving a milky residue along his top lip you know big ger cafferty he said the question was entirely rhetorical word is if you burrow deep enough its his name youll find siobhan sat forward cafferty hes not exactly advertising the fact and he never goes near the place how do you know bain wriggled in his chair not at all comfortable with this conversation ive been doing some work for the sdea you mean claverhouse bain nodded its hushhush if he finds out ive been blabbing theyre after cafferty again can we drop it please i only have to get through this one job then im off to the forensic computer branch did you know their workloads increasing twenty percent every three months siobhan was on her feet walking over to the window the shutters were closed but she stood there as though staring at some startling new vista whose workload the sdea the fcb youre not listening cafferty she said almost to herself cafferty owned the paradiso edward marber had frequented the place and there was a story that marber had been cheating his clients i was supposed to interview him today she said quietly who she turned her head towards bain it was as if shed forgotten he was there cafferty she told him what for she didnt hear him he was across in glasgow due back tonight she checked her watch itll wait till monday bain said she nodded agreement yes it could wait maybe if she could gather a bit more ammo first okay bain said so sit down again and relax she slapped a hand against her thigh how can i relax its easy all you do is sit yourself down take a few deep breaths and start telling me a story she looked at him what sort of story the story of why it is that youre suddenly so interested in morris gerald cafferty siobhan backed away from the window sat down again and took a few deep breaths then she reached down and picked her phone up off the floor theres just one thing i have to do first bain rolled his eyes but then siobhans call was answered and he broke into a smile she was ordering pizza on monday morning rebus was back at tulliallan in time for breakfast hed spent most of saturday in the oxford bar passing time first with one set of drinkers then with another finally hed headed back to his flat and fallen asleep in the chair waking at midnight with a raging thirst and a thumping head hed not been able to get back to sleep until dawn meaning he didnt wake until midday on sunday a visit to the laundrette had filled in the afternoon and hed gone back to the ox in the evening all in all then not a bad weekend at least he wasnt having the blackouts anymore he could remember the conversations hed had in the ox the jokes hed been told the tv shows playing in the background at the start of the marber inquiry hed been at a low ebb the past seeming to suffocate him just as surely as the present memories of his marriage and the day he had moved into the arden street flat with his young wife that first night hed watched from the window as a middleaged drunk across the street leaned for all his life against a lamppost struggling for balance seemingly asleep though standing rebus had felt an affection for the man hed felt affection for most things back then newly married and with a firsttime mortgage rhona talking about kids and then a week or two before the teathrowing incident rebus himself had become that man middleaged and clutching at the selfsame lamppost struggling to focus the crossing of the street an impossible proposition hed been due at jeans for dinner but had got comfortable at the ox slipping outside to phone her with some lie hed probably walked back to arden street couldnt recall his journey hanging on to that lamppost and laughing at the memory of the man when a neighbor had tried to help rebus had gripped the lamppost all the harder crying out that he was useless only good for sitting at a desk making phone calls he hadnt been able to look the neighbor in the face since after breakfast he stepped outside for a cigarette and found a commotion on the parade ground a lot of the probationers were out there the cid intake were halfway through their fiveweek induction as part of the training they had to raise money for charity and one of them had promised a parachute jump into the parade ground at there was a big letter x marking the spot it was made from two lengths of shiny red material weighted down with stones a few of the probationers were squinting skywards hands shading their eyes maybe got raf leuchars to help out one of them was suggesting rebus stood with his hands in his pockets hed signed a sponsorship form putting himself down for a fivequid donation should the jump succeed a rumor was going around that a land rover with armed forces plates was parked in the driveway two men in lightgray uniforms could be seen at one of the windows in the building which fronted the parade ground sir one of the probationers said making to pass rebus they usually did that part of the training you could get half a dozen of them in the corridors all going sir he tried to ignore it a door was opening all eyes turning towards it a young man emerged wearing a onepiece flight suit what looked like a parachute harness clamped around his chest he was carrying a metalframed chair he nodded and beamed smiles at the crowd who watched in silence as he made his way towards the x planting the chair down firmly in its center rebus blew out air through his mouth shaking his head slowly at the knowledge of what was to come the cid recruit climbed onto the chair crouched and placed his hands together as if readying to dive into a pool and then he jumped dust kicked up as he hit the ground he stood up straight opened his arms wide as if to accept the acclaim of his audience there was some muttering confused looks the recruit picked up the chair behind their window the raf officers were smiling what was that someone asked in disbelief that son was a parachute jump rebus said his admiration tempered only by the knowledge that hed just lost a fiver he recalled that when hed been going through his cid training hed raised money by taking part in an allday relay attempt on the assault course these days hed be lucky if he could walk it once through back in the syndicate room he announced that the jump had been successful there were frowns and shrugs jazz mccullough who had been made senior investigating officer was talking to francis gray tam barclay and allan ward were busy compiling the filing system stu sutherland was explaining the structure of the investigation to a twitchylooking dci tennant rebus sat down and pulled a sheaf of papers towards him he worked for a solid half hour glancing up every now and then to see if gray had any message for him when a break was announced rebus slipped a sheet of paper from his pocket and added it to the pile with a cup of tea in his hand he asked mccullough if he fancied swapping jobs fresh perspective and all that he explained mccullough agreed with a nod went and sat down in front of the papers gray had just finished a short conversation with tennant he looks antsy rebus commented the brass are in the house gray explained what sort of brass chief constables half a dozen of them here for some meeting or other i doubt theyll be bothering us but archie isnt so sure he doesnt want them meeting the remedial class something like that gray offered with a wink just then mccullough called out rebuss name rebus walked over to the table mccullough was holding the sheet of paper rebus made a show of reading it christ that had clean escaped me he said hoping he sounded surprised gray was at his shoulder what is it rebus turned his head fixing grays eyes with his own jazz has just dug this up two officers from glasgow visited edinburgh looking for one of ricos associates a guy called dickie diamond so this from tennant who had joined the group i was their liaison thats all tennant read the sheet quickly they dont seem too enamored covering their arses rebus stated now that i remember they spent the whole time in the boozer tennant was looking at him this is you just remembering rebus nodded tennant kept staring but rebus wasnt offering anything more who is this dickie diamond mccullough asked he was a local smalltimer rebus said i barely knew him past tense he could still be on the scene for all i know was he a suspect mccullough asked gray turned to the room anyone turned up a richard diamond there were shrugs shakes of the head tennant nodded towards the paperwork in front of mccullough nothing in there about him not that ive found well there must be something in the files somewhere tennant was talking to the room now and if it had been correctly indexed in the first place it would be right next to this report as it is wed better flag the name and keep looking there were murmurs of yes sir francis gray added the name to the marker board any chance your mates in lothian and borders could fill us in on this character allan ward asked looking for a shortcut no harm in asking rebus told him why dont you get on the phone ward frowned its your patch he informed rebus its also stus patch rebus reminded him ward glanced towards stu sutherland but one of the skills we need to learn in an inquiry is transregional cooperation it was one of tennants own phrases which was probably why the dci made noises of agreement ward looked frustrated by this turn of events fine he grunted give me the number rebus looked to stu sutherland do the honors will you stu be my pleasure there was a knock at the door causing tennant to freeze but when it opened a couple of inches andrea thomson rather than the feared posse of chief constables was standing there tennant waved for her to enter its just that im supposed to be seeing di rebus this afternoon but something else has come up result rebus was thinking so i wondered if you could maybe spare him this morning instead she was uncharacteristically tightlipped on the walk down the corridor and rebus gave up trying but when they got to her door she hesitated you go in she told him ill just be a minute rebus looked at her but she wouldnt meet his eyes when he reached out to the door handle she turned and started walking away watching her rebus opened the door he sensed movement from the corner of his eye seated in andrea thomsons chair was someone hed been wanting to see he entered the room quickly closing the door clever he admitted how much does she know andrea will keep her mouth shut the man said then he reached out a hand for rebus to shake how have you been john rebus took the hand returned its grip then sat down fine sir he said he was seated opposite his own chief constable sir david strathern now then the chief constable said getting comfortable again what seems to be the problem john a little over two weeks had passed since their first meeting rebus had been working in st leonards when a call had come through from the big house could rebus nip across the road to the blonde restaurant what for hed asked youll find out but as rebus had made to cross the road gripping his jacket shut against the fierce breeze a car horn had sounded the car was parked on the corner of rankeillor street and a hand was waving from its window he recognized the figure in the drivers seat even without the customary uniform sir david strathern the pair had met in the past at official functions only and infrequently at that rebus wasnt one for the sportsmens dinners the boxing bouts with cigars and hed never found himself on a platform being given some award for gallantry or good conduct it didnt matter sir david seemed to know him it wasnt an official car black gleaming rover almost certainly the chief constables own there was a chamois cloth on the passengerside floor magazines and a shopping bag on the backseat as rebus closed the door the car pulled away sorry about the subterfuge strathern said with a smile the action creased the lines around his eyes he was in his late fifties not that much older than rebus but he was the boss the chief the big stick and rebus was still wondering what the hell he was doing here strathern was dressed in gray casual trousers and a dark crewneck jumper mufti it might be but he wore it like a uniform his hair was silver neatly clipped above his ears the large bald spot prominent only when he turned his head to check for traffic at the next junction youre not offering me lunch then rebus guessed the smile widened too close to st leonards didnt want anyone seeing us together am i not good enough for you sir strathern glanced in rebuss direction its a good act he commented but then youve spent years perfecting it havent you what act is that sir the wisecracks that hint of insubordination your way of coping with a situation until youve had a chance to digest it is that right sir dont worry john for what im about to ask you to do insubordination is a prerequisite which left rebus more baffled than ever strathern had driven them to a pub on the southern outskirts of the city it was close to the crematorium and got a lot of business from funeral meals which meant it wasnt quite so popular with anyone else their corner of the bar was quiet strathern ordered sandwiches and halves of ipa then attempted some conversation as if this was a regular outing for the two of them are you not drinking strathern asked at one point noting rebuss stillfull glass i hardly touch the stuff rebus told him strathern looked at him thats not exactly been your reputation maybe youve been misinformed sir i dont think so my sources are usually impeccable there was little rebus could say to this though he did wonder who the chief had been talking to assistant chief constable colin carswell perhaps who disliked rebus intensely or carswells acolyte di derek linford neither would have painted rebus in anything but the darkest shades with respect sir rebus said sitting back food and drink untouched we can skip the foreplay if you like he then watched his chief constable struggle to contain the anger mounting within him john strathern said at last i came to you today to ask a favor one which requires a certain level of insubordination the chief constable nodded slowly i want you to get yourself kicked off a case the marber case rebuss eyes narrowed the case itself has nothing to do with it strathern said sensing rebuss suspicion but you want me off it all the same yes why without thinking rebus had raised the flat halfpint of beer to his lips because i want you somewhere else tulliallan to be precise theres a rehab course about to start there and ill need rehab because ive been kicked off a case i think dcs templer will demand it she knows about this shell agree to it when i tell her who else knows nobody why do you ask because i think youre asking me to go undercover i dont know why yet and i dont know that ill do it but thats the feeling i get and and there are people at fettes who dont like me i wouldnt like to think that theyd strathern was already shaking his head nobody would know except you and me and dcs templer shell be told only as much as i need her to know which leads to the big question sir namely namely rebus said rising to his feet empty glass in hand whats this all about he lifted the glass id offer to get you another sir but youre driving and you said you hardly touch the stuff i was lying rebus said with the ghost of a smile thats what you need isnt it a convincing liar the way strathern told it was there was a drug dealer on the west coast a man called bernard johns bernie johns as hes more colloquially known or was until his untimely death the chief constable nursed his nearempty glass as he spoke he died in prison still protesting his innocence no doubt no not exactly but he was adamant hed been ripped off not that he ever said as much to us it would hardly have helped his case would it youre putting me away for eight kilos but i had a lot more than that stashed away i can see it would have been awkward but word got around about a large amount of missing stuff either drugs or cash depending who you talked to and and the operation against johns was big you probably remember it ran from the winter of ninetyfour to spring ninetyfive three forces dozens of officers a logistical nightmare rebus nodded but lothian and borders wasnt involved thats true we werent he paused not back then at any rate so whats happened whats happened john is that three names keep coming up the chief constable leaned over the table lowering his voice still further you might know some of them try me francis gray hes a di based in govan knows the place like the back of his hand invaluable for that reason but hes dirty and everybody knows it rebus nodded hed heard of gray knew the mans rep not so dissimilar from his own he wondered how much of it was bluff who else he asked a young dc called allan ward works out of dumfries hes learning fast never heard of him the last one is james mccullough a di from dundee basically clean so far as anyone knows but blows a fuse from time to time they worked the case john got to know each other and you think they took bernie johnss swag we think its likely whos we my colleagues by which strathern meant the other chief constables in scotland it looks bad something like that even if it is just a rumor but it tarnishes everyone at the highest level and whats your role in all of this sir rebus was halfway down the pint hed bought himself the beer seemed to be weighing down his gut as if what was liquid had suddenly become solid he was thinking of the marber case the grind of all those cold calls his hands gripping a cold lamppost the three regions involved we couldnt ask a detective from any one of them to act on our behalf rebus nodded slowly because it might get back to the three men involved so instead theyd asked strathern if he could think of anyone and apparently hed thought of rebus so these three rebus said theyre going to be at tulliallan by accident yes all three will be on the same course the way he said it rebus knew it was anything but an accident and you want me in there with them rebus watched strathern nodding to do what exactly to find out what you can gain their confidence you think theyll suddenly open up to a complete stranger you wont be a stranger to them john your reputation precedes you meaning im a bent cop same as them meaning your reputation precedes you strathern repeated rebus was thoughtful for a moment you and your colleagues do you have any evidence at all strathern shook his head the little investigating weve been able to do we cant find any trace of drugs or money youre not asking much of me are you sir i appreciate its a tall order john tall were talking jack and the beanstalk rebus chewed his bottom lip give me one good reason why i should do this i think you like a challenge plus im hoping you dislike dirty cops as much as the rest of us rebus looked at him sir there are plenty of people out there who think im a dirty cop he was thinking of francis gray curious to meet the man but we know theyre wrong dont we john the chief constable said rising to fetch rebus another pint tulliallan no more marber inquiry a short break from the blackouts and a chance to catch up with the man hed once heard called the glasgow rebus the chief constable was studying him from the bar rebus knew strathern didnt have long to go retirement looming maybe the man was still hungry unfinished business and all that maybe rebus would do it after all now in andrea thomsons room strathern sat with his hands clasped so whats so urgent he asked i havent made much headway if thats what youre wondering gray mccullough and ward act like they barely know each other they do barely know each other there was just that one case they worked together they dont act like theyve got riches salted away how do you expect them to act drive around in bentleys have their bank accounts been checked the chief constable was shaking his head theres nothing tucked away in their bank accounts maybe in a wifes name nothing strathern stated how long have they been under investigation strathern looked at him is that any concern of yours rebus shrugged i just wondered if i was the straw you were clutching at were close to losing them strathern admitted at last grays up for retirement in less than a year mccullough probably wont be far behind him and allan wards disciplinary record you think hes looking for the early bath maybe the chief constable was checking his watch sliding the metal casing up and down his wrist i should be getting back theres just one thing sir about time strathern took a deep breath go on then theyve got us working an old case trying you out as a syndicate eh i dare say archie tennants in charge he is yes thing is rebus paused considering just how much to tell his boss well both gray and me tie to the case strathern looked interested gray worked it from his end and i was liaison when two of glasgows finest came through to edinburgh on a recce this was in ninetyfive same year as bernie johns strathern looked thoughtful its coincidence he said pure and simple tennant doesnt know about strathern shook his head and this case wasnt foisted on him another shake of the head is that why you wanted to see me gray might think its more than just coincidence i agree its awkward on the other hand if you play it right it could get you closer to him the pair of you already have something in common dyou see what i mean yes sir do you think maybe somebody could ask ask ask dci tennant why he happened to choose that particular case strathern looked thoughtful again pursing his lips ill see what i can do that good enough for you thats fine sir rebus said but he wasnt sure he believed his own words strathern looked satisfied and got up from the chair the two men met by the door you first the chief constable said then he raised a hand and patted rebuss shoulder templers mad at you you know because without my insights the marber case is doomed strathern accepted the joke because of how hard you threw that mug shes taking it personally all part of the act sir rebus said pulling open the door as he walked back along the corridor he thought better of it and wandered downstairs instead to the breakout area he needed a cigarette but there were none in his pockets looking outside he noted a distinct shortage of fellow addicts there was a packet in his room if he could be bothered walking there or he could linger in the hope that some good samaritan would come by the meeting had failed to put his mind at rest he wanted to be sure that the rico lomax case was just a coincidence and he couldnt shrug off the niggling suspicion that perhaps there was less to this than met the eye no cabal of worried chief constables no drug money no conspiracy between gray mccullough and ward just the rico lomax case and his own involvement in it because john rebus knew more about rico lomax than he was telling a hell of a lot more did strathern know was gray working for strathern rebus took the stairs back up to cid two at a time breathing hard as he made his way back down the corridor he pushed open the door without knocking but the chief constable wasnt there andrea thomsons office was empty strathern had to be headed to the original building the castle itself rebus knew the way moved quickly ignoring the young uniforms with their clipped sirs strathern had paused for a moment to study one of the display cases which lined the main corridor the corridor facing the now empty parade ground no chair or parachute no xmarksthespot a moment of your time sir rebus said quietly stratherns eyes widened he pushed open the nearest door it led to a conference room empty save for rows of chairs with writing trays attached you want your cover blown strathern spluttered i need more background rebus stated on all three of them i thought wed discussed all that the more you know the more likely they are to suspect when did they take the money how did they know about it how come the three of them ended up working together john nothing like that has exactly gone on the record but there must be notes there must be something strathern looked wildly about him as though fearing eavesdroppers one thing rebus knew if the whole bernie johns story was a front there could be no background no notes all right strathern said almost in a whisper ill get you what i can by tonight rebus added john that might not i need it tonight sir strathern almost winced tomorrow at the latest the two men locked eyes eventually rebus nodded he wondered if he was giving strathern enough time to concoct a fantasy case he didnt think so by tomorrow he could be sure tonight if possible he said heading for the door this time he made straight for his room and those cigarettes wheres your homophobic friend dominic mann asked siobhan and mann were seated opposite one another at a tiny window table in a west end café he was stirring his skimmed decaf latte while shed already sunk one shot of her double espresso the inside of her mouth felt coated with a fine residue and she reached into her bag for the bottle of water she kept there you noticed she said i noticed he didnt want to make eye contact with me maybe hes just shy siobhan offered she took a mouthful of water rinsed and swallowed mann was glancing at his watch the face of which he kept on the inside of his wrist she remembered that her father had done the same and when shed asked him why hed said it was to stop the face getting scratched yet the glass itself had been almost opaque with abrasions i have to open at ten the art dealer said you didnt feel like going to the funeral by which she meant edward marbers funeral which had started almost half an hour ago at warriston crematorium mann shuddered i cant stand them i was actually relieved to have an excuse glad to be of help so what is it i can do for you the top two buttons of manns yellow shirt were undone and hed hooked a finger into the opening im wondering about edward marber if hed been cheating how would he have gone about it depends who he was cheating clients or artists lets try both mann took a deep breath and raised one eyebrow five minutes you said siobhan smiled maybe it depends how fast you talk mann unhooked the finger from his shirt and went back to stirring his latte it looked like he had no intention of actually drinking it as he spoke his eyes drifted to the window office staff were dragging their feet to work well dealers can cheat potential buyers in all sorts of ways you can exaggerate the importance of an artist or the rarity and value of a piece by a deceased artist you can offer fakes those are the cases that usually make the headlines you dont think mr marber was dealing in fakes mann shook his head thoughtfully nor was he passing along stolen works but then if he was its unlikely anyone in edinburgh would know how so his eyes turned to her because such transactions tend to be sub rosa he saw her eyes narrow under the table he explained watching her nod of understanding and what about cheating the artists themselves she asked mann shrugged that could mean several things one would be charging too high a commission hardly cheating but an artist might not see it that way commissions tend to be what anywhere between ten and twentyfive percent the betterknown the artist the lower the commission and someone like malcolm neilson mann pondered this malcolms well enough known in the uk and has his collectors in the states and the far east he doesnt live like a rich man you mean his piedàterre the stockbridge colonies mann smiled dont be fooled he uses that place as a studio he has a much larger house in inveresk and recently added a home in the perigord to his property portfolio if rumors are to be believed so just because he was left out of the colorists doesnt mean hes hurting not financially at any rate meaning malcolm has an ego same as any other artist he doesnt like to feel excluded you think thats why he says marber was cheating mann shrugged hed finally given up stirring the latte and was now testing the temperature of the tall glass cup with the tips of his fingers malcolm doesnt just think himself a colorist he feels he should be leading the group they came to blows apparently so the story goes you dont believe it he looked at her have you asked malcolm not yet maybe you should you might also ask him why he was at edwards gallery that night siobhan suddenly had trouble swallowing the last of her espresso it felt like sludge she reached for the water bottle again you were there she finally managed to ask mann shook his head i wasnt invited but we dealers were always keen to know how the competitions doing i just happened to be passing in a taxi the place looked sadly busy and you saw malcolm neilson mann nodded slowly he was standing on the pavement outside like a child at the window of a toy shop why didnt you tell me this before mann grew thoughtful again turning to face the outside world maybe it was the company you were keeping he said back in her car siobhan checked her messages three from davie hynds she called him at st leonards whats up she asked just wondered how the funeral went i didnt go that puts you in a distinct minority half of st leonards seems to be there siobhan knew theyd be on the lookout for possible suspects taking names and addresses from anyone attending the ceremony are you at the station she asked right now i think i am the station it was pretty much a skeleton crew over the weekend too i didnt know you were working this weekend thought id show willing have you heard the news no marbers bank statements seems he was renting a selfstorage unit at a place down in granton had been for the past month i went there for a looksee but it was empty owner says he doesnt think marber had been near the place so what was he planning to do with it maybe use it for storing paintings maybe but siobhan sounded skeptical neither his secretary nor cynthia bessant knew anything about it did you happen to drop by madame cyns again siobhan asked archly had to put a few questions to her over a glass or two of wine dont worry i took a chaperone hynds paused so if you gave the funeral a miss whereabouts are you im in town i was thinking of paying the artist another visit malcolm neilson what for new information neilson went to the private viewing how come no one said i dont think he went in just loitered on the pavement says who dominic mann there was another pause youve been talking to him he called it in siobhan lied she didnt want hynds to know shed gone to mann without him they might yet turn out to be partners after all more than that she was aware that she needed an ally at st leonards it wasnt just the loss of rebus or the appearance of derek linford she knew she couldnt be everywhere at once and would have to depend on others forging alliances not making enemies the next step on the promotion ladder might be a way off but that didnt mean she could afford to relax i didnt see anything about it hynds was saying he got me on my mobile funny its been switched off whenever ive tried well he did there was a longer silence between them she knew he was working it out want me with you when you talk to neilson hynds asked quietly he knew yes she replied too quickly want to meet me there all right half an hour fine she thought of something have the victims credit cards turned up yet not a single transaction which was curious in itself when you stole credit cards you used them hard and fast before a stop could be put on them eric had been talking to her about internet fraud nowadays shopping was twentyfourseven a creditcard thief could max out overnight the purchases delivered to safe addresses if youd been on a night out and your cards were lifted by the time you woke up and discovered they were gone it was already too late why would an attacker take the cards and then not use them answer to make the attack look like a simple robbery when it was anything but ill see you at neilsons she said she was about to cut the call when something struck her hang on do you have neilsons number somewhere better phone first he has another place out at inveresk if he knows were coming wont he try setting his lawyer on us again im sure you could dissuade him if hes at inveresk call me back i can pick you up on the way but malcolm neilson wasnt at inveresk he was in his row house wearing the same clothes as before siobhan doubted hed washed or shaved in the intervening time hadnt tidied either just a couple more questions she said keeping things brisk she didnt bother sitting down and neither did hynds the painter had slumped between the loudspeakers again his fingers were stained and smeared and she could smell paint fumes coming from the attic can i phone a friend he asked gruffly you can even ask the audience if you think itll help hynds answered neilson proffered a snort and the beginnings of a smile did you ever have a fight with edward marber siobhan asked depends what you mean i mean a standup fight you never knew him did you he couldnt punch his way through a prawn cracker looking at the empty tinfoil cartons on the floor siobhan deduced that neilsons last meal had been chinese did you hit him hynds asked i just gave him a bit of a push thats all eddie always liked to get up close didnt seem to know the meaning of personal space where was this siobhan asked in the chest i mean was it here at his gallery after hed turned you down for the exhibition yes and thats all it was a push he stumbled back fell over some canvases neilson shrugged and you havent been back to the gallery since wouldnt wipe my arse on the place really the question came from hynds something about his tone of voice alerted the artist okay i went there the night of the opening did you go in siobhan asked quietly im assuming someone saw me so you know damned fine i didnt what were you doing there mr neilson the specter at the feast you wanted to taunt mr marber the artist ran a hand through his hair further disturbing it i dont know what i wanted exactly to make a scene hynds suggested if id wanted one of those id have gone inside wouldnt i how long were you there not long five ten minutes did you see anything i saw fat people pouring champagne down their throats i meant anything suspicious neilson shook his head did you recognize any of the guests siobhan asked shifting her weight from one foot to the other a couple of journalists a photographer a few of eddies buyers such as sharon burns it was galling to see her there shes bought a few of my paintings in the past anyone else morris cafferty cafferty the businessman siobhan nodded does he own any of your own works i think hes got one yes hynds cleared his throat did you happen to see any other artists neilson glowered at him while siobhan seethed that theyd gone off the subject of cafferty joe drummond was there the artist admitted i didnt see celine blacker but no way shed pass up free booze and the chance to be fawned over what about hastie hastie doesnt do many parties not even when he has paintings to sell he leaves that to the dealer neilsons eyes narrowed you like his stuff it has its moments hynds offered neilson shook his head slowly as if in disbelief can i ask one more thing mr neilson siobhan interrupted youve said that edward marber was a cheat im not sure who he was cheating bloody everyone hed sell a painting for full whack then tell the artist he had to knock a bit off to secure the sale and how did that cheat the buyer because they could probably have got it for the cheaper price and take something like the new colorists thats just bloody marketing hype means he can bump up his prices again no one has to buy if they dont want to hynds said but they do buy especially after eddies patters done its trick you sell your own works direct mr neilson siobhan asked dealers have got the market sewn up neilson spat bloodsucking bastards that they are so who represents you a london gallery terrance whyte not that he seems to have what it takes outside after another fifteen minutes of fairly unproductive grumbling from the artist siobhan and hynds stepped onto the pavement siobhans car was curbside hynds doubleparked alongside hes still talking about marber in the present tense siobhan commented hynds nodded as if the murder hasnt really affected him or maybe hes read the same psychology books we have and knows it looks good for him hynds considered this he saw cafferty he said yes i wanted to thank you for getting us away from that particular topic so promptly hynds paused to think back then muttered an apology why are you so interested in cafferty she looked at him what do you mean ive heard about cafferty and di rebus what about them davie just that they hynds seemed finally to realize that he was digging himself into a hole nothing nothing you sure about that he stared at her why didnt you take me with you to see dominic mann she scratched at her ear looking around before focusing on hynds know what his first question to me was wheres your homophobic friend thats why i didnt take you i thought i might get more out of him if you werent there she paused and i did fair enough hynds said his shoulders dropping hands seeking the shelter of his pockets what are neilsons paintings like do you know siobhan asked keen to change the subject hyndss right hand appeared from its pocket clutching four postcards they were works by malcolm neilson they had titles like first impressions count last and seeing how you already know the titles didnt go with the paintings field and sky a beach with cliff face moorland a boat on a loch what do you think hynds asked i dont know i suppose id expected something a bit more abstract and angry she looked at him exactly abstract and angry dont sell hynds explained not to the people who decide which prints and postcards theyll foist on the public how do you mean hynds took the postcards and waved them at her these are where the big money is greeting cards framed prints wrapping paper ask jack vettriano i would if i knew who he was she was thinking hadnt dominic mann mentioned him hes a painter the couple dancing on the beach ive seen that one ill bet you have he probably makes more from card sales and the like than he does from his paintings youre joking but hynds shook his head pocketing the postcards arts all about marketing i was speaking to a journalist about it one of the ones from the viewing hynds nodded shes art critic for the herald and i wasnt invited he looked at her and she took the point just like her and dominic mann okay she said i asked for that go on about marketing you need to get artists names known plenty of ways to do that the artist can cause a sensation of some kind like whassername with her unmade bed hynds nodded or you stir up interest in some new school or trend the new scottish colorists the timing couldnt be better there was a big retrospective last year of the original colorists cadell peploe hunter and fergusson you got all this from your art critic he held up a single digit one phone call speaking of which siobhan dug into her pocket for her mobile punched in a number and waited till it was answered hynds had taken the postcards out again and was flicking through them is anyone speaking to the competition siobhan asked him hynds nodded i think silvers and hawes did the interviews they talked to hastie celine blacker and joe drummond does this hastie have a first name not for professional purposes there was no answer from the phone siobhan shut it off and did anything come of the interviews they went by the book she looked at him meaning meaning they didnt know what questions to ask unlike you you mean hynds rested a hand against siobhans car ive taken a crash course in scottish art you know it and i know it so speak to dcs templer maybe shell let you do a fresh lot of interviews siobhan noted some reddening on hyndss neck you already spoke to her she guessed saturday afternoon what did she say she said it looked like i thought i knew better than her siobhan muffled a smile youll get used to her she said shes a ballbreaker the smile disappeared shes just doing her job hyndss lips formed an o i forgot shes a friend of yours shes my boss same as she is yours way i heard it shes grooming you i dont need grooming siobhan paused sucked in some air whove you been talking to derek linford hynds just shrugged problem was it could have been anyone really linford silvers grant hood siobhan punched the number back into her phone dcs templers got to be tough on you she said controlling her voice dont you see thats her job would you call her a ballbreaker if she was a bloke id probably call her something worse hynds said siobhans call was picked up this time its detective sergeant clarke here i have an appointment with mr cafferty just wanted to check we were still okay she listened glanced at her watch thats great thank you ill be there she quit the call and slipped the phone back into her pocket morris gerald cafferty hynds stated big ger to those in the know prominent local businessman with sidelines in drugs protection and god knows what else youve had runins with him before she nodded but didnt say anything the runins had been between cafferty and rebus at best shed been a spectator so what time are we seeing him hynds asked we i assume youll want me to cast an expert eye over his art collection which made sense even though siobhan was loath to admit it hyndss phone sounded now and he answered it hello ms bessant he said winking at siobhan then he listened for a moment are you sure he was staring at siobhan now were not far away actually yes five minutes see you there he finished the call what is it siobhan asked one of marbers own paintings looks like someones walked off with it and guess what its a vettriano they drove to marbers gallery where cynthia bessant was waiting for them still dressed in black from the funeral and with her eyes reddened from crying i drove jan back here she nodded towards the back office where marbers secretary was fussing with paperwork she said she wanted to get straight back to work thats when i noticed noticed what siobhan asked well there was a painting eddie liked hed kept it at home for a while then decided to hang it in his office here thats where i thought it was which is why i didnt say anything when it wasnt with the rest of his collection at home but jan says he decided it might get stolen from the gallery so he took it home again could he have sold it hynds asked i dont think so david bessant said but jan is checking hyndss neck was reddening knowing siobhans eyes were on him amused by bessants use of his first name what sort of painting was it fairly early vettriano selfportrait with a nude behind him in the mirror how large hynds had taken his notebook out maybe forty inches by thirty eddie bought it five or so years ago just before jack went stratospheric so what would it be worth now she shrugged maybe thirty forty thousand you think whoever killed eddie stole it what do you think siobhan asked well eddie had peploes and bellanys a minor klee and a couple of exquisite picasso prints she seemed at a loss so this painting wasnt the most valuable in the collection bessant shook her head and youre sure its missing its not here and it wasnt in the house she looked at them i dont see where else it could be didnt mr marber have a place in tuscany siobhan asked he only spent a month a year out there bessant argued siobhan was thoughtful we need to circulate this information would there be a photo of the painting anywhere in a catalogue probably and do you think you could go to mr marbers house again miss bessant just to make doubly sure cynthia bessant nodded then glanced in hyndss direction would i need to go on my own im sure david would be happy to accompany you siobhan told her watching as the blood started creeping up hyndss neck all over again when rebus got back to the syndicate room the team were gathered around archie tennant tennant was seated the others standing behind him peering over his shoulders at the sheaf of papers from which he was reading whats that rebus said shrugging his arms out of his jacket tennant broke off his recital the file on richard dickie diamond your amigos at lothian and borders just faxed it over thats strangely efficient of them rebus watched from the window as a car drove down the access road it could have been strathern heading home driver in front passenger in the back a bit of a lad your dickie francis gray said he wasnt my dickie rebus responded you knew him though pulled him in a few times rebus nodded no use denying it he sat down at the opposite side of the table from the others i thought you said youd hardly heard of him john gray said eyes twinkling tennant turned another sheet i hadnt finished that tam barclay said thats because youve the reading age of a muppet gray complained as tennant handed the sheet to barclay i think i said i barely knew him rebus stated answering grays question you arrested him twice ive arrested a lot of people francis they dont all become bosom buddies he stabbed some guy in a nightclub then poured petrol into someone elses letterbox except the latter never made it as far as court youre not telling us anything we dont know jazz mccullough commented maybe thats because youre so fucking brainy jazz mccullough looked up they all looked up whats wrong john is it your time of the month or something this from stu sutherland maybe andreas not falling for johns charms after all francis gray offered rebus looked at the eyes watching him then released a pentup breath following it with a smile of contrition sorry lads sorry i was out of order which is why youre here in the first place tennant reminded him he prodded the file with a finger this guy never turned up again rebus shrugged and did a runner just before the glasgow cid could come calling rebus shrugged again did a runner or got himself disappeared allan ward said you still here allan gray said rebus studied both men there didnt seem to be much love lost he wondered if allan ward was ripe to rat out his fellow conspirators he doubted it on the other hand of the three supposed miscreants he was definitely the wettest behind the ears allans right tam barclay said diamond could have got himself killed but whichever it was it looks likely that he knew something or was scared someone would think he did rebus had to concede barclay had taken his brainy pills this morning tennant was prodding the file again this is just deadwood it doesnt tell us anything about whats happened to diamond in the years since we could circulate his description see if hes turned up on another forces turf the suggestion came from jazz mccullough good thinking tennant conceded the one thing this file does tell us though francis gray said is who dickie diamond hung around with someone like him goes walkies theres always someone who knows back then they may not have wanted to say anything but times passed you want to talk to his accomplices tennant said cant do any harm years go by stories start to get told we could ask lothian and borders to stu sutherlands suggestion was cut short by gray i believe our friends in the east are a bit tied up he glanced towards rebus isnt that right john rebus nodded the marber inquirys on the go pretty highprofile too gray added which turned out not to be johns cup of tea there were smiles at this gray had come around the table so that he could lock eyes with tennant so what do you reckon sir is it worth a day or two in auld reekie it has to be your call in the end not ours he opened his arms and gave a shrug maybe a couple of half days tennant agreed at last now what else have we got to go on as it turned out they did have something else by the end of that days play but first there were classes to attend the canteen was noisy at lunchtime everyone relieved that the top brass had come and gone tennant seemed strangely subdued and rebus wondered if secretly hed wanted them to come to watch his show it had crossed rebuss mind that tennant had to be in on it much easier to smooth rebuss way into the course as a latecomer if the chief constables had someone on the inside then there was that niggling doubt about the coincidence that their unsolved case just happened to be one rebus had worked one francis gray had worked too gray as a mole sent in by strathern rebus couldnt get thoughts of the double bluff out of his head the lasagna on his plate had flattened itself out a swirl of yellow and red rimmed with orange grease the more he stared at it the more the colors seemed to blur lost your appetite allan ward asked you want it rebus replied but ward shook his head frankly it looks like afterbirth as the description took effect allan ward smirked from behind a forkful of ham straight after lunch some of the probationers took to one of the football pitches others took a stroll around the grounds but up in crime management the wild bunch were being taught how to put together a manual of murder investigation the mmi being in the words of their tutor the bible of a good tight inquiry it had to detail avenues taken and procedures followed it showed that the investigating team had done their utmost to rebus it was paperwork and it was followed by forensic entomology at the end of which they streamed out of the classroom gives me butterflies just thinking of it tam barclay said referring to some of the slides theyd been shown then he winked and smiled down in the breakout area they sprawled on the sofas rubbing their foreheads eyes squeezed shut rebus and ward headed down a farther flight and outside for a ciggie does your head in that stuff ward said nodding thanks as rebus produced a lighter certainly makes you think rebus agreed theyd been shown closeups of putrefying corpses and the bugs and insects found on them theyd been told how maggots could help pinpoint time of death theyd been shown floaters and bloaters and human forms reduced to something more akin to melted raspberry ripple rebus thought of his uneaten lasagna and took another drag on his cigarette thing is allan we let a lot of shite get in the way we get cynical and maybe even a bit lazy all we can see are brass breathing down our necks and another load of paperwork to be completed we forget what the jobs supposed to be about rebus looked at the younger man what do you think its a job john i joined because no other profession would have me im sure thats not true ward thought about it then flicked ash into the air ach maybe not it feels that way sometimes though rebus nodded you seem to have francis on your back a lot of the time when ward looked up sharply rebus wondered if hed introduced the subject too rapidly but ward just gave a wry smile that stuffs like water off a ducks back you two know one another not really its just that im not sure francis would try it with everyone ward wagged a finger youre not so daft are you we did work one case i mean we werent close or anything understood but youre not complete strangers so he feels he can rag you a bit right right rebus took another draw on the cigarette then exhaled he was staring into the distance as though maybe there was something of interest to him in the football match what was the case he asked finally some glasgow drug dealer gangster sort of thing glasgow this guy had tentacles everywhere even as far south as your patch oh aye stranraer you know gateway to and from ireland guns drugs and cash bouncing backwards and forwards like a pingpong ball what was the guys name would i know him not now you wouldnt hes dead rebus watched for some sign from ward a pause or a hooding of the eyes but there was nothing name was bernie johns rebus made a show of running the name through his memory died in jail he offered ward nodded couldnt have happened to a more deserving bloke weve got one just like him in edinburgh cafferty ward guessed yeah ive heard of that bastard didnt you help put him away problem was they didnt keep him there rebus squashed the remains of his cigarette underfoot so you dont mind the ribbing francis is giving you dont you worry about me john ward said patting him on the shoulder francis gray will know when hes crossed the line ill make sure of that he made to turn away but stopped rebus felt a tingling in his shoulder from where hed been touched you going to show us a good time in edinburgh john ill see what i can do ward nodded there was still some steel in his eyes rebus doubted it was ever completely absent he knew it wouldnt do to underestimate ward but he still wondered if he could somehow turn him into an ally you coming ill catch you up rebus said he thought about another cigarette but dismissed the idea there were roars from the football pitch arms raised high on the sideline one of the players seemed to be rolling around on the ground theyre coming to edinburgh rebus said quietly to himself then he shook his head slowly he was supposed to be the one keeping tabs on the wild bunch and now theyd be trespassing on his patch instead theyd be sniffing around asking questions about dickie diamond rebus blew the idea away with a wave of his hand then got his mobile out and put in a call to siobhan who wasnt answering typical he muttered so instead he called jean she was shopping at napiers the herbalist which made him smile jean trusted in homeopathy and had a bathroom cabinet full of herbal medicines shed even made him use some when hed felt flu coming on and theyd seemed to work but every time he looked in her cabinet he felt he could use half the jars for cooking up a curry or a stew laugh all you like shed told him more than once then tell me which of us is the healthier now jean wanted to know when shed see him he told her he wasnt sure he didnt mention that his work would be bringing him back into the city sooner than expected didnt want that sense of expectation if they made some arrangement chances were hed have to cancel at the last minute better for her not to know im going round to denises tonight anyway she informed him good to see youre not pining youre the one whos done a runner not me part of the job jean sure it is he heard her sigh how was your weekend anyway quiet i tidied the flat did some washing drank yourself into a stupor that accusation wouldnt stand up in court how tough would it be to find witnesses no comment your honor how did the wedding go i wish youd been there will i see you next time youre in town of course and will that be anytime soon hard to say jean well take care of yourself dont i always he said ending the call with a bye before she could answer the question back inside there was excitement in the breakout area archie tennant stood with arms folded chin tucked into his chest as though deep in thought tam barclay was waving his arms around as if trying to attract attention to the point he was making stu sutherland and jazz mccullough were wanting their own say allan ward looked to have walked into the middle of it and wanted an explanation while francis gray was an oasis of calm seated on one of the sofas one leg crossed over the other a black polished shoe moving from side to side like a baton controlling the performers rebus didnt say anything he just squeezed past ward and took a seat next to gray a ray of low sunshine was coming in through the windows throwing an exaggerated silhouette of the group onto the far wall rebus wasnt reminded of an orchestra anymore but of some puppet show with only one man pulling the strings still rebus said nothing he noticed the mobile phone nestled in grays expansive crotch took out his own phone again and decided that it was heavier and older probably obsolete hed taken an earlier model to a shop because of a fault only to be told it would be cheaper to replace than fix gray was studying rebuss phone too i got a call he said rebus looked up at the tumult mustve been a good one gray nodded slowly i had a few favors outstanding so i put the word around glasgow that we were looking at rico lomax and and i got a call whoah whoah archie tennant suddenly called out unfolding his arms and raising them lets all slow down here okay the noise ceased tennant took in each man with his gaze then lowered his arms okay so weve got new information he broke off fixing his stare on gray your informants one hundred percent gray shrugged hes reliable what new information ward asked sutherland and barclay started answering until tennant told them to shut up okay so it turns out that ricos pub the one hed been drinking in the night he died was owned at the time by a certain chib kelly who we know started winching ricos widow soon after how soon after does it matter did the investigation know at the time the questions were coming thick and fast and once again tennant had to appeal for quiet he looked to gray well francis did the original inquiry team know about this search me gray said do any of you remember coming across this fact in any of the files tennant looked around received only shakes of the head big question then is it material to the case could be got to be crime of passion absolutely tennant grew thoughtful again letting the voices wash over him could be we need to talk to chib himself sir tennant looked to the speaker john rebus yeah sure ward was saying hes definitely going to incriminate himself the sneer reappeared its the proper course of action rebus said repeating a phrase theyd had drummed into them at the mmi talk johns right gray said his eyes on tennant in a real investigation wed be out there asking questions getting in peoples faces not sitting here like schoolkids on detention i thought getting in peoples faces was your precise problem di gray tennant said coolly could be but its been getting me results these past twentyodd years maybe not for much longer though the threat lay in the air between the two men seems logical to at least talk to the man rebus said after all this isnt just a test its a real fleshandblood case you werent half as keen to follow up the edinburgh angle john jazz mccullough stated slipping his hands into his pockets jazz has got a point gray said turning his head to face rebus something youre not telling us di rebus rebus wanted to grab gray and hiss at him how much do you know instead he pocketed his mobile and rested his elbows on his knees maybe i just fancy a trip to the wild west he said who says youre going allan ward asked i cant see us all in a room with chib kelly stu sutherland commented what too much like hard work for you stu ward taunted this isnt getting us anywhere tennant piped up since di rebus is suddenly all hot and bothered about proper courses of action the first thing we need to do is see whether this really is new ground and that means plowing back through the files seeing if chib kellys mentioned anywhere as landlord what was the pub called anyway the claymore gray offered its since become the dog and bone gone a bit upmarket still owned by kelly rebus asked gray shook his head some english chain all booklined walls and clutter more like walking into a junk shop than a pub the thing to do tennant was saying is get back into those files see what we can come up with we could maybe manage an hour or two gray offered looking at his watch plans for tonight francis tennant asked johns shipping us through to edinburgh for a night on the town grays hand landed heavily on rebuss shoulder make a change from the lounge eh john rebus didnt say anything didnt hear the rest of the group saying things like nice one and good idea he was concentrating too hard on francis gray wondering what the hell he was up to what the hell are you up to it was a snarling question and it came from behind the closed door there was a muffled reply the secretary smiled up at siobhan and hynds she had the telephone receiver to her ear siobhan could hear the phone buzzing somewhere behind the door then it appeared to be snatched up what the secretary actually flinched two police officers to see you mr cafferty they did make an appointment sounding apologetic a slight tremble in her voice she listened to whatever her employer was telling her then put the receiver down hell be with you in a moment if youll take a seat must be a joy to work for yes the secretary forced a smile yes he is plenty secretarial jobs going fridays scotsmans the place id start looking siobhan retreated to the line of three chairs taking hynds with her there wasnt space in the outer office for a coffee table two desks one currently occupied by the secretary the other a shambles of paperwork the place had probably been a shop until fairly recently it was sandwiched between a bakers and a stationers its large window looking onto the nondescript street they were west and south of the city center not far from tollcross the area held no fond memories for siobhan who had crashed her car once years back while confused by the range of options at the tollcross road junction five routes crisscrossing at the lights and her having not long passed her test the car a gift from her parents i couldnt work here hynds was telling the secretary he nodded in the direction of the street that smell from the bakers then he patted his stomach and smiled the secretary smiled back more from relief siobhan thought than anything else relief that hynds wasnt meaning her employer the onetime shop was now mgc lettings across the window was printed the legend the answer to your property needs when theyd arrived hynds had asked why a criminal genius would need such a boring front siobhan couldnt answer that she knew cafferty had other interests in the city predominantly a minicab firm out at gorgie the fresh paintwork and new carpet led her to believe that mgc lettings was a recent venture hope thats not one of his tenants hes got in there hynds said now if the secretary heard him she pretended otherwise shed slipped on a pair of headphones and looked to be typing out a letter from a dictation machine siobhan had picked up some of the sheets from the messy table they were listings of properties to let most were tenement flats in the less salubrious parts of town she handed one to hynds a lot of agencies theyll say things like no dss no mention of that here so ever heard of landlords cramming their flats with people from social security then ripping them off hynds looked blank the claimants have to hand over their benefit books landlord meantime gets the rent money from the dss hes quids in but this is a lettings agency anyone can walk in wanting a flat doesnt mean everyone gets one hynds took time digesting this then looked around the walls two calendars and a week planner no original works of art the door to the inner office opened and a rattylooking man shuffled quickly towards the exit then a figure filled the doorway he was wearing a white shirt nearluminous in its newness and a silk tie the color of spilled blood his sleeves were rolled up the arms thick and hairy the head was large and round like a bowling ball the wiry silver hair cropped short the eyes sparkled darkly sorry to keep you waiting the mouth said im mr cafferty how can i help you as siobhan and hynds stood up cafferty asked if they wanted tea or coffee they shook their heads donna can fetch it from the bakers he assured them no trouble still no takers so he led them into his office there wasnt much to it a desk with nothing but a telephone on it a gray fourdrawer filing cabinet a small window of frosted glass the lights were on but the place felt like a clean welllit cave a dog had risen to its feet it was a brown and white spaniel and it made straight for siobhan sniffing her feet wiping its wet nose against her hand when she held it out sit claret cafferty snapped the dog retreated to its corner nice dog siobhan commented why claret im a fiend for red wine cafferty said with a smile against one wall still shrouded in bubble wrap were what looked like three or four framed pictures or paintings reminding siobhan of the ones in marbers house hynds made straight for them though cafferty had directed him towards one of the chairs in front of the desk not got round to putting these up yet hynds asked dont know that i ever will cafferty replied siobhan had seated herself and as intended cafferty didnt know whether to focus his attention on her or hynds he couldnt keep an eye on both at once dc hynds is a bit of an aficionado siobhan explained as hynds peered at each canvas in turn is he now cafferty growled his jacket was over the back of his chair and he was sitting forward as if fearful of crushing it in some way his shoulders seemed massive siobhan thought he looked like a caged predator not quite hiding its ability to pounce heres a hastie hynds said lifting the painting so siobhan could see covered in polythene as it was she could just make out swatches of color and a thick white frame did you buy this at the preview mr cafferty no siobhan looked over to hynds none of the paintings have been moved from the exhibition she said as if reminding him oh yes he said nodding then he shook his head almost imperceptibly letting her know the vettriano wasnt there siobhan turned her attention to cafferty did you happen to buy anything on the night i didnt as it happens nothing there you fancied cafferty rested his forearms on the edge of the desk youre siobhan clarke arent you he smiled id forgotten but now i remember and what exactly is it you remember mr cafferty you work with rebus only i hear hes been stuck back in training school he made a tutting sound and detective constable hynds here his first name is david correct hynds straightened up thats right sir cafferty was nodding im impressed siobhan said keeping her voice level you know who we are so you should know why were here same reason you visited madame cyn you want to ask me about eddie marber cafferty watched as hynds walked around to the front of the desk and sat down next to siobhan it was cyn told me your name dc hynds he said with a wink you were at the private view the night edward marber was killed i was yes you didnt sign the guest book hynds stated didnt see any reason to how long did you stay at the party i arrived late stayed till just about the end a few people were heading on to dinner they wanted eddie to go with them but he said he was tired i he called for a taxi cafferty shifted his arms slightly the hesitation interested siobhan and she knew hynds had caught it as well neither of them filled the silence eventually cafferty continued i think we all left the gallery around eight or quarter past i went out for a few drinks anywhere in particular that new hotel in the scotsman building i wanted to see what it was like and after that the royal oak listened to a bit of folk music who was playing siobhan asked cafferty shrugged people just turn up and play hynds had his notebook out were you with anyone mr cafferty a couple of business associates and their names but cafferty shook his head thats a private matter and before you go saying anything i know youre going to try to set me up for this but it wont work i liked eddie marber liked him a lot i felt as miserable as anyone when i heard what happened you dont know of any enemies he might have had siobhan asked not one cafferty said not even the people hed cheated clarets ears suddenly pricked up as though comprehending this last word caffertys eyes narrowed cheated we hear tell mr marber might have been cheating his artists and clients alike charging over the odds paying too little you havent heard anything of those allegations news to me feel any different about your old friend now hynds asked cafferty glared at him siobhan was on her feet she saw claret watching her saw the dogs tail beginning to thump the floor you realize she said were not going to be able to verify your alibi unless you can give us your friends names i didnt say friends i said business associates cafferty had risen to his feet too claret sat up and im sure theyre all upstanding citizens hynds said im a businessman these days cafferty wagged a finger a respectable businessman whos unwilling to help himself with an alibi maybe thats because i dont need one lets hope thats the case mr cafferty siobhan shot out her hand thanks for taking the time to see us cafferty stared at the hand then shook it a smile flitting across his face are you as hard as you seem siobhan its detective sergeant clarke to you mr cafferty hynds felt obliged to offer his hand too and cafferty shook it a little game between the three of them pretending to be polite and objective to be on the same side cut from the same human cloth out on the pavement hynds clicked his tongue against his teeth so much for the infamous big ger cafferty dont let him fool you siobhan said quietly she knew hynds had been listening to the voice seeing the shirt and tie but shed been concentrating on caffertys eyes and theyd seemed to belong to some alien species predatory and cruel whats more he had confidence now the confidence that no prison could ever hold him siobhan was staring back in through the window and was being watched in turn by donna until a bark from the inner office had the secretary leaping to her feet running in and closing the door behind her the bark had been human he only made that one slip siobhan commented about calling the taxi siobhan nodded know what im wondering im wondering just who exactly it was called for the cab you think cafferty did she started nodding turning to face hynds and which company do you think he would call his own hynds guessed she kept on nodding then noticed an oldstyle jag parked across the road she didnt know the driver but the small figure in the back was the ratty figure whod been getting an earful from cafferty when theyd arrived she thought he was called the weasel something like that hang on here a second she told hynds then walked to the edge of the pavement checking right and left for traffic but something had been said to the driver and by the time she reached the middle of the carriageway the jag was moving off the weasels eyes staying on her through the rear window it took the horn of an approaching moped to bring siobhan back to life she trotted back to where hynds was waiting someone you know he asked caffertys righthand man something you wanted to ask him she thought about this and had to suppress a smile there hadnt been anything shed wanted to say to the weasel no reason for her to head off into the traffic except that it was something rebus would have done back at the station there was interest in the news of the missing painting marbers secretary had unearthed a color photograph which was now being copied while dci bill pryde itemized the expense the reports from that mornings cremation were being collated no one was claiming any great breakthrough the vettriano was as solid a piece of news as they had hynds was heading off to marbers house where he was due to meet cynthia bessant want to hook up for a drink later he asked siobhan sure madame cyn will let you drag yourself away he smiled but she was shaking her head quiet night for me she told him she said much the same thing half an hour later when derek linford asked her out to dinner nothing fancy just somewhere local a few of us are going when she gave him the brushoff his face hardened im trying to be nice here siobhan a few more lessons needed derek gill templer wanted a report on the missing painting siobhan kept it succinct templer looked thoughtful when her phone rang she picked it up broke the connection and left the receiver off the hook where do we go from here she asked i dont know siobhan admitted it gives us something to look for more than that it gives us a question to work on namely why that painting spur of the moment templer guessed grab the first thing that came to hand and remember to reset the alarm and lock up after you templer conceded that siobhan had a point you want to chase it down she asked if theres anything to chase ill bring my running shoes for now i think we file it under interesting siobhan watched templers face darken and thought she knew the reason why the chief super could hear john rebus mouthing nearidentical sentiments sorry siobhan said feeling color rise to her cheeks bad habit she turned to leave by the way templer said how was big ger cafferty hes bought himself a dog really think we could persuade it to be our eyes and ears this one was more nose and tail siobhan said finally making her exit whats your poison john each time he got a round in jazz mccullough asked the same question theyd driven into edinburgh in a twocar convoy rebus had agreed to be one of the designated drivers that way hed be sure not to drink too much jazz had been the other driver arguing that he didnt drink much in any case so it was no skin off his nose theyd worked solidly until six on the case notes archie tennant sticking with them all the way in the end and with nothing to show ward had invited tennant along for the evening maybe it was the looks from the other men but tennant had refused albeit graciously not likely hed said you lot could drink me under the bloody table six of them in two cars rebus acting the chauffeur while gray and stu sutherland sat in the back gray commenting that rebuss saab was a bit of a clunker and what is it you drive again francis bentley convertible gray had shaken his head i keep the bentley in the garage use the lexus as a runaround it was true he did drive a lexus a biggish model with leather interior rebus hadnt a clue how much one cost how much does one of those soak you for these days hed asked bit more than in the old days was the answer then sutherland had started yakking about the cost of cars when hed first learned to drive rebus taking occasional looks at gray in the rearview mirror really hed wanted gray and ward in the car together see if he could force them still further apart hed almost have been as satisfied if ward and gray had pushed to go with mccullough at least that would have shown them acting as a team no luck either way theyd wanted to eat first so hed directed them to a curry house on nicolson street and after that into the royal oak four drinkers were sitting in a row at the bar the ones either end were on their own the two in the middle were together all four were rolling cigarettes with the intensity of a championship contest seated in the corner a guitarist faced a mandolin player their eye contact passionate as lovers as they improvised a tune rebus and his fellow drinkers filled what was left of the tiny bar bloody hell john tam barclay said wheres the women didnt realize you were after a lumber tam they stayed at the oak for just the one drink then headed into the city center café royal abbotsford dome and standing order four pubs four more drinks a big night out in edinburgh barclay commented staring at the quiet pockets of drinkers around them i thought we were supposed to be the wild bunch tams started believing his own hype jazz mccullough said but its why weve been kicked into rehab isnt it barclay persisted we dont play by the fucking rules saliva flopped from his mouth he rubbed it away with the back of his hand i like a man who speaks his mind francis gray said laughing and slapping barclay on the back and i like one who can hold his drink mccullough muttered to rebus it would be different in glasgow wouldnt it francis what would tam a night out it can get pretty tangled thats for sure gray had his arm around barclays shoulders i mean this place for instance barclay studied his surroundings its a palace not a boozer used to be a bank rebus stated its not a proper pub see what im saying i think stu sutherland said youre saying youre pished barclay considered this his face widening into a smile could be youre right stu could be youre bang on the money there they all laughed and decided to retrace their steps maybe taking in some of the pubs theyd passed on the way rebus was of a mind to lead them down into the cowgate but even that he decided wouldnt be authentic enough for barclay the rowdier bars were the ones with teenage drinkers and thumping light shows places where the six of them would stick out like well like cops on a night out some of their ties might have been discarded but they were still in suits all except mccullough whod gone to his room to change into jeans and a polo shirt theyd given him stick about that old fart trying to look trendy when they reached the junction between south bridge and the high street francis gray suddenly veered left into the high street itself and started heading downhill towards the canongate they followed asking him where he was headed maybe he knows a good boozer barclay commented rebuss ears reddened slightly it was true that hed been sticking to the tourist route keeping the group away from his more regular haunts he wanted those pubs to remain his gray had stopped in front of a kilt shop and was staring up at the building next to it my mum brought me here when i was a kid he said what is it stu sutherland asked right here stu gray stamped his foot on the pavement this is everything that makes us what we are sutherland looked around i still dont get it its john knoxs house rebus said its where he lived bloody right it is gray said nodding anybody elses mum bring them here i came with a school trip jazz mccullough admitted aye me too allan ward said fucking boring it was too gray wagged a finger thats history youre insulting young allan our history rebus wanted to say something about how women and catholics might not agree he didnt know much about john knox but he seemed to recall the man hadnt been too keen on either group knoxland gray said stretching out his arms thats what edinburgh is wouldnt you agree john rebus felt he was being tested in some way he offered a shrug which knox though he asked causing gray to frown there was another doctor robert knox he bought bodies from burke and hare maybe were more like him gray thought about this then smiled archie tennant delivered us the body of rico lomax and were cutting it open he began to nod slowly thats very good john very good rebus wasnt sure it was exactly what hed meant but he accepted the compliment anyway the conversation had passed over tam barclays head i need a pee he said turning towards the nearest close and disappearing down it allan ward was looking up and down the street dumfries is times square compared to this place he complained then his eye caught a couple of women coming up the slope towards the group at last our luck changes he made a move forward all right there ladies listen me and my pals are strangers in these parts maybe we could buy you a drink no thanks one of the women said her eyes were on rebus something to eat then weve just eaten the other woman said was it any good ward asked he had a conversation going and wasnt about to lose it the first woman was still looking at rebus stu sutherland was standing beside the window of the kiltmakers exclaiming at the prices come on denise the first woman said hey denise and me are talking here ward snapped let them go allan rebus said jean i but jean was tugging at denises sleeve she glowered at rebus then her eyes moved to his left as tam barclay appeared from the shadows still zipping his fly rebus started to say something but her look stopped him ward was trying to prize denises phone number out of her christs sake barclay gasped i go for a slash and it all happens where are you headed ladies but the ladies were already on their way rebus stood there mute watching them go you dog allan barclay was saying did you get her number ward just grinned and winked she was old enough to be your mother stu sutherland commented my auntie maybe ward conceded some you win some you lose rebus was suddenly aware of gray standing by his side someone you know john rebus nodded she didnt look too happy with you jean was that her name rebus nodded again gray slid an arm around his shoulders johns in the doghouse he announced looks like hes bumped into the one person he shouldnt have thats the trouble with this place allan ward stated its too bloody small capital city capital village more like cheer up john jazz mccullough said come on lets have a drink sutherland mooted pointing to the nearest pub good idea stu gray gave rebus a squeeze maybe a drink would cheer you up eh john just the one rebus nodded slowly just the one he repeated good man francis gray said walking towards the door with his arm still around rebus rebus felt a tightness across his shoulders which had nothing to do with the physical contact he imagined himself after seven or eight pints suddenly breaking down and yelling into francis grays ear the secret hed kept all these years rico lomaxs murder its all down to me and then asking gray about bernie johns a quid pro quo and having gray admit to nothing smoke and mirrors john thats all it ever was youre stratherns unfinished business dont you see walking into the pub rebus was aware of jazz and ward directly behind him as if to make sure he didnt back out the taxi driver was loath to take six but relented when a healthy tip was mentioned that and the fact that they were cops it was a tight squeeze but a short trip they got out at arden street and rebus led them upstairs he knew he had lager in the fridge beer and whiskey in the cupboard plus tea and coffee the milk might not be too healthy but they could always do without nice stairwell jazz mccullough commented he meant the patterned wall tiles and mosaic floor which rebus hadnt really paid any attention to in years they climbed to the second floor and rebus unlocked the door there was some mail behind it but not much living rooms down there he announced ill fetch the drinks he went into the kitchen and filled the kettle then opened the fridge he could hear their voices sounding strange to him almost no one visited the flat jean sometimes a few others but never so many people all at once not since rhona had moved out he poured himself a glass of water from the tap and gulped it down caught his breath and then downed another what had possessed him to bring them back here it was gray whod put forward the proposition a wee nightcap at johns he tried to shake his head clear of the alcohol maybe maybe having opened his home to them theyd open up to him it had been grays idea was francis gray hoping to glean something about rebus from the visit just be careful in there john he muttered to himself suddenly he heard music becoming clearer as the volume was turned up well that might give the students next door something to think about it was led zeppelin immigrant song robert plants voice a wailing siren by the time he arrived in the living room with the cans of beer and lager allan ward was already asking for that pish to be turned off its a classic jazz mccullough informed him mccullough usually so poised in his movements was down on all fours arse to the group as he scrutinized rebuss record collection ah cheers john sutherland said taking a beer ward snatched a lager with a nod of thanks tam barclay asked where the toilet was some great stuff here john mccullough said ive got a lot of it myself hed pulled out exile on main street best album ever made what is it gray asked when told the title he grinned exiles on arden street thats us eh ill drink to that stu sutherland said speaking of which rebus held the cans towards gray who wrinkled his nose a wee whiskey maybe gray said rebus nodded i might join you not driving us back then ive had five pints francis reckon ill spend the night in my own bed might as well not much chance of spending it in jeans eh gray saw the look on rebuss face and lifted a hand palm out that was out of order sorry john rebus just shook his head asked jazz what he wanted coffee was the reply if johns staying put we can all squeeze into my car he announced rebus had located the bottle of bowmore and a couple of glasses he poured and handed one to gray any water with that dont be daft gray said toasting him heres to the mild bunch he got a laugh from tam barclay who was coming back into the room zipping his fly mild bunch he chuckled good one francis jesus tam ward complained you ever think of zipping it shut before you leave the bathroom barclay ignored him took one of the beers and opened it then slumped on the sofa next to sutherland rebus noticed that gray was sitting in the chair he himself normally used gray looked at home in it one leg slung over the side rebuss phone and ashtray were on the floor beside him jazz gray said you going to grace us with the pleasure of your backsides company all night mccullough half turned and sat himself down on the floor rebus had brought over one of the dining chairs for himself havent seen this one in years mccullough said waving a copy of the first montrose album jazz is like a pig in shit gray announced one whole room of his house is full of records and tapes alphabetical order and everything rebus took a sip of whiskey fixed a smile to his face youve been there then he asked where jazzs gray looked at mccullough who looked back at him cats out the bag gray said with a smile then turning to rebus we go back a ways me and jazz i mean it falls a long way short of a ménage à trois but ive been to the house a couple of times managed to keep that quiet sutherland said rebus was glad others were joining in aye whats the score here barclay asked theres no score mccullough said determinedly which caused allan ward to burst out laughing going to share it allan rebus asked he was wondering if ward had laughed precisely because there had been a score at the same time he wondered whether it really mattered one way or the other a few grand even a few hundred grand pocketed with no comebacks no harm done what did it matter in the wider scheme maybe it mattered if it was drugs drugs meant misery but strathern had been vague about just what the ripoff had entailed shit rebus had told strathern he wanted the details of the bernie johns inquiry tonight if possible and here he was thirtyodd miles from tulliallan finishing a glass of malt and readying for a refill ward was shaking his head gray was explaining that hed been to mcculloughs house years back and not since rebus hoped sutherland or barclay would run with it keep up the questions but they didnt anything on the box ward asked were listening to the music jazz chided him hed swapped the led zeppelin for a jackie leven cd the very album rebus would have chosen call that music ward snorted hey john got any videos a bit of the old porn maybe rebus shook his head not allowed in knoxland he said gaining a weak smile from gray how long you been here john sutherland asked twenty years plus nice flat must be worth a few bob over a hundred grand id guess gray said ward had lit a cigarette for himself and was now offering to barclay and rebus probably rebus told gray you were married werent you john mccullough asked he was studying the inner sleeve of bad companys first album for a time rebus admitted was jazz merely curious or was there some agenda here while since this place had a womans touch gray added looking around kids mccullough asked putting the album back exactly where hed found it just in case rebus had a system ive got a daughter shes down in england youve two sons right mccullough nodded twenty and fourteen thinking of them his face broke into a smile i dont want to put this man away rebus thought ward was a prick and gray as sly as they came but jazz mccullough was different jazz mccullough he liked it wasnt just the marriage and kids or the taste in music jazz had an inner calm a sense that he knew what his role was in the world rebus who had spent much of his life confused and questioning was envious and are they wild like their dad barclay was asking mccullough didnt bother answering stu sutherland pulled himself forward on the sofa youll forgive me for saying so jazz but you dont seem the type to get himself in trouble with the high hiedyins he looked around the room for confirmation its the quiet ones you have to watch though francis gray said wouldnt you agree john the thing is stu jazz answered someone gives me an order i dont agree with i just nod and say yes sir then go on with my own way of doing things most of the time they dont even notice gray nodded like i say thats the way to get away with it keep smiling and kowtowing but go your own way nevertheless kick up a big stink and theyll fillet you like the days catch grays eyes were on allan ward as he spoke not that ward noticed he was stifling a belch and reaching for a second can rebus got up to refill grays glass sorry jazz he said you never got that coffee black one sugar please john gray frowned since when did you stop taking milk since the moment i realized theres probably no milk in the house gray laughed well make a detective of you yet mccullough mark my words rebus went to fetch the coffee they finally left just after one rebus calling a cab to take them back to jazzs car he watched from the window as barclay tripped over the curb and nearly headbutted the taxis passengerside window his living room smelled of beer and cigarettes no mystery there the last thing theyd listened to on the hifi was saint dominics preview the tv was playing silently a sop to allan ward rebus turned it off but put the van morrison album back on turning the volume down until it was just audible he wondered if it was too late to phone jean he knew it was too late but wondered if he should do it anyway he had the phone in his hand stared at it for a while when it started ringing he nearly dropped it it would be one of those silly buggers calling from jazzs car maybe theyd forgotten something his eyes strayed to the sofa as he held the phone to his ear hello whos speaking you are rebus said what never mind its an old tommy cooper line what can i do for you siobhan i just thought maybe someone had broken in broken in where when i saw your lights on rebus went to the window and looked out her car was doubleparked engine still running is this some new kind of neighborhood watch i was just passing you want to come up rebus took in the nights detritus jazz had offered to help clear up if you like on you come then when he opened the door to her she sniffed the air mmm testosterone she said did you do that all by yourself not quite some of the lads from the college she wafted her hand in front of her as she entered the living room maybe if you opened a window latenight tips on housekeeping rebus muttered but he opened the window a couple of inches anyway what the hell are you doing out at this hour just driving around arden streets a bit off anyones route i was on the meadows thought id take a look the lads wanted me to show them the sights and were they duly impressed i think the city fell a bit short thats edinburgh for you she settled on the sofa ooh still warm she said wriggling her bottom i feel like goldilocks sorry i cant offer any porridge ill settle for coffee black something tells me i better say yes when he came back through with the mugs shed swapped the van morrison for mogwai thats the album you gave me he said i know i was wondering what you thought i like the lyrics hows the marber case i had a very interesting talk this afternoon with your friend cafferty people keep calling him my friend and hes not take away the r and youre getting close he was giving his lieutenant a bollocking when we arrived rebus whod just got comfortable in his chair leaned forward the weasel she nodded what for couldnt tell i get the feeling caffertys that way inclined with all his staff his secretary was so jumpy her nicknames probably skippy siobhan squirmed this coffees awful did you learn anything from cafferty he likes hasties paintings when rebus looked blank she kept going according to gallery records he hadnt bought anything from edward marber for a while he was there that night arrived late and stayed till the end he may even have helped marber get a taxi one of caffertys own im going to check in the morning that could be interesting she nodded thoughtfully what about you hows tulliallan treating you like a prince all mod cons and no stress so what have they got you doing looking into an old case an unsolved were supposed to be learning the oldfashioned virtues of teamwork and are you he shrugged were probably going to be in edinburgh the next day or two looking for leads anything i can help with rebus shook his head sounds to me like youve got your hands full as it is where will you be working from i thought we might find a spare office at st leonards siobhans eyes widened you think gills going to go for that i hadnt really thought about it he lied but i cant see a problem can you do the words tea mug and lob mean anything to you tea mug lob is that a cocteau twins track he won a smile from her so you really were just driving around she nodded its something i do when i cant sleep why are you shaking your head its just that i do the same thing or i used to im that bit older and lazier these days maybe there are dozens of us out there only we dont know about each other maybe he conceded or maybe its just you and me she rested her head against the back of the sofa so tell me about the others on this course whats to tell what are they like what would you expect them to be like she shrugged mad bad and dangerous to know she suggested bad for relationships certainly he confessed she caught his meaning immediately uhoh what happened so he told her when siobhan arrived at work on tuesday morning clutching a bag of paperwork and a cup of coffee someone was seated at her desk staring at her computer screen the someone was derek linford there was a new message scrolling across the screen itself i see lover boys back im assuming this isnt your work linford asked siobhan put the bag down no she said do you think they mean me she prized the lid from her coffee and took a sip whos doing it do you know linford asked she shook her head youre not surprised so im guessing this isnt the first time correct now if you wouldnt mind getting out of my chair linford stood up sorry he said thats all right she sat down and hit the mouse so that the screen saver disappeared did you switch the monitor off before you left last night linford was standing too close to her for comfort saves energy she told him so someone powered the system back up looks like and knew your password everyone knows everyone elses password she said not enough computers to go round we have to share and by everyone you mean she looked at him lets just drop it derek the office was filling up dci bill pryde was making sure the bible the mmi was up to date phyllida hawes was halfway down a list of phone calls the previous afternoon shed rolled her eyes at siobhan indicating that coldcalling wasnt the most thrilling part of an inquiry grant hood had been called to dcs templers office probably so they could talk media liaison hoods specialty linford took half a step back so whats your schedule for the day keeping you at arms length she wanted to say taxicabs was the actual word that came out you linford rested his hands against the side of her desk the deceaseds financial affairs a bloody minefield they are too he was studying her face you look tired thanks out carousing last night party animal thats me really i dont tend to go out much these days he waited for her to say something but she was concentrating on blowing on her coffee even though it was little more than lukewarm yes linford plowed on mr marbers financial wheelerdealings will take some unpicking half a dozen bank accounts investment portfolio vcts property just the house in edinburgh and his villa in tuscany all right for some mmm a week in tuscany would just about do me right now id settle for a week at home on the sofa you set your standards too low siobhan thanks for the vote of confidence he didnt catch her tone one slight anomaly in the bank statements it was a tease but she reacted anyway yes she prompted phyllida hawes was putting down the receiver ticking off another name starting to scribble some notes to herself tucked away in one of his accounts linford was saying quarterly payments to a lettings agency a lettings agency she watched linford nod which one linford frowned does it matter it might so happens i was at mgc lettings yesterday talking to the owner big ger cafferty cafferty wasnt he one of marbers clients siobhan nodded which is why im curious yes me too i mean why would someone with as much money as marber need to rent a place anyway and the answer is i havent quite got there yet give me a second he retreated to his desk rebuss old desk and started shifting sheets of paper siobhan had some digging of her own to do and dci pryde would have the answers what can i do for you siobhan he asked as she approached him the taxi that took the victim home sir she said which company was it pryde didnt even need to look it up that was what she liked about him she wondered if he did his homework every night memorizing facts and figures the man was a walking mmi drivers name is sammy wallace he has a few priors housebreaking fencing years back mind weve checked him out he looks clean but which company does he work for mg private hire owned by big ger cafferty pryde stared at her unblinking he had a clipboard held to his chest fingers drumming against it i dont think so he said all right if i check go right ahead you talked to cafferty yesterday she nodded and now linfords come up with a lettings agency that was getting regular payments from mr marber prydes mouth opened in an o so go do your checking he said yes sir she trawled the office noticing that linford was still sifting through paperwork grant hood came up to her holding a photocopied page from marbers guest book what do you reckon that says he asked she examined the signature could be marlowe only there was no one called marlowe on the guest list he exhaled noisily templers got you trying to sort out who was there that night siobhan guessed hood nodded most of the works been done but there are some names we cant put faces to and vice versa come and take a look he led her to his computer and opened up a file a floor plan of the gallery appeared on the screen with little crosses representing the guests another click of the mouse and the perspective changed the crosses had become figures moving in spasms around the room its the latest software he told her very impressive grant you worked over the weekend on this he nodded proud of his achievement like a kid showing off something hed made and what exactly does it add to the sum of our knowledge he looked up at her realizing she was mocking him sod off siobhan he said she just smiled is one of these stick men meant to be cafferty another click and a list of witness descriptions appeared thats cafferty hood said siobhan read down the column stocky silverhaired black leather jacket more suited to a man half his age thats him she agreed patting hoods shoulder and moving off in search of a phone book davie hynds had just come in pryde checking his watch and frowning hynds walked sheepishly into the room catching siobhan as she stood by george silverss desk a tattered copy of yellow pages in her hands i got stuck in traffic he explained theyre digging up george iv bridge i must remember that one for tomorrow he saw that the directory was open at taxi companies doing a bit of moonlighting mg private hire she said the driver who took marber home after the show hynds nodded looked over her shoulder as her finger ran down the page mg cabs she said tapping the name address in lochend owned by cafferty i dont know she said hes got that one cab firm out in gorgie exclusive cars or something her finger ran back up the page there they are again her finger tapped the name what do you think the mg stands for maybe the cabs are actually sports cars wake up davie remember his lettings agency mgc its called look at the letters of mg cabs mgc again hynds acknowledged im not just a pretty face you know it doesnt prove the firms owned by cafferty of course maybe the quickest way is to ask mr cafferty himself siobhan walked back over to her desk and picked up the phone is that donna she said when the call was answered donna its ds clarke we met yesterday any chance i could have a word with your boss she looked up at hynds who was eyeing her coffee greedily oh is he could you maybe ask him to give me a call siobhan gave the secretary her number meantime i dont suppose you know if mr cafferty happens to own an outfit called mg cabs siobhan pushed her coffee towards hynds nodding when he looked at her he smiled gratefully and took a couple of sips thanks anyway siobhan was saying putting down the receiver dont tell me hes fled the country hynds asked shes not sure where he is shes already had to cancel his morning appointments should we be interested siobhan shrugged lets give him the benefit of the doubt if he doesnt call back well go looking derek linford was marching towards the desk a sheet of paper in his hand morning derek hynds said linford ignored him here it is he said handing the sheet to siobhan the company was called superlative property management she showed hynds the name can you do anything with those letters he shook his head and she turned her attention to linford so why was mr marber paying these people two thousand pounds a quarter i dont know that as yet linford said im speaking to them today ill be interested to hear what they say dont worry youll be the first to know the way he said it siobhan felt the color rising to her cheeks she tried hiding behind her cup of coffee it would be useful to know who actually owns superlative hynds added linford glared at him thanks for the advice detective constable hynds hynds shrugged rose up onto his toes and then down again we need to liaise on this siobhan stated it looks like cafferty might own the cab company which took marber home he also owns a lettings agency might be coincidence but all the same linford was nodding well sit down together before the end of play today see what weve got siobhan nodded back it was enough for linford who turned away and strode back to his desk i cant believe how nice he is hynds said in an undertone i really think hes fallen head over heels for me siobhan tried stifling a grin but it happened anyway she looked across towards linford hoping he wouldnt see it he was staring straight at her seeing what looked like a radiant smile he returned it oh christ siobhan thought how the hell did i get into this remember those flats we saw yesterday at mgc lettings she asked hynds they averaged four hundred a month twelve hundred a quarter marbers rent cost a lot more hynds agreed wonder what the hell it is not a storage unit thats for certain she paused im sure derek will let us know hell let you know hynds said failing to hide an edge of bitterness maybe even jealousy oh christ siobhan thought again how many times do you need to hear this the cabdriver sammy wallace was in one of the interview rooms at st leonards the sleeves of his check shirt were rolled up to show arms covered in tattoos ranging from faded blueink jobs to professional renderings of eagles and thistles his greasy black hair curled over his ears and hung down past his neck at the back he was broadshouldered and sported scar tissue on his face and the backs of his hands how long since you did time mr wallace hynds asked wallace stood up abruptly whoah just stop the horses fucking dead im not having you lot dredge up shite on me just because you cant find any other bastard to stick in the frame eloquently put siobhan said calmly would you care to sit down again mr wallace wallace did so with a show of reluctance siobhan was skimming his file not really reading it how long have you worked at mg cabs three years so you

isnt he likes to help exoffenders who i mean hes been in jail himself so its natural he would siobhan broke off as though shed only just digested wallaces question your employer she said mr cafferty hes the one gave you the job right wallace looked from siobhan to hynds and back again i dont know anyone called cafferty morris gerald cafferty hynds said mg cabs has his initials and ive got stevie

to the cab office look as far as i know mg is run by my boss ellen dempsey shes the one gives me my jobs your boss is a woman hynds asked wallace just looked at him and hynds cleared his throat as if to acknowledge that it had been a stupid question siobhan had her mobile out whats the number whose number wallace asked mgs wallace gave it to her and she pushed the buttons her call was answered immediately mg cabs how may we help is that ms dempsey siobhan asked there was a pause and the voice became less welcoming who is this ms dempsey my name is detective sergeant clarke st leonards cid im currently interviewing one of your drivers samuel wallace christ not again how often do you need to hear the story until were satisfied that we have all the information we need so how can i help you could tell me how mg cabs got its name what the letters mg what do they stand for the sports car any particular reason i like them mg means youre going to get a cab fast and thats it i dont see what this has to ever heard of a man called morris gerald cafferty big ger hes got a cab outfit in the west end exclusive cars does a lot of topend business topend executives businesspeople they need mercs to collect them at the airport siobhan looked at sammy wallace she was trying to visualize him in a peaked cap and white gloves well thanks for your help i still dont see what this any idea who made the call to mg cabs which call the one ordering a car for mr marber i assume he made it himself theres no record of it weve checked his calls with the phone company what do you want me to do about it a mans dead ms dempsey plenty more clients out there ds clarke well thanks again for your help siobhan said coldly goodbye she ended the call placed the phone on the desk between her hands wallace had his own hands spread across it palms down fingers as wide apart as they would go well he said siobhan picked up a pen and played with it i think thats everything for now mr wallace dc hynds maybe you could show mr wallace out when hynds came back he wanted to know what ellen dempsey had said so siobhan told him he snorted with laughter and i thought i was making a joke she shook her head slowly mgs are fast and sporty you see thats as may be hynds said but mr wallaces car is a kreg ford rustbucket added to which when he got outside he was just getting a ticket dont suppose that thrilled him hynds sat down no i dont suppose it did he watched siobhan turning the pen over in her hands so where do we go now a uniform was standing in the open doorway wherever it is he said youve got about five minutes to move he then started dragging a stack of four tubular metal chairs into the already cramped space whats going on hynds asked i think were about to be invaded siobhan told him moreover she suddenly remembered who and why rebus had driven to tulliallan that morning only to turn around and drive back again this time taking stu sutherland and tam barclay with him hed watched the maneuverings concerning who should travel with whom gray had offered to take the lexus and allan ward had immediately volunteered to be one of the passengers you better come along too jazz gray had said my sense of directions hopeless then hed looked towards rebus you all right with stu and tam fine rebus had said wishing there was some way to bug grays car on the drive and between hungover yawns barclay kept talking about the national lottery wouldnt like to think how much ive wasted on it these past years all for good causes though sutherland told him while trying to pick bits of breakfast bacon from between his teeth with a thumbnail thing is barclay went on once youve started how can you stop week you dont put a line on is the week youll win it youre trapped sutherland agreed rebus was checking his rearview mirror the lexus was right behind him nobody inside it seemed to be speaking gray and jazz in the front ward slouched in the rear eight or nine million thats all i want barclay was saying its not like im greedy guy i know won just over a million sutherland confided he didnt even stop working can you credit that thing about the rich barclay offered they never seem to have any money its all tied up in stocks and stuff youve got a guy who owns a castle but hasnt got the price of a pack of smokes sutherland laughed from the backseat true enough tam he said rebus was wondering about that about rich men who couldnt spend their money because it was tied up or because as soon as they started to spend theyd also look conspicuous how much dyou think that lexus costs rebus asked eyes again on the rearview reckon francis had a wee lottery win himself sutherland turned his neck to peer out of the back window maybe thirty grand he said be honest its not exactly outrageous on a dis salary then how come im driving a fourteenyearold saab rebus said maybe youre not careful with your money sutherland offered oh aye rebus came back you saw as much last night every penny poured into the interior of my palatial bachelor pad sutherland snorted and went back to picking his teeth ever totted up what you spend on booze and ciggies barclay asked you could probably buy a new lexus every year rebus didnt trust himself to do the calculation ill take your word for it he said instead a legalsized packet had been waiting for him at tulliallan stratherns notes on bernie johns he hadnt had time to open it yet but was wondering if it would show any evidence at all that jazz gray and ward were high rollers maybe they had big houses or took expensive holidays or maybe they were biding their time the payoff awaiting them on retirement could that be why each man was having trouble with authority was it all a ruse to get them kicked off the force simpler surely just to tender your resignation rebus was aware of movement in his rearview the lexus was indicating and pulling out to overtake cruising past rebuss saab with a blare of its horn and allan wards face smirking at the rear window look at that silly sod barclay laughed jazz and gray were smiling and offering little waves tennants not behind us is he sutherland said turning his head again i dont know rebus admitted what car does he drive no idea barclay said dci tennant was due to follow them to edinburgh he wouldnt be able to monitor them throughout but would be kept informed itll be good to get away from those bloody closedcircuit cameras barclay said now i hate the things always think theyre going to catch me scratching my balls or something maybe theyll have cameras where were going sutherland said at st leonards rebus shook his head were still at the stage of cave paintings stu jesus christ the lexuss brake lights had suddenly come on causing rebus to slam his foot on the brake in the back sutherland was thrown forwards his face connecting with rebuss headrest barclay placed both hands on the dashboard as if preparing for impact now the lexus was speeding away red lights still glowing bastards got his fog lights on was barclays explanation rebuss heart was racing the cars had come within three or four feet of one another you okay stu sutherland was rubbing his chin just about he said rebus shifted down into second and pressed the accelerator his whole right leg trembling weve got to get them for that barclay was saying dont be stupid tam sutherland replied if johns brakes hadnt been in good nick wed have hit them but rebus knew what he had to do he had to show willing he pressed further on the accelerator the saabs engine urging him to go up a gear then just as it looked like he would ram the pristine lexus he pulled out so that the two cars were side by side the three men in the other car were smiling watching his performance tam barclay had gone very pale in the passenger seat and stu sutherland was searching in vain for the rear seat belt which rebus knew was trapped somewhere beneath the upholstery youre as bad as they are sutherland called from the back struggling to make himself heard above the whine from the engine thats the plan rebus felt like telling him instead he pressed a little harder on the accelerator and when his nose was ahead of the lexus turned the steering wheel hard cutting across grays bow it was down to gray he could brake he could go off the road or he could allow rebuss car to hit him he hit the brakes and suddenly rebus was in front again the lexus flashing its lights horn sounding rebus gave a wave before acceding to the saabs wishes and finally moving into third gear then fourth the lexus dropped its speed a little and they were a convoy again rebus eyes on the rearview knew that the three men were talking they were talking about him we could have died back there john barclay complained a tremor in his voice cheer up tam rebus reassured him if we had your lottery numbers would have come up next week then he started laughing it took a while for the laughter to cease they got practically the last two parking spots at st leonards the car park was to the rear of the actual station not very prepossessing is it tam barclay said studying the building its not much but i call it home rebus told him john rebus gray called emerging from the lexus you are one mad bad bastard he was still grinning rebus shrugged cant let some weegie go cutting me up francis it was a close one though jazz said rebus shrugged no adrenaline otherwise is there gray slapped rebuss back maybe were not such a mild bunch after all rebus took a little bow accept me he was thinking the high spirits evaporated the minute they saw their office it was one of the interview rooms equipped with two tables and six chairs leaving no space for anything else high on one wall a video camera was aimed at the main table it was there to record the various interviews rather than the wild bunch but barclay scowled at it anyway no phones jazz commented weve always got our mobiles gray said which we pay for sutherland reminded him stop griping for two seconds and lets think about this jazz folded his arms john is there any office space at all to be honest i dont think so weve a murder inquiry going on remember its pretty much taken over the cid suite look gray was saying were only here for a day or two right we dont need computers or anything maybe but we could suffocate in here barclay complained well open a window gray told him there were two narrow windows high up on the outer wall if all goes well well be spending most of our time on the street anyway talking to people tracking them down jazz was still taking the measure of the room not much space for all the files we dont need the files gray sounded ready to lose his temper we need about half a dozen sheets of paper from the files thats it his hand chopped the air jazz sighed i dont suppose weve much option it was us that asked to come to edinburgh ward admitted this isnt the only cop shop in town sutherland said we could look around see if someone else can offer better lets just get on with it jazz said his eyes meeting sutherlands and somehow finally gaining a shrug of acceptance might as well rebus said its not like were going to find anything new on dickie diamond great jazz said caustically lets try and keep those positive vibes flowing eh lads positive vibes ward mimicked i think you spent too long with johns record collection last night aye youll be wearing beads and sandals next jazz barclay added with a smile jazz gave him two fingers then they arranged the chairs to their liking and got down to work they had compiled a list of people they wanted to talk to a couple of names had been crossed off because rebus knew they were already dead hed considered not letting on leading them down blind alleys but couldnt really see the point crossreferencing and the computer at tulliallan had thrown up the nugget that one name joe daly was an informant belonging to di bobby hogan hogan was leith cid rebus and he went back a ways hogan was to be their first stop theyd been in the interview room only half an hour but already there was a bad smell about the place even with door and windows open dickie diamond used to hang out at the zombie bar jazz said reading from the notes thats in leith too right john i dont know if its still open they were always in trouble with their license isnt leith where the working girls hang out allan ward asked dont you go getting ideas young allan gray said reaching over to ruffle his hair there were voices in the corridor coming closer best we could do under the circs they wont mind roughing it dci tennant stepped into the doorway eyes widening at the scene within better stay where you are sir tam barclay warned one more in here and the oxygen runs out tennant turned to the figure beside him gill templer i did warn you it was small she said you did he admitted settling in all right men could hardly be cozier stu sutherland said folding his arms like a man not best pleased with his lot we thought wed put the coffee machine in the corner allan ward said next to the minibar and jacuzzi good idea tennant told him straightfaced thisll do us fine sir francis gray said he slid his chair back and managed to squash one of tam barclays toes under the leg we wont be here long you could almost look on our surroundings as an incentive he was on his feet now beaming a smile at gill templer im di gray since no ones seen fit dcs templer gill said taking the proffered hand gray introduced her to the other men leaving rebus till last this one youll already know gill glared at rebus and rebus looked away hoping it was just part of the act well if youll excuse me gentlemen ive a murder inquiry to run us too ward said gill pretended not to hear and headed down the corridor calling back to tennant that he might want to join her for coffee in her office tennant looked back into the room any problems youve got my mobile number he reminded them and remember ill be expecting progress anybody not pulling their weight ill find out he held a finger up in warning then set off to follow gill jammy bastard ward muttered and i bet her office is bigger than this slightly smaller actually rebus said but then theres only one of her gray was chuckling notice she didnt offer you a cup john thats because john cant hold his beverages sutherland said nice one stu maybe jazz broke in we could think about doing a bit of work and just to show willing ill use my mobile to phone di hogan he looked at rebus john hes your mate do you want to do the talking rebus nodded you know his number jazz asked again rebus nodded his head well then jazz said slipping his own phone back into his jacket might as well use your mobile eh francis grays face went pink with laughter the color reminding rebus of a baby being lifted from its bathtub he didnt mind making the call actually after all he reckoned hed had a pretty good morning so far the only thing he was wondering was when would he get a minute to himself to delve into stratherns report siobhan was splashing water on her face when one of the uniforms wpc toni jackson came into the womens toilets will we see you friday night jackson said not sure siobhan told her yellow card if you miss three weeks on the trot jackson warned her she went to one of the cubicles locked the door after her theres no paper towels by the way she called siobhan checked the dispenser nothing inside but fresh air there was an electric dryer on the other wall but it had been broken for months she went to the cubicle next to jacksons pulled at a clump of toilet paper and started dabbing at her face jackson and some of the other uniforms went for a drink every friday sometimes it went beyond a drink a meal then a club dancing away all the frustrations of the week they pulled the occasional bloke never any shortage of takers siobhan had been invited along one time honored to have been asked hers was the only cid face they seemed to accept her found they could gossip freely in front of her but siobhan had started skipping weeks and now shed skipped two in a row it was that old groucho marx thing about not wanting to be part of any club that would have her she didnt know why exactly maybe because it felt like a routine and with it the job became a routine too something to be endured for the sake of a salary check and the fridaynight dance with a stranger what have they got you doing siobhan called foot patrol who with perry mason siobhan smiled perry was actually john mason only recently out of tulliallan everyone had started calling him perry george silvers even had a name for toni jackson he called her tony jacklin or had done until a rumor had spread that toni was sister to footballer darren jackson silvers had treated her with a bit of respect after that siobhan had asked toni if it was true its bollocks shed said but im not going to let that worry me as far as siobhan knew silvers still thought toni was related to darren jackson and he still treated her with respect the toni was short for antonia i never call myself that toni had said one night seated at the bar in the hard rock café looking around to see what talent might be lurking sounds too posh doesnt it you should try being called siobhan siobhan had met almost no one who could spell her name and if they saw it written down they almost never connected it with her see oban theyd guess shivawn she would stress she had a gaelic name but an english accent toni couldnt call herself antonia because it was too posh such a strange country siobhan thought to herself from behind the cubicle door she could hear toni uttering a string of curses whats up siobhan called bloody loo rolls finished is there any next door siobhan looked shed used most of the paper drying her face a few sheets she said chuck them over here then siobhan did as she was asked look toni about friday night dont tell me youve got a date siobhan considered this actually i have she lied it was the one acceptable excuse she could think of for missing a friday session who is he not telling why dont you bring him along i didnt know men were allowed besides you lot would devour him looker is he hes not bad all right the toilet flushed but ill want a report afterwards the door clicked open and toni emerged adjusting her uniform and making for the sink no towels remember siobhan told her pulling open the door wpc toni jackson started cursing all over again derek linford was standing in the corridor directly outside it was obvious to siobhan that hed been waiting for her can i have a word he said sounding pleased with himself siobhan led him down the corridor wanting him out of the way before toni emerged she was afraid toni would think linford was her breakfast partner for saturday what is it she asked i spoke to the lettings agency and no sign that its owned by cafferty seems aboveboard the property they rented to marber is a flat in mayfield terrace only edward marber didnt live there of course not he had a bloody big house of his own he looked at her the womans name is laura stafford what woman linford smiled the woman who walked into the lettings agency and asked about renting a flat they showed her several and she took one but the rent comes out of marbers account linford was nodding one of his more obscure accounts meaning he wanted it kept hidden you think this laura woman was his mistress except he wasnt married no he wasnt siobhan chewed at her bottom lip the name laura there was something yes the sauna paradiso the two businessmen whod had a drink one of them had asked if laura was on duty siobhan wondered you going to talk to her she asked linford nodded he could see how interested she was want to tag along thinking of it he folded his arms listen siobhan i was wondering what well i know things didnt work out between us her eyes widened tell me youre not about to ask me out he shrugged i just thought friday if youre not doing anything after last time after you spying on me i just wanted to know you thats what worries me he gave another shrug maybe youve got other plans for friday something in his tone alerted her you were listening at the door she stated i was just waiting for you to come out its hardly my fault if you and your pal were yelling so loud half the station could hear he paused still want to go to mayfield terrace she weighed up her options yes she stated sure positive ooh look at the lovebirds toni jackson said pausing beside them when siobhan shot out an arm jackson actually ducked but all siobhan did was pick a remnant of toilet paper from her face mayfield terrace was only a fiveminute drive from st leonards it was a wide avenue between dalkeith road and minto street those two were busy routes in and out of the city but mayfield terrace was a quiet oasis with vast detached and semidetached houses most on three and four floors some of these had been split into flats including the one where laura stafford lived didnt suppose shed get a whole house around here for sixseventy a month linford said siobhan remembered that property was something of an obsession with him he would pore over the real estate agency guide each week comparing prices and areas what do you reckon to buy one she asked he shrugged but she could see he was doing the sums youd probably get a onebedroom conversion for a hundred k and a whole house detached or semi detached maybe seven eight hundred k he paused and rising theyd climbed four steps to the front door there were three names three buzzers none of the names was stafford what do you think siobhan asked linford stood back craned his neck ground first and top he said then he looked down to either side of the steps but theres a garden flat too must have its own door he went back down the steps siobhan following him around to the side of the house where they found the door and a buzzer with no name linford pressed it and waited when it opened a woman was standing there she was stooped and in her sixties behind her they could hear the playful yelps of a child ms stafford linford asked lauras not in shell be back soon are you her mother the woman shook her head im alexanders granny mrs dow thelma dow youre from the police arent you are we that obvious siobhan asked with a smile donny my son mrs dow explained he used to be an awful one for getting in trouble she suddenly started hes not its nothing to do with your son mrs dow were here to see laura shes gone to the shops should be here any minute do you mind if we wait mrs dow didnt mind she led them down a narrow set of stairs into the flat proper there were two bedrooms and a living room which opened into a bright conservatory the door to the conservatory was open showing a fouryearold boy playing in the back garden the living room was cluttered with toys i cant control him mrs dow said i do my best but laddies that age or any age siobhan said raising a tired smile from the woman theyve split up you know who linford asked seemingly more interested in the room than his own question donny and laura mrs dow was staring out at her grandson not that he minds me still coming here doesnt donny see much of alexander siobhan asked not much is that his choice or lauras linford asked still not paying much attention mrs dow decided not to answer turning instead to siobhan its tough enough being a single parent these days siobhan nodded or any days she added noting that this struck a chord with the woman obviously thelma dow had brought her son up by herself do you look after alexander when lauras at work sometimes yes theres a nursery he goes to too does laura work nights siobhan asked mrs dow looked down at the floor sometimes yes and you stay here with alexander siobhan watched the woman nod slowly thing is you didnt ask why were here mrs dow that would be the normal question makes me think lauras had a few runins over the years and youve become used to it i might not like what she does for a living that doesnt mean i dont understand her reasons lord knows ive been through plenty of hard times myself she paused years back i mean when donny and his brother were young and no money coming in who knows now whether that thought ever crossed my mind back then you mean you thought of going on the game linford asked coldly siobhan could have slapped him but had to content herself with a glower i apologize for my colleague mrs dow she said he has all the sensitivity of a goat linford looked at her seeming shocked by this pronouncement just then a door opened and closed feet on the steps just me thelma a voice called moments later laura stafford walked into the living room carrying two bags marked savacentre the name of the supermarket at the bottom of dalkeith road her eyes went from siobhan to linford and back again saying nothing she walked into the kitchen and started emptying the shopping it was a small kitchen not enough room for a table siobhan stood in the doorway its about edward marber she said i wondered when youd come well here we are we can talk now or make an appointment for later stafford looked up sensing that siobhan was doing her best to be discreet thelma she called think you could go play with alexander for five minutes while i get this done with mrs dow got up without a word and went into the garden siobhan could hear her talking to her grandson we havent said anything to her she said laura stafford nodded thanks she said does she know about marber stafford shook her head she was five foot four slim late twenties short black hair in a neat cut with a side parting she wore a little makeup on her face eyeliner and maybe some foundation no jewelry and a white tshirt tucked into faded blue denims opentoed pink sandals on her feet i dont look like a whore do i she said making siobhan aware that shed been staring too hard not the stereotype anyway siobhan admitted linford was in the doorway too now im di linford he said this is ds clarke were here to ask you a few questions about edward marber of course you are officer he pays for this place until the payments stop what happens then laura siobhan asked maybe ill keep the place on i havent decided you can afford it linford asked with what to siobhan sounded almost like a hint of envy i make enough stafford said you didnt mind being a kept woman his choice not mine she leaned back against the kitchen countertop and folded her arms okay heres the story but siobhan interrupted her she didnt like linford standing so close to her maybe if we sat down first she suggested they moved into the living room when linford settled into the sofa siobhan took the chair meaning laura stafford had to sit next to linford a move which seemed to make him uncomfortable you were saying he said i was going to give you the story itll be short and to the point eddie was a client of mine as youve already gathered at the sauna paradiso siobhan interrupted laura nodded thats where i met him he came in every couple of weeks or so did he always ask for you linford asked as far as i know maybe he came in sometimes when i wasnt on shift linford nodded go on please well he was always wanting to know about me some of the punters are like that but eddie was different he had that quiet insistent sort of voice in the end i started talking me and donny had split up i had alexander and we were in this poxy place in granton she paused next thing i know eddie says hes fixed me up i thought it was some kind of con thats another thing the punters do theyre always offering you stuff that never comes to anything she had crossed one leg over the other there was a thin gold chain around her right ankle eddie seemed to realize that he gave me the address and number of this lettings agency told me to head down there myself and pick out a flat for me and alexander she looked around her so here we are nice place siobhan said and what did mr marber want in return linford asked stafford shook her head slowly if there was a catch he didnt stay around long enough for me to find out what it was no home visits linford asked stafford bristled i dont do anything like that she paused im still not sure why he did it maybe he just fell for you laura siobhan said further softening her voice prepared to play nice to linfords nasty i think there was a bit of the romantic in him yeah maybe staffords eyes were glinting with emotion and siobhan knew shed said the right thing maybe thats what it was did you ever go to his house siobhan asked stafford shook her head you knew what he did for a living he sold paintings right siobhan nodded some of the paintings he owned they were taken down from the walls any idea why hed do that maybe to send to his place in tuscany you know about it he told me about it its true then stafford had obviously heard a lot of stories and boasts in her time he has a place in italy yes siobhan confirmed laura one of his paintings seems to be missing he didnt give it to you did he she held up the photo of the painting stafford looked at it but wasnt really concentrating he talked about italy she said wistfully how hed take me there one day i thought it was just she lowered her eyes eddie opened up to you then laura siobhan asked quietly he talked about himself nothing too personal a bit about his background stuff like that problems he was having stafford shook her head nothing troubling him recently no he seemed happy enough had some money coming to him i think what makes you say that linford asked brusquely i think maybe he said something about it when we were talking about this place how he could afford it and he said he had money coming yes could he have meant the exhibition laura siobhan asked i suppose so you dont really think so i dont know she looked out through the conservatory its getting cold out there alexander needs to come in just a couple more questions laura i need to ask about the paradiso stafford looked at her what about it who owns it ricky marshall you dont believe that siobhan teased her he might run the desk but thats all isnt it ive always dealt with ricky always stafford nodded siobhan let the silence lie between them for a minute have you ever come across a man called cafferty big ger cafferty stafford shook her head again siobhan let the silence lie stafford shifted on the sofa as if about to say something and all the time linford broke in that marber was paying for this place he never asked you for any extras staffords face became a mask and siobhan knew that theyd lost her no she was saying in reply to the question youll appreciate that we find that hard to believe linford said i dont siobhan interrupted her eyes on stafford while linford fixed her with a frown i believe it siobhan said then she got up and handed her card to laura stafford anytime you want to talk stafford studied the card nodded slowly well thanks again for your time linford said grudgingly theyd reached the door when they heard stafford calling from the living room i liked him you know thats more than i can say for most of them outside they walked towards linfords car in silence after theyd got in and fastened their seat belts he turned the ignition fixing his gaze on the road ahead well thanks for your support back there he said and thanks so very much for yours teamworks what its all about at the end of the day i dont remember saying i didnt believe you lets just leave it eh he fumed for a good two minutes before speaking the boyfriend or whatever he is donny dow linford nodded the mother of his kid is shacked up in a posh flat he decides to thump the sugar daddy but ends up thumping him too hard how did he know about marber maybe she told him mrs dow doesnt even know weve only the prossies word for that siobhan screwed shut her eyes dont call her that isnt that what she is when she didnt answer his look said hed won that particular argument we need to talk to him anyway siobhan opened her eyes again his mum said he used to get into trouble hell be on the files linford nodded and so will his ex maybe theres more to her than just soliciting eh he risked a glance at siobhan you think cafferty knew about the arrangement i dont even know for sure that he owns the paradiso but its likely with a nod siobhan conceded that it was she was thinking if cafferty had known about marbers crush on laura well then what what could it mean was it even possible that he had put laura up to it why would he do that she could think of reasons maybe marber had a painting or paintings cafferty wanted something marber was unwilling to sell she still didnt see how blackmail or anything like it would have helped marber was single it was the married ones you blackmailed the ones who needed to be whiter than white marber worked with artists the wealthy the cosmopolitan siobhan didnt think theyd be shocked to learn that their art dealer friend had been sleeping with prostitutes if anything it might have made him more popular had some money coming to him i think lauras words came back to her how much money and from what source enough money to get him killed enough to interest someone like big ger cafferty what do they do when they retire linford was asking signaling to pull into st leonards who working girls i mean she looks okay just now but that wont last the workll start to dry up amongst other things he failed to stifle a grin jesus derek you disgust me siobhan said so who is it youre seeing on friday night he asked leith police station was an elderly and distinguished building on the outside but referred to by most of its occupants as the geriatric pulling on his jacket as he led them back down its steps into the waiting afternoon di bobby hogan explained why its like somebody in a nursing home they might look well enough dressed presentable and all that but inside their bodys started breaking down the plumbing might leak the hearts a bit dicky and the brains given up the ghost he winked at allan ward three of them had made the trip from st leonards rebus was the obvious choice of course but tam barclay had made a song and dance about needing some fresh air and allan ward had volunteered even though rebus suspected that what the young man wanted to see were signs of prostitution the day was bright but windy hogans jacket flapped like a sail as he finally secured his arms into its sleeves he was glad of the excuse to be out of the station theyd only needed to mention the zombie bar and hed sprung up from his desk looking around him for his jacket if were in luck father joe might be there hed said referring to his snitch joe daly its not called the zombie bar anymore he explained now leading them along tolbooth wynd that place lost its license too many brawls allan ward guessed too many drunken poets and writers hogan corrected the more they tart leith up the more people seem to come looking for the sleazy side and wheres that to be found these days ward asked hogan offered a smile eyes turning to rebus weve got a live one here john rebus nodded tam barclay wasnt looking too lively as the day had progressed so had his hangover mixing the beer and whiskey he said rubbing at his temples he wasnt looking forward to their trip to the pub whats the zombie called now rebus asked hogan bar z came the answer and here it is bar z had windows which were all frosted glass except for a large letter z in the center of each the interior was chrome and gray the tables made from some light trendy wood which captured and retained every beer ring and cigarette burn the music was probably called something like trance or ambient and a chalkboard menu offered huevos rancheros listed as a texmex allday breakfast treat and snack attacks such as blini and baba ghanoush however something had gone badly wrong with the bar z the only people drinking the afternoon away were the same mixture of desperate businessmen and downattheheels drunks who had probably called the zombie bar home the place carried an aroma of soured dreams hogan pointed to one of the many empty tables and asked the trio what they wanted our round bobby rebus insisted youre the one helping us out ward decided on a bottle of holsten while barclay only wanted cola as much as you can fit in a glass hogan who said he was undecided went up to the bar with rebus is your man here rebus asked in an undertone hogan shook his head doesnt mean he wont come in father joes the restless type if he goes in a place and theres no one he knows he moves on never stays anywhere for more than two drinks does he have a job he has a vocation hogan saw the look on rebuss face dont worry hes not a real priest its just that he has the kind of face strangers tell their troubles to that seems to fill joes days to the brim the barman came up and rebus put in their order including a half of ipa for hogan and the same for himself a game of two halves eh hogan announced with a smile aye its a game all right bobby hogan picked up rebuss meaning so whats reopened this particular can of worms i wish i knew dickie diamond was an arsehole whole world knew it any of his other cronies still around theres one of them in here right now rebus looked around at the disconsolate blankeyed faces who hogan just winked and waited till the drinks had been paid for when the barman slouched back with rebuss change hogan greeted him by name okay malky the young man frowned do i know you hogan shrugged thing is i know you he paused still on the smack rebus too had placed the young man as a drug user it was something about the eyes the facial muscles something about the way the body held itself in turn the barman recognized pigs when he saw them im off that stuff malky said take your methadone religiously hogan asked with a smile di rebus here is wondering whatever happened to your uncle which one the one we dont hear about so much these days unless you know different hogan turned to rebus malky here is dickies sisters kid how long you been working here then malky rebus asked nearly a year the barmans attitude had changed from indifference to surliness did you know the place when it was the zombie i was too young wasnt i doesnt mean they wouldnt have served you rebus lit a cigarette offering one to hogan has uncle dickie turned up malky asked rebus shook his head its just that my mum every now and then she gets all weepy says uncle dickie must be dead and buried somewhere what does she think happened to him how should i know you could try asking her rebus had one of his cards out it had his pager number as well as the police switchboard id be interested to know her answer malky stuck the card in the top pocket of his shirt dying of thirst over here barclay called from the table hogan picked up two of the drinks rebus was staring at malky i mean it he said you ever hear anything id really like to know what happened to him malky nodded then turned away to answer the phone but rebus had gripped his arm where do you live malky sighthill whats it to you malky wrestled his arm free picked up the phone sighthill was perfect rebus knew someone in sighthill so what happened to this place ward was asking hogan when rebus reached the table they got their market research wrong thought thered be enough yuppies in leith by now to make them a fortune maybe if they hang on a few more years barclay said pausing halfway down his cola hogan nodded its coming he agreed just a shame we didnt get the parliament rebus snorted youdve been welcome to it we wanted it so what was the problem ward asked the msps didnt want to be in leith too out of the way maybe they were scared off by the temptations of the flesh ward proposed not that im seeing any around here the door opened and another solitary drinker entered he was all twitches and movement as if someone had just wound up his mechanism he saw hogan and gave a nod of acknowledgment but then started heading for the bar hogan however waved him over is this him ward asked already hardening his face turning it into a mask this is him hogan said then to the new arrival father joe i was wondering if your pastoral wanderings would bring you in here joe daly smiled at the joke and nodded as if it were part of some ritual between hogan and himself hogan meantime was making introductions now talk to the good men he said in closing while i fetch you a small libation jamesons and water no ice yes that would serve the purpose daly said his breath already sweetened by whiskey he watched hogan head for the bar a good man in his way he commented and was dickie diamond a good man too father joe rebus asked ah the diamond dog daly was thoughtful for a moment richard could be the best friend youd ever had but he could be a right bastard too he had no forgiveness in him you havent seen him recently not in five or six years did you ever meet another friend of his called eric lomax ward asked most people called him rico well it was a long time ago as i say daly licked his lips expectantly of course wed pay the going rate rebus informed him ah well dalys whiskey arrived and he toasted the company in gaelic rebus reckoned it was a double or treble hard to tell with the added water father joe was just about to tell us about rico rebus explained to hogan who was sitting down now well daly began rico was from the west coast wasnt he gave a good party so the story went of course i was never invited but dickie was oh assuredly this was over in glasgow barclay asked his face more bloodless than ever i suppose there would have been parties there daly admitted but thats not what you meant is it rebus asked well no i meant out at the caravans there was a site in east lothian rico stayed there sometimes caravans plural rebus checked he owned more than one rented them out to tourists and the like and the like they already knew ricos reputation bad men from glasgow sheltering beside east coast beaches rebus noticed that malky the barman was busying himself wiping down the already pristine tables in their vicinity they were pretty close then rico and dickie ward asked i dont know that id say that rico probably only came to leith three or four times a year did you think it strange rebus asked that dickie did a bunk around the same time rico was murdered cant say i connected the two daly said he hoisted the glass to his mouth drained the whiskey i dont think thats quite true father joe rebus stated quietly the glass was placed back on the table well maybe youre right i suppose i did wonder about it same as everyone else in leith and and what and what conclusion did you draw none at all daly said with a shrug except that our lord moves in mysterious ways amen to that said hogan allan ward rose to his feet said hed get another round when youve finished polishing that ashtray he remarked to malky so hed noted the barmans actions too maybe he was sharper than rebus had given him credit for linford was not to be deflected from his pursuit of donny dow hed called up what records they had and was poring over them alongside them on his desk was a slim file with laura staffords name on it siobhan had taken a peek at the latter the usual cautions and arrests two sauna busts one brothel bust the brothel had been a flat above a video rental shop the guy who owned the video shop it was his girlfriend ran the operation upstairs laura had been one of the girls on duty the night the police acting on a tipoff had paid a visit bill pryde had worked the case his handwriting was in the margin of one page of the report tipoff anonymous probably the sauna down the road the deepthroat business can be cutthroat too was derek linfords comment he was having more joy with donny dow who had been fighting since the age of ten arrests for vandalism and drunkenness then dow had taken up a healthy physical activity thai kickboxing it had failed to keep him out of trouble one charge of housebreaking later dropped several assaults one drug bust what sort of drugs cannabis and speed a kickboxing headcase on speed the mind boggles he worked as a bouncer for a time linford pointed to the relevant line of the typed report his employer wrote a letter defending him he turned the page the signature at the bottom of the letter was that of morris g cafferty cafferty owned a security firm in the city linford added parted company with it a few years back he looked at siobhan still dont think he could have clouted our art dealer im beginning to wonder siobhan admitted back at her desk davie hynds had pulled his chair up alongside and was drumming a pen against his teeth at a loose end siobhan asked i feel like the spare prick at an orgy he paused sorry that wasnt a good way of putting it siobhan thought for a moment wait here she said she turned back towards linfords desk but another man had entered the room and was shaking linfords hand linford nodded as though the two knew each other but not well frowning siobhan walked over hello she said the man had picked up a sheet from donny dows file and was reading it im a ds here names siobhan clarke francis gray the man said detective inspector he shook her hand almost swamping it in his own he was tall and broad with a thick neck and saltandpepper hair cut short you two know one another she asked we met once a while back at fettes right gray said right linford confirmed weve helped each other out by phone a couple of times i was just wondering how the inquiry was going gray added its fine siobhan said youre part of the tulliallan crew for my sins gray put down the sheet of paper picked up another looks like derek here may be winding things up for you oh hes a great windup merchant siobhan said crossing her arms gray laughed and linford himself joined in siobhans a bit of a doubting thomas he stated grays eyes widened means motive opportunity looks to me like youve got two out of three least you can do now is interview the suspect thank you di gray maybe well take your advice the words came from behind gray gill templer had entered the room gray dropped the sheet it wafted back to the desk might i ask what youre doing here nothing maam just out for a stroll we have to take ten minutes every hour to stave off oxygen starvation i think youll find the station has plenty of corridors theres even a world outside if youd care to explore it this on the other hand is the center of a murder inquiry last thing we need are unnecessary interruptions she paused wouldnt you agree absolutely maam he glanced from siobhan to derek my apologies for keeping you from your noble efforts and with a wink he was off templer watched him leave then saying nothing but with a twinkle in her eye she headed back to her own office siobhan felt like cheering shed been about to have a go at gray herself but doubted she could have scored so palpable a hit dcs gill templer had just risen like a rocket in siobhans estimation she can be a cold bitch cant she linford muttered siobhan didnt respond she wanted a favor from linford and upsetting him wasnt going to help derek she said since youre hell for leather on donny dow mind if hynds takes a look at marbers cash flow i know youve covered the ground already but itll give the poor sod something to do she stood there hands behind her back hoping she didnt look and sound too drippy linford gazed in hyndss forlorn direction go ahead he said reaching down to pull the relevant folder from the box on the floor beside him thanks siobhan cooed skipping back to her desk here you go she said to hynds her voice back to normal whats this hynds asked staring at the folder but not touching it marbers finances laura stafford seemed to think he had some big money coming to him i want to know the why when and how much and his records will tell me siobhan shook her head but his accountant might the name and phone number are in there she tapped the file and dont say im not generous who was that big bastard you were speaking to hynds nodded in the direction of linfords desk detective inspector francis gray hes part of the tulliallan posse hes a big bloke the bigger they are the harder they fall davie if that bugger ever looks like falling heres hoping were not in the vicinity he stared at the folder anything else i should be asking the accountant you could ask him if theres anything hes been hiding from us or his client might have been hiding from him rare paintings bundles of cash thosell do for a start she paused think you can manage this one on your own davie hynds nodded no problem ds clarke and what will you be up to while im toiling at the workface i have to go see a friend she smiled but dont worry its strictly business lothian and borders police hq on fettes avenue was known to most of the local force as the big house either that or rear window which didnt refer to the hitchcock film but to an embarrassing episode when vital documents had been stolen from the building by someone whod climbed in through an open window on the ground floor fettes avenue was a wide thoroughfare which ended at the gates to fettes college tony blairs old school fettes was where the toffs sent their kids paying dearly for the privilege siobhan had yet to meet any police officers whod been schooled there though she knew a few from edinburghs other feepaying schools eric bain for example had spent two years at stewarts melville years he described simply as rough why rough she asked now as they walked down the firstfloor corridor i was overweight wore specs and liked jazz enough said siobhan made to turn into a doorway but bain stopped her shed just been priding herself on her remembrance of the buildings geography having served in the scottish crime squad for a time theyve moved bain told her since when since the scs became the sdea he led her two doors farther along and into a large office this is what the drug enforcement agency get me im in a closet next floor up so why are we here bain seated himself behind a desk siobhan found a chair and dragged it across because he answered for so long as the sdea need me i get a window and a view he swiveled on his chair peering out at the scenery there was a laptop computer on the desk a pile of paperwork beside it on the floor were stacked little black and silver boxes peripherals of some description most of them looked homemade and siobhan would bet that bain had constructed them himself maybe even designed them too in a parallel universe somewhere a billionaire eric bain was sitting by the pool of his californian mansion and the edinburgh police were struggling with cybercrimes of all descriptions so what can i do for you he asked im wondering about cafferty i need some confirmation that he owns the sauna paradiso bain blinked a couple of times is that it an email or phone call would have sufficed he paused not that im not pleased to see you she considered her response linfords back maybe i just wanted an excuse to get away linford major peeping tom himself shed told bain all about linford it had come spilling out almost the first night hed visited her shed told him why she was wary of visitors why she closed her shutters most evenings hes filling in for rebus a tough job for anyone he watched her nodding so hows he acting as slimy as i remember i dont know he seems to be trying and then he lets the mask slip ugh she shifted in her seat look i really didnt come here to talk about derek linford no but im sure it helps she smiled acknowledging the truth of this cafferty she said caffertys finances are byzantine we cant be sure if people are fronting for him or if he might have money sunk into someone elses scheme a sort of silent partner or shareholder with nothing put down in writing these arent people who worry too much about the department of trade and industry so what have you got bain was already firing up his laptop not a whole lot he confessed claverhouse and ormiston seemed interested for a while but that appears to be passing theyve gotten all excited about something else something theyre not exactly willing to share not long now till im dispatched to the broom closet why were they interested my guess is that they want cafferty back behind bars so it was just a speculative trawl you have to speculate to accumulate siobhan bain was reading what was written on the screen siobhan knew better than to maneuver around behind him to read it for herself he would shut the screen down rather than let her see it was a question of territory for him despite their friendship he could snoop around her flat checking her cupboards and cds but there were things he felt he had to hide from her keeping that slight but tangible distance no one it seemed was allowed to get too close to bain friend cafferty he said now has interests in at least two edinburgh saunas and may have spread his wings as far as fife and dundee the thing about the paradiso is we dont really know who owns it theres a paper trail but it leads to semirespectable business types who probably are a front for someone else and youre guessing that someone is cafferty bain shrugged like you say its a guess siobhan had a thought what about taxi companies bain hit some more keys yep private hire firms exclusive cars in edinburgh and a few smaller outfits dotted around west lothian and midlothian not mg cabs where are they based lochend bain studied the screen and shook his head you know cafferty runs a lettings agency siobhan asked he started that particular venture two months ago do you know why she waited while bain considered her question he shook his head watching her care to make a guess she asked i havent a clue siobhan sorry is it relevant right now eric i dont know whats relevant im drowning in information only none of it seems to add up to anything maybe if you reduced it to binary he was making fun of her so she stuck out her tongue and to what do we owe this honor a voice boomed it was claverhouse sauntering into the office followed so closely by ormiston that the two might have been connected by ankle chains just visiting siobhan said trying not to sound flustered bain had assured her the two sdea men were out for the afternoon claverhouse slipped off his coat and hung it on a coat stand ormiston dressed for outdoors kept his jacket on hands in its pockets and hows your boyfriend claverhouse asked siobhan frowned did he mean bain last seen at tulliallan ormiston added i hear hes got someone his own age claverhouse said mockcasually that must piss you off shiv siobhan stared at bain who was reddening readying to leap to her defense she managed to shake her head just enough for him to register the act she had a sudden vision of bain as a schoolkid bullied but fighting back earning even more derision and hows your love life claverhouse she countered ormie treating you okay claverhouse sneered immune to such jibes and dont call me shiv she added she could hear a phone trilling distantly it was hers tucked deep down in her bag she wrestled it out and held it to her ear clarke she said you wanted me to call you the voice said she placed it immediately cafferty she took a second to compose herself i was wondering about mg cabs she said mg ellen dempseys outfit one of their drivers took edward marber home so so it seemed like a strange coincidence mg cabs having the same initials as your lettings agency siobhan had forgotten about the people around her she was focusing on caffertys words his phrasing and tone of voice thats what it is though a coincidence i noticed it myself a while back even thought of stealing the name why didnt you mr cafferty siobhan with the phone tucked into her chin couldnt see behind her but bain was suddenly staring over her shoulder she glanced round and saw that claverhouse was as rigid as a statue because he knew now who was on the phone ellens got friends siobhan cafferty was saying what sort of friends the sort its not worth crossing she could almost see his cruel cold smile i doubt theres anyone you wouldnt cross mr cafferty she offered youre saying you have no dealings with mg cabs none whatsoever out of curiosity who was it called a cab that night not me im not saying it was probably marber himself you didnt see him do it you reckon mg cabs had something to do with it i dont reckon anything mr cafferty im just going by the book i find that hard to believe what do you mean all that time with rebus didnt anything rub off on you she chose not to answer something else had occurred to her how did you get this number i called the station one of your colleagues gave me it which one she didnt like the idea of cafferty having access to her mobile the one i spoke to i dont remember the name she knew he was lying im not about to start stalking you siobhan just as well for you youve got more balls than tynecastle did you know that goodbye mr cafferty she cut off the call sat and watched the display for a moment wondering if hed call back mr cafferty she calls him claverhouse exploded what was all that about he was returning a call did he happen to know where you were i dont think so she paused only davie hynds knew i was coming here and me bain added and you she conceded but he got my mobile number from someone at st leonards i dont think he knew i was here claverhouse was pacing the room while ormiston rested his bulk against the edge of one of the desks hands still in his pockets it took more than a call from cafferty to fire him up cafferty claverhouse exclaimed right here in this room you should have said hello ormiston suggested his voice a quiet growl its like hes infected this fucking place claverhouse spat but his pace was slowing whats your interest in him he finally got round to asking he was one of edward marbers clients siobhan explained he was at the gallery the night marber was killed thats your man then claverhouse decreed look no further it would be nice to have some proof though siobhan told him is that what brains is helping you with ormiston asked i wanted to know about caffertys relationship with the sauna paradiso she admitted why because the deceased may have been a client she was hedging her bets not wanting to give away too much it wasnt just the rebus connection even between cops on the same force there was this mistrust this unwillingness to dilute information by spreading it around blackmail then claverhouse said thats your motive i dont know siobhan said theres a rumor marber might have been cheating clients bing claverhouse said snapping his fingers every frame you put on the wall cafferty fits it perfectly an interesting image under the circs bain commented siobhan was thoughtful who would cafferty not want to tangle with she asked you mean apart from us ormiston said with the beginnings of a smile for a while hed sported a bushy black mustache but had shaved it off siobhan noticed that the difference made him seem younger apart from you ormie she said why claverhouse asked what did he say hed stopped pacing but couldnt get comfortable standing legs apart in the middle of the room arms folded some vague mention of people he didnt want to cross he was probably bullshitting ormiston said bain scratched his nose anybody out there we dont know about claverhouse shook his head caffertys got edinburgh sewn up tight siobhan was only half listening she was wondering if ellen dempsey maybe had friends outside edinburgh wondering if it would be worthwhile taking a look at the owner of mg cabs if dempsey wasnt fronting for cafferty was it possible she was doing it for someone else someone trying to break caffertys grip on the city a little warning bell went off in her head because if this was true then wouldnt cafferty have every reason for framing dempsey ellens got friends siobhan the sort its not worth crossing his voice had been seductive intimate almost reduced to a murmur hed been trying to get her interested she doubted he would do that without a reason without some ulterior motive was cafferty trying to use her only one way to find out take a closer look at mg cabs and ellen dempsey as she zoned back in on the conversation ormiston was saying something about how claverhouse and he should try to get some shuteye surveillance op bain guessed ormiston nodded but when bain pressed for details he just tapped his nose top secret claverhouse stated backing up his colleague his eyes were on siobhan as he spoke it was as if he suspected knew even that she wasnt telling him the full story about herself and cafferty she thought back to the time shed spent at fettes as part of the crime squad team claverhouse had referred to her as junior but that seemed like a lifetime ago she returned his stare confidently when claverhouse blinked first it almost seemed like a victory and you havent seen him since the woman shook her head she was seated in her fifthfloor flat in the fort a highrise on the edge of leith there would have been great coastal views from the windows of the cramped living room if they hadnt been so filthy the room smelled of cat pee and leftovers not that rebus could see any physical evidence of cats the womans name was jenny bell and she had been dickie diamonds girlfriend at the time hed disappeared when the door had been answered by bell barclay had given rebus a look which seemed to suggest that he could see why diamond had done a midnight flit bell wore no makeup and her clothes were shapeless and gray the seams of her slippers had given way and so had her teeth leaving her mouth shrunken and lacking the dentures she probably wore when expecting company this made her speech difficult to understand especially for allan ward who sat now on the arm of the sofa a frown of concentration drawing his eyebrows together havent clapped eyes on him bell stated hedve gotten a good kicking if i had what did everyone think when he offskied rebus asked that he owed money i suppose and did he me for starters she said jabbing a finger into her prodigious bosom nearly two hundred he had from me in one go she shook her head bit here bit there how long had you been an item barclay asked four five months was he staying here sometimes there was a radio playing somewhere either in another room or in the flat next door two dogs were involved in some noisy challenge outside jenny bell had the electric heater on and the room was stifling rebus didnt suppose it helped that he and ward had been drinking adding alcoholic fumes to the general miasma bobby hogan had given them bells address but made some excuse and headed back to the station rebus didnt blame him miss bell he said now did you ever go to the caravan with dickie a few weekends she admitted almost with a leer meaning dirty weekends rebus could sense ward give an involuntary shiver as the image filled his consciousness bells eyes had narrowed she was concentrating on rebus ive seen you before havent i could be rebus admitted i do a bit of drinking down this way she shook her head slowly this was a long time back in a bar like i say werent you with dickie rebus shook his head ward and barclay were studying him hogan had hinted that bells memory was shot to hell hogan had been mistaken about the caravan rebus pressed on whereabouts was it exactly somewhere port seton way you knew rico lomax didnt you oh aye nice man rico ever go with dickie to one of his parties she nodded vigorously wild times she grinned and no neighbors to kick up a stink unlike here you mean ward guessed at which point someone through the wall started shouting at their offspring im telling you to clean that up bell stared at the wall aye not like here she replied theres more space in a bloody caravan for a start what did you think when you heard rico had been killed barclay asked she shrugged what was there to think rico was what he was and what was he you mean apart from a bloody good shag she started cackling offering a view of pale pink gums did dickie know ward asked dickie was there she declared he didnt object ward asked she just stared at him i think rebus explained for wards benefit miss bell is saying that dickie was a participant bell grinned at the look on wards face as he digested this then she started cackling again is there a shower at st leonards ward asked on the drive back reckon you need one half an hours scrubbing should suffice he scratched his leg which made rebus start to feel itchy thats an image that will be with me to the grave barclay stated allan in the shower rebus teased you know damned well what i mean barclay complained rebus nodded they were quiet for the rest of the journey rebus lingered in the car park saying he needed a cigarette after ward and barclay had disappeared inside he reached for his mobile called enquiries and got the number for calder pharmacy in sighthill he knew the pharmacist there a guy called charles shanks who lived in dunfermline and taught kickboxing in his spare time when his call was answered he asked for shanks charles john rebus here look do pharmacists have some kind of hippocratic oath why the voice sounded amused and a little suspicious i just wanted to know if you were doling out methadone to an addict called malky taylor john im really not sure i can help all i want to know is whether hes doing okay sticking with the program hes doing fine shanks said thanks charles rebus ended the call slipped the phone back into his pocket and headed indoors francis gray and stu sutherland were in the interview room talking with barclay and ward wheres jazz rebus asked he said he was going to the library sutherland answered what for sutherland just shrugged leaving gray to explain jazz thinks it would help to know what else was happening in the world around the time rico got hit and mr diamond did his vanishing act how did you get on in leith zombie bars gone downwardly upmarket ward commented and we talked to dickies old girlfriend he made a face to let gray know what he thought of her her flat was skanky barclay added im thinking of investing in some disinfectant mind you ward said mischievously i think she might have serviced john here sometime in the dim and distant past grays eyebrows rose that right john she thought she recognized me rebus stressed she was mistaken she didnt think so ward persisted john gray pleaded tell me you never shagged dickie diamonds bird i never shagged dickie diamonds bird rebus repeated just then jazz mccullough walked in through the door he looked tired rubbing his eyes with one hand and carrying a sheaf of papers in the other glad to hear it he said having just caught the last few words find anything at the library stu sutherland asked as if doubting that jazz had been within a hundred yards of one jazz dropped the sheets onto the desk they were photocopies of newspaper stories look for yourself he said as they passed the sheets among them he explained his reasoning we had the newspaper cuttings at tulliallan but they were focusing on ricos murder and that was a glasgow case which meant the glasgow paper the herald had covered the story more comprehensively than its east coast rival but now jazz had gone to the scotsman finding a few scant references to the disappearance of a local man richard diamond there was a grainy photograph it looked like diamond leaving a courtroom buttoning his check jacket his hair was longish sticking out over the ears his mouth hung open teeth angular and prominent and he had stubby little eyebrows skinny and tall with what looked like acne on his neck a bonnylooking bugger isnt he barclay commented does this lot tell us anything new gray asked it tells us o j simpsons going to catch his wifes killer tam barclay said rebus looked at the front page there was a picture of the athlete after his acquittal the paper was dated wednesday october hopes rise for an end to deadlock on ulster ward said quoting another headline he looked around the table thats encouraging jazz picked up one sheet and held it in front of him police stymied in hunt for manse rapist i remember that tam barclay said they drafted officers in from falkirk and livingston stu sutherland added jazz was holding the sheet for rebus to see you remember it john rebus nodded i was on the team he took the photocopied story from jazz and started to read it was all about how the inquiry was running out of steam no result in sight officers were being sent back to their postings a core of six officers will continue to sift information and seek out new leads those six had eventually dwindled to three rebus not among them there wasnt much in the story about the assault itself which was as brutal as anything rebus had seen in his years on the force a church manse in murrayfield leafy murrayfield with its large expensive homes and pristine avenues it had started as a breakin most probably silver and valuables had been taken in the raid the minister himself had been out visiting parishioners leaving his wife at home early evening and no lights on that was probably why the man just the one attacker according to the victim had chosen the manse it was next door to the church hidden behind a tall stone wall and surrounded by trees almost in a world of its own no lights on meant no one home being blind however the victim had needed no lights shed been in the bathroom upstairs the clatter of breaking glass shed been running a bath thought maybe shed misheard or it was kids outside a bottle thrown the manse had a dog but her husband had taken it with him to give it a walk she felt the breeze from the top of the stairs there was a telephone in the hall next to the front door and she put one foot on the first step down heard the floorboard creak decided to use the phone in the bedroom instead she almost had it in her hand when he struck snatching her by the wrist and twisting her around so that she fell onto the bed she thought she remembered the sound of him turning on the bedside lamp im blind shed pleaded please dont but he had giving a little laugh afterwards a laugh that stayed with her during the months of the inquiry laughing because she couldnt identify him it was only after the rape that he tore her clothes off punching her hard in the face when she screamed he left no fingerprints just a few fibers and a single pubic hair hed swept the phone to the floor with his arm and then stamped on it hed taken cash small heirlooms from the jewelry box on her dressing table none of the missing items ever turned up he hadnt said anything she could give little sense of his height or weight no facial description from the start officers had refused to voice their thoughts theyd given it their best shot the business community had put up a reward for information the pubic hair had given police a dna fingerprint but there hadnt been a database around back then theyd have to catch the attacker first then make the match it was a bad one rebus conceded did they ever catch the bastard francis gray asked rebus nodded just a year or so back he did another breakin assaulted a woman in her flat this was down in brighton dna match jazz guessed rebus nodded again hope he rots in hell gray muttered hes already there rebus conceded his name was michael veitch stabbed to death his second week in prison he shrugged it happens doesnt it it certainly does jazz said i sometimes think theres more justice meted out in jails than in the courts rebus knew he had just been given an opening youre right remember that gangster who got stabbed in the barl bernie johns was that his name but it felt too obvious if he said it aloud it would alert them put them on their guard so he held back wondering if hed ever take the chance got what he deserved anyway sutherland stated not that it did his victim much good rebus added whys that john jazz asked rebus looked at him then held up the sheet of paper if youd extended your search a few weeks youd have found she committed suicide shed become a recluse by then couldnt stand the thought of him still being out there weeks rebus had worked on the manse inquiry chasing leads provided by informants desperate for the cash reward chasing bloody shadows bastard gray hissed under his breath plenty of victims out there ward suggested and were stuck with a toerag like rico lomax working hard are we it was tennant standing in the doorway making lots of lovely progress for your sio to report to me weve made a start sir jazz said his voice full of confidence but his eyes betraying the truth plenty of old news stories anyway tennant commented his eyes on the photocopies i was looking for possible tieins sir jazz explained see if anyone else had gone missing or any unidentified bodies turned up and and nothing sir though i think ive discovered why di rebus didnt seem overly helpful when glasgow cid came calling rebus stared at him could he really know here rebus was supposedly infiltrating the trio and every move they made seemed calculated to undermine him first rico lomax now the murrayfield rape because there was a connection between the two and that connection was rebus himself no not just rebus rebus and cafferty and if the truth came out rebuss career would cease to be on the skids it would be a car wreck go on tennant pressed he was involved in another inquiry sir one he was loath to take time out from jazz handed the rape story to tennant i remember this tennant said quietly you worked it john rebus nodded they pulled me off it to look for dickie diamond hence your reluctance hence my perceived reluctance sir like i said i helped the glasgow cid as much as i could tennant made a thoughtful sound and does this get us anywhere nearer mr diamond di mccullough probably not sir jazz conceded three of us went down to leith sir allan ward piped up interviewed two individuals who had known him it seems diamond may have shared his old lady with rico lomax on at least one occasion tennant just looked at him ward fidgeted a little in a caravan he went on eyes darting to rebus and barclay for support john and tam were there too sir tennants eyebrows shot up in the caravan ward reddened as laughter filled the room in leith sir tennant turned to rebus a useful trip di rebus as fishing expeditions go ive been on worse tennant was thoughtful again the caravan angle is there any mileage in that could be sir tam barclay said feeling left out its something i feel we should follow up dont let me stop you tennant told him then he turned to gray and sutherland and meantime you two were making phone calls gray announced calmly trying to locate more of diamonds associates but still finding enough time to go walkabout eh francis gray knew hed been rumbled decided silence was the best policy dcs templer tells me you were nosing around her inquiry yes sir she wasnt happy about it and she came crying to you sir ward said belligerently no dc ward she quite properly mentioned it to me thats all theres us and theres them ward went on his eyes scanning the wild bunch rebus knew what he meant it wasnt so much a team thing more something approaching a siege mentality theres us and theres them except that rebus didnt feel that way instead he felt isolated inside his own head because he was a mole brought here to con the group and now working a case which if solved would be his ruin take this as a warning tennant was telling gray youre saying we shouldnt fraternize gray asked were a leper colony now are we were here through the good graces of dcs templer this is her station and if you want to get through this course he paused to allow them to prepare for his next words youll do exactly what youre told understood there were mutters of grudging acquiescence now get back to work tennant said checking his watch im headed back to base and ill expect to see all of you at tulliallan tonight just because youre in the big city dont think youre here on anything other than parole after hed gone they sat staring into space and at each other wondering where they went from here ward was first to speak that guy should be in porn films barclay frowned whys that then allan ward looked at him tell me tam when did you last see a bigger prick the laughter eased some of the tension not that rebus felt inclined to join in he was imagining a blind woman suddenly feeling a strangers hand grab her wrist he was thinking of the terror involved there was a question hed asked of a psychologist at the time blind or sighted which would have been worse the psychologist had just shaken his head unable to provide an answer rebus had gone home and fashioned a blindfold for himself hed lasted all of twenty minutes then had collapsed into his chair his shins bruised crying himself towards sleep he took a break now and went to the toilet gray warning him not to stray too close to the real detectives when he walked in derek linford was shaking his hands free of water no towels linford said explaining his actions he was studying his appearance in the mirror above the sinks i heard you were filling my shoes said rebus approaching the urinals i dont think weve got anything to say to one another do you fair enough the silence lasted only half a minute im about to do an interview linford couldnt help revealing he tucked a stray hair behind one ear dont let me keep you rebus said as he faced the urinal he could almost feel linfords eyes drilling into his back then the door swung open again it was jazz he started to introduce himself to linford but was interrupted sorry ive got a suspect waiting for me by the time rebus had zipped himself up linford was gone was it something i said jazz mused the only people linford gives the time of day to are ones he thinks he should be sucking up to career opportunist jazz said nodding his understanding he went to the sink and ran his hands under the cold tap what was that clash song again career opportunities thats the one i always felt i wasnt supposed to like the clash too old not political enough i know what you mean a good bands a good band though rebus watched jazz looking around for a towel of some kind cutbacks rebus explained jazz sighed and took out his handkerchief that night we ran into your your girlfriend was it he waited till rebus nodded everything sorted now between the pair of you not exactly they never tell you when you join do they that being a cop will screw up your love life youre still married though jazz nodded its never easy though is it he paused that rape inquiry got to you i could see it in your eyes the moment you read that story you were back in the middle of it a lot of cases have got to me over the years jazz why let them i dont know rebus paused maybe i used to be a good cop good cops put up barriers john is that what you do jazz took his time before answering end of the day its just a job not worth losing sleep over never mind anything else rebus saw an opening i started coming to that same conclusion maybe too late though ill be retiring soon meaning meaning all thats waiting for me out there is a lousy pension this jobs taken away my wife my kid most of the friends i ever had thats pretty tough rebus nodded and whats it given me apart from the drinking problem and lack of discipline rebus smiled apart from those yes i cant answer that john rebus let the silence rest between them then asked the question hed been preparing for you ever crossed the line jazz i dont mean the little things the shortcuts we take i mean something big something you had to learn to live with jazz stared at him why have you rebus wagged a finger i asked first jazz grew thoughtful maybe he said just the once rebus nodded ever wished you could go back and change it john jazz paused are we talking about me or you here i thought we were talking about both of us jazz took half a step closer you know something about dickie diamond dont you maybe even about ricos murder maybe rebus conceded so whats your big secret jazz is it something we can work out between us rebuss voice was almost a whisper inviting confession i hardly know you jazz stated i think we know one another well enough i jazz swallowed youre not ready yet he said with something akin to a sigh im not ready what about you jazz john i dont know what it is you ive been getting an idea something to make my pension that touch more secure thing is id need help people i could trust were talking something illegal rebus nodded youd need to cross that line again how risky not very rebus considered maybe medium jazz was about to say something but the door flew open and george silvers sauntered in afternoon gents he said neither rebus nor jazz returned the greeting being too busy staring one another out then jazz leaned towards rebus talk to francis he whispered and then he was gone silvers had gone into one of the cubicles but reemerged almost immediately no bloody bog roll he complained then he stopped what you grinning at progress george rebus said then youre doing a sight better than our lot silvers muttered disappearing into the second cubicle and slamming shut the door derek linford wasnt best pleased rebus and his cronies had been installed in interview room which was larger than ir where linford now sat also in ir the windows didnt open the place was stifling an airless box the desk was narrow and screwed to the floor this was where you brought the suspects with a record of violence there was a dual cassette recorder bolted to the wall and a video camera high up above the door there was a panic button disguised to look like an ordinary light switch linford was seated alongside george silvers opposite them sat donny dow dow was short and skinny but his squaredoff shoulders told you there was muscle on him he had straight blond hair a dye job and three days growth of dark stubble he wore gold studs and loops in both ears another stud in his nose a small golden sphere glinted from where his tongue had been pierced he had his mouth open licking the edges of his teeth what you working at these days donny linford asked still a doorman im answering nothing till you tell me what this is all about shouldnt i have a solicitor or something what do you want us to charge you with son silvers asked i dont do drugs good boy dow scowled and gave silvers the middle finger its your ex were interested in linford revealed dow didnt blink which one alexanders mum lauras a hooker dow stated and you left her for a prop forward silvers asked with a smile but dow stared at him blankly not a rugby man then whats she done anyway dow asked linford a man she was seeing were interested in him seeing linford nodded rich guy set her up in a nice little flat well not so little actually dow bared his teeth and thumped the desk with both fists that wee slut and shes the one got custody did you fight her for it fight fighting meant only one thing to someone like dow i mean linford rephrased did you want custody of alexander hes my son linford nodded again knowing the answer to his question was no whos this fucker anyway this rich guy hes an art dealer lives out in duddingston village and shes in his flat her and alex shagging this bastard there with alex dows face had gone puce with rage in the momentary silence linford could hear voices maybe a laugh from ir those sods were probably laughing at the idea of him demoted to ir so whats this got to do with me dow was asking you just trying to get me wound up or what youve got quite a record of violence mr dow silvers said dows file was on the desk and silvers patted its brown cardboard cover what a couple of assaults ive been hit more times than i can count see when i was bouncing wasnt a week went by when i didnt have some knobhead having a go at me you wont find any of that in there he pointed towards the file you lot only see what it suits you to see you might have a point there donny silvers said leaning back in his chair and folding his arms what we see donny linford said quietly is a man with a record of violence who has just gone into a rage over his exs relationship with another bloke fuck her see if i care dow slid his chair back and stuffed his hands into his pockets both legs going like pistons linford made a show of flipping through the file mr dow he began did you happen to read about a murder in the city only if it made the sports pages an art dealer struck repeatedly on the head outside his home in duddingston village dows legs stopped pumping hold on a fucking minute he said raising both hands palms out what did you say you did for a living george silvers asked what wait a second lauras gentleman friend is dead mr dow linford was saying you worked as a bouncer for big ger cafferty didnt you silvers asked dow couldnt keep up with this he needed time to think couldnt think and knew if he said anything anything it might a tapping at the door and siobhan clarkes head appeared any chance i could sit in she asked then seeing the thunderous looks on both her colleagues faces she started to retreat but dow had sprung to his feet and was on his way to the door silvers went for him but dow gave him a straightfingered chop to the throat silvers started wheezing hands going to his collar linford was effectively trapped between silvers the desk and the wall dow lifted a foot and hefted silvers backwards into linford whose fingers sought the panic button siobhan had been trying to close the door with herself on the outside but dow couldnt have that he yanked the door open grabbed her by her hair and threw her into the room an alarm was going off in the corridor but he ran there were men in the room next door they watched him as he sped past one more corner a set of doors and he would be gone back in ir silvers was hunched in his seat still trying to catch a breath linford was squeezing past him siobhan was lifting herself from the floor a whole clump of hair seemed to be missing from the top of her head shit shit shit she squealed linford ignored her and ran into the corridor his left leg was aching from where silvers had connected with it but it was his pride that felt the most bruised where is he he yelled tam barclay and allan ward looked at one another then both pointed towards the exit he went thataway sheriff ward said with a grin problem was no one had actually seen him leave the station there was video surveillance of the main entrance and linford asked the comms room to run the tape meantime he went from office to office checking under desks and inside the stations few walkin closets when he got back to the comms room they were running the tape donny dow sprinting in fullcolor time lapse right out the front door we need patrols to search the area linford said cars and foot get his description out the uniformed officers looked at each other what are you waiting for linford snarled i think theyre probably waiting for me to give them the okay derek a voice said from behind him dcs gill templer ouch siobhan said she was seated back at her desk while phyllida hawes checked the damage to her head youve lost a little bit of skin hawes said i think the hair will grow back probably feels worse than it looks allan ward offered the incident in ir seemed to have broken down barriers gray mccullough and rebus were present too while gill templer debriefed linford and silvers in her office names allan by the way ward said for phyllida hawess benefit when she told him her name he remarked that it was unusual he was listening to her explanation when siobhan got up and moved away she didnt think either of them had noticed rebus was standing by the far wall arms folded studying the display relating to the marber case hes a fast worker siobhan said rebus turned his head watched the interplay between ward and hawes you should warn her he said im not sure allans housebroken maybe thats the way she likes it siobhan dabbed at the patch of naked skin it was at the crown of her head and it stung like buggery you could get a sick leave on the strength of that rebus informed her ive known cops go on disability for less factor in the shock and stress you dont get rid of me that easily she said shouldnt you all be out chasing donny dow this isnt our patch remember rebus scanned the room hawes listening to wards patter jazz mccullough in conversation with bill pryde and davie hynds francis gray sitting on one of the desks swinging one leg as he leafed through an evidence file he saw rebus watching him and gave a wink sliding off the desk and coming forwards this is the sort of case they should have given us eh john rebus nodded but said nothing gray seemed to take the hint and after a few words of commiseration to siobhan he moved away again changing desks picking up another file i need to speak to gill siobhan said quietly her eyes on templers closed door going on the sick after all siobhan shook her head i think i recognized donny dow he was the weasels driver the day i went to interview cafferty rebus stared at her you sure ninety percent i only saw him for a matter of seconds then maybe we should talk to the weasel she nodded after ive okayed it with the boss if thats the way you want to play it you said it yourself this isnt your patch rebus looked thoughtful what about if you kept it to yourself for the moment she stared at him uncomprehending what if i talk to the weasel on the quiet rebus went on then id be withholding information no youd just be withholding an inkling maybe itll take you a day to convince yourself that it was dow you saw driving the weasels car john without saying as much she was asking him for something she wanted him to share to confide to trust in her i have my reasons he said voice just above a whisper something the weasel might help me with it took her a full thirty seconds to make up her mind all right she said he touched her arm thanks he said i owe you what about something to eat tonight my treat have you called jean yet his eyes darkened ive been trying shes either out or not answering shes the one you should be asking to dinner i should have phoned her that night you should have followed her that night apologizing all the way ill keep trying he said and send her some flowers she had to smile at the look on his face last time you sent anybody flowers it was probably a wreath am i right probably he admitted more wreaths than bouquets thats for certain well dont confuse the two this time round plenty of florists in the phone book he nodded straight after i talk to the weasel he said heading for the corridor there were some calls that had to be made on a mobile rather than one of the office phones rebus now had a list of two but the weasel wasnt in his office and the best anyone could do was offer a tepid promise to pass on a message thanks rebus said by the way is donny there at the moment donny who the voice said before cutting the connection rebus cursed went to the comms room for a yellow pages then headed out into the car park to phone a florist he ordered a mixed bunch what sort of flowers does the lady like he was asked i dont know well what about colors look just a selection okay twenty quids worth or thereabouts he reeled off his creditcard number and the deal was done sliding his phone back into his pocket switching it for cigarettes and lighter he realized he had no idea what twenty notes would buy half a dozen withered carnations or some ridiculously huge spray whatever it was it would be delivered to jeans home this evening at he wondered what would happen if she was staying late at work would the florist leave them on the doorstep prey to any passing thief or take them back to the shop and try again the next day he took a long drag on the cigarette filling his lungs things always seemed to be more complicated than you expected but then when he thought about it he was adding the complications himself looking at what could go wrong with the arrangement rather than hoping for the best he knew hed been a pessimist from an early age realizing that it was a good way to prepare for life as a pessimist if things went wrong you were ready while if things went right it came as a pleasant surprise too late to change now he muttered talking to yourself it was allan ward busily loosing a fresh packet from its cellophane bonds whats up has your patter failed to impress dc hawes ward started to nod shes so unimpressed he said lighting up shes agreed to have dinner with me tonight any tips tips shortcuts into her knickers rebus flicked ash from his cigarette shes a good officer allan more than that i like her id take it personally if she got hurt just a bit of harmless fun ward said defensively then his face changed to a smirk just because youre not getting any rebus swung round grabbing both of wards jacket lapels in one hand pushing him back against the wall of the station the cigarette dropped from wards mouth as he tried to push rebus away a patrol car was pulling in through the gateway the uniforms staring out at the spectacle then hands were on both men separating them it was derek linford ladies ladies he was telling them no fisticuffs ward was rearranging his jacket whatre you doing here checking under the cars for a missing prisoner flecks of saliva flew from his mouth no linford said but he shifted his gaze to the car park just in case i was actually wondering if any smokers were down here you dont smoke rebus reminded him he was breathing hard i thought maybe i should give it a go christ knows this is as good a time as any ward laughed seeming to forget all about rebus welcome to the club he said offering his packet to linford templer gave you a hard time did she its the fucking embarrassment as much as anything linford admitted with a sheepish grin while ward lit the cigarette for him forget about it everybodys saying dows into kickboxing you dont want to mess with that ward seemed to be cheering linford up rebus was wondering about linford hed come across them brawling yet hadnt asked why being busy with his own concerns rebus decided to leave them to it hey john no hard feelings eh ward suddenly announced rebus didnt say anything he knew that once hed gone linford now reminded would probably ask about the fight and his new best buddy would explain about the night out and jean and suddenly linford would have ammunition rebus wondered how long it would take him to use it he was even starting to worry about the fact that linford had been chosen to replace him on the marber case why linford of all people as rebus walked back into the station he could feel how the tension was making his every movement more sluggish he tried rolling his shoulders stretching his neck he remembered an old piece of graffiti just because youre paranoid it doesnt mean theyre not after you was he becoming paranoid seeing enemies and traps everywhere blame strathern for picking him in the first place i dont even trust the man im working for rebus thought so how can i trust anyone else passing one of the officers from the marber inquiry he thought how nice it would be to be seated at a desk in the murder room making routine telephone calls knowing how little any of it mattered instead he seemed to be digging himself an everdeeper hole hed promised jazz an idea a plan to make some money now all he had to do was deliver that evening rebus went drinking alone hed told the syndicate he had something to do but might catch up with them later they were undecided about whether to stay in edinburgh for a few drinks or head straight back to tulliallan jazz was thinking of broughty ferry but his car was back at the college ward was thinking of treating phyllida hawes to a mexican place near st leonards they were still arguing over strategies and alternatives when rebus slipped away after three drinks in the ox only half listening to the latest batch of jokes he started feeling hungry didnt know where to eat last thing he wanted was to walk into a restaurant and bump into ward and hawes playing footsie under the table he knew he could cook himself something at home knew too that this wouldnt happen all the same maybe he should be at home what if jean rang had she got the flowers yet his mobile was in his pocket just waiting for her call in the end he ordered another drink and the last leftover scotch egg been there since lunchtime has it he asked harry the barman i wasnt on at lunchtime you want it or not rebus nodded and a packet of nuts there were times he wished the ox did a bit more in the catering line he remembered the previous owner willie ross dragging some hapless punter outside after the man had asked to see the menu pointing up at the oxford bar sign and asking does that say bar or restaurant rebus doubted the client had become a regular the ox was quiet tonight murmurs of conversation from a couple of tables in the lounge and only rebus himself in the front bar when the door creaked open he didnt bother turning to look get you one the voice beside him asked it was gill templer rebus straightened up my shout he said she was already easing herself onto a bar stool letting her shoulder bag slump to the floor whatll it be im driving better make it a half of deuchars she paused on second thought a gin and tonic the tv was playing quietly and her eyes drifted towards it one of the discovery channel programs favored by harry whatre you watching gill asked harry puts this stuff on to scare away the punters rebus explained thats right harry agreed works with every bugger but this one he nodded in rebuss direction gill offered a tired smile bad one rebus guessed its not every day someone does a runner from the interview room she gave him a sly look i suppose youre pleased enough how anything that makes linford look bad i hope im not that petty no she considered this looks like he might be though words going around that you and another of the tulliallan crew had a punchup in the car park so linford had been talking just thought id warn you she went on i think its already reached the ears of dci tennant you came looking for me to tell me she shrugged thanks he said i suppose i was also hoping to have a word look if its about the mug of tea well you did give it some welly john be honest if id pushed it off the desk with my pinkie youd hardly have had reason to send me into purdah rebus paid for her drink raised his own pint glass to her in a toast cheers she said taking a long swallow and exhaling noisily better he asked better she confirmed he smiled and people wonder why we drink onell be enough for me though how about you would you settle for a ballpark figure id settle for knowing how things are going at tulliallan ive not made much headway is that likely to change it might he paused if i take a few risks she looked at him youll talk to strathern first wont you he nodded but could see she wasnt convinced john same tone siobhan had used earlier in the day listen to me trust me he turned towards gill you could always take a cab he told her meaning what meaning you could have another drink she examined her glass it was already mostly ice i could probably manage one more she conceded its my round anyway what are you having after the third gin and tonic she confided to him that she had been seeing someone it had lasted about nine months then fizzled out you kept that pretty quiet he said theres no way i was ever going to introduce him to you lot she was playing with her glass watching the patterns it made on the bar harry had retreated to the other end of the small room another regular had arrived and the two of them were talking football how are things with jean and you gill asked we had a bit of a misunderstanding rebus admitted want to talk about it no want me to act as peacemaker he looked at her and shook his head jean was gills friend gill had introduced them to one another he didnt want her feeling awkward about it thanks anyway he said well sort it out she glanced at her watch i better get going slid off the stool and collected her shoulder bag this place isnt so bad she decided studying the bars faded decor i might grab something to eat have you had dinner yes he lied feeling that a meal with gill would be a betrayal of sorts i hope youre not going to drive in that condition he called as she made for the door ill see how i feel when i get outside think how much worse tomorrow will be if youre charged with drunk driving she waved a hand and was gone rebus stayed for one more her perfume lingered he could smell it on the sleeve of his jacket he wondered if he should have sent jean perfume instead of flowers then realized he didnt know what kind she liked scanning the gantry he guessed that when pushed he could reel off the names of over two dozen malts straight from memory two dozen malts and hed no idea what perfume jean burchill used as he pushed open the main door to his tenement he saw a shadow on the stairwell someone descending maybe one of the neighbors but rebus didnt think so he looked behind him but there was no one on the street not an ambush then the feet came into view first then the legs and body what are you doing here rebus hissed heard you were looking for me the weasel replied he was at the bottom of the stairs now i wanted a bit of a chat anyway did you bring anyone with you the weasel shook his head this isnt the sort of meeting the boss would approve of rebus looked around again he didnt want the weasel in his flat a bar would be okay but any more drink and his brain would start clouding come on then he said passing the weasel and making for the back door he unlocked it and dragged it open the tenements shared garden wasnt much used there was a drying green the grass almost a foot long surrounded by narrow borders where only the hardiest plants survived when rebus and his wife had first moved in rhona had replaced the weeds with seedlings hard to tell now if any of them still thrived wroughtiron railings separated the garden from its neighbors all the gardens enclosed by a rectangle of tall tenement buildings there were lights on in most of the windows kitchens and bedrooms stair landings the place was well enough lit for this meeting whats up rebus asked fishing for a cigarette the weasel had stooped to pick up an empty beer can which he crushed and dropped into his coat pocket alys doing okay rebus nodded he had almost forgotten the weasels son you took my advice theyve not let him off the hook yet but my solicitor says were in with a shout have they charged him the weasel nodded but only with possession the spliff he was smoking when they picked him up rebus nodded claverhouse was playing this one cautiously thing is the weasel said crouching by the nearest flower border picking up empty crisp bags and sweet wrappers i think my boss might have got wind of it of aly not aly exactly the dope i was meaning rebus lit his cigarette he was thinking about caffertys network of eyes and ears it only needed the technician from the police lab to tell a colleague back at base and that colleague to tell a friend there was no way claverhouse was going to keep the haul under wraps forever all the same that could be in your favor rebus told the weasel puts pressure on claverhouse to do something about it like charge aly you mean rebus shrugged or hand it over to customs so they all end up taking credit and aly still goes down the weasel had risen to his feet pockets filled and rustling if he cooperates he could get a light sentence caffertys still going to nail him so maybe you should get your retaliation in first give the drug squad what they want the weasel was thoughtful give them cafferty dont tell me you havent been thinking about it oh ive thought about it but mr caffertys been very good to me hes not family though is he hes not blood no the weasel said stretching the single syllable out can i ask you something rebus flicked ash from the cigarette what do you have any idea where donny dow is the weasel shook his head i heard hed been taken in for questioning hes done a runner that was silly of him its why i wanted to talk to you because now we have to send out search parties which means talking to all his friends and associates im assuming youll cooperate naturally rebus nodded lets say cafferty does know about the drugs what do you think hell do number one hell want to know who brought them up here the weasel paused and number two the weasel looked at him who said there was a number two there usually is when theres been a number one okay number two he might decide he wanted them for himself rebus examined the tip of his cigarette he could hear sounds of tenement life music tv voices plates colliding on the drying rack shapes passing a window ordinary people living ordinary lives all of them thinking they were different from the rest did cafferty have anything to do with the marber murder he asked when did i become your snitch the weasel asked i dont want you for my snitch i just thought maybe one question the small man stooped down again as though hed spotted something in the grass but there was nothing and he rose again slowly other peoples shit he muttered it sounded like a mantra maybe he meant his son or even cafferty the weasel cleaning up after them then he locked eyes with rebus how am i supposed to know something like that im not saying cafferty did this himself it would be one of his men someone hed hired probably through you so as to distance himself from it caffertys always been good at letting other people take the fall the weasel seemed to be considering this is that what those two cops were doing there the other day asking questions about marber he watched as rebus nodded the boss wouldnt say what it was about i thought he trusted you rebus said the weasel paused again i know he knew marber he said at last his voice dropping to a level where the slightest gust of wind would erase it i dont think he liked him much i hear he stopped buying paintings from marber is that because he found out marber had been cheating i dont know do you think its possible its possible the weasel conceded tell me rebuss own voice dropped further still would cafferty organize a hit without your knowledge youre asking me to incriminate myself this is just between the two of us the weasel folded his arms the rubbish in his pockets crackled and clicked were not as close as we once were he confided ruefully a hit like this one who would he have gone to the weasel shook his head im not a rat rats are clever creatures rebus said they know when to leave a sinking ship cafferty isnt sinking the weasel said with a sad smile thats what they said about the titanic rebus replied there wasnt much more to be said they went back into the stairwell the weasel heading for the front door and rebus for the stairs he wasnt inside his flat two minutes when there was a knock at the door he was in the bathroom running a bath he did not want the weasel in here this was where he could try shutting it all out and pretend he was like everyone else another knock and this time he walked to the door yes he called di rebus youre under arrest put his face to the peephole then unlocked the door claverhouse was standing there sporting a smile as thin and sharp as a surgeons blade going to invite me in he said wasnt thinking of it not entertaining are you claverhouse craned his neck to look down the hallway im just about to get in the bath good idea id do the same under the circumstances what are you talking about im talking about the fact that youve just spent a good fifteen minutes being contaminated by caffertys righthand man does he often make house calls youre not busy counting out a payoff in there are you john rebus took two steps forward backing claverhouse against the banister it was a twostory drop to the ground what do you want claverhouse the feigned humor had vanished from claverhouses face he wasnt scared of rebus he was just angry weve been trying to nail cafferty he spat in case youve forgotten now words starting to leak out about the shipment and weasels got a nasty little lawyer chewing at my balls so were on surveillance and what do we find weasel himself paying you a visit he stabbed a finger into rebuss chest and hows that going to look in my report detective inspector fuck you claverhouse but at least rebus knew where ormiston was now he was tailing the weasel fuck me claverhouse was shaking his head youve got it all wrong rebus its you the boys in barlinnie will be telling to bend over because if i can tie you to cafferty and his operation so help me ill send you so far down theyll need a bulldozer to find you consider me warned rebus said its all starting to unravel for friend cafferty claverhouse hissed make sure you know whose side youre on rebus thought of the weasels words cafferty isnt sinking and the smile that had accompanied his words why had the weasel looked sad he took a step back giving claverhouse room claverhouse saw it as a weakening john reverting to rebuss first name whatever it is youre hiding you need to come clean thanks for your concern rebus saw claverhouse for what he was a chipontheshoulder careerist who had ideas he couldnt follow through on nailing cafferty or at the very least inserting a mole into caffertys operation would in his own eyes be the making of him and he couldnt see past it it was consuming him rebus was almost sympathetic hadnt he been there himself claverhouse was shaking his head at rebuss stubbornness i see the weasel was driving himself tonight that because donny dow did a runner you know about dow claverhouse nodded maybe i know more than you think john maybe you do at that rebus agreed trying to loosen him up such as what exactly but claverhouse wasnt falling for it i was talking to dcs templer this evening she was very interested to find out about donny dows chauffeuring duties he paused but you knew all the time didnt you did i you didnt manage to sound very surprised when i told you thinking back you didnt sound surprised at all so how come she didnt know keeping stuff to yourself again john maybe you just wanted to protect your pal the weasel hes not my pal his lawyer came asking all the right questions almost as if hed been primed it was claverhouse who had advanced on rebus this time not that rebus was budging an inch he could hear the bath still filling not long now and it would start to overflow what was he doing here john you wanted me to talk to him claverhouse paused a glimmer of hope seemed to rise in his eyes and nice talking to you claverhouse rebus said say hello to ormie for me when you catch up with him he stepped backwards into his hall and started closing the door claverhouse stood unmoving almost as if he planned to stay there till morning not saying anything because nothing needed to be said between them rebus padded back to the bathroom and turned off the tap the water was scalding and there wasnt enough room to add cold he sat down on the toilet and held his head in his hands it struck him that he actually trusted the weasel more than he did claverhouse make sure you know whose side youre on rebus didnt like to think about it he still couldnt be sure that he hadnt landed in a trap was strathern out to nail him using gray and the others as bait even if there was some dirty deal to uncover something involving gray jazz and ward could rebus succeed without implicating himself he got up and went through to the living room found the whiskey bottle and a glass picked up the first cd he found and stuck it on rem out of time the title had never meant more to him than right here this minute he stared at the contents of the bottle but knew he wasnt going to touch it not tonight he swapped it for the phone called jean at home answering machine so he left another message he thought about driving to the new town maybe dropping in on siobhan but it wasnt fair to her and she was probably out driving anyway her scalp burning eyes not quite focused on the road ahead he walked softly back to the door and put his eye to the peephole the landing was empty he allowed himself a smile remembering the way hed left claverhouse dangling back into the living room and over to the window no sign of anyone outside on the hifi michael stipe alternated between rage and grieving john rebus sat down in his chair prepared to let the nighttime take its toll and then the phone rang and it had to be jean returning his call but it wasnt all right big man francis gray said in that soft west coast growl of his been better francis never fear uncle francis has the cure for all ills rebus rested his head against the back of his chair where are you the delightful surroundings of the tulliallan officers bar and thats the cure for my ills could i be that heartless no big man im talking about the trip of a lifetime two people with a whole world of possibilities and delights opening before them someone been spiking your drinks di gray im talking about glasgow john and youll have me as your guide to whats best in the west its a bit late for all this isnt it tomorrow morning just you and me so be here at sparrowfart or youll miss all the fun the phone went dead rebus stared at it considered calling back gray and him in glasgow meaning what meaning jazz had spoken to gray told him rebus had something to offer why glasgow why just the two of them was jazz distancing himself from his old friend rebuss thoughts turned again to the weasel and cafferty old ties could loosen old alliances and allegiances could crumble there were always points of vulnerability cracks in the carefully constructed wall rebus had been thinking of allan ward as the weakest link now he was turning to jazz mccullough he went back through to the bathroom gritted his teeth and plunged his hand into the superheated bathwater letting the plug out then he turned on the cold tap to restore some balance back through to the kitchen for a mug of coffee and a couple of vitamin c tablets then into the living room hed hidden stratherns report under one of the sofa cushions his bathtime reading bernie johns had been a brute of a man controlling a large chunk of the scottish drug trade by means of contacts and ruthlessness disposing of any and all contenders for his crown along the way people had turned up tortured maimed or dead sometimes all three a lot of people had simply disappeared there had been talk that such a lengthy and successful reign of terror could be achieved only with the help of the police in other words bernie johns had been a protected species this had never been proven though the report such as it was made mention of some possible suspects all based in and around glasgow but none of them francis gray johns had lived for a large part of his life in an unassuming public housing unit in one of the citys toughest projects hed been a man of the people gifting money to local charities and benefiting everything from toddlers playgrounds to old peoples shelters but the giver was also a tyrant his munificence tempered by the knowledge that he was paying for power and invulnerability anyone came within a hundred yards of him on his home turf he got to know about it police surveillance activities were scuppered within ten minutes of their outset white vans were rumbled flats were located and attacked nobody was going to get near bernie johns there were plenty of pictures of him in the folder he was tall broad at the shoulders but not physically massive he wore fashionable suits his wavy blond hair always carefully groomed rebus could imagine him as a child playing the angel gabriel in his schools christmas show the eyes had hardened in the interim as had the jaw but johns had been a handsome man his face sporting none of the nicks and slashes associated with longevity in a gangster and then operation cleancut had come along involving several forces in a longterm surveillance and intelligence operation which had ended with a haul of several thousand tabs of ecstasy and amphetamines four kilos of heroin and about the same weight of cannabis the operation had been branded a success and bernie johns had been put on trial it wasnt the first time hed appeared in a dock three previous charges all dropped due to admin cockups or by dint of witnesses changing their minds the case against him wasnt watertight this time either the procurator fiscals office had admitted as much in a letter rebus found in the folder it could go either way but they would give it their best shot any police officer even rumored to have had links to johns and his gang was sidelined throughout the investigation and trial the team kept working even through the duration of the trial ensuring evidence wasnt changed or witnesses lost it was only after johnss conviction that he started complaining that hed been shaken down and ripped off he wasnt naming any names but the story seemed to be that hed been told that certain pieces of evidence could be contaminated there was a price to pay of course and hed been willing to pay it one of his men had been dispatched to fetch the money from a secret stash police had found little at johnss actual home around five thousand in cash and a couple of unlicensed pistols the underling didnt come back and when he was tracked down he told a story that he had been followed to the site and attacked by three men almost certainly the same people who had done the deal in the first place they had then cleaned johns out precisely how much was involved was left to the rumor mill the best estimate of johnss accumulated wealth was around the three million mark three million pounds give us some names and we might start to believe you johns had been told by an investigating officer but johns had refused that wasnt the way he worked never had been never would be the underling meantime was found stabbed to death near his home after a night out the price hed had to pay for failure johns was adamant that this man could not by himself have tricked him stolen from him the man had done a runner only because hed been terrified of the ramifications of the theft three million was not the sort of figure bernie johns was likely to shrug off as human error the stabbing was proof of that no doubt hed had similar fates in mind for the cops it was assumed they were cops whod doublecrossed him but he never got time to put any plan into effect hed been stabbed in the neck with a homemade shiv the painstakingly sharpened end of a soup spoon by one of the inmates while queueing for breakfast this inmate alfie frazer known to all and sundry as soft alfie had been one of francis grays snitches which gave the investigators their first inkling of who might have been involved in ripping off bernie johns gray had been questioned but had denied everything it was never made clear precisely why soft alfie known to be academically challenged and never the worlds most perfect physical specimen would commit a murder all the investigators knew was that gray had fought hard to keep alfie out of prison and that it was believed alfie owed him as a result but alfie had been in on a threeyear stretch was it possible he would have committed himself to a far lengthier term by murdering johns at grays behest the only other valuable piece of the jigsaw had come when it was discovered that on the day johnss hapless henchman had been sent to fetch the cash three officers gray mccullough and ward had headed out in grays car their excuse when asked about it later theyd gone out to celebrate the end of the investigation they named pubs theyd been in a restaurant where theyd eaten this was as much as the high hiedyins had on the three men they hadnt proved profligate spenders and didnt appear to have money salted away in hidden bank accounts the last page of the report detailed francis grays disciplinary record the sheet was handwritten and unsigned rebus got the feeling it came from grays own chief constable reading between the lines the personal bitterness was all too evident this man has been a disgrace verbal abuse of senior officers drunken antics at a social occasion it was gray they really wanted whatever rebuss own reputation gray had raised the crossbar it struck rebus that they could have turfed gray out at any time so why hadnt they his reasoning they were hanging on to gray waiting for an opportunity to nail him for bernie johns but with retirement in the offing they were growing desperate in their eyes it was time for payback at any price rebus dried himself off and padded through to the living room the blue nile on the hifi and him on his chair stonecold sober and thinking hard the file was all conjecture rumor stories told by old lags all the high hiedyins had to go on was the coincidence of the trios day trip taking place on the same day as the supposed money pickup that and the death of johns at the hands of one of grays snitches all the same three million he could see why they wouldnt want gray and co getting away with it a cool million apiece rebus had to admit they didnt look like millionaires didnt act like them either why not just resign and head off to spend the loot because it would have been proof of a sort and might have helped launch a fullscale inquiry soft alfie had been questioned half a dozen times in the intervening years but hadnt said anything worthwhile maybe he wasnt so soft after all again rebus wondered if the whole thing was part of some elaborate setup meant to distract him maybe leading him to incriminate himself in the rico lomax case he concentrated on the music but the blue nile werent about to help him they were too busy singing beautiful songs about glasgow glasgow tomorrows destination he tapped his fingers in time to the music tapped them on the cover of the folder strathern had given him when he woke up the cd had finished and his neck felt stiff hed been dreaming that he was in a restaurant with jean some posh hotel somewhere but he was wearing clothes hed been given by rhona during their marriage and he had no money on him to pay for the expensive meal hed felt so guilty guilty of betraying rhona and jean guilty about everything someone else had been in the dream someone who had money enough to pay for it all and rebus had ended up following him through the maze of the hotel everywhere from its penthouse to the cellars had he been going to ask for a loan was the figure someone he knew had he been going to take the money by force or duplicity from a total stranger rebus didnt know he pulled himself to his feet and stretched tiredly couldnt have been asleep more than twenty minutes then he remembered that he had to be in tulliallan by morning no time like the present he told himself snatching up his car keys ponytailed ricky was back on the door of the sauna paradiso christ not you again he muttered as siobhan walked in she looked around the place was dead one of the girls was lying along a sofa reading a magazine there was baseball on the tv monitor the sound turned off you like baseball siobhan asked ricky didnt look in the mood for conversation i watch it sometimes she went on if im awake through the night couldnt tell you the rules or half of what the commentators are talking about but i watch it anyway she looked around laura in tonight he thought about lying but knew shed spot it shes with someone he said mind if i wait take your coat off make yourself at home he waved his arm in an exaggerated greeting if a punter comes in and wants to take you downstairs dont go blaming me i wont siobhan said but she kept her coat on and was glad she was wearing trousers and boots the woman on the sofa now that siobhan studied her was ten years older than shed originally thought makeup hair and clothes they could put years on you or take them off she remembered when shed been thirteen knowing she could pass for sixteen or older another of the women had appeared from the curtained doorway she gave siobhan a look of curiosity as she moved behind rickys desk there was an alcove there with a kettle she made herself a mug of coffee and reappeared stopping in front of siobhan ricky says youre looking for some action she was in her midtwenties with a pretty rounded face and long brown hair her legs were bare with black bra and panties visible beneath a kneelength negligee rickys having you on siobhan informed her the woman looked in the direction of the desk and stuck her tongue out displaying a silver stud then she dropped into the chair next to siobhans careful suzy you might catch something this from the woman on the sofa who was still flicking through her magazine suzy looked at siobhan she means im a cop siobhan said and is she right am i going to catch something siobhan shrugged ive been told ive got an infectious laugh suzy smiled siobhan noticed that she had a bruise on one shoulder which the negligee was failing to conceal quiet tonight siobhan commented theres always a bit of a rush after the pubs close then it calms down again you here to see one of the girls laura shes got a punter with her siobhan nodded how come youre talking to me she asked way i see it youve got your job to do same as i have suzy held the chipped mug to her lips no sense getting worked up about it you here to arrest laura no asking her questions then something like that your accents not scottish i was brought up in england suzy was studying her i had a friend sounded a bit like you past tense this was at college i did a year at napier i cant remember where she was from somewhere in the midlands that could be about right that where youre from suzy was wearing frayed moccasinstyle slippers she had crossed one leg over the other and was letting one moccasin dangle from her painted toes around there siobhan said do you know laura weve worked some of the same shifts she been here long suzy stared at siobhan but didnt answer all right then siobhan said what about you nearly a year thats me just about ready to quit said id do it for a year and no longer ive got enough saved now to go back to college the woman on the sofa snorted suzy ignored her you make good money in the police not bad what fifteen twenty thousand a bit more actually suzy shook her head thats nothing to what you can make in a place like this i dont think i could do it though thats what i thought but when college fell through she got a faraway look the woman on the sofa was rolling her eyes siobhan didnt know how much of it to believe suzy had had nearly a year to fashion her story maybe it was her way of coping with the sauna paradiso a man suddenly came out from behind the curtain he looked around the room surprised to find no other men there except ricky siobhan recognized him the less drunk businessman from her previous visit the one whod mentioned laura by name with head down he walked briskly to the front door and made his exit has he got a tab or something siobhan asked suzy shook her head they pay us then we settle with ricky later siobhan looked across the desk where ricky was standing watching her going to let mr cafferty know im here she called you still on about him ricky grinned i keep telling you i own this place sure you do siobhan said winking at suzy another month tops thats me out of here suzy was saying to herself more than anyone as siobhan got up and made for the curtained doorway only one cabin had its door closed she knocked and opened it she could hear a shower running it was behind a frosted glass door the room had a wide bench topped with a mattress a spa bath in one corner and not much else siobhan was trying not to breathe in the fetid air laura she called whos that its siobhan clarke all right if i wait for you outside give me two minutes will you no problem siobhan climbed back up the stairs the place was still dead tell laura im right outside she ordered ricky her car was actually across the road she sat in it the radio playing softly window rolled down a few cars and taxis rumbled past not too far away she knew the streetwalkers were plying their trade a trade less safe than that enacted in places like the paradiso men would pay for sex it was a fact of life and as long as the demand was there thered be no shortage of suppliers it struck siobhan that what troubled her most about the business was that it was run by men for men with the women themselves reduced to merchandise okay so theyd maybe made the choice themselves but for what reasons because there was nothing else at least in their eyes from desperation or coercion her stomach felt tight as though some cramp was coming on it was a feeling she was getting more frequently these days as though she might be about to seize up completely she saw herself frozen like a statue while cafferty ricky and all the others got on about their business the door of the sauna opened and laura stepped out she was dressed in a tight black miniskirt and matching sleeveless top with kneelength black leather boots no coat or jacket so she was intending going back to work afterwards laura siobhan called laura crossed the road and got into the passenger side rubbing her arms not warm tonight she commented have you heard from donny siobhan asked without preamble laura looked at her and shook her head we took him in for questioning earlier today siobhan made sure she had eye contact he did a runner lauras eyes went vacant he knows about your arrangement siobhan said quietly what arrangement you and edward marber oh will he come after you i dont know what about alexander lauras eyes widened he wouldnt hurt alexander but might he try to snatch him not if he knows whats good for him maybe we could have some officers watch your home laura was shaking her head i dont want that donny wont hurt me or alexander you could always ask mr cafferty for help siobhan stated nonchalantly cafferty i already told you donny worked for cafferty did you know that maybe you could ask cafferty to keep donny away from you i dont know anyone called cafferty siobhan stayed silent i dont laura persisted well then youve nothing to worry about have you maybe i wasted my time coming out here this time of night to warn you laura looked at her im sorry she said then and thank you she reached over and laid her hand on siobhans i appreciate it siobhan nodded slowly did suzy ever go to college she asked laura seemed taken aback by the question suzy i think she thought about going maybe six or seven years ago is that how long shes worked in saunas at a rough guess they heard the door to the paradiso opening a man his back to them face in shadow as he disappeared inside i better get going laura said could be one of mine you have a lot of regulars dont you a fair few means you must be good or they must be desperate was edward marber desperate laura looked slighted i wouldnt have said so what about the punter who was leaving as i came in hes a regular too isnt he maybe becoming defensive now opening the car door and stepping out thanks again she started to cross the road the saunas door was opening throwing light onto the street the same man emerging only now with his front to them rather than his back donny dow laura siobhan called get back in the car at the same time she was struggling to find the door handle which seemed to have moved a few inches from where she normally found it pushed open the door and started to get out laura siobhan calling out her name almost at the same time he did their voices clashing in the air above their heads come here you whore donny dow rushing at laura laura screaming and in the background a sound siobhan would hear for the rest of the night the sound of the lock clicking shut on the inside of the door to the sauna paradiso dow had laura grabbing her shoulders shoving her backwards against the car then his arm went up and siobhan knew though she couldnt see it that there was a weapon there a blade of some sort she launched herself across the hood one hand propelling her across it so that she flew feet first catching him low down on one side it wasnt enough to deflect him the knife sliced into lauras flesh making a soft sound almost like a mild reproach tsssk siobhan grabbed for the knife arm trying to lock it behind him while listening to an elongated gasp from laura the air escaping from her as blood leaked from the puncture dow flung his head sideways catching siobhan on the bridge of her nose tears welled in her eyes and she momentarily lost strength tsssk the knife again finding its target siobhan let go of his arm and aimed her knee into his groin connecting with all the force she could muster dow staggered backwards his voice a rising complaint of pain siobhan watched laura sag visibly she was hanging on to the cars door handle knees buckling there were rivulets of blood got to end this now siobhan aimed another kick at dow but he dodged it turning full circle the knife it was one of those builders blades the kind you bought in a diy store was still gripped in his right hand siobhan filled her lungs and let out a scream making sure he took the full force of it help somebody help us here shes dying donny dows murdered her at the sound of his name he paused or maybe it was the word murdered he stared unblinking at laura siobhan made a move towards him but he backed away three four five steps you bastard she shouted at him then she gave another scream searing the inside of her throat lights were coming on in the tenement windows above the sauna nineninenine ambulance and police faces at the windows curtains pushed aside dow was still walking backwards she had to follow him but what about laura siobhan glanced back and as she broke eye contact dow took his chance jogging and swaying his way back into darkness siobhan crouched beside laura whose lips looked almost black in the streetlight maybe because her face was so white going into shock siobhan sought the wounds thered be two had to get pressure on them the saunas door stayed resolutely closed bastard siobhan hissed she couldnt see dow anymore there was warm blood oozing from between her fingers hang on laura ambulance is coming her mobile was in her pocket but she didnt have any free hands shit shit shit then one of the neighbors was standing beside her he seemed to be asking if everything was all right put some pressure here she said showing him where then she fumbled for her phone as it slid away from her bloodied grasp the man was looking horrorstruck he was in his late fifties thin hair flapping down over his forehead she couldnt push the numbers her hands were shaking too much she ran across to the sauna gave the door a kick then rammed it with her shoulder ricky opened up he was shaking too christ is she did you call nineninenine siobhan asked he nodded ambulance and he swallowed just ambulance he corrected she thought she could hear a siren in the distance hoped it was coming this way did you tell him she was out here siobhan spat ricky shook his head guy looked in a rage i said she wasnt on shift he swallowed again i thought he was going to do me well arent you the lucky one siobhan ran past the woman from the sofa who was now standing arms folded protectively in front of her and found the pile of towels and robes she could hear sobbing from the actual sauna didnt have time to look but knew it was suzy probably cowering in fear for herself siobhan dashed outside again pushing towels hard against the wounds lots of pressure she told the man he was sweating looked scared but he nodded anyway and she patted his shoulder laura was sitting on the ground legs folded beneath her her fingers clung resolutely to the door handle maybe she was remembering siobhans instruction get back in the car mere centimeters from safety dont die on me siobhan commanded running a hand through lauras hair lauras eyelids were open a fraction but the eyes themselves were glassy like the marbles boys used to play with she was breathing through her mouth little gasps of pain the siren was a lot closer now and then it was rounding the corner from commercial street sending sweeps of blue light across the buildings theyre here laura siobhan cooed youre going to be fine just hang in there the man said looking to siobhan for reassurance that hed said the right thing too many episodes of casualty and holby city siobhan thought youre going to be fine the lie that brings no peace the lie that exists only because the speaker needs to hear it just hang in there four in the morning she wished rebus were there he would make some joke about the song of the same name hed done it before when theyd been on hospital vigils villain stakeouts hed sing half a misremembered verse of some countryandwestern song she couldnt remember the name of the original singer but rebus would know it farnon farley somebody farnon these games rebus played to take their minds off the situation shed thought of phoning him but had reconsidered this was something she had to get through on her own she was crossing a line could feel it she wasnt at the hospital they hadnt wanted her there a quick shower and change of clothes at home the patrol car waiting to take her back to st leonards the leith police would take the investigation it was their patch but they wanted her at st leonards for debriefing at least you got him a good kick in the charlies her uniformed driver had said should slow him down a bit she stood in her shower and wished it had a bit more pressure the water dripped onto her she wanted sharp needles a pummeling a torrent she held her hands over her face eyes screwed shut she leaned against the tiled wall then slid down it until she was crouching again the way shed crouched over laura stafford whos going to tell alexander mummys dead daddy did it it would be grandmas job in between the tears who would break the news to grandma someone would already be on their way out there the body needed to be idd her machine was flashing to let her know she had phone messages they could wait there were dishes in the sink needed washing she was drying her hair with a towel as she moved through the flat her nose was red and she kept needing to blow it her eyes were bloodshot pinkrimmed and puffy the towel she dried her hair with was dark blue no more white towels for me dcs templer was waiting for her at the station the first question was an easy one are you all right siobhan made all the right noises but then templer said donny dows an animal works for big ger cafferty siobhan wondered whod been talking rebus but then templer explained all claverhouse told me you know claverhouse to which siobhan nodded sdea have had their eye on cafferty for a while templer went on not getting very far if their track records anything to go by all of which was just by way of filler working up to the real story you know shes dead yes maam christ siobhan no need for the formal stuff its gill here remember yes gill templer nodded you did what you could it wasnt enough what were you supposed to do set up a blood transfusion on the pavement templer sighed sorry thats the middle of the night talking not me she ran her hands through her hair speaking of which what were you doing down there id gone to warn her at that time of night best time to find her at work i thought siobhan was answering the questions but her mind was elsewhere she was still on that street the click of the lock on the sauna parlor door the hand gripping her car for dear life tsssk leith are handling it templer said unnecessarily theyll want to talk to you siobhan nodded phyllida hawes has gone to break the news she nodded again she was wondering if donny dow had bought the blade that same afternoon there was a diy store practically next door to st leonards it was premeditated siobhan stated ill say so in my report no way that bastards getting off with manslaughter templers turn to nod siobhan knew what she was thinking good lawyer behind him dow would push for manslaughter a moment of madness diminished responsibility my client your honor had only just learned that his exwife the woman charged with the care of his son was not only a prostitute but that she was living in accommodation provided for her and the child by one of her clients faced with this revelation a revelation made by police officers no less mr dow fled from a police station and was allowed to roam free the balance of his mind affected dow would be lucky to serve six years it was horrible she said voice reduced to a whisper of course it was templer reached out and took her hand reminding siobhan of laura laura so alive reaching out to touch her hand in the car a blunt knock at the door and not even a wait to be asked to enter siobhan could see templer readying to tear a strip off the intruder it was davie hynds he glanced at siobhan then fixed his eyes on templer got him was all he said dows story was that he had given himself up but the arresting officers were saying hed resisted siobhan had said she wanted to see him he was in one of the cells downstairs they were waiting for him to be transferred to leith where the cells were ancient and the approximate temperature of a deep freeze all the year round hed been found at tollcross looked like he was heading for the morningside road maybe planning to hike south out of the city but then siobhan remembered that caffertys lettings agency was on that same stretch of road there was a knot of officers outside his cell door they were laughing derek linford was one of them linford was rubbing his knuckles as siobhan approached one of the uniforms unlocked the cell she stood in the doorway dow sat on the concrete bed with head sunk into his chest when he lifted it she saw the bruising both eyes were almost closed looks like you did more than kick him in the nuts shiv linford said provoking more laughter she turned to him dont pretend you did this for me she said the laughter ceased the smiles evaporating at best i was the excuse then she turned to face dow but i hope it hurts i hope it keeps on hurting i hope you get cancer you repellent little shit the smiles were back in place but she just walked past them theyd taken the lexus gray knew glasgow rebus could have driven them to barlinnie the famous barl jail was on the edinburgh side of town just off the motorway but chib kelly wasnt in barlinnie he was under guard at a citycenter hospital hed had a stroke hence the urgency of their visit if they wanted chib kelly cogent the sooner they talked to him the better he could be faking it rebus said he could gray agreed rebus was thinking of cafferty and his miracle recovery from cancer caffertys story was that he was still being treated albeit privately rebus knew it was a lie hed woken early with someone thumping on his door the donny dow story had already reached tulliallan rebus had got on the mobile trying first siobhans home and then her own mobile recognizing his number shed picked up you all right hed asked bit tired not hurt no bruises to report it was a good answer it didnt mean she wasnt hurting in other ways the rough stuff is supposed to be my job hed chided her keeping his voice light youre not here shed reminded him before saying goodbye rebus looked out of his passengerside window glasgow roads all looked the same to him i always get lost driving round here he confessed to gray im like that in edinburgh all those bloody narrow streets jinking this way and that its the oneway system here gets me every time easy once you know it you glasgowborn francis the lanarkshire coalfields thats where im from fife coalfields me rebus said with a smile forging this new bond between them gray just nodded he was concentrating on the world beyond his windshield jazz said there was something you wanted to talk about he said im not sure rebus hesitated is that why you picked me for this trip maybe gray paused seemed to be watching the scenery anything you want to say better be quick five minutes well be in the car park maybe later rebus said bait the hook john make sure the point drives home gray gave a halfshrug as though he didnt care the hospital was a tall modern building on the north side of the city it looked to be ailing stonework tarnished windows clouded with condensation the car park was full but gray stopped on a double yellow placing a card next to the windshield stating he was a doctor on emergency call does that help rebus asked sometimes why not use a police sign get real john people round here see a cop car theyre likely to christen it with a halfbrick the admissions desk was next door to ae while gray queued to find out chib kellys ward number rebus eyed the array of walking wounded cuts and bruises downandouts nursing worlds made of shopping bags sadfaced civilians for whom this was an experience devoutly to be forgotten teenage boys swaggered by in packs they seemed to know each other patrolled the aisles as though they owned the place rebus checked his watch ten am on a weekday imagine it at midnight on saturday gray said seeming to read rebuss thoughts chibs on the third floor lifts are over here the lifts opened onto a waiting area and the first person rebus saw he recognized from the photos they had on file fenella rico lomaxs widow she knew them for cops straight off and was on her feet tell them to let me see him she cried ive got my rights gray put a finger to his lips you have the right to remain silent he said now behave yourself and well see what we can do youve no business being here my poor mans had a heart attack we heard it was a stroke she started wailing again how am i supposed to know what it is they wont tell me anything well tell you something gray cajoled just give us five minutes eh he put his hands on her shoulders and she allowed him to push her slowly back down onto the seat a member of the nursing staff was watching through a narrow vertical window in the doors to the ward as they walked towards her she pushed the doors open were thinking of having her ejected she said how about giving her a bit of news instead the nurse glared at gray when we have news well tell her how is he rebus asked trying to calm things down he had a seizure of some kind theres paralysis down one side would he be able to answer some questions gray asked able yes willing im not so sure she led them past beds filled with old men and young men a few of the patients were on their feet shuffling in carpet slippers along a polished linoleum floor the color of oxblood there was a faint smell of fried food mingled with disinfectant the long narrow room was stifling rebus was already beginning to feel the sweat cloying on his back the very last bed had been closed off by curtains behind which lay a pastyfaced man hooked up to machines and with a drip going into one arm he was in his early fifties a good ten years older than the woman outside his hair was gray combed back from the forehead his chin and cheeks had been shaved erratically silver stubble flecking the skin seated on a chair was a prison guard he was leafing through a tattered copy of scottish field rebus noticed that one of chib kellys arms was hanging down the side of the bed the wrist had been handcuffed to the iron frame hes that dangerous is he gray commented eyeing the cuffs orders the guard said rebus and gray showed their id and the guard introduced himself as kenny nolan nice day out for you eh kenny gray said conversationally thrilling nolan said rebus walked around the bed kelly had his eyes closed there didnt seem to be any movement behind the lids and the chest was rising and falling rhythmically you asleep chib gray said leaning down over the bed whats all this a voice said behind them a doctor in a white coat was standing there stethoscope folded into one pocket clipboard in his hand cid gray explained weve got a few questions for the patient does he really need those handcuffs the doctor was asking nolan orders nolan repeated any particular reason rebus asked the guard he knew that kelly could be a violent man but he hardly looked an immediate threat to the public nolan wasnt about to answer the question so gray stepped in barlinnie lost a couple of prisoners recently they walked away from hospital wards just like this one rebus nodded his understanding while nolan reddened at his starched white shirt collar how long till he wakes up gray was asking the doctor who knows will he be in a fit state to talk to us ive really no idea the doctor started moving away checking a message on his pager gray looked across to rebus these doctors eh john consummate professionals the crème de la crème rebus agreed mr nolan gray said if i give you my number any chance you could page me when the prisoner comes round i suppose so you sure gray made eye contact want to check first to make sure its not against orders dont listen to him rebus advised nolan hes a sarky bugger when the mood takes him then to gray give the man your number francis im melting in here they told fenella lomax what little they could leaving aside any mention of the handcuffs hes sleeping peacefully rebus tried to reassure her regretting his choice of words immediately they were what you said just before someone died but fenella nodded silently and allowed them to lead her down to the ground floor in search of something to drink there was no cafeteria as such just an illstocked kiosk rebus whod skipped breakfast bought a dry muffin and an overripe banana to go with his tea the surface of the liquid was the same gray color as all the patients theyd seen youre hoping hell die arent you fenella lomax said why do you say that because youre cops thats why youre here isnt it on the contrary fenella gray said we want to see chib up and about there are a few questions wed like to ask him what sort of questions rebus swallowed a mouthful of crumbs weve reopened the case on your late husband she looked shocked eric why i dont understand no case is ever closed until its solved rebus told her di rebus is right gray said and weve been given the job of dusting off the files see if we can add anything new whats chib got to do with it maybe nothing rebus assured her but something came to light a day or so back what her eyes darted between the two detectives chib owned your husbands local the one hed been in the night he died so so we need to talk to him about it rebus said what for just so the files complete gray explained maybe you could help by telling us a little yourself theres nothing to tell well fenella thats not strictly true rebus told her for a start it didnt seem to come out at the time that chib owned the bar rebus waited but she just shrugged a woman on crutches was trying to get past their table and rebus moved his chair taking him a little closer to fenella when did you and chib become an item it was months after eric died she stressed she was a pro knew where they were going with this but you were friendly before her eyes burned into his how do you mean friendly gray sat forward i think hes wondering if you and chib were maybe a bit more than friends fenella then he leaned back again its not the sort of thing you can hide is it tightknit community like that im guessing wed just have to ask around and wed find out the score ask all you like she said folding her arms theres nothing to tell you must have known though gray persisted women always do in my experience known what whether chib fancied you thats all were talking about no it isnt she said coldly youre talking about framing chib for something he didnt do we just need to be sure of the relationships involved rebus said quietly that way we dont go jumping to conclusions or heading off down the wrong road he tried to inject a bit of hurt into his voice we thought you might like to help with that erics death is ancient history she stated unfolding her arms reaching for her cup maybe weve just got longer memories than some gray said his tone gaining more edge as his patience waned whats that supposed to mean she lifted the cup as if to drink from it im sure di gray didnt mean to suggest but rebus didnt get the chance to finish the sentence shed hurled the tea into grays face and was on her feet now walking purposefully away gray was on his feet too fucking hell he held a handkerchief to his face rubbing it dry his white shirt was stained he glanced in fenellas direction we could have her for that couldnt we rebus was thinking back to his own tea incident if you want to he said jesus its not like i gray realized his pager was sounding he checked it patients awake he said the lifts were at the far end of the building both men left the table and started walking rebus glad to see the back of his muffin and banana lets hope she doesnt beat us to it he said gray was nodding shaking drips from his shoes in fact there was no sign of fenella lomax on the ward someone had put some pillows behind chib kellys head and he was accepting sips of water from a nurse nolan stood up when rebus and gray approached thanks for letting us know gray said thats a favor i owe you nolan just nodded hed noticed the stained shirt but didnt ask chib kelly had finished drinking and was resting his head against the pillows eyes closed how are you feeling mr kelly rebus asked youre cid the voice croaked i can practically smell it off you thats because they make us all wear the same deodorant rebus sat down watching the nurse she was saying something to gray about letting the doctor know kelly was awake gray just nodded but as she moved away he touched nolans arm go keep her talking kenny give us a few extra minutes he winked you might even get a date nolan seemed happy with the challenge kelly had opened one eye gray sat down in the guards vacated seat we need to get those cuffs off you chib ill have a word when he comes back what do you want we want to talk about a pub you used to own the claymore i sold it three years ago wasnt it making you any money rebus asked it didnt fit my portfolio kelly said closing the eye again rebus had thought his voice hoarse from sleep but it wasnt something had affected it so that only one side of the mouth was operating a hundred percent they keep telling me a portfolios a good thing to have gray said eyes on rebus money we make we may never get the chance to find out he winked rebus wondered if he was trying to tell him something my hearts bleeding kelly slurred well youre in the right place rico lomax used to drink in the claymore didnt he rebus asked the patient kelly opened both eyes he didnt look surprised just curious rico were doing some housework on his case rebus explained just a few loose ends to tidy up kelly was quiet for a moment rebus could see nolan at the far end of the ward engaging the nurse in conversation rico drank in the claymore kelly acknowledged and as the owner youd drink there too sometimes sometimes rebus nodded even though the patients eyes were closing again so youd have met him gray chipped in i knew him and fenella too rebus added kelly opened his eyes again look i dont know what it is you think youre trying to pull like we said its housekeeping and what if i told you to take your feather dusters elsewhere well obviously wed find that highly amusing rebus said about as amusing as a stroke gray added kelly looked at him eyes narrowing i know you dont i weve met once or twice youre based out at govan gray nodded with all the other bent cops kelly tried his best to smile with both sides of his face i hope youre not suggesting that my colleague is less than honest rebus said angling for details they all are kelly said then he looked at rebus and corrected himself you all are were fenella and you an item before rico got whacked gray hissed suddenly tired of the game playing thats all we want to know kelly considered his answer it wasnt till after not that fenella didnt spread herself a bit thin back then but that was because she was with the wrong man something she didnt realize till after rico was dead rebus asked doesnt mean i killed him kelly said confidently then who did what do you care ricos just another blip on your clearup rate rebus ignored this you say fenella had other men care to give us some names a doctor was approaching different one from before excuse me gentlemen he was saying give us something to work with chib rebus demanded kelly had his eyes closed the doctor was bedside now if youll just leave us for a few minutes he was saying youre welcome to him gray said but take my advice doc dont strain yourself they took the lift back down stepped outside rebus lit a cigarette gray stared at it greedily thanks for putting temptation my way funny thing about hospitals rebus said i always need to smoke afterwards give me one gray held out a hand youve stopped dont be a bastard all your life gray flicked his hand towards himself and rebus relented offering both a cigarette and the lighter gray inhaled held the smoke in his lungs then exhaled noisily his eyes were screwed shut in ecstasy christ thats good he said then he examined the tip of the cigarette let it fall from his fingers and crushed it underfoot you might have nipped it and given it back rebus complained gray was studying his watch suppose we could head back he said meaning back to edinburgh or or we could take that tour i was promising you bugger is i cant drink if im driving then well stick to irnbru rebus said i suppose we could visit the claymore see if anyone remembers any names for us rebus nodded but didnt say anything waste of time gray asked could be gray smiled why is it i get the feeling you know more about this case than youre letting on rebus concentrated on finishing his cigarette thats why you were so keen at tulliallan wasnt it getting to the files before anyone else rebus nodded slowly you were right about that i didnt want my name coming up yet you still let it happen in fact you made it happen you could have kept that page of the report hidden destroyed it even i didnt want to be in your debt rebus confided so what is it you know about rico lomax thats between me and my conscience gray snorted dont tell me youve still got one of those dwindling to the size of my pension rebus flipped his cigarette stub down a grating dickie diamonds old girlfriend really did recognize you didnt she i knew dickie a bit back then i know what jazz is thinking what hes wondering if there could be any connection with that attack at the manse rebus shrugged jazz has an active imagination dont give too much away john his brain was telling him he had to convince gray he was dirty without giving the man too much ammo if he incriminated himself at any turn it was something they the trio and the high hiedyins both could use against him but grays mind was working away rebus could see it in the very way he was standing head angled hands in pockets if you did have anything to do with the rico case im not saying i did rebus qualified im saying i knew dickie diamond gray accepted the point all the same doesnt it strike you as quite a coincidence that weve ended up working that exact same case except that we havent its rico lomax were investigating not dickie diamond and theres no connection between the two i dont remember going quite that far rebus said gray looked at him and laughed shaking his head slowly you think the brass have got an inkling and are out to get you what do you think rebus was pleased and disturbed that grays mind was taking him down this road pleased because it deflected grays thoughts from another coincidence namely that of him jazz and ward being thrown together into tulliallan with rebus a late and sudden recruit disturbed because rebus himself was wondering about the lomax case too and whether strathern had some agenda that he was keeping to himself i was talking to a couple of guys whove been on our course before gray said know what they told me what tennant always uses the same case not an unsolved a murder that happened in rosyth a few years back they got the guy thats the case he always uses for his syndicates but not for us rebus stated gray nodded makes you think eh a case both you and i worked whatre the chances think we should ask him i doubt hed tell us but it does make you wonder doesnt it he came up close to rebus how far do you trust me john hard to tell should i trust you probably not everyone will tell you what an arse i can be gray smiled for effect but his eyes remained bright calculating orbs are you going to tell me what it was you couldnt tell jazz theres a price attached and whats that i want the tour first gray seemed to think he was joking but then he started nodding slowly okay he said youve got a deal they walked back to the car where someone had attached a parking ticket to grays windshield he tore it off merciless bastards he growled looking around for the culprit there was no one in view the doctor on call badge was still visible on the dashboard thats glasgow for you eh gray said unlocking the car and getting in a city full of prods and tims each and every one of them a callous godless bastard it wasnt what youd call the citys tourist route govan cardonald pollok and nitshill dalmarnock bridgeton dennistoun possilpark and milton there was an almost hypnotic sameness to a lot of the streets rebus let his eyes drift out of focus tenement walls playgrounds corner shops kids watchful but bored now and then gray would relate some story or incident no doubt with embellishments collected over the years of telling he provided thumbnail sketches of villains and heroes hard men and their women in bridgeton they passed the grounds of celtic fc parkhead to civilians like rebus paradise to the clubs supporters thisll be the catholic end of town then rebus commented he knew that the rangers stadium ibrox was practically next door to govan where gray was stationed so he added and youll be a bluenose i support rangers gray agreed have done all my life are you a hearts man im not really anything gray looked at him you must be something i dont go to games what about when you watch on tv rebus just shrugged i mean theres only two teams playing at any one time you must take sides not really say it was rangers against celtic gray was growing annoyed youre a protestant right whats that got to do with it well christs sake man youd be on rangers side wouldnt you i dont know theyve never asked me to play gray let out a snort of frustration see rebus went on i didnt realize it was meant to be religious warfare fuck off john gray concentrated on his driving rebus laughed at least i know now how to wind you up just dont wind the mechanism too tight gray cautioned he saw a sign for the m time to head back yet or do you want to stop somewhere lets go back into town and find a pub finding a pub should present no major difficulties gray said indicating right they ended up in the horseshoe bar it was central and crowded with people who took their drinking seriously the kind of place where no one looked askance at a teastained shirt so long as the wearer had about him the price of his drink rebus knew immediately that it would be a place of rules and rituals a place where regulars would know from the moment they walked through the door that their drink of preference was already being poured for them it had gone twelve and the fixedprice lunch of soup pie and beans and ice cream was doing a roaring trade rebus noticed that a drink was included in the price they each opted for pie and beans no starters or dessert there was a corner table just emptying so they claimed it two pints of ipa as gray had argued they could manage one pint apiece surely cheers rebus said and thanks for the tour were you impressed i saw places id never been before glasgows a maze jungle would be a better description you like working here though i cant imaging living anywhere else not even when you retire not really gray took a mouthful of beer youll be on full pension i suppose not long now ive thought about retiring rebus confessed but im not sure what id do with myself theyll turf you out one day rebus nodded i suppose they will he paused thats why ive been thinking of supplementing my pension gray knew they were at long last coming to the point and how will you do that not on my own rebus looked around as though someone in the noisy bar might be listening in could be ill need some help help to do what knock off a couple of hundred grands worth of drugs there it was out the single mad bloody scheme he could think of something to snare the trio and maybe even maneuver them away from rico lomax gray stared at him then burst out laughing rebuss face didnt change jesus youre serious gray eventually said i think it can be done you must have put your arse on backwards this morning john youre supposed to be one of the good guys im one of the wild bunch too the smile had left grays face by degrees he stayed quiet sipped at his drink their food arrived and rebus squirted brown sauce onto his piecrust christ john gray said rebus didnt answer he wanted to give gray time after hed demolished half the pie he put down his fork you remember i got called out of class gray nodded not about to interrupt there were these two sdea men downstairs they took me back into edinburgh there was something they wanted to show me a drug bust theyve got it tucked away in a warehouse thing is theyre the only ones who know about it grays eyes narrowed how do you mean they havent told customs or anyone else for that matter that doesnt make sense theyre trying to use it as leverage theres someone they want to get to big ger cafferty it was rebuss turn to nod theyre not going to get him but they havent quite realized it yet and meantime the dope is just sitting there but protected i assume so i dont know what securitys like gray grew thoughtful they showed you this stuff a chemist was grading it at the time why did they show it to you because they wanted to do a trade i was the intermediary rebus paused i dont really want to get into it but if someone lifts the consignment it has to be you who else have they shown it to i dont know rebus paused but i dont think id be their number one suspect why not because word is cafferty knows about it too so he might make a bid to get to it first which is why wed have to act fast gray held up a hand trying to stem rebuss enthusiasm dont go saying we rebus bowed his head in a show of repentance the beauty of it is theyll lift cafferty for it especially if he finds himself with a kilo or so planted on him grays eyes widened youve got it all figured out not all of it but enough to be going on with are you in gray ran a finger down the condensation on his glass what makes you think id help or jazz come to that rebus shrugged tried to look disappointed i just thought i dont know its a lot of money maybe it is if you can shift the drugs something like that john youd have to range far and wide selling a bit at a time very dangerous i could sit on them awhile and watch them go stale drugs are like pies at their best when fresh i bow to your superior knowledge gray grew thoughtful again have you ever tried anything like this before rebus shook his head eyes fixing on grays have you gray didnt answer and you just thought this up not straightaway ive been looking for something for a while some way of making sure i could kiss the job goodbye in style rebus noticed their glasses were empty same again better get me a softie if im driving rebus approached the bar he had to work hard not to turn around and study gray he was trying to look nonchalant but excited he was a cop whod just stepped over the line gray had to believe him had to believe in the scheme it was the only one rebus had he bought a whiskey for himself something with which to toast his newfound bravado gray had wanted an orange and lemonade rebus placed it before him there you go he said sitting down youll appreciate gray said that this dream of yours is pure mental rebus shrugged placed his glass to his nose and pretended to savor the aroma even though his mind was so stretched he couldnt smell anything what if i say no gray asked rebus shrugged again maybe i dont need any help after all gray smiled sadly and shook his head im going to tell you something he began lowering his voice a little i pulled off something a while back maybe not as grand as this but i got away with it rebus felt his heart lift what was it he asked but gray shook his head not about to answer were you alone or did you have help grays head continued its slow arc not telling was it bernie johns and his millions rebus ached to ask the question stop this stupid game and just ask he was holding the glass trying to appear relaxed and all the time he felt it might splinter in his grasp he stared down at the table willing himself to place the glass there nice and slow but his hand didnt move half his brain was warning him youll smash it youll drop it your hand will shake the contents out of it maybe not as grand as this what did that mean was johnss stash disappointing or did he just not want rebus to know you got away with it thats the main thing he said his throat just loose enough to form recognizable words he tried a cough it felt like invisible fingers were busy squeezing just beneath the skin im losing this he thought you all right gray asked rebus nodded finally putting down his glass it just feels im a bit edgy youre the only person ive told what if i cant trust you shouldve thought of that first i did think of it first its just that im having second thoughts bit late for that john its not your idea any longer its out in the public domain unless i take you outside he left it for gray to finish the thought and kill me with a baseball bat like what happened to rico gray broke off gnawed his bottom lip what did happen to him john i dont know gray stared at him come on i really dont know francis on my kids life rebus held his hand to his heart i thought you knew gray seemed disappointed you bastard did strathern plant you are you feeding me a line about bernie johns so that ill spill the beans about rico sorry was all john rebus said sitting on his hands to stop them shaking gray took a mouthful of the fizzy drink stifled a belch why me how do you mean why tell me do i look that corruptible as it happens yes and what if i run back to archie tennant tell him what youve just said theres nothing he can do rebus guessed no law against having a dream is there but this isnt just a dream is it john that depends gray was nodding something in his face had changed hed come to some decision tell you what he said i like listening to this dream of yours what about if you fill in some of the spaces on the drive back to base which spaces exactly where this warehouse is who might be guarding it what sorts of drugs were talking about gray paused thosell do for starters fair enough rebus said siobhan had slept in phoning to apologize as she waited for the water in the shower to run hot no one at the station seemed too worried by her absence she told them she was coming in no matter what shed forgotten about her scalp until the water hit it after which her bathroom was filled with the sound of cursing donny dow had been transferred to leith and she made that her first stop di bobby hogan went over the statement shed made last night it didnt need any changes do you want to see him he asked afterwards she shook her head two of your guys pryde and silvers will be sitting in on our interviews hogan was pretending to busy himself writing a note theyre going to tie him to marber good for them you dont agree hed stopped writing his eyes lifting to meet hers if donny dow killed marber it was because he knew about marbers relationship with laura so why did dow explode when told about it by linford hogan shrugged if i put my mind to it i could come up with a dozen explanations he paused you cant deny it would be nice and neat and how often does a case end like that she said skeptically rising to her feet at st leonards the talk was all about dow except for phyllida hawes siobhan bumped into her in the corridor and hawes signaled towards the womens toilets when the door had closed behind them hawes confessed that she had gone out with allan ward the previous evening how did it go siobhan asked quietly lowering her voice and hoping hawes would follow suit she was remembering derek linford listening outside the door i had a really good time hes pretty hunky isnt he hawes had ceased to be a cid detective they were supposed to be two women now gossiping about men cant say ive noticed siobhan stated her words had no effect on hawes who was studying her own face in the mirror we went to that mexican place then a couple of bars and did he see you home like a gentleman actually he did she turned to siobhan and grinned the swine i was just about to invite him up for coffee and his mobile rang he said he had to hotfoot it back to tulliallan did he say why hawes shook her head i think he was pretty close to not going but all i got was a peck on the cheek known siobhan couldnt help thinking as the kissoff you seeing him again hard not to when were both in the same station you know what i mean hawes giggled siobhan had never known her so was coquettish the right word she seemed suddenly ten years younger and distinctly prettier were going to arrange something she admitted so what did the pair of you find to talk about siobhan was curious to know the job mostly the thing is allans a really good listener so mostly you were talking about you just the way i like it hawes was leaning back against the sink arms folded legs crossed at the ankles looking pleased with herself i told him about gayfield and how id been seconded to st leonards he wanted to know all about the case the marber case hawes nodded what part i was playing how it was all going we drank margaritas you could buy them by the jug how many jugs did you get through just the one didnt want him taking advantage did i phyllida id say you definitely wanted him taking advantage both women were smiling yeah definitely hawes agreed giggling again then she gave a long sigh before a look of shock came over her face and she slapped a hand to her mouth oh god siobhan i havent asked about you im okay siobhan said it was the reason she thought hawes had brought her in here lauras murder but it must have been horrible i dont really want to think about it have they offered you counseling christ phyl why would i need that to stop you bottling things up but im not bottling things up you just said you didnt want to think about it siobhan was becoming irritated the reason she didnt want to think about lauras death was that she had something else niggling away at her now allan wards interest in the marber case why do you think allan was so interested in your work she asked he wanted to know all about me but specifically the marber case hawes looked at her what are you getting at siobhan shook her head nothing phyl but hawes was looking curious and a little worried would she go straight to ward and start blabbing maybe youre right siobhan pretended to concede im getting worked up about stuff i think its because of what happened of course it is hawes took her arm im here if you need someone to talk to you know that thanks siobhan said offering what she hoped was a convincing smile as they walked back to the office together her mind turned again to the scene outside the paradiso the lock clicking she hadnt said anything to ricky ponytail about it but she would shed replayed the event so many times in the past few hours wondering how she could have helped maybe leaning over to the passengerside door pushing it open for laura so that she could simply fall backwards into the car before dow got to her being faster out of the driving seat herself faster across the hood tackling dow more effectively she should have disabled him straightaway shouldnt have let laura lose so much blood got to push it all aside she thought think about marber edward marber another victim seeking her attention another ghost in need of justice rebus had confessed to her once after too many latenight drinks in the oxford bar that he saw ghosts or didnt see them so much as sense them all the cases the innocent and not so innocent victims all those lives turned into cid files they were always more than that to him hed seemed to see it as a failing but siobhan hadnt agreed we wouldnt be human if they didnt get to us shed told him his look had stilled her with its cynicism as if he were saying that human was the one thing they werent supposed to be she looked around the inquiry room the team was hard at work hood linford davie hynds when they saw her they asked how she was she fended off their concern noting that phyllida hawes was blushing ashamed not to have had the same reaction siobhan wanted to tell her it was okay but hynds was hovering by her desk needing a word siobhan sat down slipping her jacket over the back of the chair what is it she asked its the money you asked me to look for she stared at him money what money laura stafford thought marber was in line for some big payout hynds explained seeing her confusion oh right she was noting that someone had been using her desk in her absence coffee rings a few loose paper clips her intray was full but looked as though it had been disturbed she remembered gray flicking through case notes and others from rebuss team wandering through the room and allan ward asking phyllida about the inquiry her computer monitor was switched off when she switched it on little fish swam across the screen a new screen saver not the scrolling message it looked as if her anonymous gremlin had taken pity on her she realized that hynds had been saying something only when he stopped the silence drew her attention back to him sorry davie i didnt catch that i can come back he said cant be easy for you coming in today like this just tell me what it was you were saying you sure bloody hell davie she picked up a pencil have i got to stab you with this he stared at her and she stared back suddenly aware of what shed said she watched the way her hand was holding the pencil holding it like a knife christ she gasped im sorry dont be she dropped the pencil picked up the receiver instead she signaled for hynds to wait while she made the call to bobby hogan its siobhan clarke she said into the mouthpiece something i forgot the blade dow used theres a diy shop next door to here maybe thats where he bought it theyll have security cameras could be staff will recognize him she listened to hogans response thank you she said putting the receiver down again have you had any breakfast hynds asked i was just about to ask the same thing it was derek linford the look of concern on his face was so exaggerated siobhan had to suppress a shiver im not hungry she told both men her phone buzzed and she picked it up the switchboard wanted to transfer a call it was from someone called andrea thomson ive been asked to call you thomson said im a well i hesitate to use the word counselor youre supposed to be a career analyst siobhan said stopping thomson in her tracks someones been talking she said after a long silence you work with di rebus dont you siobhan had to admit thomson was sharp he told me youd denied being a counselor some officers dont like the idea count me among them siobhan glanced at hynds who was gesturing encouragement linford was still trying for the sympathetic look not quite getting it right lack of practice siobhan guessed you might find that it helps to talk through the issues thomson was saying there arent any issues siobhan replied coldly look ms thomson ive got a murder case to be getting on with let me give you my number just in case siobhan sighed okay then if itll make you feel better thomson started reeling off two numbers office and mobile siobhan just sat there making no effort to record them thomsons voice died away youre not writing them down are you oh ive got them dont you worry hynds was shaking his head knowing damned well what was going on he lifted the pencil and held it out to her give them to me again siobhan told the receiver call finished she held up the scrap of paper for hynds to see happy ill be happier if you eat something me too derek linford said siobhan looked at andrea thomsons phone numbers derek she said davie and i have got to have a meeting can you take any messages for me she started shrugging her arms back into her jacket where will you be linford asked trying not to sound peeved in case we need you youve got my mobile number she told him thats where ill be they went around the corner of the station and into the engine shed hynds admitted he hadnt known it was there it really was an engine shed she told him steam engines i suppose they pulled freight trains coal or something there are still bits of the railway line they run down to duddingston in the café they bought tea and cakes siobhan took one bite and realized she was starving so what is it youve found she asked hynds was primed to tell the story she could see hed been keeping it to himself not wanting to dilute its effect before she heard it i was talking to marbers various financial people bank manager accountant bookkeeper and and no hint of any large amount about to accrue hynds paused as though uncertain whether accrue was the right word and and i started looking at debits instead these are listed in his bank statements by check number no clue as to who each check was paid to siobhan nodded her understanding which is probably why one debit slipped by without us noticing he paused again his meaning clear for us read linford five thousand pounds the bookkeeper found the check stub but the only thing written there was the amount business check or personal the money was drawn from one of marbers personal accounts and you know who it was to she decided to take a guess laura stafford hynds shook his head remember our artist friend she looked at him malcolm neilson hynds was nodding marber gave neilson five grand when was this only a month or so back it could have been payment for a work hynds had already thought of this marber doesnt represent neilson remember besides anything like that would have gone through the business no need to tuck it away where no one would see it siobhan was thinking hard neilson was outside the gallery that night looking for more money hynds guessed you think he was blackmailing marber either that or selling him something i mean how often do you have a blazing row with someone then pay them a fourfigure sum for the privilege and what exactly was he selling him siobhan had forgotten all about her hunger hynds nodded towards the cake willing her to finish it maybe thats the question we should be asking him he said just as soon as youve cleared your plate neilson appeared at st leonards with his solicitor as requested by siobhan both interview rooms were empty rebuss crew were said to be touring caravan sites siobhan sat down in ir taking the same seat linford had been in yesterday when donny dow had made his escape neilson and william allison sat opposite her davie hynds to her side theyd decided to tape the meeting it could put pressure on the subject sometimes they got nervous around microphones knew that whatever they said could come back to haunt them its for your benefit as much as ours siobhan had explained this being the standard line allison made sure that thered be two copies one for cid and one for his client then they got down to business siobhan switched the tape machines on and identified herself asking the others present to do the same she studied malcolm neilson as he spoke the artist sat with eyebrows raised as though surprised to find himself suddenly transported to such surroundings his hair was its usual wild self and he was wearing a thick loose cotton shirt over a gray tshirt whether by accident or design he had buttoned the shirt wrongly so one side was lower than the other at the neck youve already told us mr neilson siobhan kicked off that you were outside the gallery the night edward marber died yes remind us why you were there i was curious about the show no other reason such as you only have to answer the questions malcolm allison interrupted you dont need to add your own well since mr neilson has asked the question siobhan said perhaps i can let my colleague answer hynds opened the slim manila folder in front of him and slid a photocopy of the check across the desk would you care to enlighten us was all he said dc hynds siobhan said providing commentary for the tapes is showing messrs neilson and allison a copy of a check made out in the sum of five thousand pounds to mr neilson and dated one calendar month ago the check is signed by edward marber and comes from his personal bank account there was silence in the room when she finished might i consult with my client allison asked interview paused at elevenforty hours siobhan said curtly stopping the machine it was times like this she wished she smoked she stood with hynds outside ir tapping her foot against the floor and a pen against her teeth bill pryde and george silvers arrived back from leith and were able to report on their first full interview with donny dow he knows hes going down for his wife silvers said but he swears he didnt kill marber do you believe him siobhan asked hes a bad bastard i never believe anything those kind tell me hes in a bit of a state about his wife pryde commented that really tugs my heartstrings siobhan said coldly are we going to charge him with marber hynds asked only weve got another suspect in there in which case a new voice added what are you doing out here it was gill templer theyd told her they wanted to bring in neilson and shed agreed now she stood with hands on hips legs apart a woman who wanted results hes consulting with his lawyer siobhan explained has he said anything yet weve only just shown him the check templer shifted her focus to pryde any joy down in leith not exactly she exhaled noisily we need to start making some progress she was keeping her voice low so the lawyer and painter wouldnt hear but there was no missing the sense of urgency and frustration yes maam davie hynds said turning his head as the door to ir swung open william allison was standing there were ready now he said siobhan and hynds retreated back inside with door closed and tape running they sat across the desk once more neilson was pushing his hands through his hair making it stick up at ever more ungainly angles they waited for him to speak when youre ready malcolm the lawyer prodded neilson leaned back in his chair eyes staring ceilingwards edward marber gave me five thousand pounds to stop being a nuisance to him he wanted me to shut up and go away why was that because people were starting to listen to me when i spoke about him being a cheat did you ask him for the money neilson shook his head we need it out loud for the tape siobhan prompted i didnt ask him for anything neilson said it was him that came to me he only offered a thousand at first but eventually it went up to five and you were at the gallery that night because you wanted more hynds asked no you wanted to see how well the show was doing siobhan stated that might suggest that you were wondering whether there was any more money to be made out of your nuisance value after all youd accepted the money and there you were still hassling marber if id wanted to hassle him id have gone in wouldnt i then maybe all you wanted was a quiet word neilson was shaking his head vigorously i didnt go near the man but you did i mean i didnt speak to him you were happy with the five hynds asked i wont say happy but it was a kind of vindication i took it because it represented five thousand of crooked money that he wouldnt be spending the artists hands went to the sides of his face making a rasping sound against a days growth of beard how did you feel when you heard he was dead the question came from siobhan neilson locked eyes with her i got a bit of a kick out of it if im being honest i know thats hardly the humane response but all the same did you wonder if wed start looking into your relationship with mr marber siobhan asked neilson nodded did you wonder if wed find out about this payment another nod so why didnt you just tell us i knew how it would look sounding sheepish now and how do you think it looks it looks as though i had motive means and whatever his eyes never left hers isnt that right if you didnt do anything theres no reason to worry she said he angled his head youve got an interesting face detective sergeant clarke do you think i might paint you when this is finished lets concentrate on the present mr neilson tell us about the check how was the eventual sum reached was it posted to you or did you meet afterwards hynds and siobhan bought themselves a late lunch at a bakers filled rolls cans of drink from the fridge the day was warm overcast siobhan felt like taking another shower but really it was the inside of her head she wanted to sluice ridding it of all the confusion they decided to walk back to st leonards the long way round eating as they went take your pick hynds said donny dow or neilson why not both of them siobhan mused neilson watching edward marber alerting dow when marbers taxi arrived the two of them in cahoots and while were stirring the pot lets add big ger cafferty not a man you want to be found ripping off i cant see marber conning cafferty like you say its too fraught anyone else with a grudge what about laura stafford maybe she got sick of their arrangement maybe marber wanted to take things a bit further hynds paused what about donny dow as lauras pimp siobhans face fell thats enough she snapped hynds realized hed said the wrong thing he watched as she tossed the rest of her roll into a bin brushed crumbs and flour from her front you should talk to someone he said quietly counseling you mean do me a favor im trying to seems like you dont want to listen ive seen people killed before davie how about you she had stopped to face him were supposed to be partners he said sounding aggrieved were supposed to be senior and junior officer sometimes i think you get muddled over whos who christ shiv i was only and dont call me shiv he made to say something further but seemed to think better of it took a swig of his drink instead after a dozen paces he took a deep breath sorry she looked at him sorry for what for making jokes about laura siobhan nodded slowly a little of the tension left her face youre learning davie im trying he paused truce he suggested truce she agreed after which they resumed their walk in a silence that could almost have been called companionable when rebus and gray got back to the station ir was full the rest of the team had split into two pairs spent the day hitting the east coasts caravan parks talking to the site owners longterm users and residents now they were back and weary didnt know there were static parks allan ward said people living in these fourberth jobs like they were proper houses little flower beds outside and a kennel for the alsatian way house prices are going stu sutherland added could be the wave of the future must be freezing in winter though tam barclay said dci tennant was listening to all this with arms folded as he leaned against the wall he turned slowly towards rebus and gray i hope to christ you two have got something more for me than property speculation and gardening tips gray ignored him you didnt get anything he asked jazz mccullough bits and pieces jazz answered it was six years ago people move on we spoke to the owner of one site ward said he hadnt been there when rico was around but hed heard stories allnight parties boozedup arguments rico used two caravans on that site supposedly with another two or three elsewhere are the caravans still there gray asked one of them is other caught on fire caught on fire or was set on fire ward shrugged a response you see why im impressed tennant announced so bring me glad tidings from dear old glasgow town it took gray and rebus only five minutes to summarize their trip leaving out everything except the hospital visit at the end of it tennant looked less than cheered if i didnt know better he told them id say you lot were pissing into the wind weve hardly started sutherland complained my point exactly tennant wagged a finger at him too busy enjoying the good life not busy enough doing the work youre supposed to be here for he paused maybe its not your fault maybe theres nothing here for us to find back to tulliallan tam barclay guessed tennant was nodding unless you can think of a reason to stay put dickie diamond sir sutherland said there are friends of his we still need to talk to weve got feelers out with a local snitch meaning all youre doing here is waiting theres one other avenue sir jazz mccullough said at the time diamond went awol there was that rape case at the manse rebus concentrated hard on the rooms mudcolored carpet tiles and tennant prodded and nothing sir its just a coincidence that might be worth following up you mean in case diamond had anything to do with it i know it sounds thin sir thin you could use it as a pizza topping maybe just another day or two sir gray advised there are some loose ends we could do with tying up and since were already here he glanced towards rebus with an expert to guide us expert tennants eyes narrowed gray had slapped a hand onto rebuss shoulder when it comes to edinburgh sir john knows where the bodies are buried isnt that right john tennant considered this while rebus said nothing then tennant unfolded his arms stuck his hands in the pockets of his suit jacket ill think about it he said thank you sir after tennant had left the room rebus turned to gray i know where the bodies are buried gray shrugged gave a little laugh isnt that what you told me metaphorically speaking of course of course unless you know different later that afternoon rebus stood by the drinks machine considering his options he had a handful of change but his mind was on other things he was wondering who to tell about the heist scheme the chief constable for instance strathern wouldnt know about the warehouse stash he was sure of that claverhouse had gone to carswell the assistant chief the two of them were mates and carswell would have given his blessing to the project without feeling the need to bother the big chief if rebus told strathern about it the chief would most likely blow his top not liking the notion of having been sidelined on such an important bust rebus wasnt sure what the result would be but he couldnt see it doing his heist scheme any good what he needed at the moment was for the knowledge of the busts existence to remain as secret as possible it wasnt as if he was actually going to carry out any heist it was a smoke screen a way to infiltrate the trio and hopefully glean some information on bernie johnss missing millions he wasnt sure that gray and co would go for it in fact it worried him that gray had proved so attentive why would gray consider such a scheme when he already had much more salted away than any raid on the warehouse would bring him all rebus had wanted the story to do was prove to the trio that he too could be tempted that he like them could fall now he had to consider a further possibility that the trio would want to take it further make the plan a reality and why would they do that if they were so stinking rich on their illgotten gains the only answer rebus could think of was that there were no gains in which case he was back to square one or even worse he was square one instigator of a plot to steal several hundred grands worth of dope from under the noses of his own force then again if gray and co had gotten away with it maybe all theyd learned was that they could do it again could greed stop them thinking straight the worry was rebus knew they probably could do it the security around the warehouse wasnt overzealous last thing claverhouse wanted was for the site to start looking heavily guarded all that would do was attract attention a gate a couple of guards maybe a padlocked warehouse so what if there was an alarm alarms could be dealt with guards could be dealt with a decentsized station wagon would accommodate the haul what are you contemplating john the game was changing he still didnt know much about the three men but now gray knew that rebus knew something about dickie diamond john knows where the bodies are buried the slap gray had given him on the shoulder had been a warning letting him know who was in charge suddenly linford was behind him you using that machine or just counting your savings rebus couldnt think of a comeback so simply stepped aside any chance of another ringside seat linford said slotting his coins home what you and allan ward have you made your peace linford pressed the button for tea then cursed himself should have made that coffee tea has a way of flying around here just crawl back into your fucking hole rebus said cids a lot quieter without you any chance of making it permanent not much hope of that rebus told him i promised id retire when you lost your cherry ill have retired before that happens siobhan said walking towards the two men she was smiling but with little amusement and who was it deflowered you ds clarke linford smiled right back at her before shifting his gaze to rebus or is that something we dont want to get into he started walking away rebus moved a step closer to siobhan thats what the women say about dereks bed you know he said loud enough for linford to hear what siobhan asked playing along that its something they dont want to get into after linford had disappeared siobhan got herself a drink not having anything she asked gone off the idea rebus stated dropping the coins back into his pocket how are you im fine really well mostly she confided and no i dont want to talk about it i wasnt going to offer she straightened up maneuvering the hot plastic cup thats what i like about you she said then got a minute i need to pick your brains they went down to the car park rebus lighting a cigarette siobhan made sure there were no other smokers around no one to eavesdrop all very mysterious rebus said not really its just something thats niggling me about your friends in ir what about them allan ward took phyllida out last night and and shed nothing to report ward was quite the gentleman took her home but wouldnt go upstairs when she offered she paused hes not married or anything rebus shook his head not going steady if he is it doesnt show i mean phyls a bonny enough girl wouldnt you say rebus nodded his agreement and hed been paying her plenty of attention all night the way she said this made rebus focus on her what sort of attention asking her how the marber case was coming along its a natural enough question arent womens magazines always saying men should do more listening i wouldnt know i never read them she looked at him archly didnt realize you were such an expert you know what i mean though she nodded the thing is it made me think about the way di gray has been mooching around the inquiry room and that other one mccullen mccullough rebus corrected her jazz ward and gray spending time in the inquiry room probably doesnt mean anything siobhan said what could it mean he asked she shrugged something they wanted someone they were interested in she thought of something else the case youre working on did anything happen last night he nodded someone we wanted to speak to he was rushed into hospital part of him wanted to tell her more tell her everything he knew she was one person he could trust but he held back because there was no way of knowing whether telling her would put her in danger somewhere down the line the reason ward didnt go upstairs with phyl she was saying was because he got a call on his mobile and had to head back to the college that could have been him hearing about it rebus remembered that when hed arrived at tulliallan himself pretty late on gray jazz and ward had still been awake sitting in the lounge bar with the dregs of their drinks in front of them the bar itself had stopped serving no one else about and with most of the lights extinguished but the three of them still awake and seated around the table rebus wondered if theyd summoned ward back so they could discuss what to do about rebus the chat hed had with jazz gray coming up with the idea to take rebus as his partner to glasgow maybe quiz him further when rebus had walked in gray had told him about chib kelly and repeated that he wanted rebus with him rebus hadnt really questioned the decision he remembered asking ward how his date with phyllida hawes had gone ward had shrugged saying little it hadnt sounded like there was going to be a repeat performance siobhan was nodding thoughtfully theres something im not getting isnt there such as ill know that only when you tell me theres nothing to tell she stared at him yes there is something else you need to know about women john we can read you lot like a book he was about to say something but his mobile was trilling he checked the number held a finger up to let siobhan know he needed this to be private hello he said moving across the car park i was hoping id hear from you the mood i was in believe me you didnt want to hear from me im glad youre calling now are you busy im always busy jean that night on the high street i was roped into that group of guys from the college lets not talk about it jean burchill said im phoning to thank you for the flowers you got them i did along with two phone calls one from gill one from siobhan clarke rebus stopped and looked back but siobhan had already retreated indoors they both said the same thing jean was telling him and what was it that youre a pigheaded lout but youve got a good heart ive been trying to call you jean i know and i want to make it up to you how about dinner tonight where you choose how about number one if you can get us a table ill get us a table he paused im assuming its expensive john you muck me about its always going to cost lucky for you this time its only money seventhirty and dont be late i wont be they finished the call and he headed back inside stopping at the comms room to find a phone number for the restaurant he was in luck theyd just had a cancellation the restaurant was part of the balmoral hotel on princes street rebus didnt bother to ask how much it was likely to cost number one was a specialoccasion place people saved to dine there atonement wasnt going to come cheap nevertheless he was in good spirits as he walked back to the interview room someone looks frisky tam barclay commented and wasnt that the fragrant ds clarke we saw coming back from the car park allan ward added they started whistling and laughing rebus didnt bother to say anything one man in the room wasnt smiling francis gray he was seated at the table with a pen clenched between his teeth playing out a rhythm on it with his fingernails he wasnt so much watching rebus as studying him when it comes to edinburgh john knows where the bodies are buried said metaphorically rebus didnt think so by six that evening the inquiry room had emptied siobhan was glad to see them go derek linford had been giving her foul looks ever since the drinks machine davie hynds had spent the afternoon writing up the report on malcolm neilsons payoff the only break hed taken had been to interview with silvers as his partner a goodlooking woman who turned out to be sharon burns the art collector siobhan had asked silvers afterwards who shed been hed explained then grinned davie said youd be jealous phyllida hawes had been sitting moonfaced and anxious ever since lunch checking her watch and the doorway wanting allan ward to pay another visit but no one from ir had come near eventually hawes had asked siobhan if she fancied a drink after work sorry phyl siobhan had lied ive got a prior engagement last thing she wanted was hawes crying on her shoulder because ward was giving her the cold one but silvers and grant hood were up for a pint and hawes had joined them hynds had waited to be asked and eventually he was i could probably manage one hed said trying not to sound too desperate might join you linford had said if thats all right more the merrier hawes had told him sure you cant come siobhan thanks anyway siobhan had replied leaving her alone in the office at six oclock the sudden silence relieved only by the hum of the strip lighting templer had left much earlier to attend some meeting at the big house the brass would want to know what progress was being made on the marber case as her eyes drifted over the wall of death siobhan could have told them precious little theyd be keen for a result which was precisely when mistakes could be made shortcuts taken theyd be wanting donny dow or malcolm neilson to fit the frame even if it meant reshaping them one of her teachers at college had told her years back it wasnt the result that mattered it was how you got there hed meant that you had to play fair stay openminded make sure the case lacked any slow punctures so the procurator fiscal wouldnt kick it straight back at you it was up to the courts to decide guilt and innocence the job of cid was merely to stitch the pieces together into a ball she looked down at her desk her notepad was a mass of doodles and squiggles some in blue ink some in black not all of them hers she knew she drew little tornadoes when she was on the phone and cubes sometimes and rectangles that looked like union jacks one of the designs belonged to hiho silvers arrows and cacti were his specialties some people never doodled she couldnt remember rebus ever doing it or derek linford it was as if they might give too much away she wondered what her own graffiti would reveal to an expert the tornado could be her way of giving some shape to the chaos of an investigation the cubes and flags same thing more or less arrows and cacti she wasnt so sure about one name on her pad had been ringed and then half obliterated by a phone number ellen dempsey what was it cafferty had said ellen dempsey had friends what sort of friends the kind cafferty didnt want to tangle with is this what promotion does to you rebus said he was leaning against the doorframe how long have you been there dont worry im not spying he walked into the room theyve all buggered off then full marks for spotting that the old powers of deduction havent quite left the building yet rebus tapped his head his chair was behind what was now linfords desk he wheeled it out and placed it in front of siobhans dont let that baheid sit in my seat he complained your seat i thought you stole it from the farmers old office gill didnt want it rebus said defending himself as he sat down and got comfortable so whats on the menu for tonight beans on toast probably how about you he made a show of thinking it over resting his feet on the desktop boeuf en croûte maybe washed down with a good bottle of wine siobhan wasnt slow jean called he nodded i wanted to thank you for interceding on my behalf so where are you taking her number one siobhan whistled any chance of a doggie bag there might be a bone or two left what are you writing she noticed what she was doing ellen dempseys name was down here only its been written over i just wanted to write it again to remind myself of what i think shes worth looking at on what grounds on the grounds that cafferty said she has friends you dont think it was donny dow who killed marber she shook her head i could be wrong of course what about this artist guy i hear you had him in for questioning too we did he took a payoff from marber promised to stop badmouthing him didnt exactly work no but you dont see him for the killer either she gave an exaggerated shrug maybe nobody did it maybe a big boy did it and ran away she smiled has anyone in the whole history of the world ever really used that as an alibi im sure i tried it when i was a kid didnt you i dont suppose my mum and dad would have believed me i dont suppose any parents been duped by it doesnt mean a kid wouldnt try it she nodded thoughtfully neither dow nor neilson has an alibi for the night marber was killed even caffertys storys a bit shaky you think cafferty was involved im beginning to lean that way he probably owns the paradiso he could have known about laura and marber his driver happened to be lauras ex and caffertys a collector someone marber could have cheated then bring him in she looked at him hes hardly likely to burst into tears and confess bring him in anyway just for the hell of it she stared down at ellen dempseys name why do i get the feeling that would be for your benefit rather than mine because youve a suspicious nature ds clarke rebus checked his watch rose to his feet got to go make yourself look pretty siobhan guessed well a change of shirt anyway better find time for a shave too if you want jean to get up close and personal rebus ran a hand over his chin a shave it is he said siobhan watched him go thinking men and women when did it all get so complicated and why she opened her notepad at a fresh sheet and lifted her pen a few moments later ellen dempseys name was written there at the still center of an ink tornado rebus had washed his hair shaved brushed his teeth he had dusted off his good suit and found a brandnew shirt having removed its packaging and all the pins hed tried it on it needed ironing but he didnt know where the iron was or whether he owned such an object come to that if he kept his jacket on no one would see the creases pink tie no dark blue yes no stains on it that he could see he gave his shoes a quick wipe with the dishcloth dried them on the tea towel looked at himself in the mirror his hair had dried a bit spiky and he tried flattening it his face was flushed he realized he was nervous he decided to get there early a chance to check out the prices so he wouldnt look shocked in front of jean besides once hed reconned the place he would feel more comfortable in general maybe time for a quick whiskey just to steady him the bottle peered at him from floor level not here he thought ill have one when i get there he decided to take the car jean didnt drive and on the off chance that they might end up at her place in portobello a car would be handy it also gave him an excuse not to order too much wine let her drink for both of them and if he did drink he could leave the car in town fetch it later keys credit cards what else maybe a change of clothes he could always leave them in the car that way if he stayed the night at her place no no if he suddenly announced that he had spare clothes in the trunk shed know hed expected the night to end like that no premeditation john he warned himself last question aftershave yes or no no same reasoning so out of the flat realizing halfway down the stairs that he hadnt checked his phone messages so what he had his mobile and pager with him the car was in a sweet parking space almost directly outside shame to lose it two minutes after he drove away it would be taken still might not need a space tonight stop thinking like that what if the menu was all in french shed have to order for both of them maybe that would be a good ruse ask her straight off to order for him putting himself in her hands et cetera he was trying to think what else could go wrong credit card bouncing on him doubtful using the wrong spoon very possible there seemed already to be patches of sweat beneath his arms jesus john nothing was going to go wrong he unlocked the car slid into the drivers seat turned the key in the ignition the engine was behaving itself into reverse and out of the space he shifted into first and started down the road arden street had been reduced to a narrow lane by cars parked either side suddenly one of them reversed out of a space right in front of him rebus hit the brakes bloody stupid he sounded the horn but the driver just sat there rebus could see the shape of a head no passengers come on he called gesticulating it was a twelveyearold ford with the exhaust practically hanging off rebus decided to memorize the license plate and make sure the bastard got some grief still the car wasnt budging rebus undid his seat belt and got out slammed shut his own door started walking towards the lightblue ford he was ninety percent of the way there when he suddenly thought trap he looked around but no one was coming up behind him all the same he stopped in his tracks four feet from the drivers door the man was still sitting there hands on the steering wheel that was good it meant he wasnt carrying a weapon hey rebus called either move the car or lets talk about it the hands slid from the wheel the door opened with a dry grating clunk the sound of unoiled hinges the man placed one foot on the road eased himself halfway out of the car i want us to talk he said rebuss eyes widened whatever hed been expecting it wasnt this this face that voice this ghost i cant he managed to say i have to be somewhere in twenty minutes thisll take ten the voice said rebuss eyes were drawn to the mouth there was new dental work there blackened teeth had been removed or polished the diamond dog was looking pretty good for a dead man we can talk later rebus pleaded diamond shook his head slid back into his car he was reversing completely out of the parking spot rebus had to move aside so he wouldnt be crushed between the ford and his own saab a hand appeared from the window motioning for him to follow rebus glanced at his watch fuck looked up and saw the ford trundling forwards moving away from him ten minutes he could afford ten minutes hed still be at the restaurant ahead of time fuck rebus got back behind the wheel of his own car and started following dickie diamond they drove only the distance of two or three streets diamond parked on a single yellow safe enough this time of the evening rebus stopped directly behind him diamond was already out of the ford they were next to bruntsfield links a wide grassy slope where golfers occasionally practiced their pitch n putt skills recently students had taken to holding barbecues on the links using cheap disposable kits the tin trays left charred rectangular marks on the grass diamond was testing one of these rectangles with his foot he was dressed well nothing expensive or showy but not bargainbasement either whos the lady he asked his eyes running the length of rebuss suit what the hell are you doing here diamond met rebuss lessthanhappy gaze then he gave a rueful smile and started walking down the slope rebus hesitated then followed what sort of game are you playing he asked thats the question i should be asking i thought i told you never to set foot here that was before i got wind of whats been happening in the six years since theyd last met diamonds face had grown even thinner as had his hair what remained of the latter was an unnatural depth of black there were dark halfmoons beneath the eyes but no sign of excess weight or any lessening of the faculties and what exactly has been happening rebus asked youve got people looking for me that doesnt mean theyre going to find you unless of course you come charging back into town rebus paused who told you was it jenny bell diamond shook his head she doesnt even know im alive it was malky then rebus was guessing but it hit home diamond revealed as much by saying nothing malky in the bar z hovering near the table my advice rebus continued is that you get back in your car and hightail it out of town i meant it when i told you to stay away and ive been good as my word until now diamond had started rolling himself a cigarette so why the sudden interest coincidence thats all im on a training course and they happened to pick out rico lomax as an exercise an exercise in what diamond licked the edge of the paper rebus watched as he pulled a few stray strands of tobacco from the finished rollup and put them back in the tin they wanted us working a case see how they could turn us back into team players a team player you diamond chuckled and lit his cigarette rebus checked his watch look he said ive really i hope youre leading them up the crow road rebus his voice had assumed an edge of menace and what if i dont rebus said stubbornly ive been away a long time i miss the place itd be nice to come back i told you at the time i know i know but i was maybe too scared of you back then im not so scared now rebus pointed a finger you were part of it you come back here somebodyll get you im not so sure more i think about it more i get the feeling its your arse ive been protecting all these years you want to walk into a police station be my guest diamond examined the tip of his cigarette thatll be for me to decide not you rebus bared his teeth you little turd i could have had you buried remember that its rico i remember i think of him often how about you i didnt kill rico then who did diamond chuckled again we both know the score rebus and what about you dickie did you know rico was giving your girlfriend one way she tells it you were there at the time is that right maybe youre the one who had the grudge the one who wanted revenge rebus nodded slowly that could be the way ill tell it in court you whacked your old pal and did a runner diamond was shaking his head chuckling once more he looked around slid the tobacco tin back into his jacket pocket pulled out a snubnosed revolver and aimed it at rebuss gut im in the frame of mind to shoot you right now is that what you want rebus looked around them no one within a hundred yards dozens of tenement windows this is great dickie blending in with your surroundings and all that nobody notices people brandishing firearms in the middle of edinburgh maybe i dont care anymore maybe you dont rebus had his hands by his sides bunched into fists he was three feet or so from diamond but would he be quick enough how long would i serve if i shot you twelve to fifteen out in a bit less than that you wouldnt serve ten minutes dickie youd be on a death sentence as soon as the prison gates shut behind you maybe maybe not people i know have long memories i want to come home rebus he looked around again i am home fine but put the gun away youve proved your point diamond glanced down at the revolver not even loaded he said hearing which rebus swung at him connecting with the hollow just beneath his breastbone he grabbed diamonds gun hand and prized the revolver away sure enough its chambers were empty diamond was down on his hands and knees groaning rebus wiped his own prints off the gun with his handkerchief and dropped it onto the grass you try that again rebus was hissing and ill break every one of your fingers youve dislocated my thumb diamond bawled look he held his right hand up for rebuss inspection then launched himself at him smashing him backwards onto the grass the wind was knocked out of rebus diamond was crawling over him pinning him down rebus struggled and as diamonds grinning face came level with his own he headbutted him then half rolled so that diamond was forced off rebus clambered to his feet and swung a foot at diamond who wrapped his arms around it trying to throw him off balance instead rebus dropped to both knees his whole weight landing on diamonds chest the man groaned and spluttered let go rebus spat diamond let go rebus got to his feet once more this time stepping back out of range i heard a rib snap diamond complained as he writhed the hospitals the other side of the meadows rebus told him good luck he looked at himself grass stains and mud on his trousers shirt hanging out his tie was over to one side hair rumpled and he was going to be late i want you to get in your car he told the prone figure and keep driving its like the sparks song said this town aint big enough for the both of us i see you here again after tonight youre dead meat understood the body said something but rebus couldnt make it out he guessed diamond wasnt complimenting him on the welcome home he parked directly outside the restaurant and ran down the steps jean was in the cocktail bar pretending to study the menu her face was icy as he approached then despite the understated lighting she finally saw that something had happened what did you do as he bent down to kiss her cheek she touched her fingers to his forehead it stung and he realized hed grazed it a bit of a disagreement he said am i presentable enough for a place like this the maître d was hovering can you bring john a large whiskey jean asked a nice malt perhaps sir rebus nodded laphroaig if youve got it and some ice jean added in a glass by itself she smiled at rebus but with concern in her eyes i cant believe im going to have dinner with a man wholl be holding an ice pack to his face rebus studied his surroundings place like this they probably have someone to do that for you she smiled more openly youre sure youre all right im fine jean honest he lifted her hand kissed the inside of her wrist nice perfume he said opium she told him rebus nodded filing the information away for future use the meal was long and wonderful rebus relaxing a little more with each course jean asked just once about the disagreement rebus muttering a few words of concocted explanation before she held up a hand and stopped him id rather you told me to mind my own business john just dont start making up a story its eversoslightly insulting sorry one day maybe youll feel like opening up to me maybe he agreed but inside he knew the day would never come it hadnt happened with rhona during all the years of his marriage no reason to think things would be any different now hed drunk just the one large malt followed by two glasses of wine and as a result felt fine to drive as one of the waiters helped jean into her coat rebus asked if he could give her a lift she nodded they drove to portobello well fed and friends again an old fairport convention tape providing background music as they turned onto her street she spoke his name drawing it out he knew what she was about to say and preempted it you dont want me coming in not tonight turning towards him is that all right of course it is jean no problem there werent any parking spaces so he just stopped in the middle of the road outside her house it was a lovely meal she said well have to do it again maybe not quite so extravagantly i didnt mind you took your punishment very nobly she said leaning over to kiss him her fingers touched his face he placed both hands on her shoulders feeling awkward much the way hed felt as a teenager first dates not wanting to screw things up good night john can i phone you tomorrow you better had she warned opening her door its rare that i give someone a second chance scouts honor he said lifting two fingers to his right temple she smiled again and was gone she didnt look back just climbed the steps to her front door unlocked it and closed it after her the hall light was already on the lazy persons deterrent he waited till the lights came on upstairs hallway and bedroom then put the car into gear and moved off there was no space for the saab in arden street he had a quick look to make sure dickie diamond wasnt lurking but there was no sign he parked a twominute walk away enjoying the fresh air the night was crisp almost autumnal the dinner had gone well he decided no interruptions hed switched off his mobile and his pager hadnt sounded trying his mobile now he found that he had no new messages thank christ for that he said pushing open his tenement door he was going to have one more whiskey albeit a large one he was going to sit in his chair and listen to some music hed already penciled in led zeppelins physical graffiti he wanted something that would blow everything else away he might even fall asleep in the chair and that wouldnt matter things were back on track with jean he thought so hoped so hed phone her first thing in the morning maybe again after work he reached his landing stared at his door for christs sake the door was wide open the hall dark within someone had used an implement of some kind to bust the lock there were shards of freshly splintered wood he peered into the hall no signs of life no sounds not that he was going to risk it the memory of diamonds revolver was too recent diamond probably had the ammo hidden somewhere maybe even in his car rebus called on his mobile asked for backup then he stood on the landing and waited still no signs of life from within he tried the light switch by the front door nothing happened five minutes had passed when downstairs the main door opened and closed hed heard a car screeching to a halt feet on the staircase he leaned over to watch siobhan clarke climbing towards him youre the backup he said i was in the station this time of night she paused four steps down from him i can always go home she half turned as if to leave might as well stay he said now youre here dont suppose youve got a flashlight on you she opened her bag there was a large black flashlight inside she clicked it on fuse box is over there he said pointing into the hall someone had turned the electricity off rebus flipped the switch and the lights came on they moved through the rest of the flat as a team quickly sensing that no one was there looks like a straightforward breakin she commented he didnt respond you dont agree id feel happier with the diagnosis if anything were actually missing but nothing was nothing he could see the hifi tv his albums and cds his booze and books all present and correct to be honest im not sure id bother nicking anything either siobhan said picking up the cover of a nazareth lp do you want to call it in as a housebreaking rebus knew what that would mean a fingerprint team leaving dust everywhere giving a statement to a bored woolly suit and everyone at the station knowing hed been turned over he shook his head siobhan looked at him you sure im sure she seemed only now to spot that he was wearing a better suit than usual how was the meal he looked at himself started removing his tie fine he popped the top button on his shirt and felt some of the pressure ease thanks again for calling her anything to help she was studying the living room once more youre sure nothings been taken pretty sure then why would someone break in i dont know care to try a few guesses no dickie diamond gray the weasel plenty of people seemed to know where he lived but what would any of them be looking for maybe it was the students through the wall desperate to play some decent music for a change siobhan sighed pinching the bridge of her nose between her fingers why is it that when you say no i know youve already got some names in mind womans intuition not my finely honed detectives skills then those too of course have you got a joiner you can phone she meant the door emergency repair needed ill wait till morning they charge an arm and a leg otherwise and what if someone comes tiptoeing in here through the night ill hide under the bed till theyve gone she came forwards till she was standing directly in front of him slowly lifted her hand rebus didnt know what she was going to do but he didnt shy away her forefinger touched his brow how did that happen its just a graze a fresh one though wasnt jean was it i just fell into something they locked eyes and i wasnt drunk gods honest truth he paused but speaking of drink he picked up the bottle care to join me now youre here cant have you drinking alone can we ill fetch a couple of glasses any chance of a coffee to go with it ive no milk she went into her bag again producing a small carton i was saving this for home she said but in the circumstances he retreated to the kitchen and siobhan slipped off her coat she was thinking that she would redecorate this room given the chance a lighter carpet for definite and junk the s light fixtures through in the kitchen rebus took two glasses from the cupboard found a milk jug and poured some cold water into it just in case siobhan felt the need then he opened the freezer compartment of his fridge lifted out a half bottle of vodka a packet of venerable fish fingers and a shriveled morning roll there was a polythene shopping bag beneath and in it the chief constables report on bernie johns rebus was fairly sure no one had tampered with it he put it back along with the fish fingers and the roll filled the kettle and switched it on you can have vodka instead if you prefer he called whiskeys fine rebus smiled and closed the freezer door did you ever listen to that arab strap tape i made you siobhan asked as he returned to the living room it was good he said drunk guy from falkirk right lyrics all about getting his end away he poured handed her the glass offered water but she shook her head they both sat down on the sofa sipped their drinks theres a saying isnt there rebus asked something about drinking and friendship misery loves company siobhan guessed mischievously thats it rebus said with a smile raising his glass heres to misery to misery siobhan echoed where would we be without it he looked at her you mean its part and parcel of human life no she said i mean you and me would be out of a job as soon as he woke up rebus called jean hed actually made it as far as his bed last night but when he walked through to the living room the hifi was still playing wishbone ashs theres the rub he must have pressed the repeat button by mistake the whiskey glasses were on the dining table siobhan had left a good half inch untouched rebus thought about finishing it but dribbled it back into the bottle instead then he reached for the telephone jean was still asleep he imagined her tousled hair sun streaming in through her cream burlap curtains sometimes when she woke up there were fine white accumulations at the corners of her mouth i said id call he told her i was hoping it might be at a civilized hour but she was goodhumored about it i take it you didnt manage to pick up any unsuitable women on your way home and what sort of woman do you think would be unsuitable for me he asked smiling hed already decided that she neednt know about the breakin or about siobhans little visit they chatted for five minutes then rebus placed another call this time to a joiner he knew a man who owed him a favor after which he made himself coffee and a bowl of cereal there wasnt quite enough milk for both so he watered the carton down from the cold tap by the time hed eaten showered and got dressed the joiner had arrived pull the door shut after you tony rebus told him making his way out onto the landing as he walked downstairs he wondered again who might have been behind the breakin diamond was the obvious candidate maybe hed wanted to wait for rebus but had got fed up as rebus drove to st leonards he replayed the scene on bruntsfield links he was furious that diamond had pulled a gun on him loaded or not it didnt matter he tried to recall how hed felt not scared exactly in fact fairly calm when someone aimed a gun at you it was pointless to worry either you were going to get shot or you werent he remembered that his whole body had tingled almost vibrating with an electric energy dickie diamond the diamond dog thinking he could get away with something like that he parked the car and decided to skip his usual cigarette instead he went to the comms room and gave the word that he wanted patrols to be on the lookout for a certain motor vehicle he gave the description and license plate nobodys to go near it all i want is the whereabouts the uniform had nodded then started speaking into the mike rebus was hoping diamond would have heeded his warning to clear out of town all the same he needed to be sure it was another half hour before the rest of the wild bunch arrived theyd come in the one car rebus could tell which three had been squeezed into the backseat ward sutherland and barclay they were doing stretching exercises as they walked into the room gray and jazz driver and frontseat passenger once again rebus wondered about allan ward about how he felt being so often the odd man out he was yawning his back clicking as he raised and lowered his shoulders so what did you lot get up to last night rebus asked trying to make it sound like a casual inquiry a few drinks stu sutherland said and early to bed rebus looked around what he asked in apparent disbelief all of you jazz nipped home to see his missus tam barclay admitted see to her more like sutherland added with a leering grin we should hit a nightclub some evening barclay said kirkcaldy maybe see if we can get a lumber you make that sound so appetizing allan ward muttered so the rest of you were in the bar at tulliallan rebus persisted pretty much barclay said we werent pining for you why the interest john gray asked if youre afraid of being left out sutherland added you should move back there with us rebus knew he darent push it any further hed got back to his flat around midnight if the intruder had come from tulliallan theyd have had to leave the college around half past ten eleven oclock at the latest that would have given them time to drive into edinburgh search the flat and get out again before he arrived home how had they known he would be out something else to think about dickie diamond had known he was headed for a rendezvous reinforcing his position as most likely culprit rebus half hoped one of the patrols would call in a sighting if diamond was still in edinburgh rebus had a few things to put to him so whats the schedule today jazz mccullough asked closing the newspaper hed been reading leith i suppose gray informed him see if we can track down any more of diamonds pals he looked at rebus what do you think john rebus nodded anyone mind if i stay here for a bit ive a couple of jobs to do fine with me gray said anything we can help you with rebus shook his head shouldnt take too long francis thanks all the same well whatever happens ward said if we dont come up with something tennants going to have us back at tulliallan pronto they nodded agreement it would happen today or tomorrow it would happen and the rico case would become paperwork again and brainstorming sessions and making a card index and all the rest no more side trips no chances for breaks at the pub or the odd meal out the rico case would have died gray was staring at rebus but rebus kept his eyes on the wall he knew what gray was thinking he was thinking that john rebus would like that state of affairs just fine im only doing this because you asked so nicely whats that mr cafferty siobhan asked letting you bring me here cafferty looked around ir to be honest ive had prison cells bigger than this he folded his arms so how can i help you detective sergeant clarke its the edward marber case your name seems to be cropping up at all sorts of tangents i think ive told you everything i can about eddie is that the same as telling us everything you know caffertys eyes narrowed appraisingly now youre just playing games i dont think so cafferty had shifted his attention to davie hynds who was standing with his back against the wall opposite the desk you all right there son he seemed pleased when hynds failed to respond how do you like working under a woman dc hynds does she give you a rough ride you see mr cafferty siobhan went on ignoring everything hed said weve charged donny dow your driver with the murder of laura stafford hes not my driver hes on your payroll siobhan countered diminished responsibility anyway cafferty stated with conviction poor bugger didnt know what he was doing believe me he knew exactly what he was doing when she saw caffertys smile siobhan cursed herself for letting him push her buttons the woman dow murdered worked in the sauna paradiso i think if i dig deep enough ill find that youre its owner better buy a big shovel then you see how already you connect to both the murderer and his victim hes not a murderer till hes convicted cafferty reminded her you speak with a wealth of experience in that area dont you cafferty shrugged he still had his arms folded and looked relaxed almost as if he were enjoying himself then theres edward marber siobhan pressed on you were at the private viewing the night he was killed you were one of his clients and ironically he was one of yours he met laura stafford at the sauna paradiso he rented a flat for her and her son your point being my point being that your name keeps cropping up yes you said i think the phrase you used was at all sorts of tangents thats what were talking about here ds clarke tangents coincidences thats all were ever going to be talking about because i didnt kill eddie marber did he cheat you mr cafferty theres no proof he cheated anyone way i hear it it was one mans word against his marber paid that man five thousand pounds to shut up cafferty grew thoughtful siobhan realized she had to be careful how much she gave away to this man she got the feeling cafferty coveted information the way other people did jewelry or fast cars she already had one small result however when shed slipped a mention of the paradiso into the conversation cafferty hadnt denied ownership a knock came at the door it opened and a head appeared round it gill templer ds clarke can i have a word siobhan rose from her chair dc hynds look after mr cafferty will you out in the corridor templer was waiting looking around at the officers who moved with more efficiency once theyd spotted her my office she told siobhan siobhan was hitting the mental rewind button trying to think what shed done that might have merited a chewing out but templer seemed to relax once she was in her own room she didnt ask siobhan to sit and stayed standing herself hands behind her gripping the edge of her desk i think we might try charging malcolm neilson she announced ive been talking it through with the fiscals office youve done a thorough job siobhan meaning the dossier siobhan had compiled on the painter she could see it on the desk thank you maam siobhan said you dont sound too enthusiastic maybe i just think there are some loose ends dozens probably but look at what weve got hed fallen out with marber a very public and bitter argument hed taken money either that or extorted it he was hanging around outside the gallery on the night in question witnesses have placed him there templer counted off on her fingers means motive and opportunity siobhan remembered neilson himself saying much the same thing at the very least we can get a search warrant templer was saying see if it throws up any tidbits i want you to organize it siobhan that missing painting could be hanging in neilsons bedroom for all we know i dont think it would be to his taste siobhan commented knowing it sounded lame templer stared at her why is it that every time i try to do you a good turn you try to pull the rug out from under me sorry maam templer studied her then sighed any luck with cafferty at least he didnt bring a lawyer with him might just mean he doesnt rate the competition siobhan pursed her lips if thats everything maam well it isnt i want to go through the warrant for neilsons arrest shouldnt take us too long let mr cafferty sweat for a while i never could work with a woman boss cafferty told hynds always needed to be my own man know what i mean hynds had taken siobhans seat he was the one sitting with arms folded now while cafferty leaned over the desk palms pressed downwards their faces were so close hynds could have taken a bet on which toothpaste the gangster used not a bad job though is it cafferty ran on being a copper i mean dont get as much respect as in the old days maybe not as much fear either boil down to the same thing sometimes dont they fear and respect i thought respect was something you earned hynds commented same with fear though isnt it cafferty raised a finger to stress the point youd know better than me youre right there son i cant see you putting the frighteners on too many folk im not saying thats a fault mind its just by way of an observation i should think ds clarkes a scarier proposition than you when shes roused hynds thought back to the few times shed snapped at him the way she could suddenly change he knew he was to blame he had to think before he opened his trap shes had a pop at you has she cafferty was asking almost conspiratorially he leaned farther still across the desk inviting some confidence or other you dont half talk a lot for a man whos supposed to be under a death threat cafferty offered a rueful smile the cancer you mean well let me ask you something davie if you had only so long to live wouldnt you want to make the most of every moment in my case maybe youre right maybe i do talk too much i didnt mean hyndss apology was cut short when the door burst open he stood up thinking it would be siobhan it wasnt well now john rebus said isnt this a surprise he looked at hynds wheres ds clarke hynds frowned isnt she out there he thought for a moment dcs templer wanted her maybe theyre in her office rebus put his face close to hyndss whatre you looking so guilty about he asked im not rebus nodded towards cafferty hes the serpent in the tree dc hynds whatever he says it isnt worth hearing got that hynds gave a vague nod got that rebus repeated baring his teeth the nod this time was vigorous rebus patted hyndss shoulder then took the seat hed just vacated morning cafferty long time no see you just keep popping up dont you rebus said like a greasy spot on some adolescents arse would that make you the adolescent or the arse cafferty asked he was leaning back in his chair spine straight arms by his sides hynds noticed that the two mens postures were almost identical rebus was shaking his head it would make me the man with the clearasil he said causing hynds to smile he was the only man in the room who did youre in this up to your neck arent you rebus went on circumstantial evidence alone would see you in a courtroom and out again the same afternoon cafferty countered this is harassment plain and simple ds clarke isnt that way inclined no but you are i wonder who it was put her up to dragging me in here he raised his voice a little are you a betting man dc hynds nobody in their right mind would bet with the devil rebus stated closing hyndss mouth almost before hed opened it tell me cafferty whats the weasel going to do without his chauffeur get a new one i expect donny was a bouncer for you too wasnt he probably handy for selling stuff to all those young clubgoers i dont know what youre talking about you didnt just lose a driver did you you didnt even just lose some muscle rebus paused you lost a dealer cafferty laughed drily id love to spend twenty minutes in your head rebus its a regular fun house funny you should mention that rebus said its the title of a stooges album fun house cafferty turned to stare at hynds as if offering him the chance to concur that rebus was a couple of waltzers shy of a fairground its got a track on it that just about sums you up rebus was saying oh aye cafferty winked in hyndss direction whats that then just a oneword title rebus informed him dirt cafferty turned his attention slowly towards the man seated opposite him do you know the only thing thats stopping me reaching across this desk and crushing your windpipe like an empty fucking chip bag do tell its the feeling i get that youd actually enjoy it would i be correct in that assumption he turned his head towards hynds again what do you reckon davie think di rebus here likes a bit of domination maybe that piece of his in portobello does the leather and stilettos routine the chair crashed as rebus flew to his feet cafferty rose too rebuss arms had snaked across the space between them grabbing the narrow lapels of caffertys black leather jacket one of caffertys own hands had a grip on rebuss shirtfront hynds took a step forwards but knew it would be like a toddler refereeing a cockfight none of them noticed the door opening siobhan plunged in taking hold of both mens arms thats enough break it up or i hit the panic button caffertys face seemed to have drained of blood while rebuss had filled almost as if thered been a transfusion of sorts between the two men siobhan couldnt tell who eased off first but she managed to separate them you better get out of here she told cafferty just when im starting to enjoy myself cafferty looked confident enough but his voice was shaky out siobhan ordered davie make sure mr cafferty doesnt hang around unless its by his neck rebus spat siobhan slapped him on the chest but didnt say anything until cafferty and hynds had left the room then she exploded what the hell are you playing at okay i lost the rag at him this was my interview you had no right to interfere jesus siobhan listen to yourself will you rebus picked up his chair and slumped back down onto it every time gill talks to you you come out sounding like youve just left the college im not going to let you twist this around john then sit down and lets talk about it he had a thought maybe in the car park i could do with a smoke no she said determinedly well talk here she sat down in caffertys chair pulled it in towards the desk what did you say to him anyway it was what he said to me what he knows about jean knows where she lives rebus saw the effect of his words on siobhan what he couldnt tell her was that caffertys utterance had been only part of the problem there was also the small matter of a message from the comms room the note was folded in rebuss breast pocket it told him that dickie diamonds car had been spotted parked in the new town already with a ticket on its windshield and looking abandoned so diamond wherever he was hadnt obeyed orders the real catalyst however was rebuss own sense of frustration hed wanted cafferty in st leonards so he could probe how much the man knew about the sdeas secret cache but when it had come down to it thered been no way of asking not without coming straight out with it the only person who might know who might have access was the weasel but the weasel was no snitch hed said it himself and hed also confided that cafferty and him were not as close as had once been the case there was quite simply no way for rebus to know and that sense of impotence had boiled up within him finally gushing out when cafferty had mentioned jean the bastard had played his trump card knowing the effect it would have the feeling i get that youd actually enjoy it a bit of domination gill wants to bring in malcolm neilson siobhan was saying rebus raised an eyebrow were charging him looks like in which case caffertys off the hook not until we cut the line problem is if we do that we might lose a man overboard rebus smiled dont be so melodramatic im serious she said go read mobydick some time i dont really see myself as captain ahab he was gregory peck in the film wasnt he siobhan started shaking her head eyes never leaving his rebus didnt think she was disagreeing with the casting there was a noise in the corridor then a knock at the door not gill templer this time but a grinning tam barclay hynds said wed find you here he told rebus want to come and take a look at what we found down in leith i dont know rebus said is it contagious but he allowed himself to be taken out of the room past ward and sutherland who were sharing a joke in the corridor and into ir where jazz mccullough and francis gray were standing almost like zoologists studying some new and exotic creature in their midst the creature in question was supping tea from a styrofoam cup its eyes never met rebuss though by no means was it unaware of his sudden presence in the cramped room can you believe it gray said slapping his hands together first stop is the bar z and who should we meet coming out as were going in rebus already knew the answer to that it was seated not four feet from him hed known the answer from the moment barclay had put his head round the door richard diamond aka the diamond dog just to finish the introductions barclay told diamond this is di rebus you might remember him as your arresting officer once upon a time diamond stared straight ahead rebus glanced in grays direction all gray did was wink as if to say rebuss secret was safe with him we were just about to ask mr diamond a few questions jazz mccullough said taking the seat opposite his prey maybe we could start with the breakin and rape at a manse in murrayfield this got a reaction from diamond whats that got to do with anything it coincided with your disappearance mr diamond did it bollocks then why did you disappear funny that you pop up again just when weve started looking for you mans got a right to go where he wants diamond said defiantly only if he has a good reason jazz argued were curious as to what yours was what if i say its none of your business diamond folded his arms then youd be mistaken were investigating the murder of your good friend rico lomax over in glasgow cid came looking for you at the time and suddenly nobody could find you it wouldnt take a conspiracy theorist to see a connection the rest of the team had squeezed into the room leaving the door open diamond looked around him eyes failing to meet rebuss this is all getting a bit cozy isnt it he commented sooner you tell us sooner youll be on your way back to anonymity tell you what exactly everything francis gray growled you and your good pal rico the caravan sites the night he got whacked his wife and chib kelly gray opened his arms expansively start wherever you like i dont know who killed rico got to do better than that dickie gray said he got hit you ran i was scared dont blame you whoever wanted rico out of the way might have been after you next he paused am i right diamond nodded slowly so who was it ive told you i dont know but you were scared anyway scared enough to leave town all this time diamond unfolded his arms clasped his hands over his head rico had made a few enemies down the years could have been any one of them what jazz looked dismissive dont tell me they all had it in for you too diamond shrugged said nothing there was silence in the room until gray broke it john you got anything you want to ask mr diamond rebus nodded do you think chib kelly could have been behind the killing diamond looked like he was thinking this over could be he said at last any way of proving it stu sutherland broke in diamond shook his head thats your job lads if rico really was your friend barclay said youd want to help us whats the point it was a long time ago point is allan ward answered not wanting to be left out the killers still out there somewhere maybe maybe not diamond replied he brought his hands down from his head like i say i dont think i can help you what about the caravans jazz asked did you know one of them got torched if i did id forgotten it you used to go out there didnt you jazz continued you and your girlfriend jenny a bit of a ménage à trois going on there way she tells it that what she told you diamond seemed amused youre saying shes lying see we were starting to wonder if there mightnt have been some jealousy there you being jealous of rico or maybe ricos wife found out he was playing away from home i can see youve got an active fantasy life diamond told jazz francis gray seemed to have heard enough do me a favor will you stu shut that door sutherland complied gray was standing behind diamonds chair he leaned down and brought one arm around until he was fixing diamond to the chair by his chest then he tilted the chair back so their faces werent more than three inches apart diamond struggled but he wasnt going anywhere allan ward had taken hold of him by both wrists pressing them against the tabletop something we forgot to say gray hissed at the prisoner reason they put us on this case is were the lowest of the low the absolute fucking zero as far as the scottish police force goes were here because we dont care we dont care about you we dont care about them we could kick your teeth down your throat and when they came to tell us off wed be laughing and slapping our thighs time was buggers like you could end up inside one of the support pillars for the kingston bridge see what im saying diamond was still struggling grays arm had slid upwards and was now around his throat the crook of the elbow crushing his larynx hes turning beet red tam barclay said nervously i dont care if hes turning fucking blue gray retorted if he gets an aneurysm the drinks are on me all i want to hear from this slimy watery trail of shite is something approximating the truth what about it mr richard diamond diamond made a gurgling sound his eyes were protruding from their sockets gray kept the pressure up while allan ward burst out laughing as if this was the most enjoyment hed had in weeks let the man answer you francis rebus said gray glanced towards rebus then released the pressure dickie diamond started coughing mucus dribbling from his nose thats repulsive ward said letting go the hands diamond instinctively reached for his own throat reassuring himself that it was still intact then his fingers went to his eyes wiping away the water that had been squeezed from them bastards he coughed hoarsely stinking bunch of bastards he got a handkerchief from his pocket blew his nose the door had been closed only a couple of minutes but the place was like a sauna stu sutherland opened it again letting some air in gray still behind diamond had straightened up and was standing with an arm on each of the seated mans shoulders easier all round if you just start talking jazz said quietly suddenly playing sympathetic cop to grays monster all right all right somebody get me a can of juice or something after weve listened to your story gray insisted look diamond tried meeting their eyes lingering longest on rebus all i know is what was being said at the time and what was that jazz asked chib kelly diamond paused you were right about him he was after fenella she found out about rico playing away from home and told chib next thing ricos dead simple as that gray and jazz shared a glance and rebus knew what they were thinking dickie diamond was telling them what he thought they wanted to hear what he thought theyd believe hed taken the information theyd gifted him and he was running with it hed even lifted jazzs own phrasing playing away from home gray and jazz werent falling for it the others in the room looked more excited knew it all along stu sutherland muttered tam barclay was nodding and allan ward seemed entranced grays eyes sought rebuss but rebus wasnt playing he stared down at his shoes while diamond embroidered the story further chib knew about the caravan thats where rico would take all his women it was chib had it torched hed have done anything to win over fenella rebus could see that gray was beginning to apply pressure to diamonds shoulders ththats about all i can tell you nobody crossed chib kelly why i had to do a runner diamonds face was creasing with pain as grays fingers did their work is this a private party or can anyone join in the voice belonged to archie tennant relief flooded rebuss veins as gray let go of diamond barclay and sutherland started talking at once filling tennant in whoa whoa one at a time tennant ordered holding up a hand then he listened to the story the others chipping in when a bit was missed all the time tennant was studying the seated figure diamond staring back aware that he was in the presence of someone important someone who could get him out of this place when the story was finished tennant leaned down with clenched fists on the desk his knuckles bearing his weight is that a fair summary mr diamond he asked diamond nodded vigorously and youd be willing to make a statement to that effect with respect sir jazz mccullough interrupted im not so sure were not being led up the garden path here tennant stood up turned his gaze on jazz and what makes you say that just a feeling sir i dont think im the only one really tennant looked around the room anyone else find mr diamonds story less than tenable i have a few doubts myself sir francis gray piped up tennant nodded his eyes seeming to home in on rebus and yourself di rebus i found the witness credible sir he said the words sounding as stiff to him as to anyone else in the room with respect sir jazz repeating the gambit taking a statement from mr diamond is one thing but letting him walk out afterwards probably means were not going to see him again tennant turned to diamond di mccullough isnt sure he trusts you sir what do you have to say to that you cant keep me here tennant nodded hes got a point there di mccullough im assuming mr diamond would be willing to give us his address in the city diamond nodded with enthusiasm and a permanent address also the nodding continued sir he could make up any number of addresses jazz continued to protest oh ye of little faith tennant commented lets start with a statement anyway he paused always supposing thats okay with you di mccullough jazz said nothing precisely what was expected of him here endeth the lesson tennant intoned pressing the palms of his hands together as if in prayer barclay and sutherland took diamonds statement the others vacating ir leaving them to get on with it tennant motioned to jazz that he wanted a word with him in private the two of them heading towards the stations reception area allan ward said he was heading out back for a smoke rebus declined to join him went to the drinks machine instead he did a good job of protecting you francis gray said he was already at the machine awaiting delivery of his coffee i thought so rebus admitted i dont think anyone else noticed that the two of you knew one another better than you should rebus didnt say anything but you werent exactly surprised to see him were you did he warn you he was in town no comment we found him at the bar z probably means his nephew keeps in touch dickie knew we were after him and came sneaking back did he speak to you last night i didnt know i was working with sherlock fucking holmes gray chuckled shoulders shaking as he leaned down to remove the cup from the machine rebus was reminded of the way the man had leaned down over dickie diamond threatening to smother him completely jazz was walking up the corridor he made a show of rubbing his backside as though the headmaster had just caned him what did halfpint want gray asked twittering on about how its okay to argue your corner against a senior officer but you have to know when to back off and not start taking it personally rebus was thinking halfpint gray and jazz had found their own private nickname for tennant they were close these two i was just telling john gray went on about dickies wee acting lesson back there jazz nodded eyes on rebus he didnt give you away he agreed so gray had told jazz all about rebuss confession were there any secrets between the two men dont worry gray assured him you can trust jazz hes going to have to jazz himself added if were going to pull off this wee plan of his the silence lay between them until rebus could find his voice youre up for it then could be gray said need to know a bit more first jazz qualified layout all that stuff no point being unprofessional is there absolutely not gray concurred right rebus said his mouth suddenly dry it was my calling card thats all there is no wee plan is there you okay john jazz asked maybe getting cold feet gray guessed no no its not that rebus managed to say its just you know its one thing to think about it but quite another to actually do it jazz nodded his understanding if you bastards have got bernie johnss money what do you want this for any chance you could give the premises a quick recon gray was asking we need a floor plan that sort of thing no problem rebus said lets start with that then you never know john it could still end up being pie in the sky ive been thinking rebus said recovering some composure maybe we need a fourth man what do you think of tam barclay tams okay jazz said with little enthusiasm but maybe young allan is better he was sharing a look with gray who started nodding allans our man gray agreed so wholl talk to him rebus asked leave that side of things to us john just you concentrate on the warehouse fine by me rebus said lifting his own cup from the machine he stared at its surface trying to remember if hed pressed the button for tea coffee or selfdestruct he had to tell strathern tell him what exactly no way the heist was going to happen no possible way so what was there to tell at pm malcolm neilson was arrested on suspicion of the murder of edward marber dc grant hood whod been placed in charge of media liaison was in his element two murders two suspects in custody both charged the newspapers and tv wanted to know all about it and he was the person they needed to charm hood knew what questions they would ask and was scuttling around the inquiry room in search of answers hed nipped home and changed into a darkgray suit which hed had made for him at ede and ravenscroft the sleeves had been shortened so as to expose a few inches of shirt cuff emphasizing the gold cuff links hood would tell you that it was all for the cameras you had to look professional others had a different view is he a nancy boy or something allan ward asked rebus dont worry allan rebus assured him youre not his type they were in the car park cigarette break the team in ir was still brooding over dickie diamonds statement opinions ranged from not worth the paper its printed on to chib kellys our man for sure what do you reckon ward asked rebus now im with tennant our jobs to compile the evidence its down to someone else to decide if its a pack of lies or not not like you to side with halfpint ward commented that nickname again halfpint rebus wondered if any of the others knew about it tell me allan have jazz and francis had a chance to speak to you yet what about that sort of answers my question rebus took pity on wards look of befuddlement a wee scheme weve got going you might qualify for a share what sort of scheme rebus tapped his nose tell me how welcome would a bit of cash be ward shrugged depends whose cash it is rebus nodded but kept quiet ward was about to press him when the door burst open and a bunch of uniforms streamed out towards their cars followed by hynds hawes and siobhan hawes cast a glance in wards direction causing him to concentrate on his cigarette the smile shed been preparing melted away ward just wasnt interested off on a jaunt rebus asked siobhan search warrant came through got room for one more she looked at him youre not part of come on siobhan dont give me that routine why the interest who said im interested i just want a break from this place he turned towards ward can you square it with the others ward nodded with little enthusiasm he still had questions for rebus and now he was being left hanging go talk to jazz and francis rebus advised him then he stubbed out his cigarette and made for siobhans car shed already said something to phyllida hawes who was vacating the passenger seat and joining hynds in the back instead cheers phyl rebus said taking her place so where are we off to inveresk malcolm neilson has a house there i thought he lived in stockbridge hynds leaned forward he mostly uses that as a studio something to do with the quality of the light rebus ignored this so inveresk first stockbridge next siobhan was shaking her head linford and silvers are in charge of another team theyre headed for stockbridge leaving neilson to stew back in the cells hes got gill templer and bill pryde for company those two havent conducted a decent interview in years havent let a prisoner escape either phyllida hawes added rebus looked in the rearview returned her smile what exactly is it were hoping to find he asked siobhan god knows she said through gritted teeth maybe he kept some sort of diary hynds offered why im a coldblooded killer hawes suggested as a title inveresks nice though rebus mused must be a few bob in this painting lark he has a place in france too hawes added though i notice were not getting the chance to search that siobhan turned towards rebus local gendarmes will do the job for us just as soon as we can find someone who knows enough french to submit the request could take a while then rebus glanced into the rearview maybe thats where your diary is pourquoi je suis un tueur avec le sang froid hynds offered everything went very still in the car siobhan was first to speak why didnt you say you spoke french nobody asked besides i didnt want to be left off the search soon as we get back siobhan said coldly youre going to tell dci pryde im not sure i know enough to write something as specific as well buy you a dictionary siobhan stated ill help if i can rebus offered and how much french do you have how about nul points there was laughter from the backseat siobhans face tightened and she seemed to grip the steering wheel harder than ever as though right now it was the only thing in her life that was under her control theyd driven through the rougher outskirts of edinburgh craigmillar and niddrie crossing the city boundary and making for musselburgh the selfproclaimed honest toun hynds asked how it had come by the title but no one in the car could answer inveresk was a wealthy enclave on the edge of the town new housing was encroaching only slowly most of the homes here were old large and detached hidden behind high walls or at the ends of long meandering driveways it was a place where politicians and tv celebrities could tuck themselves away from the public gaze this is new to me hynds said peering out his side of the car me too hawes admitted there wasnt much to inveresk and they soon found neilsons house two patrol cars stood at its entrance the local station had been alerted to their arrival the media were there too wanting photos of whatever trove was produced the house itself was not large siobhan would have called it a cottage albeit an extremely pretty one the small front garden was well tended consisting mostly of rose beds though the building was a singlestory construction dormer windows protruded from the tiled roof siobhan had the keys offered up by neilson himself once hed been told that without them police would force an entry she ordered hynds to fetch the roll of trash bags from the trunk just in case they did find anything hawes was in charge of the box of smaller polythene bags plus the tags which would be attached to any useful find everyone was pulling on pairs of gloves while across the road the camera shutters clicked motors humming as the film progressed to the next frame rebus held back this was siobhans show and she was making sure everyone knew it shed gathered her team in a semicircle and was outlining their duties rebus lit a cigarette at the sound of his lighter she turned towards him not in the house she reminded him he nodded contamination ash dropped on a carpet could be misinterpreted rebus decided he was safer outdoors after all he hadnt come here to help with the search what hed needed was some time away from gray and the others time to think siobhan was unlocking the house throwing open its door the officers headed in from what rebus could see the hallway was much like any other from the way shed acted in the car rebus knew siobhan thought they were wasting their time which meant she was far from convinced that the painter was the killer it wouldnt stop her from being thorough the suspects house had to be searched and you never knew what you might find with most of the police having disappeared inside the cameras had little to do but focus on the single detective left smoking a cigarette and wouldnt that picture appeal to gill templer if it found its way into the newspapers rebus turned his back and walked around the side of the house there was a long narrow garden at the rear with a summerhouse and shed at the farthest corners a strip of lawn bordered with flagstones flower beds looking overgrown but that could have been on purpose a wild rambling garden counterpoint to the order provided by the rose beds rebus didnt know enough about either gardening or malcolm neilson to be able to say he walked down to the summerhouse it looked fairly new varnished wooden slats with woodframed and glasspaneled doors the doors were closed but not locked he pulled them open inside deck chairs stacked against one wall awaiting better weather one fairly solid wooden chair boasting wide armrests one of which had been hollowed out to accommodate a cup or glass nice touch rebus thought settling into the chair he had a view across the garden to the house itself and could imagine the artist sitting here maybe with the rain falling outside snug and cozy with a drink for company lucky bugger he muttered shapes moved behind the upstairs and downstairs windows theyd be working two to a room the way siobhan had instructed looking for what exactly anything incriminating or out of place anything that gave them an inkling rebus wished them well what he needed he realized was a place like this it felt like a haven somehow he didnt think the placement of a summerhouse in the back garden of his tenement would have the same effect hed thought before of selling his flat buying a little house just outside the city commuting distance but a place where he could find a bit of peace problem was you could have too much of a good thing in edinburgh he had twentyfourhour shops myriad pubs within a short walk and the constant background hum of street life in a place like inveresk he feared the silence would get to him eventually drawing him deeper into himself not a place he really wanted to be and defeating the whole point of the exercise no place like home he told himself rising out of the chair he wasnt going to find any answers here his troubles were his own and a change of scenery couldnt alter that he wondered about dickie diamond hopefully now in the process of scurrying out of edinburgh hed given his edinburgh address as his sisters house in newhaven his permanent address was a highrise in gateshead theyd sent a message south requesting a check by the local force hed claimed he wasnt currently working but neither had he registered as unemployed no bank account didnt have his driving license with him he hadnt mentioned his car and neither had rebus if they knew about the car they could get an address from his license plate rebus knew that the gateshead address would be fake or outofdate the car might well be another matter he got on his mobile called the comms room at st leonards and asked if the fords last known sighting looking abandoned in the new town could be rechecked but the comms room already knew car was lifted this morning the officer said which meant it would be in the pound a hefty levy payable before it could be released rebus doubted diamond would bother the ford was probably worth less than the charges now attached to it doesnt take long for them to clear rubbish from the new town does it rebus said into the phone it was parked outside a judges front door blocking the space for his own car the officer explained got the fords registration address the officer reeled it off same one diamond had given them in the interview room rebus ended the conversation slipped the phone back into his pocket dickie diamond would be leaving town by bus or train always supposing he lacked the wherewithal to steal someone elses car either that or hed be staying put necessitating another meeting between them and some strong words from rebus strong words and maybe strong actions to accompany them was the gun hidden inside the car he wondered if it was worth finding out but shook his head dickie diamond wasnt the kind to shoot anyone the gun had been a prop the prop of a weak scared man a fine insight in retrospect hed stopped to light another cigarette and was crossing the garden to the shed this was a much older construction than the summerhouse its wooden sides mildewed and spattered with bird droppings again there was no lock on it so rebus pulled it open a coiled hose which had been attached to a nail on the inside of the door slid off and fell with a clatter there were shelves of diy bits and pieces screws and brackets rawl plugs hinges an oldstyle pushpull mower took up most of the floor space but there was something tucked down beside it something smothered in bubble wrap rebus looked back at the cottage he wasnt wearing gloves but decided to pick it up all the same it was a painting or at any rate a frame heavier than hed been expecting probably the weight of the glass he lifted it onto the lawn heard the sound of a window opening then siobhans voice what the hell are you doing come take a look he called back he was unfolding the wrapping the painting showed a man in a crisp white shirt the sleeves rolled up he had long dark wavy hair and was standing by a mantelpiece atop which sat a mirror which itself was reflecting a woman with long lustrous black hair the angles of her lower jaw picked out as though from firelight around the two figures all was shadow the woman wore a black mask covering her eyes and nose she had her hands behind her maybe they were tied together at the back the artists surname was written in capitals at bottom left vettriano thisll be the missing painting then rebus said as siobhan stood over him she stared first at the canvas then at the shed and it was just lying there tucked down the side of the lawn mower the door wasnt locked rebus shook his head looks like he panicked brought the thing home then didnt want it in the house how heavy is it siobhan was walking around the painting its not light whats your point neilson doesnt own a car no point since hes never learned to drive then how did he get the painting back here rebus knew the way her mind was working he stood up watching her nodding slowly right now he told her what matters is that youve found the painting stolen from the victims house and isnt that convenient she said staring at him okay i admit it i had it hidden under my jacket im not saying you put it there but someone else did plenty of people knew malcolm neilson was a suspect maybe his prints will be all over the glass would that be enough to satisfy you siobhan or how about a bloodstained hammer could be theres one tucked away in the shed too and by the way i meant what i said about what it was you that found the painting me im not even here remember you go telling gill that it was john rebus who found the crucial piece of evidence shes going to have both of us on the carpet get one of the woolly suits to give me a lift back into town then let gill know what youve found she nodded knowing he was right but cursing the fact that shed let him come here oh and siobhan rebus was patting her on the arm congratulations everyones going to start thinking you walk on water presented with the evidence of the stolen painting malcolm neilson offered no explanation at first then said it had been a gift from marber before changing his mind again and stating that hed neither seen nor touched the painting his fingerprints had already been taken and the painting itself was sitting at howdenhall police lab being dusted for prints before undergoing other more arcane tests im curious mr neilson bill pryde asked why that particular painting when there were others more valuable right there under your nose i didnt take it i tell you william allison neilsons solicitor was rapidly jotting notes by his clients side you say it was found in malcolm neilsons garden shed dci pryde can i ask whether there was a lock of any kind on the door elsewhere in the station the success of the search at inveresk was being trumpeted the noise bringing the wild bunch out of their lair and up to the murder room you got a result then francis gray asked derek linford slapping him on the back i didnt linford snapped back too busy wading through three feet of shit in his studio the other side of town still a results a result eh the look linford gave him seemed to dispute this gray just chuckled and moved away news was filtering down that fingerprints had been found on the picture frame problem was they belonged to edward marber himself at least we know weve got the right painting one officer said with a shrug which was true enough though still not enough to satisfy siobhan she was wondering about the pictures subject matter wondering if in marbers eyes the woman in the mask had represented laura not that the two shared physical similarities but all the same did marber place himself in the mans role the voyeur or maybe even the possessor thinking about the merchandise the painting had to mean something there had to be a reason why it alone had been removed from marbers house she remembered the sales chit for it which had turned up among marbers effects five years back he had paid for it these days according to cynthia bessant it might fetch four or five times that a more than decent return on the investment but still some way short of other paintings in the dealers collection it had meant something to someone something more than mere monetary value what could it have meant to malcolm neilson was he perhaps jealous of artists more successful than himself another hand slapped siobhans shoulder good work well done shed already deflected a phone call from the assistant chief constable colin carswell she knew he would want to share in her glory and had no intention of talking to him not that she wanted the glory all to herself far from it she wanted nothing whatsoever to do with it because to her mind it fell well short of glory yet might end up putting an innocent man away one of the tulliallan crew jazz mccullough was standing beside her now whats up he asked not joining in the fun and games case must be cut and dried idve thought maybe thats why they sent you back to training school she saw a rapid change in his eyes christ sorry i didnt mean to say that ive obviously caught you at a bad time i just wanted to offer my congratulations which ill gladly accept after we get a conviction she turned and walked away aware of mcculloughs eyes following her all the way to the door rebus saw her go too he was catching a word with tam barclay asking if he had a nickname for dci tennant i can think of a few choice ones barclay was saying rebus nodded slowly hed already spoken to stu sutherland and knew damned well that halfpint was a name used only by gray jazz and allan ward now jazz was motioning to him rebus wrapped up his conversation with barclay and made to follow jazz walked down the corridor and into the toilets he was standing by the washbasins hands in pockets what is it rebus asked the door opened again and gray came in he nodded a greeting and checked that no one was lurking in the cubicles when are you going to recon the merchandise jazz asked quietly only if theres a chance it may be moved best get your arse in gear his voice was cold and calculating and rebus felt his liking for the man start to ebb i dont know he said maybe tomorrow why not today gray said theres not much of today left rebus told him making a show of consulting his watch theres enough jazz persisted if you went there right now we could cover for you its not like were unused to you bunking off gray continued funny you shot back here just before they found that picture whats that supposed to mean lets focus on something else jazz warned both men well call it the big picture if you like gray grinned at this we need some fast info something we can work from jazz went on what about allan rebus asked is he in or out hes in gray said though he didnt like the way you teased him does he know whats involved less allan knows better he likes it gray explained im not sure i understand rebus was angling hoping for a bit more allan does what hes told jazz said the three of you rebus hoped he sounded naive enough you have done something like this before thats on a needtoknow basis gray told him i need to know rebus stated why the question came from jazz a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing gray said into the silence how about your friends in the sdea are you going to pay them a visit or not what option do i have rebus tried to sound disgruntled he could feel jazzs eyes still on him its still your show john jazz reminded him quietly all were saying is that it cant be put off forever i know that rebus conceded then okay ill talk to them he grew thoughtful we need to discuss the split the split gray growled it was my idea rebus stressed and so far im the only one doing anything about it jazzs air of absolute calm now seemed almost threatening the split will be in your favor john he said dont fret gray looked set to dispute this but the words failed to come out as rebus turned towards the door however jazzs hand landed softly on his arm just dont go getting greedy on us he said remember you invited us in were here because you asked rebus nodded made good his escape outside in the corridor he could feel his heart pounding the blood sizzling in his ears they didnt trust him yet they were ready to follow him why were they setting him up and when was the time to tell strathern his head told him now but his gut said otherwise still he decided to pay a little trip to the big house it was past six and he half expected that the sdea offices would be empty but ormiston was hunched over a computer the keys of the keyboard just too small for his oversized fingers to manage as he cursed and pressed the delete key rebus walked into the room hiya ormie trying to sound chatty breezy theyve got you working late the big man grunted didnt raise his eyes from the screen is claverhouse about rebus went on leaning his backside against a desk warehouse oh aye still got the stuff stashed there rebus had picked up a stick of gum from the desk and unwrapped it folding it into his mouth whats it to you rebus shrugged just wondered if you wanted me to have another go at the weasel ormiston glared at him then turned back to his work fair enough rebus said ormistons look meant theyd given up on the weasel bet claverhouse would love to know why the weasel visited me that night maybe rebus had started pacing the room would you like to know ormie id tell you before id tell your partner that gives me a warm glow all over not that it was anything much ormiston wasnt about to take the bait rebus decided to sweeten the hook it was just something about cafferty and the warehouse ormiston stopped typing but kept his eyes on the screen you see rebus pressed on the weasel says cafferty might be planning a hit on the warehouse we know he knows about it but thats just the word on the street ormiston turned his head but it was no good rebus had stopped directly behind him the big man had to swing around degrees in his chair on the other hand rebus continued i got it from the horses mouth so to speak youre sure it wasnt the horses arse rebus just shrugged thats for you and your compadre to decide ormiston folded his arms and why in gods name would the weasel rat his boss out to you thats what i want to talk to claverhouse about rebus paused i want to apologize ormistons eyebrows rose slowly then he unfolded his arms and reached for the phone this i have to see he said youre shipping it out rebus guessed he was in the warehouse the carcass of the lorry had already been removed now the warehouse was more than half filled with newlooking wooden packing crates they were nailed closed and stacked two high across most of the floor does that mean youre splitting the glory with customs and excise rules are rules claverhouse said rebus ran his palm over the surface of one crate then made a fist and rapped on it claverhouse smiled bet you cant guess which crate theyre in crate or crates that would be telling there was the smell of fresh wood in the air youre expecting someone to try taking them rebus surmised not exactly but we know the word is out theres only so much you can do with security but but this way at least itll take them an hour or two to find the right boxes rebus was nodding actually quite impressed with claverhouses thinking why not just shift the drugs and theyd be safer where exactly i dont know fettes or somewhere the big house all open windows and no alarms maybe not rebus agreed anyway youre right theyre going to be shifted just as soon as weve squared everything with customs claverhouse thought of something ormie said you had some apology you wanted to make rebus nodded again about weasel i think i was too soft on him you told me it would be two fathers having a talk and i let that happen stopped thinking like a cop so i wanted to apologize and thats why he came to your flat that night he came to warn me that cafferty knew about the haul information you decided to hold back from us you already knew didnt you we knew word was out well anyway rebus sniffed gazed around him youve got this place sewn up right cafferty would have wanted to catch you unawares securitys round the clock claverhouse confirmed padlocks on the gates razorwire fences and my little puzzle to contend with at the end of it all rebus looked at ormiston do you know which crates the stuffs in ormiston stared back unblinking stupid question rebus muttered aloud claverhouse smiled i want you to know rebus told him that i really do feel bad about not snaring the weasel for you i gave him far too easy a ride that sent the wrong message he thought i was doing it on purpose which meant he owed me and fed you the news on cafferty to even things up claverhouse was nodding but now that ive opened a line of communication with him rebus went on maybe i can still bring him over to our side too late for that now claverhouse informed him looks like the weasel has jumped ship he hasnt been seen since the night he went to your flat what i think he panicked which was what we wanted ormiston admitted the look he received from his partner shut him up we put word out claverhouse explained that we were readying to charge weasels son with the whole shebang you thought if he got scared enough hed come in claverhouse nodded and he ran instead rebus was trying to make sense of it the weasel had shown no sign at all that he was planning flight would he have flown without taking aly with him claverhouse seemed to contort his whole body into a shrug letting rebus know the subject was closed takes a big man to admit when hes wrong he said instead addressing rebus i didnt think you had it in you then he stuck out a hand which rebus after only a moments debate accepted he was still thinking of the weasel trying to assess whether the man could do any harm to rebus and his plans he came up blank whatever had happened to him rebus couldnt spare the time or space for conjecture he had to focus draw all his energy together look after number one the six oclock headlines were just ending when siobhan switched off her engine she was parked in the forecourt of mg cabs the large tarmac parking area boasted half a dozen assorted vauxhalls and a single brandnew flamered mg sports car there was a white flagpole from which drooped a st andrews cross the office was a prefab building with a garage next to it where a solitary mechanic in gray overalls was working on the engine of an astra lochend wasnt far from easter road home of hibernian siobhans chosen football team but she didnt know the area at all it seemed to be mostly lowrise and terraced housing with a smattering of neighborhood shops she hadnt really expected anyone to be here but the cab business was roundtheclock she now realized all the same she doubted ellen dempsey would still be on duty that was fine all she wanted was a feel for the place maybe ask a couple of questions of the mechanic or anyone else she could find having trouble she asked approaching the garage thats it fixed he said dropping the hood maintenance check he slid into the drivers seat revved the engine a couple of times sweet as a nut office is in there he nodded towards the prefab siobhan was studying him through the oil and grease on the backs of his hands she could see old homemade tattoos he was skinny with a pale face and thinning hair which stuck out above the ears something about him made her think exoffender she recalled that sammy wallace the driver whod taken marber home had boasted a police record thanks she told the mechanic whos manning the phone tonight he looked at her saw her for what she was mrs dempseys inside he said coldly then he shifted the astra into reverse and started maneuvering it out of the garage and into a parking space the driversside door still open so that siobhan had to take a step back or risk being hit by it he glowered at her through the windshield and she knew she hadnt made a friend there were two steps up to the office she tapped on the glass door a woman was seated behind a desk the woman looked up sliding the spectacles from her nose and gestured for her to enter siobhan closed the door after her mrs dempsey im sorry to trouble you she was opening her bag to find her warrant card dont bother with that ellen dempsey said leaning back in her chair i can see youre a cop detective sergeant clarke siobhan said by way of introduction we spoke on the phone indeed we did ds clarke what can i do for you dempsey motioned towards the chair on the other side of the desk and siobhan sat down ellen dempsey was in her midforties fullfigured but well preserved the ringed creases of skin around her neck were a better indicator of her age than was her carefully madeup face the darkbrown hair had probably been dyed but it was hard to tell no nail polish no jewelry on her fingers just a chunky ladies rolex on her left wrist i just thought youd like to know that sammy wallace is off the hook siobhan said dempsey was making a show of tidying some papers in truth the desk was about as neat as could be the paperwork divided into four piles with four labeled folders waiting to be filled was he ever on the hook dempsey asked he was the last person to see mr marber alive apart from whoever murdered him dempsey corrected now she looked up at siobhan narrowing her eyes slightly her glasses hung around her neck by a chain if he was ever really a suspect ds clarke it was because he already had a criminal record and thats just laziness on your part im not saying we seriously considered what other reason was there siobhan paused knowing this was an argument she couldnt win yes theyd looked that bit more closely at sammy wallace precisely because of his criminal past it had been as good a starting point as any besides dempsey said reaching into the wastebasket and pulling out the latest edition of the evening news it was on the front page all about this painter youve arrested thats you isnt it dempsey had turned the paper round for siobhan to see there was a headline man charged in art dealer murder and a large color photo of the search party as they made ready to enter the house at inveresk obviously the story had been printed just too early to use a photo of them coming out again carrying their labeled trash bags in one of which was hidden the painting dempsey was jabbing at one of the figures in the photograph yes it was siobhan mouth open as she issued orders finger pointing towards the house but there was another figure at the very edge of the frame grainy to be sure but identifiable to those who knew him as detective inspector john rebus chances of gill templer not seeing the photo astronomical it took siobhan a moment or two to recover mrs dempsey she said are all your employees exoffenders not all of them no dempsey folded the paper and put it back in the bin maybe its some sort of principle it is as it happens dempseys tone said this was another argument she was ready for men with convictions for violence driving cabs around edinburgh men who have served their sentence men whose crimes are far in the past i credit myself with an instinct for knowing which ones i can trust but your instinct could be wrong i dont think so the silence in the room was broken by a phone call not the phone on dempseys desk but another on a long waisthigh shelf which ran the length of the window siobhan noticed that there was a twoway radio system tucked on a shelf beneath the window itself could slide open and she guessed that outside office hours if anyone came to the site looking for a cab they had to stand at the window and offer details through the opening it wasnt her drivers that ellen dempsey didnt trust it was the public she watched dempsey take the call then get on the radio and offer the job to car four two regulars needed picking up from a west end bar contract job to be charged to one of the citys insurance firms sorry about that dempsey apologized coming back to the desk siobhan had been studying her clothes matching blue jacket and skirt with a white blouse thickish ankles lowheeled black shoes every inch the successful businesswoman i cant help thinking this is an odd career choice siobhan said with a smile i like cars im guessing the mg outside is yours dempseys eyes turned to the window shed parked the car so it would be visible from the desk thats the eighth one ive owned two are still in the garage at home all the same you dont see many women in charge of a cab company maybe im breaking the mold you started from scratch if youre implying that the company was set up by some exhusband or other youre mistaken i was just wondering what you did beforehand looking for some tips on changing your career dempsey reached into a drawer and brought out cigarettes and lighter she offered but siobhan shook her head i always have one a day around this time dempsey explained somehow i cant bring myself to stop altogether she lit up inhaled deeply exhaled slowly i started with a couple of taxis in dundee thats where i grew up when i wanted to expand i didnt think dundee was ready for me edinburgh on the other hand your competitors cant have been too thrilled when you arrived we had some frank exchanges of views dempsey admitted she broke off to answer the phone again afterwards siobhan had a question for her including big ger cafferty dempsey nodded but im still here arent i in other words he didnt scare you off caffertys not the only operator in town things can get a bit hairy look at the trouble out at the airport siobhan knew she was referring to the constant battle between black taxis and licensed minicabs vying for trade from the arriving planeloads ive had slashed tires broken windshields a whole spate of fake bookings back in the early days but they could see i was dug in thats the type of person i am ds clarke i dont doubt it mrs dempsey its ms siobhan nodded i noticed you didnt wear a ring but the mechanic outside called you mrs dempsey smiled they all do gives me less grief if they think there might be a mr dempsey who could come down hard on them she glanced at her watch look i dont want to rush you but my nightshift telephonist will be coming in soon and i want to get this paperwork finished understood siobhan said rising to her feet and thanks for dropping in no problem thanks for the career advice you dont need any advice ds clarke running a cab company is one thing but being a female officer in the cid dempsey shook her head slowly now theres one job i couldnt do for all the tea in china luckily i dont drink tea siobhan said thanks again for your time she drove as far as the end of the road and squeezed into a curbside parking space turning off the ignition and letting her mind wander what had she gleaned from the conversation a few useful snippets that dempsey had recognized her for cid straight off was interesting to employ excons was one thing but clocking a plainclothes cop took a certain skill a skill that came with practice siobhan couldnt help wondering how ellen dempsey would have acquired such an ability then there was dundee to consider the story of her time there almost rang true almost but not quite there had been enough pauses in her narrative to indicate that she was leaving things unsaid those were the things siobhan wanted to know about when her mobile sounded she knew who it would be gill templer and not in a mood to waste words what in gods name was john rebus doing out at inveresk he tagged along siobhan said adopting a veneer of honesty as the best policy a car was pulling into the forecourt of mg cabs the night shift she guessed why templer was asking wanted a break from st leonards and and nothing i didnt let him near the house as far as i know he smoked a cigarette then headed back siobhan was thinking of all the officers whod been present and could call her a liar the ones whod heard her bellowing out of the window at rebus whod seen her march down the garden towards where he crouched over the unwrapped object why do i find that so hard to believe templer was saying now denting siobhans fragile confidence i dont know maybe because youve known him longer than i have but thats the way it happened he said he needed a break i emphasized that he was no longer part of the marber inquiry he accepted that made no effort to assist at the house and left soon after he left before you found the painting siobhan took a deep breath before we found the painting she confirmed templer was thoughtful for a few moments siobhan could see the red mg reversing out of the compound turning in her direction i hope for your sake john backs up your story templer was saying as siobhan turned the ignition understood there was a pause siobhan could sense that her boss had something else she was struggling to say well if thats everything she coaxed and was rewarded when templer broke in has john said anything to you about tulliallan just what youd expect siobhan frowned has something happened no its just templer sounded anxious he will be coming back wont he siobhan asked i hope so siobhan i really do templer ended the call just as ellen dempseys car roared past siobhan took her time easing out of the parking spot this time of the evening traffic would still be heavy but a red sports car was hard to miss she thought back to templers closing words siobhan had been asking whether rebus was for the chop but the way templer had answered made her wonder it had all sounded much more ominous she tried calling rebus but he wasnt answering she wasnt sure why she was following ellen dempsey exactly except that she wanted to know a little more about the woman the way she drove could offer pointers as could her home the style of house the part of the city and at least when she was tailing dempsey she was keeping busy she wasnt at the station being fawned over she wasnt at home brooding over a ready meal she switched the cars cd player on mogwai rock action it had an edginess to it which she found soothing maybe she could relate to it edgy and samey but with sudden unpredictable shifts just like an investigation and maybe even just like her what siobhan hadnt been expecting was that dempsey would head south out of the city until she hit the bypass then use it to start heading west and north at speed plainly she didnt live in edinburgh and soon it became apparent that she didnt even live this side of the firth of forth as they made for the forth road bridge siobhan found herself checking her petrol gauge if she had to pull into a service station she would lose dempsey as it was the bridge offered problems of its own there was a backup of drivers waiting to pay their toll siobhan found herself in a separate queue from her prey one that seemed to be moving much more slowly at this rate dempsey would be across the bridge and out of sight but dempsey seemed intent on sticking to the speed limit which told siobhan that shed probably had a speeding fine in the recent past either that or had clocked up enough points on her license that any fresh violation might see her banned siobhan was in the outside lane ignoring the regular roadside reminders that the limit on the bridge was fifty miles per hour over to her right a train was crossing the rail bridge the cd had finished and she was trying to find the repeat button then at the last minute she saw dempsey signaling to take the first turnoff after the bridge the inside lane was clogged and siobhan couldnt see a gap that would let her in she switched her indicator on and edged towards the dividing line the car behind flashed at her angrily but braked to let her in the driver sounding his horn afterwards and flashing his lights again i get the picture siobhan snarled there were three cars between her and dempsey and one of them also took the access road they were heading for north queensferry a picturesque place on the banks of the forth with the rail bridge towering above the houses and shops dempsey was signaling to turn up a steep incline which was little more than the width of a single car siobhan drove past then pulled over when the traffic behind her had passed she reversed to the bottom of the hill dempsey had reached the summit and was disappearing over the brow siobhan followed a hundred yards farther on dempsey had turned into a driveway siobhan waited a few moments then drove past she couldnt see much because of the tall hedge in front in her favor dempsey couldnt see her either the bungalow was pretty much at the eastern edge of the village the steep climb giving it height so that it looked down on the main street and surroundings siobhan would bet there were spectacular uninterrupted views from the back garden at the same time it was a very private place and north queensferry was nicely anonymous another train was crossing the bridge with her window open siobhan could hear it heading across fife to dundee and beyond fife was what separated edinburgh from dundee she wondered if that was why dempsey had chosen to make it her home neither one place nor the other but within reach of both it felt right to her dempsey wasnt just visiting someone she was home she also got the feeling dempsey lived alone no other cars outside the bungalow and no garage hadnt dempsey said something about owning other mgs about having them stored in her garage well wherever that garage was it wasnt here always supposing the cars existed at all why would she have lied to impress her visitor to stress that the name of her company was down to her passion for the sports cars which bore that brand there could be multiple reasons people lied to police officers all the time if they had something to hide if they were talking for the sheer sake of talking because as long as they were talking they werent being asked any awkward questions dempsey had sounded confident enough calm and collected but that could have been all front what could she be hiding this woman who hid herself away from the world she drove a car that wanted you to look at it wanted you to admire the shiny surface the promise of performance but here was this other side to its owner the woman who dressed immaculately only to spend her days alone in an office enduring only a little physical contact with the outside world her employees called her mrs she didnt let them get too close didnt want them to think she was single available and when she came home it was to this quiet haven to a house hidden behind walls and a hedge there was a whole side to ellen dempsey which she kept away from the world siobhan wondered what it might consist of would she find any answers in dundee dempsey had friends people even cafferty was wary of was she fronting for some dundee villains where had the money come from to kickstart her business a fleet of cars didnt exactly come cheap and it was a bit of a step up from a couple of taxis in dundee to the operation she now ran at lochend a woman with a past a woman who could spot cid and gave work to excons ellen dempsey didnt just have a past siobhan realized she had a police record of her own it was the simplest explanation what was it eric bain had told her reduce it to binary his way of saying keep it simple maybe she was trying to make everything too complex maybe the marber case was simpler than it seemed reduce it to binary siobhan she told herself then she started the car and headed for the bridge by the time rebus drove home it was almost half past seven his mobile had stored a couple of messages gill and siobhan then it started ringing gill he said i was just about to call you he was in a queue at traffic lights have you seen tonights final edition he knew what she was going to say you made the front page john bingo you mean they got a picture of me he pretended to guess hope it was my good side i wasnt aware that you had a good side a low blow but he let her get away with it look he said it was my own stupid fault i wanted out of the station for an hour and they were all heading for the cars i insisted on going so dont go blaming anyone else ive already spoken to siobhan she told me to clear off and thats pretty much what i did which is almost exactly what she told me except that in her version it was you who decided to leave voluntarily shes trying to make me look good gill you know what siobhans like youre supposed to be off the marber inquiry john remember that im also supposed to be the sort of cop who cant take a telling do you want me to blow my cover at tulliallan she sighed no luck so far then theres a ray of light in the tunnel he admitted the lights had changed and he drove across the junction into melville drive problem is im not sure i want to go anywhere near it dangerous i wont know that till i get there for christs sake be careful its nice to know you care john speak to you later gill he didnt bother responding to siobhan knew now what her message had been gray jazz and allan ward would be waiting for him as arranged but hed already prepared his story he didnt want them hitting the warehouse not because it would or wouldnt work but because it was wrong he knew now that he could go to strathern tell him that he was able to lead the three men into a trap he still doubted strathern would go for it it wasnt clean it didnt answer the question all the trio had to do was say theyd merely been following rebuss lead hed parked at the top end of arden street but the trio had found a space right outside his tenement door the headlamps flashed at him letting him know they were there one of the rear doors opened on his approach lets go for a drive john gray said from the front jazz was driving leaving allan ward in the rear beside rebus where are we going he asked how did it go at the compound rebus looked into the rearview where he could connect with jazzs eyes its a nonstarter lads he sighed tell us for a start theyve got twentyfourhour security on the gate plus theres an alarm system on the fence as well as some seriouslooking razor wire then theres the warehouse itself which is locked tight and almost certainly alarmed too but claverhouse has been cleverer than id have credited hes filled the interior with packing crates dozens of them and the merchandise is in one of them jazz guessed rebus nodded aware of the drivers eyes still on him and hes not about to say which one so all it needs is a lorry gray piped up take the whole damned lot of them takes time to load a lorry francis jazz told his friend we dont need a lorry ward pitched in leaning forward we just take whichever case feels the heaviest thats good thinking allan jazz said it still takes time rebus argued a hellish lot of time and meantime the forces of law and order are streaming towards the scene jazz guessed rebus knew he hadnt quite managed to dissuade them his head was swimming they dont have bernie johnss money always supposing there was any money to begin with all theyve got is this dream ive offered them and they want to make it real which makes me the mastermind he started shaking his head without realizing he was doing it but jazz noticed you dont rate our chances john theres one more problem rebus said thinking fast theyre moving the stuff over the weekend claverhouse is antsy that cafferty will try something tomorrows friday ward said unnecessarily not much time to procure a lorry gray grumbled he pulled down on his seat belt making some slack so he could turn to face rebus you come to us with this big fucking plan of yours and this is what it turns into its not johns fault jazz said then whose is it ward asked it was a nice idea but it wasnt to be jazz told him it was a halfcocked idea that we should have kiboshed from the start gray snarled still giving rebus the full force of his scowl rebus turned to peer out of the window where are we going back to tulliallan ward explained tennant gave the word thats the end of our wee holiday hang on i havent got any of my stuff with me so so there are things i need jazz signaled pulled over they were approaching haymarket all right making your own way back from here john if thats whats on offer rebus said opening his door grays hand closed like a vise around his forearm were very disappointed in you john i thought we were a team francis rebus told him twisting free of his grip you want to walk into that warehouse its fine by me but theyll catch you and theyll put you away he paused maybe another scheme will come along aye right gray said dont call us and we wont call you he leaned back and pulled rebuss door closed the car took off again leaving rebus watching from the pavement that was it then hed blown it he was never going to win them back never going to find out the truth about bernie johns and on top of all that it might just turn out that they were on to him fuck it he said wishing hed never said yes to strathern hed never meant for them to agree to his scheme it was a way of getting them to open up about themselves instead of which they were closing ranks excluding him the course had one more week to run he could pull out now or see it through to the end it was something hed have to consider if he failed to see it through whatever suspicions the trio harbored would appear confirmed he turned and found that he was standing outside a pub what better way to ponder the conundrum than over a pint and a double malt with any luck the place would do food too theyd call him a cab afterwards to see him home his problems would all have disappeared ill drink to that he told himself pushing open the door it was two in the morning when the phone woke him he was lying on the living room floor next to the hifi cd cases and album sleeves spread around him he crawled on hands and knees to his chair and picked up the receiver yes he croaked john its bobby rebus took a moment to realize who bobby was bobby hogan leith cid he tried focusing on his watch how soon can you get down here hogan was asking depends where here is rebus was doing a stock check head cloudy but bearable stomach queasy look you can go back to bed if you like hogan starting to sound aggrieved i thought maybe i was doing you a favor ill know that when you tell me what it is a floater pulled him out of the docks not fifteen minutes ago and though i havent seen him in a while he looks awfully like our old pal the diamond dog rebus stared down at the album sleeves not really seeing them you still awake john ill be there in twenty minutes bobby hell be on his way to the mortuary by then even better ill meet you there rebus paused any chance of this being an accident at this stage were supposed to be keeping an open mind you wont be too bothered if i dont do the same ill see you at the dead center john dead center was what they called the mortuary one of the workers there had come up with the phrase telling everyone that he was proud to work at the dead center of edinburgh the building was tucked away on the cowgate one of the citys more secretive streets few pedestrians ever found themselves there and the traffic was intent on being elsewhere things might change when the parliament opened its new building less than a tenminute walk away more traffic more tourists at this time of night rebus knew the drive would take him five minutes he wasnt sure his blood alcohol level would pass muster but after a quick shower he made for his car anyway he didnt know what he was thinking or how he was feeling about dickie diamonds death hard to say how many enemies had been harboring their festering thoughts just waiting for the night when they clapped eyes on diamond again he cut across to nicolson street and headed for the city center turning right at thins bookshop and taking the steep turn down to the cowgate a couple of taxis a few drunks dead center he was thinking he knew the easiest way into the mortuary this time of night was the staff entrance so he parked outside making sure he wasnt blocking the loading bay for a long time theyd had to carry out actual autopsies at one of the citys hospitals due to the lack of a decent airfiltering system in the mortuarys autopsy suite but that had been remedied now rebus walked into the building and saw hogan in the corridor ahead of him hes in here hogan said dont worry he wasnt long in the water good news the body underwent terrible changes after lengthy submersion the short corridor led directly into the loading area which itself led directly to the holding area a wall of little doors each one opening to reveal a trolley one trolley was sitting out a polythenewrapped body lying on it dickie diamond was still wearing the same clothes his wet hair was slicked back from his face and there was some kind of algae stuck to one cheek his eyes were closed mouth open the attendants were readying to take him upstairs in the elevator whos doing the cutting rebus asked theyre both on tonight hogan told him meaning professor gates and dr curt the citys chief pathologists its been a busy one drug overdose in muirhouse fatal fire in wester hailes and four naturals an attendant reminded him people dying of old age or in the hospital mostly they ended up here shall we go up hogan asked why not rebus said as they climbed the stairs hogan asked about diamond you lot were just interrogating him werent you interviewing him bobby as a suspect or a witness the latter when did you let him go this afternoon how long had he been dead when you fished him out id say about an hour question is did he drown rebus shrugged do we know if he could swim no theyd entered a glassfronted viewing area there were a couple of benches for them to sit on on the other side of the glass people moved around in surgical gowns and green wellingtons there were two stainlesssteel slabs with drainage holes and oldfashioned wooden blocks for the head to rest on gates and curt waved a greeting curt gesturing for the two detectives to come join the fun they shook their heads pointing to the benches to let him know they were fine where they were the body bag had been removed and now dickie diamonds clothes were being discarded placed in their own plastic bags how did you id him rebus asked phone numbers in his pocket one was for his sister i recognized him anyway but she did the formal id downstairs just before you got here how was she she didnt seem too surprised to be honest maybe she was just in shock or maybe shed been expecting it hogan looked at him something you want to tell me john rebus shook his head we reopened the case went sniffing malky the nephew told dickie what was happening he came haring up here we picked him up he shrugged end of story not as far as someone was concerned hogan said peering through the glass as one of the attendants lifted something from the clothing it was the revolver diamond had pointed at rebus the attendant held it up for them to see managed to miss that in your search bobby rebus said hogan stood up called out through the glass where was it down the back of his underpants the attendant called back voice muffled by the face mask he was wearing cant have been too comfortable professor gates added maybe hed a bad case of piles and was resorting to threats when hogan sat down again rebus noticed that he had reddened slightly at the neck these things happen bobby rebus sought to reassure him he was wondering now if the gun had been tucked into diamonds waistband when hed been answering their questions in ir with the body stripped of its clothing the autopsy proper was beginning with the taking of body temperature rebus and hogan knew what the pathologists would be looking for alcohol levels signs of injuries head trauma they would want to know whether diamond had been alive or dead when hed entered the water alive and it could have been an accident too much booze maybe dead and there was foul play involved everything from the state of the eyeballs to the contents of the lungs provided little clues the body temperature would be used to calculate time of death though immersion would make any exact calculations problematic after twenty minutes as spectator rebus said he needed a cigarette hogan decided to join him they went to the staff room and helped themselves to mugs of tea then walked outside the night was clear and chilly an undertakers car had arrived to take charge of one of the naturals the driver bowed his head to them in sleepy acknowledgment at this time of night in this location you had a bond of sorts you were dealing with things most people those with their heads warm against pillows dreaming the time away until morning shied away from undertaker hogan mused you ever thought it a bloody odd word to use in the circumstances funeral director i can understand but undertaker you getting philosophical on me bobby no im just saying ach forget it rebus smiled his own thoughts were of dickie diamond dickie had gifted them chib kellys name they could have accepted his gift presented the case to tennant and left it at that but gray and jazz jazz in particular hadnt been satisfied rebus was wondering if theyd decided to press dickie further theyd dumped rebus at haymarket but that didnt mean they hadnt turned back in fact he was a damned good alibi when last seen the trio had been heading west out of town while dickie was found in the northeast corner of the city the wild bunch had started life looking like an uneasy alliance of insubordinate officers who didnt like authority and were as likely to ignore an order as carry it out but now rebus was wondering if there was something more dangerous more lethal at work gray jazz and ward had been all too ready to help rip off the warehouse consignment force would have been necessary but that hadnt seemed to bother them were they capable of killing dickie diamond then again why would they have killed him rebus didnt have an answer for that not yet he was leaning over the wall watching the roadway when he spotted the parked car movement within it as the drivers door opened and the interior light came on he recognized malky he looked for malkys mother but didnt see her malky was making to cross the road towards rebus but stopped at the centerline and stretched his arm pointing you fucking killed him ya bastard hogan was at the wall now too calm down malky he called dickie told me he was going to have a word with you malky shouted hoarsely his finger moved towards the mortuary building is that what you call a word man comes to talk to you you do him in whats he talking about john hogan said rebus shook his head maybe dickie did say he was coming to see me but never got round to it hogan guessed or didnt get the chance hogan patted rebuss arm ill go talk to him he said making for the street hands held up in front of him easy now malky easy its a bad time for you i know but lets not go waking the neighbors eh for a moment rebus had thought he was going to say waking the dead he headed back indoors depositing his empty mug in the sink in the staff room as he turned to leave dr curt came in no longer wearing his gown and boots any tea going curt asked kettles not long boiled curt busied himself with a fresh mug and tea bag he was dead when he went in the water he began happened around midnight and the body went in the water not long after forensics might be able to tell us more from the clothing how did he die windpipe was crushed rebus thought back to the interview room the way grays forearm had slid around diamonds throat you got a spare cigarette curt was asking now rebus opened his pack and curt picked one out tucking it behind his ear ill have it with my tea simple pleasures eh john where would we be without them rebus said his mind on the drive he was planning to take it was nearly dawn when he reached tulliallan he saw another detective in front of him sneaking back in after a night in someone elses bed rebus recognized him a young detective sergeant from the new city center force hed be here on one of the specialist programs rebus drove around the car park seeking jazzs volvo there was dew on it as with the cars on either side so it had been there awhile he touched the hood it was cold again same temperature as the cars either side he did the same set of checks with grays lexus once hed found it nothing to suggest it had been used in the recent past then he realized he didnt know what car allan ward drove he supposed he could look for a dealer badge on the back windshield something indicating purchase in dumfries but that would take time and he was pretty sure it would be a waste of effort instead he headed indoors and along to the bedrooms walking right past his own door and knocking loudly on grays four along from him when there was no answer he knocked again who is it the voice coughed from within its rebus the door opened a crack gray squinting into the light hells going on he asked his hair was sticking up he was dressed in a tshirt and underpants the room smelled stuffy been in bed long francis rebus asked whats it to you dickie diamonds just been found dead windpipe crushed gray didnt say anything just blinked a couple of times as if trying to wake from a dream afterwards he was dumped in leith docks the killer trying to muddy the waters as it were rebus narrowed his eyes coming back to you now is it francis it was only four or five hours ago four or five hours ago i was tucked up in bed gray stated anyone see you come back i dont have to explain anything to you rebus thats where youre wrong rebus pointed a finger round up your pals and meet me in the bar youve got a serious amount of convincing to do if you want me off your case rebus went to the bar and waited the place smelled of stale beer and cigarettes there were a few glasses dotted around left there by drinkers whod stayed put after the place had closed most of the chairs had been stacked on tables rebus lifted one down and made himself comfortable he was asking himself what the hell he was doing here it wasnt that he was afraid of what dickie diamond might have told anyone it was more that he just didnt care anymore everything seemed to be falling apart and the subtle undercover work hadnt accomplished anything perhaps because subtlety had never been his strong point rather he was going to shake things up see how the trio reacted what did he have to lose that was a question he wasnt about to answer five minutes later the three men walked in gray had made some attempt to flatten his hair against his skull jazz looked wide awake and had dressed with his usual care allan ward wearing only a baggy tshirt and gym shorts was yawning and rubbing his face hed slipped sneakers on his feet but no socks has francis filled you in rebus asked as they sat in a row across the table from him dickie diamonds been found dead jazz answered and you seem to think francis had a hand in it maybe more of a forearm than a hand dickies windpipe was crushed same sort of maneuver francis pulled in ir when did all this happen jazz asked pathologist thinks around midnight jazz looked to gray we were back here by then werent we gray shrugged you left me around eight rebus said doesnt take four hours to drive from haymarket to here we didnt come straight back ward explained still rubbing his face with both hands we stopped for something to eat and a few drinks where rebus asked coldly john jazz said quietly none of us went near dickie diamond where rebus repeated jazz sighed that road out of town the one we were on after we left you we stopped for a curry after all we had things to talk about didnt we now all three men looked at rebus we did gray agreed what was the restaurant called rebus asked jazz tried to laugh give me a break john and afterwards where did you drink couple of pubs on that same road ward stated too good an opportunity with jazz driving names rebus said get stuffed gray said he leaned back and folded his arms we dont need this paranoia of yours is it because youre in the huff wed given you the hump left you standing there so now you try pulling this francis has a point john jazz said if you went trawling leith for dickie diamond someone will have spotted you rebus pressed on jazz shrugged fine he said but no ones going to come forward because we were never there well see yes jazz said nodding his head without his eyes ever leaving rebuss we will but meantime any chance we can go get some sleep now something tells me tomorrows going to be a day and a half ward was already on his feet paranoia he said echoing gray rebus doubted he knew what the word meant gray stood up without saying anything his eyes burned into rebus jazz was the last to leave i know you did it rebus told him jazz seemed about to say something but shook his head instead as if to acknowledge that no words were going to change rebuss mind you need to admit it while theres still time rebus went on time for what jazz asked genuinely curious for resurrection rebus answered quietly but jazz just winked at him before turning to go rebus sat for a few more minutes before returning to his room making sure the door was locked behind him he was aware of the proximity of the three men three men hed just accused of murder and accessory to murder he thought of placing his chair against the door he thought of heading out to the car park and driving home in truth he wasnt sure theyd killed dickie he was only sure that they were capable of it it all depended how much they knew and how much they suspected about rebuss involvement with dickie how it had led to rico lomaxs murder and a burning caravan but hed wanted the trio shaken and reckoned hed succeeded in spades he considered who else might have have wanted dickie dead there was one name but thinking of it took him right back to the rico lomax case the name of morris gerald cafferty late down to breakfast rebus found the other five members of the wild bunch seated at one of the tables he squeezed in between stu sutherland and tam barclay whats this about dickie diamond barclay said got himself throttled last night rebus answered concentrating on the plate in front of him barclay whistled got to be our shout hasnt it its a leith call rebus told him body was fished out of the docks but it could tie in to the lomax case barclay argued which belongs to us sutherland was nodding bloody hell we talked to him only yesterday yes funny coincidence rebus said john thinks one of us did it allan ward blurted out sutherlands jaw dropped revealing chewedup bacon and egg yolk he turned to rebus hes right rebus conceded diamond had the same neck hold put on him that francis used in the interview room id say youre leaping to conclusions jazz said aye barclay added the kind of leap superman used to make in the cartoons just think for a minute john jazz pleaded try to rationalize it rebus sneaked a glance at gray who was working away at a crust of toast what do you say francis he asked gray stared back at him as he answered i say the pressures got to you youve stopped thinking straight maybe a few extra sessions with wee andrea are in order he reached for his coffee preparing to wash down the mouthful of toast mans got a point john barclay argued why the hell would any of us want to do away with dickie diamond because he was holding something back such as stu sutherland asked rebus shook his head slowly if theres something you know gray intoned maybe nows the time to spit it out rebus thought of the little confession hed made to gray the hint that hed not only known dickie better than hed admitted but also knew something about rico lomaxs demise grays threat was implicit keep accusing me i start talking but rebus had considered this and didnt think anything gray could say would do him much harm unless hed wrenched some confession out of the diamond dog morning sir jazz said suddenly looking over rebuss shoulder tennant was standing there he tapped two fingers against rebuss upper arm i hear the situation has changed somewhat gentlemen di rebus as you were present at the postmortem examination perhaps you could fill us in from what ive been told di hogan has yet to apprehend any suspects and hes keen for whatever input we can provide with respect sir barclay spoke up we should be in charge of this one seeing how it might connect to lomax but were not an active unit barclay weve been doing a pretty good impersonation jazz stated thats as may be and youre not saying leith wouldnt welcome a few extra pairs of hands always supposing they were there to help rebus muttered whats that tennant asked no point in us being there if an ulterior motives involved sir hindering rather than helping im not sure i see what youre getting at rebus was aware of three pairs of eyes glowering at him i mean sir that dickie diamond was strangled and when we brought him in for questioning di gray got a bit carried away and started throttling him is this true di gray di rebus is exaggerating sir did you touch the witness he was bullshitting us sir with respect sir stu sutherland piped up i think johns making a mountain out of a molehill a molehill can trip us as surely as any mountain tennant told him what do you have to say di gray johns getting carried away sir hes got a bit of a rep for letting cases get beneath his skin i was out last night with di mccullough and dc ward theyll vouch for me his two witnesses were already nodding john tennant said quietly is your accusation against di gray based on anything other than what you say you saw in the interview room rebus thought of all the things he could say but he shook his head instead are you willing to withdraw the accusation rebus nodded slowly eyes still on his untouched plate of food you sure if leith cid do ask us to help i have to be sure were heading there as a team yes sir rebus said dully tennant pointed to gray meet me upstairs in five minutes the rest of you finish your breakfast and well convene in fifteen ill talk to di hogan and see what the state of play is thank you sir jazz mccullough said tennant was already on his way nobody said anything to rebus during the rest of the meal gray was first to go followed by ward and barclay jazz seemed to be waiting for stu sutherland to leave them alone but sutherland got himself a refill of coffee as he rose to go jazz kept his eyes on rebus but rebus focused on the remains of his egg white sutherland settled back down with his replenished cup and took a loud slurp friday today he commented poets day rebus knew what he meant piss off early tomorrows saturday the team were due a weekends break followed by the final four days of the course think ill go to my room and start packing sutherland said getting up again rebus nodded and sutherland paused as if preparing for some carefully considered speech cheers stu rebus said hoping to spare him the effort it worked sutherland smiled as though rebus were responding to something hed said some valuable contribution to rebuss wellbeing back in his room rebus was checking for messages on his mobile when it started to ring he studied the number on the lcd display and decided to take the call yes sir he said all right to talk sir david strathern asked ive got a couple of minutes before i need to be somewhere else hows it going john i think ive blown it bigtime sir no way im going to regain their trust strathern made a noise of irritation what happened id rather not go into details sir but for the record whatever they did with bernie johnss millions i dont think theyve got much of it left always supposing they had it in the first place youre not convinced im convinced theyre not on the straight and narrow i dont know if theyve pulled any other scams but if one presented itself theyd be happy to take it on none of which gets us any further not really sir no not your fault john im sure you did what you could maybe even a bit more than that sir dont worry john i wont forget your efforts thank you sir i suppose youll want to be pulled out now no use staying actually sir id rather stick it out only a few more days to go and theyd rumble me if i suddenly disappeared good point wed be breaking your cover yes sir very well then if youre okay with that ill just have to grin and bear it sir rebus ended the call and thought about the lie hed just told he was staying put not because he feared being rumbled but because he still had work to do he decided to phone jean let her know theyd have the weekend to themselves her response always supposing nothing comes up he couldnt disagree the wild bunch reconvened in the lomax inquiry room it seemed like theyd been away from it a long time longer still since theyd first met around its table tennant was seated at the head hands clasped in front of him leith cid would like our help gentlemen he began or more properly your help you wont be running the case its not your bailiwick after all but you will share any and all information with di hogan and his team you will pass on to them your notes on the procedures youve followed the progress youve made on the lomax case and especially anything pertaining to mr diamond and his circle clear enough will we be based in leith sir jazz mccullough asked for today yes make sure you take everything with you theres a weekend coming up and after that youll be back here for four days of intensive final analysis the plan was to retrain you and prepare you to work once more as effective team players rebus felt tennants eyes rest on him as he spoke these words your respective forces will need evidence that you have learned from this course how are we doing so far boss sutherland piped up you really want to know ds sutherland actually now you mention it i think i can wait there were smiles at this from everyone in the room but rebus and gray gray looked chastened after his little chat with tennant while rebus was deep in thought trying to gauge how safe he would be down in leith at least hed be in edinburgh on home turf and hed have bobby hogan to watch his back odds on him making it to the weekend in one piece hed give no better than even money the case against malcolm neilson was proceeding nicely colin stewart from the procurator fiscals office had arrived at st leonards that morning for a progress report it would be stewart and his team of lawyers whod decide whether there was enough evidence to justify a trial so far he seemed satisfied siobhan had been called into gill templers office to answer a few of his procedural questions regarding the search of the house in inveresk siobhan had countered with a few questions of her own weve no actual physical evidence yet have we stewart had removed his glasses seeming to study the lenses for smears while gill templer sat stonefaced beside him weve the painting he commented yes but it was found in an unlocked shed anyone could have put it there arent there more tests we could be doing to see whether anyone else handled it stewart glanced towards templer we appear to have a doubting thomas in our midst ds clarke likes to play devils advocate templer explained she knows as well as we do that further tests would take time and money especially money and probably wouldnt add anything to what we already know it was something the officers on an inquiry were never allowed to forget each case had to fall within a strict budget bill pryde probably spent as much time adding up columns of figures as he did on actual detective work it was another thing he was good at bringing cases in under budget the high hiedyins at the big house perceived this as a strength im just saying that neilson would be an easy target hed already had a very public fallingout with marber then there was the hush money and the only people who know about the hush money ds clarke stewart said are the investigation team themselves he slipped his glasses back on youre not implying that one of your own officers could have had some involvement of course not well then and that had been that back at her desk she called bobby hogan in leith it was something shed been meaning to do she wanted to know whether alexander had been told about his mothers death and how he was bearing up shed even considered paying the grandmother a visit but knew there could be no easy conversation between them thelma dow had to contend with the loss of laura and the jailing of her own son siobhan hoped she would be able to cope able to give alexander what he needed shed even briefly considered contacting a pal in social work someone who could check that both carer and grandson were going to manage staring at the office around her she saw the case winding down the telephones had stopped being busy people were standing around catching up on gossip shed seen grant hood on last nights tv news acknowledging that a man had been charged a house searched and certain contents taken away for examination it all had to be very coy now so as not to jeopardize the legal case the murder of laura stafford hadnt even made the front page of the tabloids redlight stab horror was the headline siobhan had seen with a daytime photograph of the paradisos exterior and a much smaller photo of laura looking younger and with longer bubblepermed hair bobby hogan was taking a while to come to the phone eventually another officer answered for him hes swamped right now siobhan is it anything i can help with not really theyre keeping you busy down there then we had a murder last night rogue called dickie diamond they chatted for a couple more minutes then siobhan hung up she walked across to where george silvers and phyllida hawes were sharing a joke hear what happened to dickie diamond she asked whos he when hes at home silvers responded but hawes was nodding that lot from tulliallan had him in here only yesterday she said bobby hogan was in first thing this morning asking questions as long as hes not after poaching a few extra bodies silvers commented folding his arms i think we all deserve a bit of a rest dont you oh aye george siobhan told him youve been breaking your neck on this one his glare followed her back to her desk wpc toni jackson entered the room saw siobhan and smiled its friday she said leaning against the side of the desk silvers had spotted her and was giving a sycophantic wave still believing her to be related to someone famous she waved back silly sod she muttered under her breath then to siobhan you still got that date lined up siobhan nodded sorry toni jackson shrugged its your loss not ours she gave a sly look still keeping lover boys name under wraps absolutely well thats your prerogative i suppose jackson eased herself off the desk oh nearly forgot she handed over the sheet of paper shed been carrying marked for your attention came through to our fax machine by mistake she wagged a finger i want to hear all about it on monday right down to the forensic detail siobhan promised offering a smile as jackson moved away the smile melted as she studied the cover sheet of the lengthy fax it was from dundee cid responding to her request for the lowdown on ellen dempsey just as she was starting to read a voice interrupted her no rest for the wicked eh siobhan it was derek linford he seemed even better groomed than usual with a pristine shirt newlooking suit and dapper tie going to a wedding derek he looked down at himself nothing wrong with being presentable is there siobhan shrugged wouldnt have anything to do with the rumor that were in line for a visit from the chief constable linford raised an eyebrow are we she gave a wry smile you know damned well we are bit of a fillip for the troops telling us how hard weve all been working linford sniffed well it happens to be true doesnt it speaking of which some of us still have work to be getting on with linford angled his head trying to read the fax siobhan turned it facedown on her desk hiding something from your colleagues siobhan he teased thats hardly being a team player is it so so maybe youve been learning all the wrong lessons from di rebus make sure you dont end up like him kicked into rehab he turned to go but she called him back when youre having your hand shaken by the chief just remember she pointed a finger at him it was davie hynds who found the money marber paid to malcolm neilson youd already been through marbers bank statements and hadnt spotted it bear that in mind when youre taking all the credit for solving the case derek he gave her a cold smile said nothing when he was gone she tried getting back to her reading but found it impossible to concentrate scooping up the fax she decided she wanted to be elsewhere when the brass from the big house came calling settling for the engine shed she bought herself some herbal tea and sat at a table by the window a couple of mums were feeding jars of food to their infants otherwise the place was quiet siobhan had turned off her mobile pulled out a pen and was preparing to mark any interesting snippets having read the fax through once she found that shed underlined just about the whole damned thing she realized that her hand was trembling slightly as she poured out more tea taking a deep breath trying to clear her head she started reading again the money to fund ellen dempseys cab company hadnt come from shady businessmen it had come from a few years work as a prostitute shed been employed in at least two saunas undergoing a single arrest in each when they were visited by police the busts had been eighteen months apart there was an additional note to the effect that dempsey had also worked for an escort agency and had been questioned after a foreign businessman mislaid his cash and credit cards after a visit by dempsey to his hotel room in the city she was never charged siobhan looked for evidence that one or both of the saunas had been owned by cafferty but couldnt find any names were given but they were the names of local entrepreneurs one greek in origin one italian after the police raids hm inland revenue and customs and excise had opened their own inquiries looking into profits and vat left undeclared the owners had shut up shop and moved on by which time ellen dempsey was already running her smalltime cab company there were a couple of minor cases a driver assaulted by a passenger whod refused to pay the fare the passenger ready for an argument at the end of a long nights drinking had found in the driver a willing sparring partner the result had made it as far as an overnight stay in the cells but had fallen short of a court appearance the second case was similar only ellen dempsey had been the driver and shed sprayed the client with mace as mace was banned in scotland it was ellen whod ended up being charged the passenger claiming that hed only wanted a goodnight kiss and that the two of them knew one another of old though this last phrase wasnt explored siobhan got an inkling of what had really happened one of ellens old punters probably not believing that shed given up the sauna life deciding that if he pressed shed be willing but shed reached for the mace instead it might explain the move to edinburgh how could she operate a legitimate business from dundee without the threat of more ghosts appearing impossible to escape her old life her old self so shed set up in edinburgh instead and bought herself a house in fife somewhere she wouldnt be recognized somewhere she could hide from the world siobhan poured more tea though it was tepid now and too strong but it gave her something to do while she collected her thoughts she flicked back four or five sheets found the page she was looking for there was a name not only underlined there but circled too it cropped up a couple of times once in connection with the raid on the sauna once to do with the mace case a detective sergeant called james mccullough or jazz as everyone seemed to call him siobhan wondered if jazz might be able to shed more light on ellen dempsey always supposing there was light to shed she thought back to caffertys words there was no indication in the fax of any friends dempsey might have shed never been married had no children she seemed always to have supported herself pictures flickered across siobhans vision jazz mccullough visiting the marber inquiry keeping up with developments francis gray seated on one of the desks reading transcripts allan ward buying phyl dinner and pumping her for information ellen dempsey tangential to the case maybe worried contacting her friends jazz mccullough and ellen dempsey coincidence or connection siobhan turned her mobile on called rebus on his he picked up i need to talk to you she said where are you st leonards you leith supposedly helping with the diamond killing are the others there with you yes why i want to ask you about jazz mccullough what about him it may be nothing youve got me curious want to meet where can you come down to leith that would make sense i can ask mccullough a few questions while im there dont expect me to be much use in that department she drew her eyebrows together why not i dont think jazz is talking to me nor is anyone else for that matter hang in there siobhan said im on my way sutherland and barclay had traveled to leith in rebuss car a period of uncomfortable silence had been broken by some stilted conversation before barclay plucked up courage and asked rebus if it was maybe worth reconsidering his accusations rebus had just shaken his head slowly no use arguing with the man sutherland had muttered thank christ for the weekend at leith police station the atmosphere had been hardly less strained theyd presented a report to hogan and one of his colleagues rebus saying little as he concentrated on spotting anything the trio might be trying to leave out hogan had been aware of the tension in the room his eyes requesting some sort of explanation from rebus none had been forthcoming we dont mind sticking around jazz had said at the end of the report if you feel weve a contribution to make then hed shrugged youd be doing us a favor keeping us away from tulliallan hogan had smiled all i can promise is office grind better than classroom lessons gray had opined speaking it seemed for all of them hogan had nodded fair enough then maybe just for today the inquiry room was oldfashioned and highceilinged with peeling paint and chipped desks the kettle seemed to be on constantly with the most junior officers on a milkbuying roster there wasnt much room for the tulliallan contingent which suited rebus as it meant they had to split up sharing desk space with disgruntled locals rebus waited a good twenty minutes after siobhans call before she put her head around the door he got up joined her in the corridor having signaled to hogan with his palm spread meaning he was taking five he knew hogan would relish the chance of a word realizing something was up and wanting to know what it was but hogan was in charge of the team his time at a premium so far they hadnt managed a moment alone lets go walkies rebus told siobhan when they got outside it was drizzling rebus pulled his jacket around him and took out his cigarettes he gestured with his head letting her know they were walking down towards the docks he didnt know exactly where the diamond dogs body had been discovered but it couldnt have been too far from here i heard about diamond siobhan said how come no ones talking to you just a little fallingout he shrugged concentrating on his cigarette these things happen to you more than most years of practice siobhan so whats your interest in mccullough his name came up where i was looking at ellen dempsey she owns the cab that dropped marber home that night dempsey moved her company here from dundee in a past life she worked in a sauna rebus thought of laura stafford interesting coincidence he mused and heres another one jazz mccullough arrested her a couple of times rebus seemed to concentrate harder than ever on his cigarette and then i started remembering the way mccullough and gray spent so much time flipping through the transcripts and notes in the inquiry room rebus nodded hed been there seen them and allan ward dating phyl siobhan was saying asking her questions rebus added still nodding hed stopped walking jazz gray and ward how do you think it plays she shrugged i just wondered if there was some connection between mccullough and dempsey maybe theyve kept in touch and he kept tabs on the marber case at her behest maybe siobhan paused maybe because she didnt want her past to come up i think shes tried hard to build a new life could be rebus said not sounding entirely convinced hed started walking again they were close to the docks now heavy lorries passing them almost continuously spewing out fumes kicking up dust and grit they walked with their faces turned to one side rebus could see siobhans unprotected neck it was long and slender a line of muscle running down it he knew that when they reached the dockside the water would be oily and dotted with jetsam no place for a body to end up he touched her arm and took a detour leading them down an alley it would connect with one of the roads eventually leading them back towards the station what are you going to do about it he asked i dont know i thought id get mcculloughs response im not sure about that siobhan maybe youd be better off doing a bit more digging first why rebus shrugged what could he tell her that to his mind jazz mccullough quiet and charming family man was perhaps mixed up in murder and criminal conspiracy i just think it might be safer she stared at him care to elucidate its nothing concrete just a feeling a feeling that asking mccullough a few questions might not be safe rebus shrugged again theyd come out of the alley by turning right theyd be heading towards the rear of the police station im guessing this feeling of yours has something to do with the fact that nobodys talking to you look siobhan he ran a hand down his face as if trying to brush away a layer of skin you know i wouldnt say anything if i didnt think it mattered she considered this then nodded her agreement they were walking around the side of the station a pavement drunk causing them to step onto the road rebus pulled siobhan back to safety as a car hurtled past horn blaring someone in a hurry thanks siobhan said i do what i can rebus informed her the drunk was making for the opposite pavement stumbling blindly across the road they both knew hed make it he was carrying a bottle no way a motorist would want that flying through his windshield ive often thought pedestrians should be issued with hammers for just this situation siobhan said watching the car disappear into the distance she said goodbye to rebus on the steps of the police station watched him disappear inside shed wanted to say something take care maybe or watch yourself but the words hadnt come out hed nodded anyway reading her eyes with a smile the problem wasnt that he thought himself indestructible quite the opposite she worried that he relished the idea of his own fallibility he was only human and if proving it meant enduring pain and defeat he would welcome both did that mean he had a martyr complex maybe she should give andrea thomson a call see if the two of them could talk about it but thomson would want to talk about her and siobhan wasnt ready for that she thought of rebus and his ghosts would laura stafford now haunt her dreams might she be the first of many lauras face was already starting to fade losing definition leaving siobhan with a hand locked to a cars door handle she took a deep breath got to keep busy she told herself then she opened the door to the station and peered inside no sign of rebus she walked in showed her id climbed the stairs to the cid floor it struck her that donny dow might still be in the cells but by now he was probably on remand in saughton jail she could always ask but wasnt sure that seeing him again would constitute any kind of exorcism its siobhan isnt it the voice startled her the man had just appeared from out of an office he was carrying a blue folder she forced a smile di mccullough she said thats funny the smile widening i was just looking for you oh yes i wanted a quick word he looked up and down the corridor then nodded to the room hed just vacated well have some privacy in here he said leaning past her to open the door after you she said the smile frozen on her face the office looked little used some old desks chairs each missing a leg stiffdrawered filing cabinets she left the door open then remembered rebus didnt want him catching her here so she closed the door behind her all very mysterious mccullough said placing the folder on a desk and folding his arms not really she said its just something thats cropped up in connection with the marber case he nodded i hear you found the missing painting that should give you a hike up i was promoted pretty recently nevertheless you go on breaking cases at this rate skys the limit i dont think the case is necessarily broken he paused oh sounding genuinely surprised which is why i have to ask a few questions about the owner of mg cabs mg cabs a woman called ellen dempsey i think you know her dempsey mccullough frowned trying the name out a few times then he shook his head give me a clue you knew her in dundee prostitute she was working the night you raided a sauna a while after that she was off the game and running a couple of minicabs used mace against a customer ended up in court mccullough was nodding right he said ive got her now what did you say her name was ellen dempsey that the name she was using back then yes he looked like he was still having trouble putting a face to the name well what about her i just wondered if youd kept in touch his eyes widened why the hell would i do that i dont know ds clarke unfolding his arms face turning angry his hands had started to bunch themselves into fists i should have you know im a happily married man ask anyone even your friend john rebus theyll tell you look im not suggesting anything improper here it just seems a coincidence that the two of you well coincidence is all it can be okay okay mcculloughs face had reddened and she didnt like those clenched fists the door opened and a face peered round you okay jazz francis gray asked far from it francis this little bitch has just accused me of shagging some old pro i arrested once in dundee francis gray stepped into the room closing the door softly behind him say that again he growled eyes reduced to slits which were concentrated on siobhan all im trying to say is you better be careful what you say dykefeatures anybody starts badmouthing jazz theyve got me to contend with and i make jazz here look like a pussy though probably not the kind of pussy that interests you siobhans face was suffusing with color now hang on a minute she spat trying to control the tremor in her voice before the pair of you go flying off the handle did rebus put you up to this mccullough was snarling fingers of both hands pointed at her as though they were sixshooters because if he did di rebus doesnt even know im here siobhan said her voice rising the two men seemed to glance at one another and she couldnt tell what they were thinking gray stood between her and the door she didnt think she was going to get past him in a hurry best thing you can do mccullough was warning her is head back to your burrow and dig yourself in for the winter you start telling tales you could be headed for your chief constables cooking pot i think jazz as usual is being too generous in his predictions gray said with quiet menace hed just taken half a step towards her and away from the door when it flew open catching him in the back rebus had shouldered it and was now standing there surveying the scene sorry to crash the party he said what do you think youre trying to pull rebus reckon you could drag your little girlfriend here into those paranoid fantasies of yours rebus looked at jazz he seemed upset but rebus couldnt tell how genuine it was or what its cause might be it was just as easy to be upset when maligned as when found out you finished asking questions siobhan when she nodded rebus stuck out his thumb and jabbed it over his shoulder letting her know it was time to leave she hesitated not liking the idea of him bossing her around then she gave mccullough and gray the same withering stare and squeezed past rebus striding down the corridor without looking back gray offered rebus a wicked grin want to shut that door again john sort things out here and now dont tempt me why not just you and me well leave jazz out of it rebuss fingers were around the door handle he didnt know what was about to happen but started pushing the door closed anyway watching as grays grin widened showing yellow glinting teeth then a fist rapped on the other side of the door and rebus let it swing open again getting all cozy in here bobby hogan said ill have no goldbricking on my shift just conferencing jazz mccullough said face and voice suddenly back to normal gray had his own face lowered pretending to adjust his necktie hogan looked at the three men knowing something had been going on well he said conference your arses out of here and back to what we in the human world call work the human world rebus wondered if hogan would ever know how close to the mark hed been in this room for a matter of seconds three men had been reconciled to acting like something less than human sure thing di hogan jazz mccullough said picking up his folder and readying to leave the office grays eyes caught rebuss and rebus could see the man was having a hard time pulling himself back it was like watching edward hyde decide he no longer needed henry jekyll rebus had told jazz that there was still the chance for resurrection but not in francis grays case something had died behind his eyes and rebus didnt think hed be seeing it again after you john mccullough was saying with a sweep of his arm as he followed hogan out of the room rebus could feel a tingling all down his spine as though a blade were about to lodge itself there there was a tapping at siobhans window it took her a moment to work out where she was the st leonards car park she must have driven there from leith couldnt remember anything about it how long had she been sitting it could have been half a minute or half an hour more tapping she got out of the car whats up derek shouldnt that be my question youre sitting there like youve seen a ghost not a ghost no what then has something happened she shook her head as if trying to clear it of the memory of that office gray and mccullough rebus had warned her and shed gone blundering in anyway with her sweeping accusations and halfformed questions it was hardly what they taught you at tulliallan even so the reactions of mccullough and gray had been startling mcculloughs sudden anger grays snarling defense of his colleague shed expected a response yes but nothing quite so feral it was as if the two men had been unraveling in front of her eyes im fine she told linford just in a dream thats all sure look derek her voice had hardened she rubbed at a throbbing spot on her right temple siobhan i am trying to mend the fence between us i know you are derek but this isnt the time okay okay he held up both hands in surrender but you know im there for you if you need me she managed to nod her head he shrugged prefacing a change of subject friday night tonight shame youve got that date i was going to suggest dinner at the wichery another time maybe she couldnt believe she was saying this i dont want to make any more enemies linford was smiling ill hold you to that she nodded again i have to go to the office now linford checked his watch im out of here might be back before the close of play otherwise have a great weekend he seemed to think of something maybe we could do something together i need a bit more notice than that derek the throbbing was getting worse why wouldnt he just go she turned and walked towards the stations rear door hed be standing there watching her waiting for her to turn so he could try out another sympathetic smile no chance upstairs in the murder room things were winding down the team had been given the weekend off en masse the procurator fiscals office was happy enough with the case as it stood theyd have more questions more information they needed come monday morning but for now everyone was relaxing there was still paperwork to contend with still loose ends to be gathered together and tied as tight as possible it could all wait till monday siobhan sat at her desk staring at the cover sheet of the dundee fax when she looked up hynds was moving in her direction she could see by the look on his face that he was going to ask if anything was wrong she held up a finger warning him off he stopped shrugged and turned away she started reading the text of the fax one more time willing something anything to jump out at her she supposed she could try talking to ellen dempsey see if shed let anything slip so what she wondered what difference did it make if mccullough did connect to ellen dempsey it certainly seemed to make a difference to him she knew almost nothing about mccullough and didnt have any contacts in dundee who could enlighten her then she turned back to the cover sheet to ds clarke lothian and borders from ds hetherington tayside hetherington a detective sergeant just like her siobhans request hadnt been addressed to any particular officer shed just got the fax number for tayside police hq and sent it there the cover sheet was on letterhead the telephone number just discernible then she noticed something typed below hetheringtons name x had to be an extension number siobhan picked up her phone and punched the digits police hq dc watkins the male voice said its ds clarke here st leonards in edinburgh any chance i could have a word with ds hetherington shes not in the office right now she a smile cracked open siobhans face can i take a message is she likely to be back hang on a sec there was the sound of the receiver being laid down on a desktop ds hetherington was a woman it gave them something in common might make it easier for the pair of them to talk the receiver was picked up again her stuffs still here meaning shed be back to pick it up could i leave you a couple of numbers to pass on to her id really like to talk to her before the weekend shouldnt be a problem we have to prize her out of the office usually better and better thought siobhan giving watkins her st leonards and mobile numbers afterwards she stared at the telephone willing it to ring the room around her was emptying early doors as rebus would have called it she hoped he was all right she didnt know why she hadnt called him actually she had a vague memory of doing just that probably as soon as shed got back to her car but he hadnt been answering she tried him again now he picked up im fine he told her without preamble ill talk to you later end of conversation she visualized hetherington returning to her desk maybe not noticing the message watkins hadnt sounded the type who had to be prized from anything but a barstool what if hed already made his escape before her return what if she saw the message but was too tired to do anything about it maybe shed had a long week to siobhan it had lasted an eternity she wasnt going to do anything this weekend but lie in bed and read doze then read some more maybe drag the duvet as far as the sofa and watch a blackandwhite film there were cds she hadnt got round to playing hobotalk goldfrapp shed decided to give the football a miss it was an away game at motherwell the phone remained silent siobhan counted to ten giving it a chance then gathered her stuff and headed for the door she got in her car and put some driving music on the latest rem it was fiftythree minutes long which meant it would see her most of the way to dundee she hadnt allowed for the fridayafternoon exodus from the city ending with a long queue to pay the toll at the forth road bridge after that she put her foot down her mobile was attached to its charger still no word from hetherington she picked it up every few minutes just in case some new text message had escaped her attention the farther north she traveled the better she felt it wouldnt matter if there was nobody at the office when she arrived it was good to be out of edinburgh it reminded her that there was another world out there she didnt know dundee professionally but had visited the city plenty of times as a football fan the two dundee teams had stadiums practically next door to one another there were a few pubs in the center where siobhan had enjoyed a drink before kickoff her hibs scarf hidden deep down in her shoulder bag there was a sign off the motorway to the tay bridge but shed made that mistake once before it led to a long winding trail through the villages of fife she stuck to the m bypassing perth and heading into dundee from the west this approach turned into a seemingly endless series of roundabouts she was steering the car around one of these when her phone sounded i got your message the female voice said thanks for calling back as it happens im on the outskirts of town christ it must be serious maybe i just fancied a friday night in dundee in which case delete serious and add desperate siobhan knew she was going to like ds hetherington my names siobhan by the way she said mines liz are you just about ready to shut up shop liz only i know the pubs in this city better than i do your hq hetherington laughed i suppose i could be persuaded great siobhan named a pub and hetherington said she knew it ten minutes ten minutes hetherington agreed how will we know one another i dont think thatll be a problem siobhan single women in that place tend to be an endangered species she was right siobhan only knew the place from saturday afternoons drinking in safety a pack of hibs fans around her but as people clocked off the weekend stretching ahead of them the pub took on a very different character there were office parties loud laughter the only people drinking alone were sourfaced men at the bar couples were meeting up after work bringing their days gossip with them supermarket shopping bags held the evening meal there was thumping dance music and a tv sports channel playing silently the interior was spacious but siobhan was having trouble finding somewhere to stand somewhere shed be conspicuous to anyone coming in there were two doors into the place which didnt help every time she thought shed found a spot drinkers would gather nearby camouflaging her and hetherington was late siobhans glass was empty she went to the bar for a refill lime and soda the barman remembered she nodded quietly impressed she turned to watch the door and saw that it had opened a woman was standing there something liz hetherington had forgotten to mention she had to be six feet tall or thereabouts unlike a lot of tall women she made no attempt to make herself seem shorter holding her back straight and wearing shoes with heels siobhan waved and hetherington joined her liz siobhan said hetherington nodded whatre you having just a dry ginger she paused no the hell with it its friday right right so make it a bloody mary there were no tables left but they found a ledge by the far wall and placed their drinks there siobhan realized that she didnt want to stand next to hetherington for too long she might get a crick in her neck she fetched two stools from the bar and they sat down cheers she said cheers liz hetherington was in her midthirties thick shoulderlength black hair which she kept trimmed without spending a fortune on new styles her slender frame thickened considerably at the hips but her height helped her carry it no rings on her left hand how long have you been a ds siobhan asked hetherington puffed out her cheeks three years three and a half actually you nearer three weeks congratulations hows lothian and borders much the same as up here id expect ive got a female dcs hetherington raised an eyebrow good for you shes okay siobhan said thoughtfully i mean shes not the kind to give favors they never are hetherington stated too much to prove siobhan nodded agreement hetherington was savoring a mouthful of her drink ages since i had one of these she explained swirling the ice in her glass so what brings you to the city of the three js siobhan smiled the three js jute jam and journalism of which as far as she knew only the third still provided much in the way of local jobs i wanted to thank you for sending me that stuff i asked for a phone call would have sufficed siobhan nodded there was a name mentioned one of your colleagues i may have to ask him a few questions and siobhan shrugged and i was just wondering what he was like his names james mccullough hes a di maybe you know someone who can give me a bit of background hetherington studied siobhan over her glass siobhan wasnt sure she was falling for the line shed just spun maybe it wouldnt matter you want to know about jazz mccullough meaning hetherington knew him i just want to know how hell react if i ask him some questions forewarned is forearmed and all that and knowledge is power she watched siobhan shrug again then gestured towards her drink you need a refill siobhan knew hetherington was giving herself time lime and soda she said want a gin or anything in that im driving siobhan stared down at her nearempty glass go on then she said hetherington smiled and headed for the bar when she came back shed made her decision shed also bought two packets of dryroasted peanuts sustenance she said placing them on the ledge then as she sat down again the hunters are out siobhan nodded shed seen them mens eyes assessing her men from the office parties but also men at the bar they did after all appear to be two women at the start of a night out making them possible prey good luck to them siobhan said heres to professional women hetherington said chinking glasses then she paused you dont realize how lucky you are oh i mean maybe it isnt luck could be its instinct or kismet or something she paused to sip her drink there are plenty of people in cid who know jazz mccullough and some of them might even be willing to talk to you but not many would say very much he has a lot of friends hes made a lot of friends plenty of favors hes done for people down the years but youre not one of them ive worked with him a couple of times in the past he acted like i was invisible which as you can imagine is quite a feat siobhan could well imagine it she reckoned hetherington was probably a good halfinch taller than mccullough maybe more he didnt like you hetherington shook her head i dont think it went that far he just didnt think i was necessary because youre a woman hetherington shrugged maybe she lifted her glass again so dont expect him to welcome you with open arms i wont siobhan thought back to the scene in leith and had to suppress a shiver the alcohol seemed to surge through her she lifted a handful of nuts to her mouth what is it you need to ask him anyway the notes you sent me i forget the womans name ellen dempsey mccullough arrested her a couple of times once for prostitution then again for using mace against someone in a taxi dempsey may be part of a case im working whats it got to do with mccullough probably nothing but i need to ask anyway hetherington nodded her understanding well ive told you what i know about jazz you havent mentioned that hes on a course at tulliallan oh you know about that jazz isnt always very good at following orders a colleague of mine in edinburghs just the same happens to be at tulliallan too which is why you know jazz is there its not that i was covering up for him siobhan i just didnt see how it was relevant everythings relevant liz siobhan told her my feeling strictly between us she waited until hetherington had nodded her agreement is that mccullough may have kept in touch with this ellen dempsey character after she left dundee kept in touch in what way to the extent that he may want to protect her hetherington was thoughtful for a moment im not sure i can help i know hes married with kids one of them grown up and studying at university she paused theres some sort of separation going on oh hetherington winced this is going to sound like me having a go at him not as far as im concerned liz siobhan waited for her to speak hetherington let out a sigh he moved out a couple of months back according to the rumor mill still goes round there i think he moved into a flat only a couple of streets away he lives in the city hetherington shook her head just outside in broughty ferry on the coast hetherington nodded look i really dont want to speak bad of the guy if you talked to a dozen detectives youd hardly find anyone with a but he has a problem with authority he just happens to think he knows more than them whos to say hes wrong reminds me of that colleague again siobhan said with a smile hey girls looks like you could do with another drink two men were approaching pint glasses in hands they wore jackets ties and wedding rings not tonight fellas hetherington told them the one whod spoken gave a shrug only asking he said hetherington waved them goodbye maybe theres somewhere else you prefer siobhan asked her i really need to be getting home she tugged at her watch strap if you need to talk to jazz just dive in and do it he wont bite siobhan didnt like to say that she wasnt sure about that they were heading in different directions so they shook hands outside the pub the two men followed them out where you lassies off to then never mind us just get on home to your wives the men glowered then slouched off muttering curses thanks for your help liz siobhan said im not sure ive done much you gave me an excuse to get out of edinburgh hetherington nodded as though she could understand come see us again sometime ds clarke ill do that ds hetherington she watched the tall confident figure striding away from her hetherington sensed it threw a wave without bothering to look back siobhan walked downhill to where shed parked her car the sky was losing light as she snaked her way back towards the motorway replacing rem with boards of canada when her mobile rang she knew instinctively who it would be how was the rest of your day she asked i survived rebus told her sorry i couldnt talk earlier you were in the same room as them and sticking as close to bobby hogan as i could you managed to get under jazz mcculloughs skin im impressed i should have taken your advice and steered clear im not so sure about that john are you ready yet to tell me what the hells going on maybe im not doing anything else for the next hour there was a long silence on the line this has got to stay between us he told her you know you can trust me like i trusted you to stay away from mccullough that was more in the way of advice she said with a grin well all right then if youre sitting comfortably im ready another silence and then rebuss voice sounding eerily disembodied once upon a time in a land far away there was a king called strathern and one day he called one of his errant knights to him with news of a perilous quest rebus paced his living room as he told siobhan the story or as much of it as he felt she needed hed clocked off early and come straight home but now the place felt like a trap he kept peering from the window wondering if someone was waiting for him below the front door was locked but that wouldnt keep anyone out the joiner had replaced the doorjamb but without adding any extra reinforcement another chisel or crowbar would open it as effortlessly as a key the lights were off throughout the flat but rebus wasnt sure he felt any safer in the darkness siobhan asked him a couple of questions when he was done she didnt say anything about whether hed been right or wrong to take on such a task she didnt tell him he was mad for suggesting the drug heist to the trio rebus knew then that she was listening to him as a friend as well as a colleague where are you he thought to ask at last from the sounds she was still driving hed thought she was probably on her way home from st leonards but that had been half an hour ago when hed started his story ive just passed kinross she told him im on my way back from dundee rebus knew what dundee meant digging dirt on jazz mccullough not that there was much to find hes split from his wife but that hardly makes him a monster split from his wife rebus was thinking back to their first days in tulliallan but hes always on the phone to her made a point of going home when he could they separated a few months back the happy marriage had been smoke rebus realized then where was he going he asked i wonder if ellen dempsey could tell us me too rebus grew thoughtful what are you doing tonight not much are you suggesting a stakeout maybe a little one just to see if we can confirm anything dempsey lives in north queensferry i could be there in ten fifteen minutes and mccullough has a house in broughty ferry rebus went to his dining table started sifting through the paperwork there there was a sheet theyd each been given one at the start of the course names and ranks of the participants plus their work and home addresses he lifted it out got it he said word is hes rented a flat a couple of streets away siobhan was saying you sure you want to head up there if his cars in north queensferry its a wasted trip anythings better than sitting here rebus told her he didnt add how much he felt like a target they agreed to keep in touch by mobile and he placed one last call to jean letting her know he would see her later on in the evening how much later he couldnt say if the lights are out dont bother ringing the bell she told him call me in the morning instead will do jean he walked quickly from the tenement to his car starting the engine and reversing out of the parking space he didnt know what to expect some ambush perhaps or a car following him but it was midevening quiet and the edinburgh streets were such that it was hard to tail someone if they were expecting you it was all stopstart traffic lights and junctions rebus didnt think he was being followed the wild bunch had dispersed supposedly on their way home to families loved ones drinking cronies allan ward had complained of the long drive he faced no fast easy route to dumfries but that could have been just talk impossible to tell where any of the trio were rebus had imagined jazz heading for the happy home hed talked into existence but there was no happy home hard to say what was real anymore friday night and the city was coming out to play girls in short dresses boys bouncing as they walked filled with chemical bravado men in suits waving down taxis music pounding from cruising cars you worked hard all week then prayed for oblivion having left edinburgh behind crossing the forth bridge he looked down towards north queensferry and gave siobhan a call no sign of life she told him ive driven past a couple of times no car in the driveway she might still be at work rebus argued busy night and all that i called to book a cab it wasnt her voice rebus smiled nice move where are you if you wave i might see you im just crossing the bridge let me know when you get there rebus ended the call clearing his mind as he drove broughty ferry was on the coast just east of dundee itself it liked to think of itself as genteel and independent like someone with enough money put aside for a comfortable retirement he stopped to ask a local for directions and soon found himself on jazz mcculloughs street though mindful that mccullough himself could be in the vicinity there were plenty of cars parked curbside and in driveways but no sign of mcculloughs volvo sedan rebus passed his house it was detached but unostentatious maybe four bedrooms leaded windows in the lounge light was pouring through them there was a driveway but no garage the car on view was a honda accord probably the wifes rebus turned his saab round at a neighboring culdesac and managed to park just close enough to the house to keep any comings and goings visible he took a sheet of paper from his pocket and unfolded it the list from tulliallan jazzs phone number was printed next to his address rebus placed the call a young male voice picked up the fourteenyearold son is your dad in rebus asked cheerily no the word stretched out longer than necessary as the boy tried to decide what else to tell the caller ive got the right number for jazz hes not here the boy said im a friend of his from work rebus explained the boy relaxed a little i can give you another number if youve got a pen thatd be great the number was recited from an address book or piece of notepaper rebus jotted it down thats a great help thanks no problem the boy put the phone down just as rebus could hear the faint voice of a woman asking who was calling he looked at the number hed just been given it was jazzs mobile no point trying that it wouldnt help pinpoint a location rebus settled his neck against the headrest then called siobhan im here he told her any action your end maybe theyre down the pub i wish i was with them me too i had a gin a couple of hours ago and its given me a thumping head for which the only cure is more alcohol rebus agreed what the hell are we doing john i thought we were on surveillance but for whose benefit our own she sighed i suppose youre right dont feel dutybound to stick around rebus watched a sports car turn into the street its brake lights glowed as it passed the house but it kept going signaling to turn into the road at the end what car does dempsey drive rebus asked starting his ignition latestmodel red mg one just drove past me he made the same turn the mg just had and saw it round another corner rebus kept up his commentary slowed down as if the driver wanted a quick recon of mcculloughs family pile and now rebus made to turn into another street but changed his mind when he saw the mg reverse into a tight parking spot a man was standing on the pavement looking to left and right jazz mccullough with better lighting he might have spotted rebus but rebus had the feeling it was mcculloughs wife he was watching for a woman got out of the car and he led her briskly indoors result rebus told siobhan shes just gone into mcculloughs flat he described the woman hed seen thats her all right siobhan confirmed what now i think weve got as much as we can expect jazz mcculloughs playing away from home with ellen dempsey thats why he was so keen to keep tabs on the marber case he wanted to check we werent hassling her i suppose so but why siobhan persisted what was it they thought wed find i dont know rebus admitted he didnt see what else he could say youre giving up siobhans voice asked i just think it can wait till monday he told her it doesnt make me a bad person no of course not look siobhan its something you should take to gill templer whether she decides to act on it or if theres anything for her to act on is down to gill herself she thinks the case is closed maybe shes right what if shes wrong jesus siobhan what are you saying here you take dempsey and mccullough for some latterday bonnie and clyde you think they killed edward marber of course not she answered trying for the sound of a dismissive laugh well then rebus told her she went on to say he was right shed sleep on it cogitate over the weekend maybe put it into some kind of binary some kind of what never mind they ended the call but rebus didnt move the car not quite yet dempsey and mccullough as bonnie and clyde it had been said in jest but now rebus was starting to wonder not about bonnie and clyde as such but about the relationship between mccullough and ellen dempsey and how it might tie in to something much bigger than even siobhan could have imagined fuck it he said finally unable to sort out the jumble of strands in his head then he turned the car around and headed south jeans lights were still on when she opened the door he was standing there with a fish supper and a bottle of red wine enough for two he told her as she stood back to let him in im naturally flattered first dinner at number one now this he kissed her forehead she didnt resist got any plans for the weekend he asked nothing i cant change if i feel like it i just thought we might spend some time together theres a lot about you i need to get to know such as such as for future reference do you prefer perfume bouquets or fish suppers with wine thats a tough one she admitted closing the door behind them the weekend passed in a blur saturday morning rebus suggested they go for a drive they headed over to the west coast stopping for lunch at loch lomond spending the afternoon as tourists passing through tarbet and crianlarich rebus found them a hotel just outside taynuilt and they checked in laughing at their lack of baggage how will you cope he asked her theres not a napiers the herbalist within a hundred miles she just thumped his arm then went out and found a chemists shop returning with toothbrushes and toothpaste replete after dinner they managed a short stroll down to airds bay before retiring to their room they left the curtains and the window open so that the first thing theyd see on waking would be loch etive then they fell asleep in one anothers arms sunday they didnt rise till nine blaming the country air as they embraced and kissed neither felt the need for any breakfast just orange juice and tea some of the other residents were reading newspapers in the lounge rebus and jean said good morning and then walked outside the grass was damp with dew underfoot and there were thick gray clouds overhead yesterdays distant views across the loch had disappeared into the mist they walked anyway jean was good at recognizing birdsong she knew plant names too rebus took deep lungfuls of the air reminded of childhood walks in the countryside around his home village in fife coal mines coexisting with farmland he wasnt used to walking could feel his heart pumping his breathing slightly labored jean kept up a stream of conversation but rebus was eventually reduced to monosyllables hed smoked only eight cigarettes the whole weekend maybe lack of nicotine was slowing him down back at the hotel they checked out and settled into the car where now jean asked home rebus suggested part of him itching to spend the afternoon in a smoky pub jean looked disappointed the slow route he added watching her face brighten they stopped in callander and stirling after which rebus took an unwilling detour because jean wanted to see tulliallan i was expecting some sort of guard she said as they stopped halfway up the driveway nice grounds though rebus nodded only half listening tomorrow he would be back here four more days of the course to endure maybe strathern was right maybe he should bail out gray mccullough and ward might well feel cheated feel there was unfinished business but would they do anything about it not if they didnt think he was a danger he wondered if siobhan might now look more of a threat to them john jean was saying hmm i think i lost you for a moment there thinking about next week he nodded i shouldnt have brought you here she went on squeezing his hand im sorry rebus shrugged seen enough he asked he was thinking of the three mens bedrooms and whether thered be anything there for him to find if he broke in he doubted it but all the same and where were they anyway was gray at home in glasgow had he taken ward there with him the two of them plotting their next move would jazz have joined them or was he tucked up in bed with ellen dempsey risky her visiting him at home it meant his wife knew about them or jazz wanted her to find out or dempsey didnt want him in her own home which would mean what that this was some sort of arrangement she went along with without necessarily being too thrilled about it that there was a large part of her life she didnt feel like sharing with him john he realized hed completed twothirds of a threepoint turn leaving the car stationary in the driveway sorry jean he said moving the gearshift into first its okay she told him i had you all to myself for a whole day im rather proud i managed that you certainly took my mind off things he agreed with a smile but now theyre back she guessed theyre back he admitted and theyre not going away not unless i do something about them he said flooring the accelerator he dropped her home said he wouldnt stay they kissed and hugged she held up her handbag want your new toothbrush maybe we could keep it at your place he suggested she nodded slowly all right she said he drove out of portobello trying to remember if the roads through holyrood park were closed on a sunday if they were he should probably take duddingston road his mind busy with calculations he was slow to spot the blue light behind him when he did see it it was accompanied by flashing headlights hell is this he muttered pulling over to the curb the patrol car stopped behind him a uniform emerging from the passenger seat rebus was already out of his saab planning to breathalyze me perry the passenger was pc perry mason mason looked anxious weve had cars out all day trying to track you down sir rebuss face hardened whats happened his mobile had been switched off since friday night and still was while his pager was somewhere on the cars backseat his first thought was siobhan dont let anything have happened to siobhan the driver of the patrol car was on the twoway radio we just had orders to be on the lookout for you whose orders whats going on were to give him an escort the driver called out ive really no idea what its about sir mason told rebus im sure theyll explain everything when we get there rebus got back into his saab and let the patrol car move ahead of him it put its blue light and siren on and sped up leaving rebus to follow close behind the driver was enjoying himself breaking the speed limit pulling out onto the wrong side of the road to pass strings of traffic ignoring red lights at junctions they crossed north edinburgh in no time at all rebus tensing up not so much from the drive as from the sense of expectation something bad had happened he didnt want to think what hed expected them to be making for the big house but they continued west it wasnt until they hit dalry road that rebus realized they were heading for the warehouse the gates were open four cars parked in the compound ormiston was waiting for them he pulled open rebuss door fuck have you been he asked whats happened ormiston ignored him turning instead towards the officers who were just emerging from the patrol car you lot can go he snapped mason and his driver looked disgruntled but as far as ormiston was concerned theyd already ceased to exist going to give me a clue ormie rebus asked as he was led into the warehouse ormiston turned towards him hows your alibi looking for last night i was in a hotel seventyodd miles away any company around midnight asleep in the arms of a good woman rebus grabbed ormistons arm jesus ormie going to give me a break here but they were inside the warehouse now and it became crystal clear what had happened two or three of the crates nearest the front had been upended wrenched open compound got turned over last night ormiston explained we were going to move the stuff today rebuss head reeled what about the guard guards plural both of them nursing fractured skulls in the western general ormiston was leading him through the warehouse towards the back where claverhouse stood peering into a single open crate they found the right one then rebus guessed all too easily ormiston muttered his eyes targeting rebus pupils as dark as the barrels of a shotgun about time claverhouse growled at rebus he was a long way away at the time ormiston informed his colleague thats what he says whoa rebus said you saying i had something to do with this half a dozen people knew about this place did they bollocks you said it yourself news had leaked out all over town claverhouse was pointing a finger but you knew about the packing crates i didnt know which one the stuff was in though hes got a point ormiston said folding his arms rebus looked back at the opened boxes they seemed to find it bloody quick claverhouse slapped the edge of the crate a door in the warehouses rear wall opened and three men stepped through theyd been out back carrying on what from their faces had been an angry conversation fingers were being pointed the fingers belonged to two men rebus hadnt seen before they were being pointed at assistant chief constable colin carswell customs rebus guessed claverhouse didnt say anything but ormiston nodded the two agents from customs and excise were turning to leave carswell looked furious as he came towards rebus christ almighty whats he doing here di rebus knew about the packing crates sir ormiston explained but i didnt steal it rebus added any idea who did carswell asked what did ce say claverhouse interrupted theyre absolutely fucking furious said it should have been their shout lack of cooperation and all that shit no way theyre taking any portion of the blame do the media have hold of it rebus asked carswell shook his head nor are they going to i want that understood we handle this internally that quantity of dope suddenly appears on the street it wont stay quiet for long rebus commented rubbing in some salt carswells mobile rang he looked at the display ready to ignore it then changed his mind yes sir he said will do sir right away he ended the call started playing with the knot in his tie stratherns just arriving he said strathern knows rebus asked claverhouse course he bloody well knows claverhouse spat back no way he couldnt be told he kicked the side of the packing crate should have moved the stuff yesterday bit late for that carswell muttered heading off to meet his fate rebus could hear one car leaving the compound the customs agents and another the chief constables arriving who knew the move was planned for today he asked necessary personnel ormiston answered weve been talking to them all morning no one saw anything what about cctv weve got it on tape claverhouse admitted four men in ski masks two of them tooledup sawedoffs ormiston added they thumped the guards put some cutters to the padlocks drove in stolen van of course claverhouse growled he was pacing the room now white ford transit picked it up this morning half a mile from here two guards for that amount of stuff rebus shook his head slowly no prints he guessed ormiston shook his head two vans actually he said correcting his colleague four men rebus was thinking he was wondering who the fourth might be can i take a look he asked at what the video ormistons eyes went to his partners claverhouse shrugged ill show you ormiston told rebus angling his head back towards the door they left claverhouse still staring into the empty crate exiting the warehouse rebus saw carswell in the back of stratherns car the driver had got out for a smoke leaving the two men alone carswell looked distinctly uncomfortable which pleased rebus more than it should have he followed ormiston to the gatehouse there was a tv there the screen quartered and showing exterior views no interiors rebus said ormiston shook his head he was slotting home a cassette how come the gang didnt take the tape the recordings are made on another machine hidden in a box behind the warehouse either they couldnt find it or didnt think we were taping them he hit the play button thats one little detail we seem to have managed to keep secret the action was stilted the video working on what looked like a fivesecond delay the transit stopping at the gate two men rushing the gatehouse while another cut the padlock and a fourth drove the van into the compound rebus had only the mens builds to go by and couldnt identify any of them the van was backed up to the warehouse doors which were pulled open after which the van disappeared inside this is the interesting bit ormiston said then he speeded the film up whats happening rebus asked absolutely nothing as far as we can tell then seven or eight minutes later this the videotape now showed a second smaller van arriving it too reversed into the warehouse whos this rebus asked dunno one or two men in the van the gang now totaling six a matter of a few minutes later both vans left the compound ormiston rewound the tape to the point where the second van arrived do you see rebus had to admit he didnt ormiston pointed to the front of the van just below the radiator grille the first van you could just about make out the license plate now rebus saw the second vans license plate was obliterated looks like its missing he said either that or taped up ormiston stopped the video what happens now rebus asked ormiston shrugged you mean apart from the internal inquiry and me and claverhouse getting the boot he spoke phlegmatically and rebus knew what he was thinking claverhouse was the teams senior partner his idea him for the boot ormie might just about hang in there but carswell knew and carswell hid the scheme from the chief constable the sackings could go higher than just claverhouse has the weasel turned up rebus asked ormiston shook his head you think maybe he look ormie word got out about what you were hiding in that compound isnt it feasible that there could have been another leak half the city could have known about claverhouses little ploy with the packing crates but how did they know which one rebus shook his head i cant answer that claverhouse apart who knew which crate the stuff was in just him ormiston replied with a shake of the head it sounded like this was already very old ground and was there anything about the crate that made it different from the others not apart from its weight there had to be some way of telling which one it was the corner farthest from the loading bay with another case on top of it rebus was thoughtful maybe the guards knew was all he could come up with well they didnt rebus folded his arms sounds like it was your partner then ormiston smiled without humor he thinks you told your pal cafferty hed turned to watch from the cabins window as claverhouse marched across the compound towards them the team were in and out of there in under ten minutes ormie rebus explained patiently they knew which box they were looking for claverhouse appeared at the cabins open door i was just explaining to ormie here rebus informed him how it had to be you claverhouse stared at him but rebus wasnt blinking so the sdea man turned towards his partner dont go blaming me ormiston said weve been through this a dozen times it looked like there might be a dozen more in the future too rebus squeezed out of the booth well he said i think ill leave you gentlemen to grind and gnash your teeth some of us have got the last precious hours of the weekend to look forward to youre going nowhere claverhouse told him not until youve made your report rebus stopped what report everything you know everything even the little chat you wanted me to have with the weasel strathern already knows about it john ormiston told him and he knows about the latenight visit the weasel paid to you claverhouse added grim satisfaction bringing the ghost of a smile to his pale lips just then one of the doors to stratherns car opened and carswell stepped out crossing briskly to the gatehouse your turn he told rebus the smile was lingering on claverhouses face you didnt think it worth telling me any of this strathern said he held a notebook open on his lap tapping it with a silver pen they were seated in the back of his car it smelled of leather and polished wood strathern looked annoyed and his cheeks were tinged red rebus knew he was going to be a lot more annoyed by the end of their talk sorry for that sir whats this about caffertys man di claverhouse asked me to speak with him why you rebus shrugged i suppose because ive had a few runins with him in the past claverhouse thinks youre in caffertys pocket hes entitled to his opinion it happens to be untrue rebus watched as the sdea men accompanied by carswell disappeared inside the warehouse again you didnt say anything to caffertys man nothing di claverhouse didnt want me to say but he sought you out he came to my home yes we spoke for a few minutes about what he was still worried about his son and thought you could help im not really sure sir strathern looked over some handwritten notes you visited the warehouse twice yes sir and your second visit was thursday sir why were you there claverhouse says you werent invited thats not strictly true sir i went to hq to speak to him he was at the warehouse and ds ormiston was headed down here di claverhouse knew i was coming i think he was pleased at the prospect it meant he could show off his little idea the crates bloody idiotic strathern paused he says you came to offer an apology doesnt sound like you john it isnt rebus said his stomach tightened things were about to get uncomfortable it was a pretext a pretext id come to the warehouse because gray mccullough and ward asked me to there was a long silence the two men fixed eyes strathern twisted in his seat trying to face rebus as best he could in the cramped confines proceed he said so rebus told him the planned heist his way into the gang how it was never meant to come to anything the way theyd dumped him once hed gone cold on the idea they knew about the crates strathern asked voice ominously quiet yes because you told them i was trying to make them see how impossible the whole thing was strathern leaned forward placed his head in his hands jesus christ he whispered then he sat back up took a deep breath there were five of them rebus said as strathern struggled to regain his composure maybe even six what four men in the van the cctv footage plus at least one other in the second van so so who were the others maybe one of them was you john maybe thats why im getting this story youre setting up your coconspirators i was at a hotel on the west coast convenient alibi girlfriend with you rebus nodded just the two of you alone in the room all night as i say a convenient alibi sir supposing i was involved why would i have told you any of it to set them up fine rebus said grimly it was you and your cronies who wanted them go get them and arrest me while youre at it rebus opened his door weve not finished here di rebus but rebus was already out of the car he leaned back down into it better to get the air cleared sir lets have all of it out in the open the bernie johns case bent cops dope kept hidden from customs and a coven of chief constables who managed to fuck everything up rebus slammed the door closed after him and stalked towards his own car then thought better of it he needed a pee so walked around the side of the warehouse there in the narrow weedfilled conduit between the security fence and corrugatedaluminum wall he saw a distant figure the man was at the far corner of the building hands in pockets head bowed forward as his whole body seemed to convulse it was colin carswell the assistant chief constable kicking the fence with all his might youre not going to get away with it monday morning at tulliallan while parking his saab rebus had seen mccullough getting out of his own car mccullough had been reaching into the backseat for his carryall he turned at the sound of rebuss voice but then decided to ignore him there was a folder he wanted farther along the backseat he stretched for it rebus planted a knee in the small of his back ducked down so he wouldnt hit his head on the top of the door mccullough was stuck writhing in the confined space youre not going to get away with it rebus repeated get off me think you can pull a stunt like that i dont know what youre talking about the hit on the warehouse mccullough stopped moving let me up and well talk youll do more than that mccullough youll hand the whole fucking lot back rebus heard a car screech to a stop behind him a door opening with the motor still running grays fist caught him in his right kidney then grabbed him by the collar rebus stumbled backwards off mccullough and out of the car falling to his knees but rising quickly come on you bastard gray was shouting he had both fists up knees bent feet shuffling a bareknuckle fighter who fancied his chances rebus was grimacing in pain mccullough was extracting himself from the backseat face red hair disheveled he says weve turned over the warehouse he told his friend what grays eyes darted from one man to the other abruptly he stopped acting the boxer i just want to know how you knew which crate to open rebus hissed one hand rubbing his side you trying to stick us in the frame mccullough said accusingly was that the plan all along he pointed a finger anyones got hold of the dope its you i was on the other side of the country rebuss eyes were blazing what about you mccullough will ellen dempsey give you an alibi that why youve been cozying up to her mccullough didnt say anything just shared a look with his partner rebus felt like wincing because now hed really blown it letting them know he knew about dempsey but the look which passed between gray and mccullough was curious there was fear fear mixed in there with everything else fear of what what was it that was lurking there rebus got the feeling it had nothing to do with the warehouse siobhan so you know about ellen jazz was saying trying to sound offhand he shrugged no big deal i left my wife weeks back yeah gray added belligerently rebus looked at him that the best you can do francis dont tell me ive got you at a loss for words ive always let actions do the talking for me gray rubbed his fist with his palm if you think im going to let you get away with this get away with what gray spat its your word against ours like jazz says youre the fucker who set it up in the first place and thats precisely what well tell anyone who comes asking rebus had to admit they didnt seem worried by his accusations angered yes worried no his mention of ellen dempsey had touched a rawer nerve he decided to save it think it over turned away and walked back towards his car see you inside gray called to him and rebus couldnt know if he meant inside the college building or in one of her majestys many fine scottish prisons he leaned against the saab grays punch still throbbed he hoped there wouldnt be any damage he watched a procession of other cars heading along the driveway towards him some might be fresh probationers preparing for their first tentative steps on the career path others might be senior officers coming to hone their skills and learn new tricks i cant go back in there rebus told himself he couldnt stay not for another minute the idea of sitting around tennants table avoiding eye contact with gray and mccullough keeping up with the sham surrounded by hundreds of recruits for whom tulliallan was teacher and nourisher friend and mentor fuck it he said sliding back behind the saabs steering wheel he wouldnt even bother calling in sick let them ask questions phone gill templer hed deal with it when he had to if he had to if he felt like it right now he couldnt get that solitary moment out of his mind gray and mccullough sharing a look a look as if theyd come one step closer to the edge a step too close for either man protecting ellen dempsey or being protected by her rebus was starting to get an inkling but hed need help if he was going to prove any of it help and one hell of a lot of luck as he started away down the drive he saw gray in his rearview the man was standing in the road legs apart hed made a pistol of his right hand and was aiming it at the saab wrist recoiling as he fired the imaginary bullet his mouth opening silently bang you dont think neilson did it do you rebus whispered siobhan locked eyes with him and shook her head she was seated at her desk rebus leaning down over her he could see that on her computer shed been writing a report on the connection between mccullough and dempsey without mentioning friday nights unapproved surveillance i need to take another look at the case you cant she whispered back youre still persona non grata as far as gills concerned he was about to tell her that this wasnt the case anymore one call to strathern and the boss would inform gill that rebus was back on board but then he looked around the room eyes were staring at him curious as to his sudden appearance there and the way he was trying to talk in private with siobhan hawes linford hood and silvers rebus wasnt sure how far he could trust any of them hadnt gray worked a case once with linford could hawes still fall under allan wards spell youre right he whispered i am a nonperson and ir is probably still empty he nodded slowly hoping shed understand then pushed himself back upright see you he told her reverting to his normal speaking voice bye she said watching him leave interview room had yet to be cleared of the desks and chairs used by the wild bunch meaning that in the interim all interviews would be conducted next door in ir there was a knock at the door and it opened siobhan sidled in carrying a thick manila folder rebus was seated at one of the desks nursing a coffee from the machine anyone see you come in she asked him nope anyone notice you leaving the office with that lot hard not to she shrugged i dont think i was followed though she placed the folder on his desk so what are we looking for sure you can spare the time she pulled out a chair what are we looking for ties that bind he answered dempsey and mccullough he nodded for starters by the way i blew it this morning told mccullough i knew about the pair of them i dont suppose he was thrilled no but it means theyll both be ready for us we need to have some ammunition and you think its hiding somewhere in here she patted the folder i hope so she blew air from her cheeks no time like the present she said opening the folder do we each take a chunk of the inquiry rebus was shaking his head getting up and moving to the chair next to her we work as partners siobhan that means reading each and every page together seeing what ideas we come up with im not the worlds fastest reader all the better something tells me you know this case back to front anyhow this way i get the chance to read everything through twice to your once he slid the first stapled set of sheets out of the folder and placed it on the desk between them then like kids at primary school sharing a textbook they started to read by lunchtime rebuss head was pounding hed covered six sides of lined legal paper with comments and questions no one had disturbed their session siobhan was standing up and stretching can we take a break he nodded checking his watch forty minutes for lunch can you fetch a bag from upstairs she stopped in the middle of a neck stretch what for rebus had his hand on the folder this goes with us he said ill meet you outside in five he was smoking a cigarette when she came out something was weighing down her shoulder bag and he nodded his satisfaction tell me were not working through lunch i just dont want anyone else to know what were up to he explained well since its your idea she handed him the shoulder bag you get to be in charge they went to a sandwich bar near the meadows sat on high stools at the window chewing their purchases neither spoke their heads were still cluttered the passing world a good excuse to stare unblinking and unthinkingly both sipped from cans of irnbru afterwards on the way back to st leonards siobhan asked rebus how his filled roll had been it was fine he told her she nodded what was the filling again he thought for a moment cant honestly remember he looked at her what was in yours watching her shrug his face broke into a smile which siobhan returned there was no sign that anyone had been in ir in their absence theyd brought extra cans of juice with them and placed these on the desk along with the folder and the lined pad of notes remind me siobhan said opening her drink what are we looking for whatever it is that was missed first time round she nodded and they got back to work half an hour later they were in discussion about the missing painting it means something rebus was saying maybe not to us but to someone when did marber buy it again rebus waited while siobhan flipped through the sheets finding the right one five and a half years back rebus tapped the desk with his pen weve been talking about neilson trying to blackmail marber what if it works both ways how do you mean maybe marber was putting the squeeze on someone else neilson rebus shook his head the big money he was expecting we only had lauras word for that marber could just have been trying to impress her fair enough but lets say he did have money coming or thought he did blackmail money rebus was nodding from someone he had no need to fear cant be too many people out there wimpier than edward marber rebus held up a finger exactly but maybe marber wasnt going to be around for much longer because he was going to be dead siobhan was frowning feeling she was failing to understand rebuss train of thought he shook his head he wasnt going to be around siobhan the empty selfstorage unit the paintings all wrapped up as though ready to be shipped out going somewhere now rebus nodded this place of his in tuscany maybe he was thinking of persuading laura to go there with him shed never have agreed im not saying she would but if he was infatuated with her maybe he couldnt see that think of the way he got her the flat in mayfield terrace springing it on her could he have been planning the same sort of surprise with italy siobhan was thinking it through so hes going to put some of his stuff into storage maybe take some of it with him she shrugged and where does that get us exactly rebus was rubbing his chin it brings us back to the vettriano the door opened and a head popped round phyllida hawes thought i heard voices she said were in conference here phyl siobhan complained thats as may be but dcs templer is looking for di rebus tootsweet as i believe they say in france gill templer looked to be rearranging the paperwork on her desk when rebus walked in you wanted to see me he said heard youd been spotted on the premises she crumpled a sheaf of paper and added it to the contents of her overflowing bin marber case solved to your satisfaction then he asked fiscals office seem inclined to go to trial few loose ends they want us to tie up she looked at him i hear youre awol from tulliallan he shrugged thats all finished with gill really sir david hasnt said anything give him a ring maybe i will she paused did you get a result he shook his head anything else i can do for you gill only theres some work im trying to catch up on what sort of work he was already halfway out of the door oh you know loose ends he walked into the murder room and stood next to phyllida hawess desk there were only a couple of officers around rebus crouched down so his head was the same level as hers where was it you found me he asked quietly she caught his meaning anywhere but ir she guessed he nodded slowly stood back up anyone else know she shook her head lets keep it that way he said back downstairs siobhan had finished her drink vettriano she prompted him im not seeing it he sat down picked up his pen why take that particular painting like you said it meant something to someone exactly say marber had blackmailed somebody used some or maybe all the money to buy himself a painting he wouldnt be the first person to get greedy later on decide he could get himself a little extra nor would he be the first to die for his efforts siobhan pressed the tips of her fingers together he was thinking of leaving the country anyway so decided he might as well try an extra squeeze on whoever it was hed blackmailed they didnt like that so they had him killed taking the painting because they knew hed bought it with money taken from them but the painting didnt mean anything to them other than that rebus added stealing it was a gesture and a pretty rash one so when neilson started to look good as a suspect the killer decided it could be the final nail in his coffin something the procurator fiscal said siobhan mused the money marber had paid neilson no one knew about it but us meaning meaning the only people who knew how firmly neilson was fitting the picture were cops rebus guessed watching her nod but we still dont know who it was marber was blackmailing she said rebus shrugged im not so sure hed blackmailed anyone not the first time round explain she narrowed her eyes but rebus shook his head not yet lets keep digging when siobhan took a break to fetch more coffees she returned with news have you heard the rumor is it about me rebus guessed for once no she put their cups down moves afoot at the big house do tell word is carswells moving on really and theres some shakeup at the sdea rebus whistled but his act was failing to convince her you already knew she stated says who come on john siobhan cross my heart i didnt know a thing about it she stared at him linfords looking bootfaced i think hed gotten used to carswells protection its a cold world at the big house if no ones looking out for you rebus agreed they pondered this for a moment then broke into smiles couldnt happen to a more deserving bloke rebus said now lets get back to the real work they decided some foot slogging was necessary so left the station bundling the folder and all their notes into the shoulder bag again and made for the selfstorage facility where the owner wasnt able to add much marber had arranged for a standing order to pay for the unit he hadnt said why he might need it back at marbers gallery they found his secretary trying to clear out the office she was on a retainer from the estate until the work was complete and didnt seem in a hurry to hit the dole queue her name was jan meikle she was in her early forties with tiedback hair and thick oval glasses her frame seeming needlethin amidst the haystack of boxes papers and artifacts in the overheated room the gallery itself was empty the walls denuded of the pictures which had given it its personality rebus asked where they were gone to auction jan meikle replied all monies to accrue to the estate it sounded like the line shed been given by marbers solicitor were mr marbers affairs in order at the time of his death rebus asked he was standing with siobhan in the doorway there being no floor space worth mentioning inside the room itself apart from two small patches which were currently being occupied by miss meikles sandaled feet as much as could have been expected she replied automatically it wasnt the first time a police detective had asked the question you didnt get the sense that the business was winding down in any way rebus pressed she shook her head but didnt look at him sure about that miss meikle she mumbled something neither of them caught sorry siobhan said eddie was always getting ideas into his head the secretary repeated he told you he was selling up didnt he rebus asked she shook her head again defiantly this time not selling up no taking time off then this time she nodded his place in tuscany did he mention anyone he might have been taking with him she looked up working hard to keep the tears from flowing why must you persist in this its our job siobhan stated you know malcolm neilsons in custody charged with mr marbers murder yes do you think he did it i dont see why not you want it to be him because it brings all this to an end siobhan said quietly but wouldnt it be better to get the person who was really responsible meikle blinked at her not malcolm neilson we dont think so rebus said did you know about laura stafford miss meikle yes and you knew she was a prostitute the woman nodded unwilling to speak did eddie say he was going to go to tuscany with laura stafford another nod do you know if hed actually asked her as i say eddie was always getting ideas this wasnt the first time hed spoken of it she paused and she was by no means the first woman hed spoken of taking with him on one of his jaunts from her tone rebus guessed that maybe miss meikle had at one time thought herself one of those candidates could he have meant it this time he asked quietly he was putting his paintings into mothballs hed rented a storage unit hed done that before too she snapped rebus thought for a moment the vettriano that went missing would there be any records here about its purchase the when and where the police took them did they take any other records rebus was looking towards two fourdrawer filing cabinets in a corner of the room were interested in sales and purchases between six and five years ago all in there the secretary said nodding not in the direction of the cabinets but towards two large boxes on the floor beside the desk ive spent the last two days sorting them out lord knows why itll all probably go to the dump rebus tiptoed gingerly into the room removing the lid from one of the boxes there were bundles of invoices and receipts wrapped in clear plastic envelopes and elastic bands page markers sticking out showing relevant dates he looked up at miss meikle youve done a grand job he said an hour later rebus and siobhan were seated on the floor of the gallery the paperwork spread out and divided between them a few curious passersby had stopped to watch perhaps thinking themselves spectators at some new style of art installation even when siobhan had raised two fingers at a studenty couple theyd just smiled as if in appreciation that this too must be part of the performance rebus had his legs stretched out ankles crossed back resting against the wall siobhan sat with her legs folded beneath her until pins and needles set her hopping across the whitewashed wooden floor silently rebus was blessing miss meikle without her organizational skills their task might have taken days mr montrose seems to have been a good customer rebus said watching siobhan rubbing the circulation back into her foot no shortage of those she said i didnt realize people in edinburgh had so much money to burn theyre not burning it siobhan theyre investing it much nicer to hang your cash on the drawing room wall than have it molder in a bank vault youve convinced me im closing my savings account and buying an elizabeth blackadder i didnt know you had that much tucked away she flopped down beside him so she could study mr montroses purchases wasnt there a montrose at the opening was there she reached over for her shoulder bag and produced the marber folder busying herself flipping through its many sections rebus called through to miss meikle who appeared in the doorway i was thinking of heading home soon she warned him all right if we take this lot with us rebus indicated the sprawl of paperwork the secretary looked disappointed at what had become of her careful filing dont worry rebus assured her well put it all back together again he paused its either that or leave it lying here till we can come back this was the clincher miss meikle nodded her agreement and made to turn back into the office just one thing rebus called out mr montrose how well do you know him not at all rebus frowned wasnt he at the preview if he was we werent introduced buys a lot of paintings though or he did four five years ago yes he was a good client eddie was sorry to lose him how did that happen she shrugged came towards him and dropped to a crouch the numbers on these page markers refer to other transactions she started sifting through the paperwork plucking out this sheet and that list of people at the party siobhan said brandishing a sheet of her own we were dealing with signatures remember some more legible than others one particularly nasty squiggle is down here as possibly marlowe matthews or montrose i remember grant hood showing it to me she handed him a photocopy of the relevant page in the gallerys visitors book no first name unless the squiggle was a first name no address in the space left for one miss meikle says montrose stopped being a client of mr marbers he handed back the photocopy which siobhan now studied would he turn up at a preview he didnt get an invite the secretary stated i never knew his address eddie always dealt with him direct was that unusual a little some clients didnt want to be identified famous people or the aristocracy wanting a valuation and not wishing anyone to know they were needing to sell she drew out another sheet of paper checked its page marker then started looking again makes sense siobhan was saying we had montrose down as being cafferty i cant imagine him courting publicity you think it was cafferty rebus didnt sound so sure here we are miss meikle said sounding proud that her system had already proved its usefulness montrose whoever he was had purchased in bulk to start with a quarter of a million pounds worth of paintings in a matter of a few months in the years that followed there were a few sales a few more purchases the sales were always at a profit although montroses name appeared on the sales slips and buyers notes his address was given as co marber galleries all these years and you never met him rebus asked meikle shook her head you must have spoken to him on the phone yes but only to pass him over to eddie how did he sound curt id say a man of few words scottish yes upper class she thought about this no she said drawing out the single syllable not that im one to prejudge people her own cadences were edinburgh private school she spoke as though dictating each utterance to some slowwitted foreigner when montrose bought a painting it must have gone to some delivery address rebus guessed i think they always came here i could certainly check rebus shook his head and after they arrived here what then i really cant say he looked at her cant or wont cant she said sounding peeved at his insinuation could mr marber have kept them she shrugged youre saying this montrose character never actually kept any of his own paintings siobhan sounded skeptical maybe maybe not say hed no interest in them except as an investment he could still put them on his walls not if people might suspect suspect what rebus glanced towards miss meikle letting siobhan know this was a discussion they should carry on in private the secretary was twisting her watchband anxious to close up for the night one last question rebus told her what happened to mr montrose she showed him the final sheet of transactions he sold everything rebus looked down the list of paintings and prices fetched montrose had walked away with a third of a million less commission did mr marber put everything through the books siobhan asked meikle suddenly looked furious of course she snapped in which case inland revenue will have been notified rebus saw her point i dont suppose theyve had any more luck tracking mr montrose down than we have and if they havent started looking by now i think theyre whistling dixie because montrose no longer exists siobhan guessed rebus nodded know the best way to make someone disappear siobhan she thought for a moment then shrugged if theyve never been there in the first place rebus told her beginning to gather up the papers they stopped for a chinese takeaway and already being on siobhans side of town went to her flat im warning you she said itll look like a bombs hit it and it did rebus could see how shed spent her weekend video rentals a pizza box crisp bags and chocolate wrappers and a selection of cds as she went to fetch plates from the kitchen he asked if he could put some music on be my guest he perused the rack of titles most of the names meaning nothing to him massive attack he called to her opening the lid they any good maybe not for our purposes try the cocteau twins there were four to choose from he opened one dropped the cd onto the tray of the player pressed the load button he was opening more of the cases when she came back through carrying a tray you put your cds back the right way up he commented youre not the first to notice i should also tell you that i line up the tins in my cupboards with the labels facing out profilers would have a field day with you funny you should say that andrea thomson offered me counseling after that attack on laura you sound as though you liked her thomson she was being obtuse laura rebus corrected accepting the plate and fork from her they started prizing open the cartons of food i did like her siobhan confessed pouring soy sauce onto her noodles she sat down on the sofa rebus took the armchair what do you think of it i havent started yet rebus said i meant the music its fine theyre from grangemouth you know must be all the chemicals in the water rebus was thinking of the drive between edinburgh and tulliallan passing the flare towers of grangemouth in the distance looking like some lowbudget blade runner set you had a quiet weekend then mmm she said mouth full of vegetables still seeing brains his names eric were just friends did you see jean at the weekend yes thanks he remembered the way it had turned out with a patrol car leading him at speed through streets not far from here shall we call a truce on asking questions about one anothers love life rebus nodded his agreement and they ate in silence afterwards they cleared the coffee table and placed all the paperwork there siobhan said she had some lagers in the fridge turned out they were mexican rebus frowned at the bottle but siobhan paid no attention she knew hed drink it anyway then they got back to work who exactly was at the party that night rebus asked do we have a description of montrose always supposing he was there and the scribble didnt belong to a marlowe or matthews she found the relevant pages in the folder theyd interviewed everyone they could but there were still some uncertainties bound to be with the place so crowded and not all of the guests acquainted she remembered hoods computer simulation the gallery had sent out a hundred and ten invitations seventyfive had rsvpd to accept but not all of them had turned up on the night and others who hadnt got round to replying had turned up like cafferty rebus said like cafferty siobhan agreed so how many were actually there on the night she shrugged its not a precise science if theyd bothered to sign the guest book we might have had a better chance montrose signed or matthews he stuck out his tongue then stretched his spine and groaned so what exactly did you do with all the guests we asked them who else they could remember being there the names of anyone theyd known or talked to physical descriptions of anyone else they could think of rebus nodded it was the kind of painstaking detail that was oftentimes useless to a case but very occasionally threw up some nugget and did you manage to put names to all the faces not exactly she admitted one guest described someone in a tartan jacket nobody else seemed to have spotted it sounds like theyd had a bit to drink or had been to too many parties that night there are a lot of vague descriptions we did try to match each and every one of them not easy rebus admitted so what are we left with anyone put a name to cafferty one or two yes he didnt seem keen on striking up conversations you still see him as montrose we could always ask we could rebus agreed but maybe not yet she pointed to a particular paragraph on one sheet these are all the descriptions that seem to be indicating cafferty rebus read down the list two of them have got him wearing a black leather jacket which is what he usually wears siobhan was nodding he had it on when he came to the station but another two have got him in a brown sports jacket they got through four dozen bottles of champagne siobhan reminded him and one persons got him with darker hair describes him as being fairly tall whats cafferty fivenine would you say that was tall maybe if the person describing him was on the short side whats your point my point is that we could be talking about two different people cafferty and someone else who happens to share some physical similarities rebus was nodding taller than cafferty with hair not turned so gray and wearing a brown jacket that narrows things down nicely she saw that her sarcasm was lost on rebus he was deep in thought our mr montrose she asked maybe were just starting to see him siobhan only an outline but definitely there so what now siobhan looked suddenly tired theyd been working flat out and now she was home and feeling like a bath and an hour or two of mindless tv just to put your mind at rest i thought we might pay cafferty a visit right now could be well catch him at home but i want to drop in to arden street first pick something up oh and well need to talk to miss meikle look and see if shes in the phone book will you yes boss siobhan said seeing bath and tv receding into the distance rebus told her to wait for him in the car when they reached arden street she peered up saw the light come on in his living room less than five minutes later it went off again and rebus emerged from the building am i allowed to ask she said lets save the surprise he answered with a wink as he drove them out of marchmont she noticed that he seemed interested in the rearview mirror someone behind us she guessed i dont think so but you wouldnt be surprised if there was lot of people seem to know my address he commented gray and mccullough to name but two and the others so far ones turned up dead and the others gone awol she thought it through dickie diamond and the weasel well make a detective of you yet he told her she was silent for a few moments until she thought of something you know where cafferty lives she waited till hed nodded then you know more than i do thats why im the senior officer he said with a smile when she stayed quiet he decided she deserved more than this i like to keep tabs on mr cafferty its by way of a hobby you know the rumors he turned his head to her that im in his pocket that the pair of you are too similar oh were similar all right like cain and abel were caffertys home was a large detached house at the end of a culdesac behind the astley ainslie hospital in the grange area of the city the street suffered from poor lighting probably the only time it came into contact with an adjective like poor i think this is the one rebus said siobhan looked there was no sign of caffertys red jaguar there was a garage at the side of the house however so maybe it had been put to bed for the night behind the downstairs curtains the lights were on curtains werent that usual in streets as des res as this one the owners either used the original shutters or else left them open so that pedestrians could peer jealously through the windows it was a solidlooking stonebuilt residence on at least three floors matching bay windows to either side of the front door not bad for an excon siobhan stated be a while before he has us as neighbors rebus agreed unless he suddenly comes down in the world there were three steps up to the front door but when they tried the garden gate it was locked the gates to the driveway looked locked too movementsensitive lights were suddenly bathing them in halogen the curtains twitched and a few seconds later the front door opened the man standing there was tall and wiry with a tight black tshirt showing off thick shoulder muscles and a flat stomach his stance was classic club doorman legs apart arms folded youre not coming in here it said can big ger come out to play rebus asked he could hear a dog barking inside next moment it came flying from between the bodyguards legs siobhan snapped her fingers and made clicking noises with her tongue hello there claret at the sound of its name the spaniel pricked its ears up and waggled its tail all the way to the gate where siobhan had dropped to a crouch so it could sniff her fingers moments later it was off again sniffing its way across the lawn the bodyguard had turned into the house to speak to someone perhaps surprised that siobhan had known the dogs name claret rebus asked i met her at caffertys office she explained rebus watched claret pause to pee on the lawn then turned his attention to the doorway cafferty was standing there in a thick blue bathrobe rubbing his hair dry with a matching towel brought your swimsuits he cried out nodding to the bodyguard before retreating back inside the bodyguard pressed a button and the gate clicked open claret decided to follow them indoors the wide hallway boasted four marble pillars and two chinese urns each a similar height to siobhan need bloody big flowers to fill those rebus said to the guard who was leading them towards the back of the house your names joe isnt it siobhan said suddenly the guard stared at her i recognize you from a club i sometimes visit with my mates i dont do that anymore joe said siobhan had turned to rebus joe here was the doorman always a smile for the ladies is that right joe rebus said whats your other name buckley and how does joe buckley like working for the east coasts most notorious gangster buckley looked at him i like it fine plenty of chances to put the frighteners on people eh is that in the job description or just one of the perks rebus was smiling know what happened to the poor sod youve replaced joe hes going down for murder just something for you to bear in mind club bouncer might have been the smarter career move through a door and down some steps they found themselves at another door which led into a vast conservatory most of the space taken up by an eightmeter swimming pool cafferty stood behind the poolside bar dropping ice into three glasses an evening ritual he explained you still drink whiskey strawman strawman his nickname for rebus because of a mixup years back in court the prosecutor thinking rebus was another witness a mr stroman depends what youve got glenmorangie or bowmore ill take a bowmore without the ice no ice cafferty acknowledged emptying rebuss glass siobhan what about you ds clarke she corrected him noting that buckley had left them still on duty eh ive got some bitter lemon might suit that scowl on your face they could hear claret scratching at the door behind them basket claret basket cafferty growled this is the one part of the house thats out of bounds he told them then he lifted a bottle of bitter lemon from the fridge vodka and tonic siobhan said thats more like it cafferty grinned as he poured his hair was thin and spiky where hed rubbed it with the towel the robe capacious as it was barely stretched around him so that the tufts of gray hair on his chest were exposed i take it youve got zoning permission for this rebus asked gazing at the surroundings is that what youre reduced to zoning violations cafferty laughed and handed them their drinks nodding towards a table they sat down cheers he said raising his glass of whiskey good health rebus said his face set like stone cafferty swallowed a mouthful and exhaled so what brings you out at this time of night do you know anyone called montrose rebus asked swirling his own drink around the inside of the glass as in château montrose cafferty asked i wouldnt know its one of the better bordeaux reds cafferty explained but then youre not a wine man are you so you dont know anyone called montrose rebus asked again no i dont and its not a name youve used yourself as cafferty shook his head rebus produced a notebook and pen so you wouldnt mind writing it down im not so sure about that strawman i have to be careful of entrapment dont i just to compare to a handwriting sample you can make it a scrawl if you prefer rebus pushed the notebook and pen across the table cafferty looked at him then at siobhan maybe if you were to explain there was someone calling themselves montrose at the preview siobhan told him they signed the guest book ahh cafferty nodded well as i know damned fine it wasnt me he turned the notebook round opened it at a clean page and wrote the word montrose it looked nothing like the signature on the guest book want me to have another go cafferty didnt wait for an answer writing the name a further four times each one slightly different still none of them looked like the signature thank you rebus took the notebook back cafferty was about to pocket the pen until rebus reminded him that it wasnt his am i off the hook cafferty asked did you talk to a man at the party slightly taller than you maybe similar build brown sports jacket darkish hair cafferty seemed to ponder this claret had at last shut up maybe the bodyguard had dragged her off to her basket i dont remember he said at last maybe youre not really trying rebus said accusingly cafferty tutted and i was just about to offer you a spare pair of swimming trunks tell you what rebus said you jump in again and ill fetch the toaster from the kitchen cafferty looked at siobhan do you think he means it ds clarke hard to say with di rebus tell me mr cafferty you know ellen dempsey dont you weve had this conversation before i seem to remember maybe but back then i didnt know that shed worked for you in dundee worked for me a stint in a sauna siobhan explained she was thinking of what bain had told her about how caffertys tentacles might stretch as far as fife and dundee i think maybe you were the owner cafferty just shrugged in which case siobhan went on you might have come into contact with a local cid officer name of mccullough cafferty shrugged again when youre a businessman he told her a lot of palms seem to want crossing with silver care to expand cafferty chuckled and shook his head rebus shifted in his seat okay heres another one for you to try any chance you can account for your whereabouts this past weekend siobhan couldnt mask her surprise at the question the whole fortyeight hours cafferty asked if i put my mind to it but youd probably just be jealous try me rebus said cafferty sat back in his wicker chair saturday morning i testdrove a new car an aston martin im still thinking about it lunch here then a round of golf over at prestonfield evening i was at a party the neighbors two doors along lovely couple both lawyers that was me till around midnight sunday we took claret for a walk around blackford hill and the hermitage then i had to go to glasgow to lunch with an old friend i cant mention her name shes still married hubbies in brussels on business so we booked one of the rooms above the restaurant he winked at siobhan who was concentrating on her drink got back here about eight watched some telly joe had to wake me up around midnight and tell me to go to bed he offered a thoughtful smile i think i will buy that aston you know not much room for the weasel in the back rebus stated blithely that hardly matters as he no longer works for me had a fallingout siobhan couldnt help but be curious a business matter cafferty said the glass to his lips eyes staring above the rim and straight into rebuss care to tell us which loch we can expect to fish him out of rebus asked cafferty tutted again now youre definitely not getting that swim just as well rebus was putting down his glass getting to his feet id only go and pee in your pool id be disappointed if you didnt strawman cafferty rose as if to see them out but then called his bodyguards name buckley must have been standing right behind the door it opened immediately our visitors are leaving joe cafferty instructed rebus stood his ground a moment longer you havent asked why i was interested in your weekend so go ahead and tell me rebus shook his head slowly doesnt matter he said always playing your little games strawman cafferty chuckled as they left he was back at the bar throwing more ice into his glass outside bathed once more in halogen as they walked down the path siobhan had a question whats all this about last weekend not your problem it is if were working as a team since when have i been a team player siobhan i thought that was what tulliallan was for rebus just snorted opened the gate clarets a funny name for a brown and white spaniel he commented maybe its because too much of it gives you a bitch of a hangover he smiled with half his mouth maybe he echoed but she could tell he was thinking otherwise bit late to go dropping in on miss meikle isnt it siobhan said angling her watch towards the intruder lights you dont think shes a night owl cocoa and a bedside radio siobhan predicted when do i get to know what you were doing in your flat when we see miss meikle then lets go see her i was planning on doing just that jan meikle lived in the top half of a house conversion facing leith links siobhan liked the area when theyd turned an old bonded warehouse nearby into flats shed visited a couple of times and the only thing that had stopped her buying was the thought of moving all her stuff she was reminded of cynthia bessant edward marbers closest friend and the warehouse she lived in not more than a third of a mile from here would bessant have known if marber was thinking of a move to tuscany probably yet she hadnt said anything no doubt mindful of his good name she would probably have known he was wanting to take laura stafford with him too he confided in her trusted her it was a plan bessant would not have been able to agree with siobhan thought of sharing her ideas with rebus but didnt want him to think she was showing off he would ask her how she knew and shed have to shrug and tell him intuition hed smile at that and understand having relied on his own instincts many a time in the past no lights on he was saying but he pressed the buzzer anyway a face appeared at an upstairs window and siobhan waved shes in she said the next moment the intercom crackled into life yes di rebus and ds clarke rebus spoke into the grille theres one thing we forgot to ask earlier yes i need to show you something first can we come up im not dressed we wont be staying miss meikle two minutes will do it there was a pause then another crackle very well the tinny voice said the door buzzed to let them know the lock was off they walked into the reception hall then had to wait for jan meikle to unlock her door and lead them up a narrow flight of stairs she was wearing a baggy yellow jumper over gray leggings with her hair untied and falling in straggles either side of her face she seemed younger shed applied a layer of night cream making her cheeks and forehead glow the upstairs was cluttered meikle was obviously something of a collector herself rebus could imagine her spending long hours rummaging in junk shops and haunting garage sales buying eclectic pieces which appealed to her there was no particular style or period on display just masses of stuff rebus stubbed his toe on a plinth atop which sat a large carved bird of prey lighting was provided only by a series of wallmounted lamps throwing long shadows in odd directions its the bates motel rebus muttered to siobhan who had to stifle a snort of laughter as miss meikle turned towards her just admiring your collection she managed to say a few gewgaws meikle answered rebus and siobhan looked at one another each wondering if the other knew what the word meant the living room was three parts edwardian parlor to one part sixties kitsch and one part contemporary scandinavian siobhan recognized the sofa as ikea but was that a lava lamp sitting in the ornately tiled fireplace there was no carpet as such just eight or nine rugs of different sizes and designs causing bumps in the floor where they intersected rebus walked over to the window which had neither curtains nor shutters all he could see was the darkened expanse of the links a drunk meandering home hands in pockets stifflegged what is it you have to show me meikle was asking good question siobhan thought she too was keen to know rebus reached into his pocket and produced five photographs they were passportsized headandshoulders shots men unused to smiling were trying hard siobhan recognized them francis gray jazz mccullough allan ward stu sutherland tam barclay theyd been cut from larger sheets probably handed out at the start of the tulliallan course she knew now what rebus had been doing during the arden street stopover hed been busy with a pair of scissors rebus laid the five photos out on a round threelegged table the kind their ancestors might have played a hand of cards at there was a crystal fruit bowl there now sitting on a white lace doily but still room for the tiny photos miss meikle peered at them closely ever seen any of these men rebus was asking take your time meikle showed every sign of taking him at his word she studied each face as though this were an examination she must not only pass but score high marks in siobhan had lost interest in the room now she could see all of a sudden where rebus had been leading her how much of it hed known and how much was intuitive she couldnt say but hed obviously felt for some time that the crew from tulliallan were somehow connected to edward marbers murder and she got the feeling it went further than mccullough and ellen dempsey rebus had hinted as much mccullough and dempsey werent bonnie and clyde so there had to be some other explanation he was at the gallery that night miss meikle stated she was touching the edge of one of the photos brown jacket rebus guessed im not sure what he was wearing but i remember his face he spent most of the time looking at the paintings he had this smile on his face but i got the feeling he didnt really like any of them he definitely wasnt going to be buying siobhan leaned closer it was di francis gray similar in build and hairstyle to big ger cafferty but taller gray had managed more of a smile for the camera than his colleagues pretending he hadnt a care in the world siobhan looked at rebus the look on his face was one of grim satisfaction thank you miss meikle he said beginning to gather up the photos wait she ordered then she pointed to jazz mccullough hes been to the gallery too a very pleasant gentleman i remember him well when did you last see him she considered his question with the same amount of care shed given to the photographs probably a year ago around the time mr montrose was selling his collection rebus guessed im not sure i suppose yes it would have been around the same time mccullough is montrose siobhan said when they got back outside montrose is all three of them three gray mccullough ward he paused though how much ward has had to do with any of it im not sure the money from bernie johns bought all those paintings rebus nodded hellish hard to prove it though and gray killed marber rebus shook his head that wasnt grays job all he had to do was keep an eye on marber see what his plans were after the show when marber said he needed a taxi gray called one for him making sure it was an mg cab rebus nodded then all ellen dempsey had to do was dispatch one of her drivers and let someone else know marber was on his way home siobhan had it now mccullough was waiting for him yes jazz mccullough rebus tried to visualize it marber at the front door jazz calling to him marber recognizing both face and voice relaxing maybe hed been expecting a visit because jazz had some money for him what had mccullough used a rock an implement of some kind he would have got rid of it afterwards knowing how to dispose of a weapon in such a way that it would very likely never be found but before that he had taken marbers keys unlocked the door and turned off the alarm long enough to take the vettriano a matter of principle with him where do we begin siobhan was asking ive always favored the direct approach she wasnt sure she agreed but she got in the car anyway at quarter to midnight francis gray got a call on his mobile he was in the bar at the police college his tie was off the top two buttons of his shirt undone and he was smoking he still had the cigarette in his mouth when he walked along the corridor and climbed the single flight of stairs to the mockup courtroom this was where fledgling officers learned how to present evidence and deal with hostile questions it was scaled down but correct in every detail rebus was sitting alone on the public benches bit melodramatic john you could have come and had a drink i tend not to mix with murderers if i can avoid it jesus not back to all that again gray turned as if to leave i dont mean dickie diamond rebus said coldly the door opened and jazz mccullough came in not sleeping over at north queensferry tonight rebus asked him no mccullough had the look of a man whod been roused from bed dressing quickly he walked over to the desk beneath which sat the rooms recording apparatus controls for video cameras and microphones none of its switched on rebus assured him nobody hiding under the benches mccullough said gray bent down to look clean he reported youre smoking again francis rebus noticed its all the stress gray answered are you here to divvy up your little drug heist with us wasnt me rebus paused dont worry i dont think it was you now either well thats a relief mccullough was doing a circuit of the room as though unconvinced that rebus didnt possess backup of some kind youve got bigger things to worry about jazz rebus informed him john here gray explained has another murder he wants to accuse us of youre a singleminded little bastard arent you mccullough said i like to think so i find it gets results rebus was sitting very still hands on knees tell me john mccullough was close to him now stopped three feet in front of him how many times have you stretched the truth a little in a place like this his eyes surveyed the courtroom a few rebus admitted mccullough nodded ever gone further fabricated a case to put away someone you knew was guilty of something else no comment mccullough smiled rebus gazed at him you killed edward marber he stated quietly gray snorted the accusations just get wilder and wilder rebus turned to him you were at the preview francis it was you who phoned marber the cab that way ellen dempsey could let jazz here know it was on its way ive got witnesses who can identify you the call to mg cabs will be listed on your phone account maybe that squiggle you used when you signed the guest book can be identified amazing what these handwriting experts can do juries love all that stuff maybe i needed a taxi for myself gray speculated but you signed yourself montrose and that was a mistake because i have all the records of mr montroses various purchases and sales a third of a million at the last count what happened to the rest of bernie johnss millions gray snorted again there werent any millions i think youve said enough francis mccullough warned i dont think johns in any position to im just here to piece it together for my own satisfaction from what francis has just said im presuming bernie johns didnt have as much salted away as expected so much for the mythical millions there was enough to give you an initial lump sum not enough to arouse suspicion rebuss eyes met mcculloughs did you use your share to help ellen dempsey set herself up in edinburgh no other way she could have gone from two cars to a fleet had to be some kind of down payment he turned to gray what about you francis a new car every year gray said nothing and the rest you invested in modern art whose idea was that neither man spoke rebus kept his eyes on mccullough had to be yours jazz how about this as a theory marber happened to be in that sauna in dundee the night you raided it i reckon if i dug deep enough into the records his name might pop up heres another theory bernie johnss stash was hidden in or near the town of montrose nice little joke there he paused how am i doing youre not in a position to threaten us john mccullough said quietly hed lowered himself onto one of the other benches gray had hefted himself onto the table used by the prosecuting counsel and was swinging his legs looking desperate for his feet to connect with rebuss face diamond told us all about you gray snarled the manse rapist how rico lomax had hidden him away at the caravan but by the time you got there it was too late hed scrammed so you took it out on lomax and told diamond to vanish you didnt want to help those two cops when they came to edinburgh looking for diamond gray laughed if we solved the lomax case it was your name wed have in the frame he told you all that and you still killed him bastard drew a gun on me gray complained i was just trying to stop him shooting the pair of us it was an accident john mccullough drawled not something that can be said of rico lomaxs fate i didnt kill rico lomax mccullough smiled benignly and we didnt kill edward marber you talk a good game john but im not seeing any evidence so what if you can place francis at the party so what if he did phone mg cabs marber wanted money from you didnt he rebus persisted hed already had his cut bought that painting with it but now youd sold all your paintings and taken your money elsewhere he broke off realizing that marber had concocted his scheme because of the way he himself felt he was being squeezed by malcolm neilson what was the plan keep it invested quietly till you and francis reached retirement thats less than a year away ward still young enough to enjoy his share problem was mccullough said picking a thread from his trousers we got greedy decided to play the stock market new technologies rebus saw grays face sag you lost the lot he guessed now he knew why theyd been so keen on the idea of the heist and something else bothered to tell allan yet nobody said anything and rebus had his answer we cant prove mccullough said at last that you killed rico lomax but that neednt stop us circulating the story just as you cant prove any connection between us and edward marber so where does that leave us gray asked mccullough locked eyes with rebus and shrugged his response i think some tombs are best left undisturbed he said in the same quiet voice rebus knew what he was referring to resurrection dont you john what do you say do we call it a draw rebus took a deep breath then checked his watch i have to make a call gray and mccullough were like statues as he pushed the buttons siobhan its me he watched some of the tension leave either man out in five rebus ended the call mccullough patted his hands together in muffled applause shes waiting for you in the car he guessed an insurance policy if i dont walk out of here rebus acknowledged she runs straight to the chief constable if we were chess players wed be shaking hands right now happy to share a result but were not rebus stated im a cop and youve killed two men he stood up started to walk out see you in court he said he closed the door after him but didnt make straight for the car he walked briskly along the corridor punching siobhans number back into his phone i might need a couple more minutes he warned her turning into the accommodation block he thumped hard on one of the doors eyes darting back along the corridor in case either mccullough or gray was following the door opened a crack and a pair of eyes slitted against the light appeared what the fuck do you want allan ward asked his voice dry and rasping rebus pushed him into the room closed the door behind them we need to talk he said or rather i need to talk you need to listen get the hell out of here rebus shook his head your pals have blown the money he said wards eyes opened a fraction wider look i dont know what you think youre trying to pull have they told you about marber i dont suppose they have shows how much they trust you allan who was it asked you to pump phyllida hawes for information was it jazz did he say it was because hes been slipping one to ellen dempsey rebus shook his head slowly he killed marber marbers the dealer who bought and sold all those paintings for you building the investment only jazz decided you could make faster money playing the market im sorry to be the one to tell you allan but the whole lots gone fuck off but some of the force had left wards voice marber decided he wanted another cut and they didnt have the money to pay him they were worried hed blab so they killed him and whether you like it or not youre implicated ward looked at him unblinking then sat down on his unmade bed he was dressed in a travis tshirt and boxer shorts he rubbed both hands through his hair i dont know what they told you about the plan at the warehouse rebus went on maybe they said it would be easy money but they needed it because in under a year from now when they started taking retirement you were going to find out that there were no shares to divvy out you could put all those dreams of yours on hold ward started shaking his head no he said no no no rebus opened the door an inch talk to them allan theyll lie to you ask to see the money he nodded slowly ask to see it and look into their eyes when you do theres no money allan just a couple of corpses and some cops gone very very bad he opened the door wider but paused again on the threshold you want to talk to me youve got my number he walked outside expecting at any second to be grabbed stabbed or bludgeoned saw that siobhan was still in the car and felt the first wave of relief she slid over from the drivers seat to the passenger side and he opened the door and got in behind the wheel so she asked still sounding frustrated that shed been left out he shrugged i dont know he said i suppose all we can do now is wait and see he turned the ignition you mean see if they try to kill us too we write up everything we know every step weve just taken copies to be kept in safe places tonight she frowned has to be rebus said sliding the gearshift into first your place or mine mine she sighed and you can keep me awake on the drive by telling me a story what kind would you like the kind where you walk into tulliallan leaving me outside in the cold he smiled you mean a courtroom drama then so be it tuesday morning morris gerald cafferty was enjoying breakfast at his kitchen table feeding pieces of glistening sausage to an attentive claret rebus sat opposite him nursing his second glass of orange juice hed managed four hours sleep on siobhans sofa tiptoeing out without waking her at quarter to seven he was at tulliallan and now just over an hour later he was having to endure the smell of caffertys fryup a bustling middleaged woman had cooked it and rebus refusing the offer of a helping looked ready to start on the washingup until cafferty told her to come back later see if you can hoover some of clarets hair off the sofa will you mrs prentice cafferty asked she nodded brusquely and left them alone you dont get many like mrs prentice to the pound cafferty commented biting into a crisp halfslice of toast bring your trunks this time strawman i know it was you that hit the warehouse weasel told you about it didnt he rebus had worked it out claverhouse hadnt just stumbled on the lorry hed been pointed in its direction by the weasel the man shopping his own son because otherwise alys life would have been short indeed but having delivered him into police custody hed realized that cafferty would still want blood when he found out rebus had offered shortterm deliverance but in the end there was only one way to save aly take cafferty out of the picture which meant setting him up telling him about the drugs in the hope that he would be tempted but cafferty had plotted the hit without telling the weasel and the weasels hint to rebus that night in the tenement garden hadnt clicked quite hard enough the weasel had been left out of the loop and the heist had succeeded leaving him rather than his son as the wanted man cafferty was shaking his head dont you ever rest for a second what about some coffee to go with that juice i even know how you did it cafferty dropped another chunk of sausage into clarets mouth i need a favor rebus continued he took out his notebook and wrote down an address tearing out the page and sliding it across the table if some of the merchandise found its way here you might find the heat dissipating a bit i didnt know there was any heat cafferty said with a smile rebus lifted his glass want me to tell you something i know about claret the wine or the dog both i suppose you can tell their quality by their good nose when i saw your dog last night nosing its way up and down the path and across the lawn i knew rebuss eyes shifted from claret to her owner shes a sniffer dog isnt she caffertys smile broadened and he leaned down to pat clarets side customs and excise pensioned her off i dont like my staff doing drugs so i thought she might come in handy rebus nodded he remembered the video footage the van going into the warehouse then a wait as they realized they didnt know where the consignment was a quick call and claret had been driven there in another van a few minutes later it was mission accomplished you didnt have time to steal another van rebus said so im guessing you used one of your own thats why you blacked out the license plate cafferty waved his fork at him as it happens one of my vans was stolen saturday night found it burnt out in wester hailes there was silence between them for a moment then cafferty sniffed and slid the piece of notepaper closer to himself reading it upside down another favor eh his eyes gleamed made any progress on the rico lomax case strawman news travels it does in this city rebus thought back six years dickie diamond telling him that the manse rapist was holed up in lomaxs caravan rebus getting there too late at the end of his tether hed torched the caravan and paid a visit to barlinnie not to ask cafferty a favor but merely to tell him the story hoping caffertys contacts would succeed where he had failed but that hadnt happened instead his men had attacked rico lomax beating him mercilessly and leaving him to die which hadnt been rebuss plan at all not that cafferty had believed him when rebus had returned to barlinnie to rage at him cafferty had laughed sitting with arms folded we should be careful what we wish for strawman the words ringing in rebuss ears all down the years the lomax case is closed he stated now cafferty lifted the address folded it into the pocket of his clean white shirt funny the way things sometimes turn out he said and is the weasel busy laughing as we speak rebus asked hes history cafferty said brushing toast crumbs from his fingers think his son could have come up with a scheme like that weasel was about to make a move on me then he got cold feet shopped aly cafferty made sure there were no crumbs on his shirtfront or trousers then dabbed his mouth with a cotton napkin he looked at rebus and sighed always nice to do business with you strawman rebus stood up fearing at first that his legs might not support him his whole body felt like it was turning to dust the dull sensation of ashes in his mouth ive made a pact with the devil he thought as his hands gripped the edge of the breakfast table resurrection would come only to those who deserved it rebus knew he was not among them he could find a church and pray all he liked or offer up his confession to strathern neither would make a jot of difference this was how the jobs got done with a tainted conscience guilty deals and complicity with grubby motives and a spirit grown corrupt his steps were so shallow as he walked towards the door he could have been wearing shackles ill be seeing you in court one of these days cafferty he said his words failing to have any effect it was as though cafferty had ceased to see him his annihilation complete one of these days he repeated under his breath hoping to god that he meant it allan ward woke up late that morning he was making his way to the dining room when stu sutherland looking sprightly as the course neared its end told him there was a mysterious envelope waiting for him at reception ward passed the dining room and opened the connecting door to the original baronialstyle building where a uniformed receptionist handed him a thick legalsized packet he opened it in front of her knew at once what it was a typed report of rebuss findings deciding to skip breakfast for once allan ward headed back to his room he had some reading to do rebus spent the morning at st leonards where nothing was happening siobhan had argued that they should talk to gill templer persuade her to at least get malcolm neilson out on bail just a bit longer rebus told her shaking his head why i want to see what allan ward will do he got his answer at midday when about to pop out for some lunch his mobile sounded caller id allan ward hello there allan rebus said had a chance to speak to your mates ive been too busy reading there was a lot of background noise ward was in his car and and i dont think ive really got anything to say to them its you i want to talk to on the record if you like do you want to come here where are you st leonards no not there how about somewhere else i want to get everything straight first talk it through with you would your flat be all right im just west of the city ill have the beers waiting better make it soft drinks only ive got a lot of talking to do want to make sure it comes out right the irnbrus are on me rebus said ending the call he didnt see siobhan maybe shed headed out to lunch already or was networking with the uniforms in the toilets there was no sign of derek linford either word was with the case wrapped up hed hightailed it back to hq to keep tabs on the future of his onetime mentor davie hynds had sidled up to rebus earlier complaining that he felt siobhan was freezing him out get used to it rebus had advised coldly thats the kind of cop she is i begin to see where she gets it from hynds had muttered rebus stopped at a corner shop bought six cans of irnbru and four of fanta tuna mayonnaise roll for himself he took two bites of it as he drove but realized he wasnt hungry he thought of siobhan more and more she reminded him of himself he wasnt sure it was necessarily a good thing but was glad of it all the same there was a parking space outside his tenement the rest of the day was going to be good to him red cone on the pavement which might mean they were going to start laying cables or something the council always seemed to be digging up marchmont he was just about to close his driversside door when feet shuffled up behind him you got here quick allan wards voice said you too he had his head half turned saw that ward had brought some friends with him next thing the doors to the saab were open again and he was being bundled into the back a knife pressing into his side with enough force to let him know francis gray wouldnt need much of an excuse to use it now the cone made sense theyd used it to keep the parking bay free until he arrived which didnt exactly help the situation any the car was reversing at speed mccullough turning the steering wheel hard allan ward was in the front beside him leaving rebus in the back with francis gray it was an evillooking knife with a long black handle and a shining serrated edge christmas present francis rebus asked i could kill you now save us some fucking hassle gray spat showing his teeth a dull throb of pain told rebus that the tip of the knife had already pierced his skin when he dabbed with a finger he found a large droplet of blood shock and adrenaline were doing their work otherwise hed be feeling it more than he was made your peace then allan he called out ward didnt reply this is insane you must know that it doesnt matter anymore john mccullough said softly hasnt that struck home yet francis has tried making the point he caught mcculloughs eyes in the mirror they seemed to be smiling where are we heading if this was glasgow gray answered wed be going for what we call a short walk in the campsies rebus took his meaning the campsie fells was a hill range outside the city im sure we can find a suitable spot somewhere on edinburghs equivalent mccullough added somewhere a shallow grave wont be disturbed youve got to get me there first rebus said he knew theyd be heading south out of the city making for the wild expanse of the pentland hills alive or dead makes no odds to me gray hissed that go for you too allan rebus asked thisll be the first killing youve actually participated in got to break your cherry sometime i suppose gray was holding the knife at stomach level so it wouldnt be seen from passing cars rebus doubted there was any way he could escape from the saab without gray doing him some serious damage before he got out there was a mad gleam to the mans eyes maybe that was what mccullough had meant it didnt matter anymore theyd crossed the line permanently with rebus out of the way suspicion would fall on them but still with no concrete proof theyd done anything strathern and his colleagues had suspected them for years and nothing had come of it maybe they really believed they could take rebus out of the game with impunity and maybe they were right i had a wee look at the notes you sent allan mccullough was saying as though following rebuss train of thought i dont see that youve got much of a case then why take the risk of killing me because itll be fun gray replied for you maybe rebus told him but i still dont see what jazz and allan get out of it except that it binds you all together makes sure one of you can never rat out the others he was staring at the back of allan wards head willing him to turn round make eye contact finally ward did turn but only to speak to gray do me a favor will you francis kill him now so we dont have to listen to any more of his squawking gray chuckled nice to have friends eh rebus speaking of which maybe itll be your pal ds clarke next three murders four stops making any difference after a while i know whos got the stuff from the warehouse rebus said holding his side as the pain increased we could take it from him who mccullough asked big ger cafferty gray snorted i like this game better rebus looked at him the one where you end up no better off but with a few corpses littered across your conscience bingo gray said with a grin theyd left marchmont and mayfield behind a few more minutes and theyd be within reach of the pentlands i seem to remember theres a pub car park with a golf course behind it mccullough was saying rebus looked out at the weather rain had started falling about an hour ago and was turning heavy probably pretty quiet this time of year lots of people go walking there not so unusual to see four men out for a hike in suits in the rain mccullough stared at him in the mirror if it isnt quiet enough well go someplace else he paused but thanks for your concern gray let out a cold chuckle shoulders shaking rebus was running out of ploys it was hard to think beyond the pain in his side his whole palm was damp with blood now hed taken a handkerchief out but the blood had seeped through its folded layers too a nice slow death gray assured him rebus leaned back against the headrest this is ridiculous he thought any second now ill be unconscious there was sweat on the back of his neck but his arms felt icy his knees ached too there never had been enough room for passengers in the back of the saab could you slide your chair forward he asked ward fuck you ward replied not turning round could be his last request gray commented after a minute or two ward found the lever and suddenly rebus had a few more inches in which to stretch his legs then he drifted away this is the place mccullough was signaling making a hard turn into a gravel car park rebus knew the pub hed brought jean here the place got busy at weekends but this was a midweek afternoon with rain falling the car park was deserted thought wed lost you there gray said pushing his face close to rebuss mccullough was directing them to a spot at the far corner of the car park next to a grassy slope a public footpath wound its way around the playing area of the golf course and up into the hills theyd walked off their lunch jean and him until the climb had started making them breathless and theyd turned to start their descent it was only as ward was climbing out that rebus noticed he was carrying something it was a small spade folded into two or three rebus had seen them in camping shops maybe the same sort of place which had furnished gray with the hunting knife going to take a while to dig a hole big enough for me rebus said to no one in particular he made to slap his stomach but found his shirtfront sticky with blood gray had taken off his own jacket and was wrapping it around rebus dont want people to see you in that state he said rebus felt ready to agree then they were out of the car hands grabbing his arms to help him up the slope pain seared down his side with every step he took how far ward was asking need to get off the beaten track mccullough advised he was looking around to ensure they were alone rebuss blurred vision told him they were quite quite alone here drink this someone was tipping a hip flask into his mouth whiskey rebus swallowed but mccullough wanted him to drink more come on john finish it off eases the aches and pains yes rebus thought and makes me even easier to deal with but he swallowed anyway coughing some of it down his shirt more dribbling from his nose his eyes were growing so tearful nothing was staying in focus they were having to hold him upright now almost dragging him one of his shoes came off and ward stooped to pick it up carrying it with him one shoe off and one shoe on diddlediddledumpling my son john could he really remember his mother reading out nursery rhymes at his bedside the rain was dripping down from his hair stinging his eyes running down into his shirtfront cold cold rain dozens of songs about rain hundreds he couldnt recall a single one what were you doing at tulliallan john mccullough was asking i threw a mug of tea no that was just your story someone put you there to spy on us didnt they is that why you broke into my flat rebus took a deep painful breath didnt find anything did you you were too good for us john who was it put you up to it rebus shook his head slowly you want to take it to the grave thats fine but just remember it was no accident they had us working the lomax case so dont think you owe them anything i know rebus said hed already worked it out there must have been something in the files something pointing to his involvement in the murder of rico lomax the disappearance of dickie diamond gray had said it himself tennant always used the same case a murder in rosyth solved years back there had to be some reason for the use of the lomax case and rebus was that reason the high hiedyins had nothing to lose after all and at best theyd be killing two birds with one stone rebus might solve his puzzle the wild bunch might solve theirs how much farther he could hear ward complaining thisll do mccullough said allan rebus spluttered i feel really sorry for you dont ward snapped back hed taken the spade from its plastic sleeve and was straightening it out tightening the connecting nuts who wants to start he asked i wish you could have been spared this allan rebus persisted youre a lazy bastard sometimes allan gray snarled correction im a lazy bastard all the time ward grinned and handed the spade to gray who snatched hold of it give me the knife ward said gray gave it to him rebus noticed that it looked clean either gray had wiped it on rebuss shirt or else the rain had washed his blood away gray pushed the spade into the earth and pressed down with his foot next thing the knife was sticking out of his neck embedded in the top of his spine gray gave a highpitched squeal and brought a suddenly shaking hand around to find the knife but all he did was flap at its handle before dropping to his knees ward had picked up the spade and was swinging it at mccullough lost my cherry now eh jazz he was yelling you cheating bastard rebus was working hard at staying upright watching it all happen in a hazy slow motion realizing that allan ward had been brooding and stewing these past hours the spade was slicing into mcculloughs cheek bringing with it a spume of blood mccullough staggered backwards stumbling and falling gray had keeled over onto his side and was shuddering like a wasp hit with a blast of insecticide allan for christs sake blood gurgled in mcculloughs mouth it was always you two against me ward was explaining voice shaking there were flecks of white at the corners of his mouth right down the line kept you out of it to protect you like hell you did ward raised the spade again towering over mccullough but rebus standing next to the young man now placed a hand on his arm enough allan no need to take it further ward paused then blinked and his shoulders dropped call it in he said quietly rebus nodded he already had the phone in his hand when did you decide he asked pushing the buttons decide what to let me live ward looked at him five ten minutes ago rebus raised the phone to his ear thanks he said allan ward slumped down onto the wet grass rebus felt like joining him maybe laying down and going back to sleep in a minute he told himself in a minute with allan wards confession there was no real necessity for the kilo of heroin which claverhouse recipient of an anonymous tipoff found in jazz mcculloughs rented flat but rebus hadnt known that at the time as it was the fact that the heroin came from the stolen consignment meant that claverhouse might salvage something of his career at the sdea though demotion remained a near cert rebus was curious to find out how claverhouse would cope serving under ormiston for so long his junior rebus required a blood transfusion and seven stitches as the blood from the anonymous donors dripped into him rebus felt he should repay them in some way for his gift of renewed life he wondered who they were adulterers misfits christians racists it was the deed that mattered not the individual he was up and about soon afterwards rain was still falling on the city on the route to the cemetery rebuss taxi driver commented that it seemed it would never stop and sometimes i dont want it to he admitted makes everything smell clean doesnt it rebus agreed that it did he told the driver to keep the meter running hed be only five minutes the newest headstones were closest to the gate dickie diamonds was no longer the latest addition rebus didnt feel bad that hed missed the funeral he had no flowers for the diamond dog even though he was carrying a small posy he didnt think dickie would mind farther into the cemetery were the older graves some well tended others seemingly forgotten louise hodds husband was still alive though no longer a church of scotland minister hed gone to pieces after her rape and suicide picking himself up again only slowly there were fresh flowers by her headstone to which rebus added his posy staying on his knees for a minute it was as close as he came these days to prayer hed memorized the inscription her dates of birth and death her maiden name had been fielding six years since she took her life six years since rico lomax had died as a kind of retribution her attacker michael veitch was dead also stabbed in jail by someone whod known nothing of this particular crime no one had planned it or asked for it to happen but it had happened anyway a complete and utter waste rebus could feel his stitches tingling reminding him that he was still alive all because allan ward had changed his mind he rose to his feet again brushing the earth from his trousers and hands sometimes that was all it took to effect a kind of resurrection maybe allan ward plenty of jail time ahead of him for contemplation would come to realize that then why are you here andrea thomson pressed her hands together resting her chin on her fingertips for this meeting she had borrowed an office at fettes hq it was the same office she always used when there were officers in edinburgh with a need for counseling is it because you feel cheated of some sort of victory did i say that i felt it was what you were trying to say did i misunderstand i dont know i used to think policing was about upholding the law all that stuff they taught you at tulliallan and now thomson had picked up her pen but only as a prop she didnt write anything down until after the sessions now a shrug im not sure those laws necessarily work even when you achieve a successful result is that whats been achieved you solved the case didnt you an innocent man has been released from custody doesnt sound like a bad result to me maybe not is it the means of achieving the end you think thats where the systems at fault maybe the fault lies with me maybe im just not cut out to to what another shrug play the game perhaps thomson studied her pen youve seen someone die its bound to have affected you only because i let it because youre human i dont know where any of this is going siobhan said with a shake of her head no ones blaming you ds clarke quite the reverse and i dont deserve it we all get things we feel we dont deserve thomson said with a smile most of us treat them as windfalls your career so far has been a success is that the problem perhaps you dont want that easy success you want to be an outsider someone who breaks the rules with only a measure of impunity she paused maybe you want to be like di rebus im well aware that theres not the room for more than one of him but all the same siobhan thought about it but ended up offering only a shrug so tell me what you like about the job andrea thomson leaned forward in her chair trying to appear genuinely interested siobhan shrugged again thomson looked disappointed what about outside work are there any keen interests you have siobhan thought for a long time music chocolate football drink she looked at her watch with any luck ill have time to indulge in at least three of them after this thomsons professional smile faded perceptibly i also like long drives and homedelivery pizza siobhan added warming to the subject what about relationships thomson asked what about them is there some special relationship youre in just now only with the job ms thomson and im not absolutely sure it loves me anymore what do you plan to do about that ds clarke i dont know maybe i could take it to bed with me and feed it cadburys whole nut thats always worked for me in the past when thomson looked up from her cheap blue pen she saw that siobhan was grinning i think thats probably enough for today the counselor said probably siobhan said getting to her feet and thank you i feel heaps better and i feel like a large bar of chocolate andrea thomson said the canteen should still be open thomson put her unblemished legal pad into her bag then what are we waiting for she asked about the author ian rankin is the author of more than eighteen books he is an edgar award nominee and the recipient of both a
