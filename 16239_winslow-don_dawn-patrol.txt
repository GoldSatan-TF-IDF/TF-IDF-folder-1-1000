dawn patrol don winslow the marine layer wraps a soft silver blanket over the coast the sun is just coming over the hills to the east and pacific beach is still asleep the ocean is a color that is not quite blue not quite green not quite black but something somewhere between all three out on the line boone daniels straddles his old longboard like a cowboy on his pony hes on the dawn patrol the girls look like ghosts coming out of the earlymorning mist their silver forms emerge from a thin line of trees as the girls pad through the wet grass that edges the field the dampness muffles their footsteps so they approach silently and the mist that wraps around their legs makes them look as if theyre floating like spirits who died as children there are eight of them and they are children the oldest is fourteen the youngest ten they walk toward the waiting men in unconscious lockstep the men bend over the mist like giants over clouds peering down into their universe but the men arent giants theyre workers and their universe is the seemingly endless strawberry field that they do not rule but that rules them theyre glad for the cool mistit will burn off soon enough and leave them to the suns indifferent mercy the men are stoop laborers bent at the waist for hours at a time tending to the plants theyve made the dangerous odyssey up from mexico to work in these fields to send money back to their families south of the border they live in primitive camps of corrugated tin shacks jerryrigged tents and leantos hidden deep in the narrow canyons above the fields there are no women in the camps and the men are lonely now they look up to sneak guilty glances at the wraithlike girls coming out of the mist glances of need even though many of these men are fathers with daughters the ages of these girls between the edge of the field and the banks of the river stands a thick bed of reeds into which the men have hacked little dugouts almost caves now some of the men go into the reeds and pray that the dawn will not come too soon or burn too brightly and expose their shame to the eyes of god its dawn at the crest motel too sunrise isnt a sight that a lot of the residents see unless its from the other sideunless theyre just going to bed instead of just getting up only two people are awake now and neither of them is the desk clerk whos catching forty in the office his butt settled into the chair his feet propped on the counter doesnt matter even if he were awake he couldnt see the little balcony of room where the woman is going over the railing her nightgown flutters above her an inadequate parachute she misses the pool by a couple of feet and her body lands on the concrete with a dull thump not loud enough to wake anyone up the guy who tossed her looks down just long enough to make sure shes dead he sees her neck at the funny angle like a broken doll watches her blood black in the faint light spread toward the pool water seeking water epic macking crunchy thats how hang twelve describes the imminent big swell to boone daniels who actually understands what hang twelve is saying because boone speaks fluent surfbonics indeed off to boones right just to the south waves are smacking the pilings beneath crystal pier the ocean feels heavy swollen pregnant with promise the dawn patrolboone hang twelve dave the love god johnny banzai high tide and sunny daysits out there on the line talking while they wait for the next set to come in they all wear black winter wet suits that cover them from their wrists to their ankles because the earlymorning water is cold especially now that its stirred up by the approaching storm this mornings interstitial conversation revolves around the big swell a onceeverytwentyyears burgeoning of the surf now rolling toward the san diego coast like an outofcontrol freight train its due in two days and with it the gray winter sky some rain and the biggest waves that any of the dawn patrol have seen in their adult lives its going to be as hang twelve puts it epic macking crunchy which roughly translated from surfbonics is a term of approbation its going to be good boone knows they might even see twentyfoot peaks coming in every thirty seconds or so double overheads tubes like tunnels real thunder crushers that could easily take you over the falls and dump you into the washing machine only the best surfers need apply boone qualifies while its an exaggeration to say that boone could surf before he could walk its the dead flat truth that he could surf before he could run boone is the ultimate lociehe was conceived on the beach born half a mile away and raised three blocks from where the surf breaks at high tide his dad surfed his mom surfedhence the conceptual session on the sand in fact his mom surfed well into the sixth month of her pregnancy so maybe it isnt an exaggeration to say that boone could surf before he could walk so boones been a waterman all his life and then some the ocean is his backyard his haven his playground his refuge his church he goes into the ocean to get well to get clean to remind himself that life is a ride boone believes that a wave is gods tangible message that all the great things in life are free boone gets free every day usually two or three times a day but always always out on the dawn patrol boone daniels lives to surf he doesnt want to talk about the big swell right now because talking about it might jinx it cause the swell to lie down and die into the deep recesses of the north pacific so even though hang twelve is looking at him with his usual expression of unabashed hero worship boone changes the subject to an old standard out on the pacific beach dawn patrol line the list of things that are good they started the list of things that are good about fifteen years ago back when they were in high school when boone and daves social studies teacher challenged them to get their priorities straight the list is flexibleitems are added or deleted the rankings change but the current list of things that are good would read as follows if that is it were written down which it isnt double overheads reef break the tube girls who will sit on the beach and watch you ride double overheads reef break and the tube inspiring sunnys remark that girls watchwomen ride free stuff longboards anything made by oneill allfemale outrigger canoe teams fish tacos big wednesday i propose boone says to the line at large moving fish tacos over allfemale outrigger canoe teams from ninth to eighth johnny banzai asks his broad generally serious face breaking into a smile johnny banzais real name isnt banzai of course its kodani but if youre a japaneseamerican and a seriously radical nosefirst ballsout hardcharging surfer youre just going to get glossed either kamikaze or banzai you just are but as boone and dave the love god decided that johnny is just too rational to be suicidal they decided on banzai when johnny banzai isnt banzaiing hes a homicide detective with the san diego police department and boone knows that he welcomes the opportunity to argue about things that arent grim so hes on it basically flipflopping them johnny banzai asks based on what deep thought and careful consideration boone replies hang twelve is shocked the young soul surfer stares at boone with a look of hurt innocence his wet goatee dropping to the black neoprene of his winter wet suit his light brown dreadlocks falling on his shoulder as he cocks his head but booneallfemale outrigger canoe teams hang twelve loves the women of the allfemale outrigger canoe teams whenever they paddle by he just sits on his board and stares listen boone says most of those women play for the other team what other team hang twelve asks hes so young johnny observes and as usual his observation is accurate hang twelve is a dozen years younger than the rest of the dawn patrol they tolerate him because hes such an enthusiastic surfer and sort of boones puppy plus he gives them the locals discount at the surf shop he works at what other team hang twelve asks urgently sunny day leans over her board and whispers to him sunny looks just like her name her blond hair glows like sunshine a force of naturetall longleggedsunny is exactly what brian wilson meant when he wrote that he wished they all could be california girls except that brians dream girl usually sat on the beach whereas sunny surfs shes the best surfer on the dawn patrol better than boone and the coming big swell could lift her from waitress to fulltime professional surfer one good photo of sunny shredding a big wave could get her a sponsorship from one of the major surfclothing companies and then therell be no stopping her now she takes it upon herself to explain to hang twelve that most of the females on the allfemale outrigger canoe teams are rigged out for females hang twelve lets out a devastated groan you just ripped a boys dreams boone tells sunny not necessarily dave the love god says with a smug smile dont even start sunny says is it my bad dave asks that women love me its not really dave the love god has a face and physique that would have caused a run on marble in ancient greece but its not even so much daves body that gets him sex as it is his confidence dave is confident that hes going to get laid and hes in a profession that puts him in a perfect position to have a shot at every snowzone turista who comes to san diego to get tanned hes a lifeguard and this is how he got his moniker because johnny banzai who completes the new york times crossword in ink said youre not a life guard youre a love god get it yeah the whole dawn patrol got it because they have all seen dave the love guard crawl up to his lifeguard tower while guzzling handfuls of vitamin e to replace the depletion from the night before and get ready for the night ahead they actually give me binoculars he marveled to boone one day with the explicit expectation that i will use them to look at scantily clad women and some people say theres no god so if any hominid with a package could get an allfemale outrigger canoe team member or several of them to issue a gender exemption for a night or two it would be dave and judging by the selfsatisfied lascivious smile on his grille right now he probably has hang twelve is still not convinced yeah but fish tacos it depends on the kind of fish in the taco says high tide nй josiah pamavatuu weighing in on the subject literally weighing in because the samoan crashes the scales at well over three and a half bills hence the tag high tide because the ocean level rises anytime he gets in the water so high tides opinion on food commands respect because he obviously knows what hes talking about the whole crew is aware that your pacific island types know their fish are you talking about yellowtail ono opah mahimahi shark or what it makes a difference rankingwise everything boone says tastes better on a tortilla this is an article of faith with boone hes lived his life with it and believes it to be true you take anythingfish chicken beef cheese eggs even peanut butter and jellyand fold them in the motherly embrace of a warm flour tortilla and all those foods respond to the love by upping their game everything does taste better on a tortilla outside high tide yells boone looks over his shoulder to see the first wave of what looks to be a tasty set coming in party wave hollers dave the love god and he high tide johnny and hang twelve get on it sharing the ride into shore boone and sunny hang back for the second wave which is a little bigger a little fuller and has a better shape your wave boone yells to her chivalrous or patronizing you decide sunny yells back but she paddles in boone gets on the wave right behind her and they ride the shoulder in together a skillful pas de deux on the white water boone and sunny walk up onto the beach because the morning session is over and the dawn patrol is coming in this is because with the exception of boone they all have real jobs so johnnys already stepping out of the outdoor shower and sitting in the front seat of his car putting on his detective clothesblue shirt brown tweed jacket khaki slackswhen his cell phone goes off johnny listens to the call then says a woman took a header off a motel balcony another day in paradise i dont miss that boone says and it doesnt miss you johnny replies this is true when boone pulled the pin at sdpd his lieutenants only regret was that it hadnt been attached to a grenade despite his remark johnny disagreesboone was a good cop a very good cop it was a shame what happened but now boone is following high tides eyes back out to the ocean at which the big man is gazing with an almost reverential intensity its coming high tide says the swell big boone asks not big says high tide huge a real thunder crusher like ka boom what is a wave anyway we know one when we see one but what is it the physicists call it an energytransport phenomenon the dictionary says its a disturbance that travels through a medium from one location to another location adisturbance its certainly that something gets disturbed that is something strikes something else and sets off a vibration clap your hands right now and youll hear a sound what youre actually hearing is a sound wave something struck something else and it set off a vibration that strikes your eardrum the vibration is energy its transported through the phenomenon of a wave from one location to the other the water itself doesnt actually move what happens is one particle of water bumps into the next which bumps into the next and so on and so forth until it hits something its like that idiot wave at a sports eventthe people dont move around the stadium but the wave does the energy flows from one person to another so when youre riding a wave youre not riding water the water is the medium but what youre really riding is energy very cool hitching an energy ride billions of ho particles work together to transport you from one place to another which is very generous when you think about it that last statement is of course airyfairy soulsurfer bullshitthe wave doesnt care whether youre in it or not particles of water are inanimate objects that dont know anything much less care the water is just doing what water does when it gets goosed by energy it makes waves a wave any kind of wave has a specific shape the particles knocking into one another dont just bump along in a flat line but move up and downhence the wave prior to the disturbance the water particles are at rest in technical terminology equilibrium what happens is that the energy disturbs the equilibrium it displaces the particles from their state of rest when the energy reaches its maximum potential displacement positive displacement the wave crests then it drops below the equilibrium line to its negative displacement aka the trough simply put it has highs lows and middles just like life its own self yeah except its a little more complicated than that especially if youre talking about the kind of wave that you can ride especially the kind of giant wave thats right now rolling toward pacific beach with bad intent basically there are two kinds of waves most waves are surface waves theyre caused by lunar pull and wind which are sources of the disturbance these are your average gardenvariety everyday joe lunchbucket waves they show up on time punch the clock and they range in size from small to medium to occasionally large surface waves of course give surfing its name because it appears to the unenlightened eye that surfers are riding the surface of the water surfers are if you will surfacing despite this distinction surface waves are the mules of the surfing world unheralded beasts of burden not incapable however of kicking their traces from time to time when whipped into a frenzy by the wind a lot of people think that its strong winds that make big waves but this really isnt true wind can cause some big surf blowing an otherwiseaverage wave into a tall peak but most of the energythe disturbanceis on the surface these waves have height but they lack depth all the action is on topits mostly show its literally superficial and wind can ruin surf and often does if the wind is blowing across the wave it will ruin its shape or it can make the surf choppy or if its coming straight in off the ocean it can drive the crest of the wave down flattening it out and making it unridable what you want is a gentle steady offshore wind that blows into the face of the wave and holds it up for you the other kind of wave is the sub surface wave which starts duh under the water if surface waves are your middleweight boxers dancing and shooting jabs the subsurface wave is your heavyweight coming in flatfooted throwing knockout punches from the ocean floor this wave is the superstar the genuine badass the takeyourlunch money walkoffwithyourgirlfriend givemethosefuckingsneakers thank you for playing and now what parting gifts do we have for our contestant vanna wave if surface waves lack depth the subsurface wave has more bottom than a sly and the family stone riff its deeper than kierkegaard and wittgenstein combined its heavy my friend it aint your brother its the hate child of rough sex at the bottom of the sea theres a whole world down there in fact most of the world is down there you have enormous mountain ranges vast plains trenches and canyons you have tectonic plates and when they shift and scrape against each other you have earthquakes gigantic underwater earthquakes violent as a mike tyson off meds that set off one big honking disturbance at its most benign a big beautiful swell to ride at its most malevolent a massmurdering tsunami this is a disturbance a mass transportation of energy phenom that will travel thousands of miles either to give you the ride of your life or fuck you up and it doesnt care which this is whats rolling toward pacific beach as the dawn patrol gets out of the water this particular morning an undersea earthquake up near the aleutian islands is hurtling literally thousands of miles to come crash on pacific beach and go kaboom kaboom is good if youre boone daniels and live for waves that make big noises hes always been this way since birth and before if you buy all that stuff about prenatal auditory influences you know how some mothers hang out listening to mozart to give their babies a taste for the finer things boones mom dee used to sit on the beach and stroke her belly to the rhythm of the waves to the prenatal boone the ocean was indistinguishable from his mothers heartbeat hang twelve might call the sea mother ocean but to boone it really is and before his son hit the terrible twos brett daniels would put the kid in front of him on a longboard paddle out and then lift the boy on his shoulder while they rode in casual observersthat is touristswould be appalled all like what if you drop him im not going to drop him boones dad brett would reply until boone was about three and then brett would intentionally drop him into the shallow white water just to give him the feel of it to let him know that other than a few bubbles in the nose nothing bad was going to happen young boone would pop up giggling like crazy and ask for his dad to do it again every once in a while a disapproving onlooker would threaten to call child protective services and dee would reply thats what hes doinghes protecting his child which was the truth you raise a kid in pb and you know that his dna is going to drive him out there on a board youd better teach him what the ocean can do youd better teach him how to live not die in the water and youd better teach him young you teach him about riptides and undertow you teach him not to panic protect his child listen when brett and dee would have birthday parties at the condo complex pool and all boones little friends would come over brett daniels would set his chair at the edge of the pool and tell the other parents no offense have a good time have some tacos and some brews but im sitting here and im not talking to anybody then hed sit at the edge of the kidcrowded pool and never take his eyes off the bottom of the pool not for a single second because brett knew that nothing too bad was going to happen on the surface of the water that kids drown at the bottom of the pool when no one is watching brett was watching hed sit there for as long as the party lasted in zenlike concentration until the last kid came out shivering and was wrapped in a towel and went to wolf down some pizza and soda then brett would go eat and hang out with the other parents and there were no irredeemable tragedies no lifelong regrets i only turned my back for a few seconds at those parties the first time brett and dee let their then sevenyearold boy paddle out alone into some small and close beach break their collective heart was in their collective throat they were watching like hawks even though they knew that every lifeguard on the beach and every surfer in the water also had their eyes on young boone daniels and if anything bad had happened a mob would have showed up to pull him out of the soup it was hard but brett and dee stood there as boone got up and fell got up and fell got up and felland paddled back out and did it again and again until he got up and stayed up and rode that wave in while a whole beach full of people played it casual and pretended not to notice it was even harder when boone got to that age right about ten when he wanted to go the beach with his buddies and didnt want mom or dad showing up to embarrass him it was hard to let him go and sit back and worry but that was also a part of protecting their child to protect him from perpetual childhood to trust that they had done their job and taught him what he needed to know so by the time he was eleven boone was your classic gremmie a gremmie is natures revenge a gremmie aka grom is a longhaired sunbleached overtanned preadolescent waterborne painintheass little surfer a gremmie is karmic payback for every annoying obnoxious shitty little thing you did when you were that age a gremmie will hog your wave ruin your session jam up the snack bar and talk like he knows what hes talking about worse your gremmie runs in packs with his little gremmie buddiesin boones case this had been little johnny banzai and a young dave the yettobe love godall of them equally vile disgusting smartmouthed obscene gross little bastards when theyre not surfing theyre skateboarding and when theyre not surfing or skateboarding theyre reading comics trying to get their filthy little mitts on porn trying unsuccessfully to pull real live girls scheming to get adults to buy beer for them or trying to score weed the reason parents let their kids surf is that its the least sketchy thing that the board monkeys get up to as a gremmie boone got his fair share of shit from the big guys but he also got a little bit of a pass because he was brett and dee danielss kid glossed the spawn of mr and mrs satan by a few of the crankier old guys boone grew out of it all gremmies do or theyre chased out of the lineup and besides it was pretty clear early on that boone was something special he was doing scarygood things for his age then scarygood things for any age it wasnt long before the better surf teams came around inviting him onto their junior squads and it was a dead lock that boone would take home a few armloads of trophies and get himself a sweet sponsorship from one of the surfgear companies except boone said no fourteen years old and he turned away from it how come his dad asked boone shrugged i just dont do it for that he said i do it for he had no words for that and brett and dee totally understood they got on the horn to their old pals in the surf world and basically said thanks but no thanks the kid just wants to surf the kid did petra hall steers her starter bmw west on garnet avenue she alternately watches the road and looks at a slip of paper in her hand comparing the address to the building to her right the address garnet avenueis the correct listing for boone daniels private investigator but the building appears to be not an office but a surf shop at least thats what the sign says a rather unimaginative yet descriptive pacific surf inscribed over a rather unimaginative yet descriptive painting of a breaking wave and indeed looking through the window she can see surfboards body boards bathing suits and being that the building is half a block from the beach garnet avenue would certainly appear to be a surf shop except that it is supposed to be the office of boone daniels private investigator petra grew up in a climate where the sun is more rumor than reality so her skin is so pale and delicate that its almost transparent in stark contrast to her indigo black hair her charcoal gray very professional imaseriouscareerwoman suit hides a figure that is at the same time slim and generous but what youre really going to look at is her eyes are they blue or are they gray like the ocean it depends on her mood she parks the car next door in front of the sundowner lounge and goes into pacific surf where a pale young man behind the counter who would appear to be some sort of white rastafarian is playing a video game sorry petra says im looking for a mr daniels hang twelve looks up from his game to see this gorgeous woman standing in front of him his stares for a second then he gets it together enough to shout up the stairs cheerful brah civilian here looking for boone a head peers down from the staircase ben carruthers glossed cheerful by the pb crew looks to be about sixty years old has a steel gray crew cut and a scowl as he barks call me brah one more time and ill rip your tongue out sorry i forgot hang twelve says like the moana was epic tasty this sesh and i slid over the ax of this gnarler and just foffed totally shredded it and im still amped from the ocean hit so my bad brah cheerful looks at petra and says sometimes we have entire fascinating conversations in which i dont understand a word that is said he turns back to hang twelve youre what i have instead of a cat dont make me get a cat he disappears back up the stairs with a single word follow petra goes up the stairs where cheerfula tall man probably sixsix very thin wearing a red plaid shirt tucked into khaki trousersis already hunched over a desk well she takes it on faith that its a desk because she cant actually see the surface underneath the clutter of papers coffee cups ball hats taco wrappers newspapers and magazines but the saturnine man is punching buttons on an oldfashioned adding machine so she decides that it is indeed a desk the office if you can grace it with that name is a mess a hovel a bedlam except for the back wall which is neat and ordered several black wet suits hang neatly from a steel coatrack and a variety of surfboards lean against the wall sorted and ordered by size and shape fortysome years ago cheerful says a bra was something i tried with trembling fingers and little success to unsnap now i find that i am a brah such are the insults of aging what can i do for you would you be mr daniels petra asks i would be sean connery cheerful replies but hes already taken so is boone but i wouldnt be him even if i could do you know when mr daniels will be in no do you petra shakes her head which is why i asked cheerful looks up from his calculations this girl doesnt take any crap cheerful likes that so he says let me explain something to you boone doesnt wear a watch he wears a sundial i take it mr daniels is somewhat laidback if boone was any more laidback cheerful says hed be horizontal boone walks up garnet avenue from the beach in the company of sunny nothing unusual about thattheyve been in and out of each others company for coming on ten years sunny originally flashed onto the dawn patrol like daytime lightning paddled out took her place in the lineup like shed been born there boone was about to launch into a sixfoot right break when sunny jumped in and took it from him boone was still poised on the lip when this blond image zipped past him as if he were a buoy dave laughed man that babe just ripped your heart out and fed it to you boone wasnt so freaking amused he caught the next wave in and found her coming back out through the white water yo blondie boone said you jumped my wave my name isnt blondie sunny said and when did you buy the beach i was lined up you were late my ass i was your ass was late sunny said whats the matter the big man cant take getting beat by a girl i can take it boone said even to himself it sounded lame apparently not sunny said boone took a closer look at her do i know you i dont know sunny said do you she lay out on her board and started to paddle back out boone had no choice but to follow catching up with her wasnt easy you go to pac high boone asked when he got alongside used to sunny said im at sdsu now i went to pac high boone said i know you do i remember you sunny said uh i guess i dont remember you i know she kicked it up and paddled away from him then she spent the rest of the session kicking his ass she took over the water like she owned it which she did that afternoon shes a specimen dave said as he and boone watched her from the lineup eyes off boone said shes mine if shell have you dave snorted turned out she would she outsurfed him until the sun went down then waited for him on the beach until he dragged his ass in i could get used to this boone said to her get used to what getting beat by a girl my names sunny day she said ruefully im not laughing he said mines boone daniels they went to dinner and then they went to bed it was natural inevitablethey both knew that neither one of them could swim out of that current as if either one of them wanted to after that they were inseparable you and boone should get married and produce offspring johnny banzai told them a few weeks later you owe it to the world of surfing like the child of boone and sunny would be some sort of mutant superfreak but marriage not happening ccbhs is how sunny explained herself on this issue classic california broken home syndrome there ought to be a telethon emily wendelins hippie dad had left her hippie mom when emily was three years old her mom never got over it and neither did emily who learned not to give her heart to a man because men dont stay emilys mom retreated into herself becoming emotionally unavailable as the shrinks would say and it was her grandmotherher mothers motherwho really raised the girl eleanor day imbued emily with her strength her grace and her warmth and it was eleanor who gave the girl the nickname sunny because her granddaughter lit up her life when sunny turned eighteen she changed her surname to day regardless of how pseudohippie it sounded im matrilineal she explained it was her grandmother who persuaded her to go to college and her grandmother who understood when after the first year sunny decided that higher education at least in a formal setting wasnt for her its my fault eleanor had said her house was a block and a half from the beach and eleanor had taken her granddaughter there almost every day when eightyearold sunny said that she wanted to surf it was eleanor who saw that a board was under the christmas tree it was eleanor who stood on the beach while the girl rode wave after wave eleanor who smiled patiently when the sun went down and emily would wave from the break holding up one imploring finger which meant please grandma one more wave it was eleanor who went to the early tournaments who sat calmly in the er with the girl assuring her that the stitches in her chin wouldnt leave a scar and that if they did it would be an interesting one so when sunny came to her and explained that she didnt want to go to college and tearfully apologized for letting her down eleanor said that it was her fault for introducing emily to the ocean so what do you intend to do eleanor asked i want to be a professional surfer eleanor didnt raise an eyebrow or laugh or argue or scoff she simply said well be a great one bea great surfer not marry one not like the options were mutually exclusive but neither sunny nor boone was interested in getting married or even living together life was just fine the way it wassurfing hanging out making love and surfing it was all one and the same thing one long unbroken rhythm good days sunny waited tables in pb while she worked on her surfing career boone was happy being a cop a uniformed patrolman with the sdpd what busted it up was a girl named rain sweeny things changed after rain sweeny after she was gone boone never really came back it was like there was this distance between boone and sunny now like a deep slow current pulling them apart and now this big swell is coming and they both sense that its bringing a bigger change they stand outside boones office so late sunny says late walking away sunny wonders if its too late like shes already lost something she didnt even know she wanted boone walks into pacific surf hang twelve looks up from grand theft auto and says theres an inland betty upstairs looking for you and cheerfuls way aggro cheerfuls always aggravated boone replies thats what makes him cheerful whos the woman dunno hang twelve shrugs but boone shes smokin hot boone goes upstairs the woman isnt smokin hot shes smokin cold but she is definitely smokin mr daniels petra says guilty she offers her hand and boone is about to shake it when he realizes that shes handing him her card petra hall she says from the law firm burke spitz and culver boone knows the law firm of burke spitz and culver they have an office in one of the glass castles in downtown san diego and have sent him a lot of work over the past few years and alan burke surfs not every day but a lot of weekends and sometimes boone sees him out on the line during the gentlemens hour so he knows alan burke but he doesnt know this small beautiful woman with the midnight hair and the blue eyes or are they gray you must be new with the firm boone says petras appalled as she watches boone reach behind his back and pull the cord thats connected to a zipper the back of the wet suit opens and then boone gently peels the suit off his right arm then his left then rolls it down his chest she starts to turn away as he rolls the suit down over his waist and then she sees the flower pattern of his north shore board trunks appear shes looking at a man who appears to be in his late twenties or early thirties but its hard to tell because he has a somewhat boyish face made all the more so by his slightly too long unkempt sunstreaked brown hair which is either intentionally unstylishly long or has simply not been cut recently hes tall just an inch or two shorter than the saturnine old man still banging away on the adding machine and he has the wide shoulders and long arm muscles of a swimmer boones oblivious to her observation hes all about the swell theres a swell rolling down from the aleutians he says as he finishes rolling the wet suit over his ankles its going to hit sometime in the next two days and high tide says its only going to last a few hours biggest swell of the last four years and maybe the next four humongous waves real bbm hang twelve says from the staircase is anyone watching the store cheerful asks theres no one down there hang twelve says bbm petra asks brown boardshorts material hang twelve says helpfully lovely petra says wishing she hadnt asked thank you anyway boone says as he steps into the small bathroom turns on the shower and carefully rinses not himself but the wet suit everyones going out johnny banzais going to take a mentalhealth day high tides calling in sick dave the love gods on the beach anyway and sunny well you know sunnys going to be out everyone is stoked petra delivers the bad news she has work for him to do our firm petra says is defending coastal insurance company in a suit against it by one daniel silvieri aka dan silver owner of a strip club called silver dans dont know the place boone says yeah you do boone hang twelve says you and dave took me there for my birthday we took you to chuck e cheeses boone snaps backpaddle arent you going to introduce me its amazing boone thinks how hang twelve can suddenly speak actual english when theres an attractive woman involved he says petra hall hang twelve another nom de idiot petra asks he has twelve toes boone says he does not says petra then she looks down at his sandals he has twelve toes six on each foot says boone gives me sick traction on the board hang twelve says the strip club is actually immaterial petra says mr silver also owns a number of warehouses up in vista one of which burned to the ground several months ago the insurance company investigated and from the physical evidence deemed it arson and refused to pay mr silver is suing for damages and for bad faith he wants five million dollars im not an arson investigator boone says i can put you in touch with mr silver was having a relationship with one of his dancers petra continues one ms tamara roddick a strip club owner banging one of his dancers boone says just when you think youve seen it all recently petra says mr silver broke off the relationship and suggested that ms roddick find employment elsewhere let me finish this for you boone says the spurned young lady in a sudden attack of conscience decided that she couldnt live with the guilt anymore and came forward to the insurance company to confess that she saw silver burn his building down something like that yes and you bought this shit boone asks alan burke is way too smart to put this tammy babe on the stand boone thinks the opposing lawyer would shred her and the rest of burkes case with her she passed a polygraph with flying colors petra says oh boone says its the best he can think of so whats the problem he asks the problem petra says is that ms roddick is scheduled to testify tomorrow does she surf boone asks not to my knowledge then theres no problem when i tried to contact her yesterday petra says to make arrangements for her testimonyand to bring her some courtappropriate clothes i bought for hershe didnt respond a flaky stripper boone says again brave new world weve made repeated attempts to contact her petra says she neither answers her phone nor returns messages i rang her current employer totally nude girls the manager informed me that she hasnt shown up for work for three days have you checked the morgue boone asks five million dollars is a lot of money of course so shes taken off boone says you have a keen grasp of the obvious mr daniels petra says therefore you should have no trouble discerning what it is that we require of you you want me to find her full marks well done ill get right on it boone says as soon as the swell is over im afraid that wont do nothing to be afraid of boone says its just that this tamara tammy babe could be anywhere by now boone says its at least an even bet that shes at a spa in cabo with dan silver wherever she is or isnt its going to take a while to find her so whether i start today or tomorrow or the day after it really doesnt matter it does to me petra says and to mr burke boone says maybe you didnt understand me when i was talking about the big i did petra says something is in the process of swelling and certain people with sophomoric sobriquets are for reasons that evade my comprehension stoked about it boone stares at her finally he says as if to a small child well pete let me put it to you in a way you can understand some very big wavesthe sort of waves that come only about once every other presidential administrationare about to hit that beach out there for one day only so all im going to be doing for those twentyfour hours is clocking in the green room now go back and tell alan that as soon as the swell passes ill find his witness the world petra says doesnt come to a screeching halt on account of big waves yes boone says it does he disappears into the bathroom shutting the door behind him the next sound is that of running water cheerful looks at petra and shrugs as if to say what are you going to do petra walks in to the bathroom reaches into the shower and turns on the cold water naked here boone yells sorrydidnt notice he reaches up and turns off the water that was a sketchy thing to do whatever that means boone starts to reach for a towel but then gets stubborn and just stands there naked and dripping wet as petra looks him straight in the eyes and informs him mr daniels i intend to make partner within the next three years and i am not going to achieve that goal by failing to deliver petra huh boone says he finds a tube of headhunter and rubs it over his body as he says okayyour dad was pete and he wanted a boy child but that didnt work out so he glossed you petra you figured out pretty young that the best way to earn daddys affection was to add a little testosterone to the mix by growing up to be a hardcharging lawyer which sort of accounts for that log on your shoulder but not the analretentiveness no that would be the fact that its still the law firm of burke spitz and culver not burke spitz culver and hall petra doesnt blink actually danielss shot in the dark isnt far off she is an only child and her british father a prominent barrister had wanted a son so growing up in london she had kicked a football around the garden with her dad attended spurs matches and accompanied him to british grand prix at silverstone and perhaps becoming a lawyer was yet more of an effort to earn her fathers approval but doing it in california had been her american mothers idea if you pursue your career in england her mother said you will always be simon halls daughter to everybody including yourself so petra took a first at somerville college in oxford but then had crossed the water to stanford for law school burkes talent spotters had plucked her easily from the crowd and made her an offer to come to san diego your offthecuff psychoanalysis she says with a smile is all the more amusing coming from a man whose parents named him daniels boone they liked the tv show boone says its a lie actually it was dave the love god who back in junior high gave him the boone tag but boone is not about to reveal thisor his real first nameto this pain in the butt and what are you putting on your body she asks rash guard oh dear ever had wet suit rash boone asks nor a rash of any other kind well you dont want it boone says im sure towel boone takes the towel wraps it around his waist and shuffles out into the office whats the state of the nation boone asks cheerful cheerful punches a few more numbers into the adding machine looks at the result and says you can either eat or pay rent but not both this is not an unusual short list of options for boone his perpetually shallow cash flow isnt because boone is a bad private investigator the truth is hes a very good private investigator its just that hed rather surf hes totally up front about the fact that he works just enough to get by or not because he is now three months late on the rent and would be facing eviction if not for the fact that cheerful is not only his business manager but also his landlord cheerful owns the building pacific surf and about a dozen other rental properties in pacific beach cheerful is in fact a millionaire several times over but it doesnt make him any more cheerful especially not with tenants like boone hes taken on the redemption of boones business affairs as a quixotic challenge to his own managerial skills sort of edmund hillary trying to summit a mountain of debt fiscal irresponsibility unpaid bills unfiled taxes unwritten invoices and uncashed checks for an accountant and businessman boone daniels is mount everest as your accountant he tells boone now i strongly advise you to take the case how about as my landlord i strongly advise you to take the case are you going to evict me you have negative cash flow cheerful says do you know what that means it means i have more money going out than i have coming in no cheerful says if you were paying your bills youd have more money going out than coming in boone performs the complicated maneuver of putting on jeans while still keeping the towel wrapped around him as he moans twelve to twenty feet double overheads oh stop whinging petra says whinge is one of her favorite brit wordsa combination between a whine and a cringe if youre as good as your reputation youll find my witness before your swelling goes down she proffers a file folder boone pulls a north shore tshirt over his head followed by a hooded killer dana sweatshirt slips into a pair of reef sandals takes the file and walks downstairs where are you going petra calls after him breakfast now its the most important meal of the day despite his name dan silver always wears black for one thing hed look pretty stupid dressed in silver he knows this for a fact because back when he was a professional wrestler he dressed all in silver and he looked pretty stupid but what the hell else was a wrestler named dan silver going to wear he started off as a good guy but soon found out that the wrestling fans didnt buy him as a hero so he traded the silver for black and became a villain by the name of vile danny silver which the fans did buy and anyway bad guys made more money than good guys a life lesson for danny he did about five years in the wwe then decided that it was easier dealing with strippers than getting the shit kicked out of you three nights a week so he cashed out and opened his first club now dan has five clubs and he still dresses in black because he thinks the black makes him look sexy and dangerous and slim because dan is starting to get that fifties tire around his waist some heavy jowls and a second chin and he doesnt like it he also doesnt like that his rust red hair is starting to thin and black clothes cant do a thing about it but he still wears a black shirt black jeans and a thick black belt with a wide silver buckle as well as black cowboy boots with walking heels its his trademark look he looks like a trademark asshole now he goes to meet the guy down on ocean beach near the pier the sea is kicking up like a nervous thoroughbred in the starting gate dan could give a shit hes lived by the water all his life never been in it above his ankles the ocean is full of nasty stuff like jellyfish sharks and waves so dans more of a jacuzzi man you ever hear of anyone drowning in a hot tub he asked red eddie when the subject of getting into the ocean came up actually red eddie had but thats another story now dan walks up the beach and meets tweety you take care of it dan asks dan is a big guy sixfour and pushing but he looks small standing facetoface with tweety fucking guy is built like an industrialsize refrigerator and hes just as cold yeah tweety says any trouble dan asks not for me dan nods he already has the cash twenty onehundreddollar bills rolled into one of his thick hands two grand to pitch a woman off a motel balcony whoever said life is cheap overpaid its too bad dan thinks because that was one hot chick and a little freak to boot but shed seen something she shouldnt have seen and if theres one thing dans learned about strippers after twentyplus years of trying to manage them is that they cant keep their legs or their mouths shut so the girl had to go its no time for taking chances theres another shipment due in and the merchandise is worth a lot of money and that kind of money you dont let some dancer jeopardize even if she is a freak dan slips tweety the money and keeps walking making sure to stay far away from the water boone usually eats breakfast at the sundowner for one thing its next door to his office it also serves the best eggs machaca this side of well nowhere warm flour tortillas come on the side and as weve already established everything although mobbed with tourists in the afternoon and at night the sundowner is usually inhabited by locals in the morning and it has a congenial decorwoodpaneled walls covered with surfing photos surfing posters surfboards broken surfboards and a television monitor that runs a continuous loop of surf videos plus sunny works the morning shift and the owner chuck halloran is a cool guy who comps boones breakfast not that boone is a freeloader its just that he deals largely in the barter economy the arrangement with chuck has never been formalized negotiated or even discussed but boone provides sort of de facto security for the sundowner see in the morning its a restaurant full of locals so there is never a problem but at night its more of a bar and tends to get jammed up with tourists whove come to pb for the raucous nightlife and to provoke the occasional hassle boone is often in the sundowner at night anyway and even if he isnt he lives only two blocks away and it just sort of evolved that he deals with problems boone is a big guy and a former cop and he can take care of business he also hates to fight so more often than not he uses his laidback manner to smooth the rough alcoholic waters and the hassles rarely escalate to physical confrontations chuck halloran believes that this is the best kind of problem solving taking care of a situation before it becomes a problem before damage is done before the cops get involved before the liquor licensing board gets to know your name so one night a few years back chucks eyeballing a situation where a crew of guys from somewhere east of the doesnt matter specifically whereonce youre east of interstate its all the same are about to leave with a young turista whos about three sips from unconscious chuck overhears the word train so apparently does boone because he gets up from his seat at the bar and sits down at the booth with the guys he looks at the one who is clearly the alpha male smiles and says dude its not cool what isnt the guy is big he puts his time in at the gym takes his supplements one of those barrelchested chuckleheads his shirt opened to his chest and a chain with a crucifix nestled into his fur hes got enough brew down him to think its a good idea to get hostile what you have in mind boone says jutting his chin at the young lady who is now taking a brief nap with her head on the table its not cool i dunno bench press says grinning at his crew i think its cool boone nods and smiles bro im tellin ya its not on we dont do that kind of thing here so bench press says who are you like the sheriff here no boone says but shes not leaving with you bench press stands up yougonna stop me boone shakes his head like he cant believe this walking clichй thats what i thought bitch bench press says mistaking boones gesture he reaches down and grabs the turista by the elbow and shakes her awake come on babe were all gonna party then suddenly hes sitting down again trying to breathe because boone has jammed an open hand into his chest and blown all the air out of it one of his boys starts to go for boone then looks up and changes his mind because a shadow has fallen over the table high tide is standing there with his arms crossed in front of his chest and dave the love god is right over his shoulder sup boone dave asks nuch we thought maybe there was a problem no problem boone says no theres not because the sight of a pound samoan tends to have a tranquilizing effect on even the most hostile drunks truly even if youre more or less totally faced and youre thinking about throwing down one sight of boone backed by high tide and an evilly grinning dave the love god who does like to fight and is very very good at it will usually make you go mahatma gandhi if that crew shows you the door the other side of that door is going to knock disneyland off the happiest place on earth throne i gotta pay the check bench press says i got it says boone peace bench press and his crew go out like march lambs boone pays their bill then he high tide and dave revive the turista long enough to find out what motel shes in take her back put her in bed and go back to the sundowner for an aloha beer the next morning boone went in for breakfast and no bill was forthcoming chuck says no sunny explained listen i dont expect chuck says no and that was that the unspoken deal was in place boones breakfast is on the house but he always leaves a tip lunch or dinner he pays and still leaves a tip and if a situation occurs in or around the sundowner boone settles it before it becomes a problem now boone comes into the sundowner slides into a booth and is annoyed but not surprised when petra takes a seat across the table dave the love god sitting at the counter as he packs down a stack of blueberry panckakes notices her too whos the betty with boone he asks sunny dunno bother you no sunny says why should it petra may not bother herwhich is a lie anywaybut shes sure as shit bothering boone i should have thought petras saying given the urgency that you would want to get right at it theres a limit boone says to what you can accomplish on an empty stomach actually petra thinks that theres a limit to what he can do on a full stomach too but she refrains from saying so there must be something to this oceangoing neanderthal that im missing she thinks because with all the reputable detective firms in san diego alan burke was adamant about hiring him and alan burke may be the best trial lawyer in captivity so he must have a high opinion of mr daniels or perhaps its just that alan thinks that mr daniels is simply the man to call when you need to locate a stripper chuck e cheeses my aching teeth sunny comes over and asks him the usual please for the inland bettys benefit sunny recites boones usual order eggs machaca with jack cheese corn and flour tortillas split the black beans and home fries coffee with two sugars petra stares at boone have you no restraint and throw in a side of bacon boone says and for you sunny asks petra petra picks up the edge in her voice right away and knows without doubt that boone daniels and this woman have slept together the waitress is dropdead gorgeous a stunner with long blond hair longer legs a figure to kill for and a golden suntan no surf boy is most decidedly not a stranger to this lovely creatures bed would you like to order sunny asks sorry yes petra says id like a small oatmeal raw brown sugar on the side dry wheat toast and a decaffeinated tea please decaffeinated tea boone asks is that a problem she asks him no problem sunny says giving her a golden smile she already hates this woman sunny fires boone a look uh sunny says boone this is petra petra sunny pleasure to meet you petra says you too what brings you to pb sunny asks im attempting to engage mr danielss services petra says thinking as if its any of your business what brings me to pacific beach thats not always easy to do sunny says glancing at boone as i am discovering says petra well discover away sunny says ill get your drinks the bitch wants to sleep with him sunny thinks as she walks to the kitchen to place the order if she hasnt already a small oatmeal raw brown sugar on the side as if the skinny brit needs to watch her waistline but why does it bother me sunny wonders back at the booth petra asks boone if theres a toilet in the place go down the bar take a left boone watches dave the love god eyeing her as she walks past him no boone says what dave asks with a guilty smile just no dave smiles shrugs turns around and goes back to reading the tide report in the san diego uniontribune it looks good very good for the big swell boone opens the tammy roddick file after ive finished eating he says when petra gets back im going over to tammys place i was just there petra says she wasnt but her car might be and that would tell us there is no vehicle registered in her name petra says i checked look boone says if you know better how to find your witness why dont you just go do it save yourself the money and me the grief youre easily offended petra says im not offended i didnt imagine that youd be so sensitive im not sensitive boone replies hes speaking the truth sunny says as she sets the food on the table could you make this to go boone asks her except when he gets out to the street a tow truck just about has its hook into the boonemobile the boonemobile is boones van an dodge that the sun wind and salt air have turned to an indiscriminate motley splatter of colors and lack thereof despite its modest appearance the boonemobile is a san diego icon that boone has used to carry him to a few thousand epic surfing sessions ambitious young chargers have been known to cruise the pacific coast highway scanning the beach parking lots for the boonemobile to learn what break its owner is hitting that day and there is no doubt among the greater san diego beach community that the van when it goes to its inevitable and welldeserved rest will find a home in the surf museum up in carlsbad boone doesnt care about any of that he just loves his van he has lived in it on long road trips and when he didnt have the scratch to rent an apartment what fury was to joey what silver was to the lone ranger thats what the boonemobile is to boone and now a tow truck operator is trying to sink his hook into it yo whoa boone yells whats up you missed two payments tow truck guy says bending down to fix the hook under the vans front bumper he wears a red ball cap with asan diego wreck and towing logo a dirty greasestained orange jumpsuit and brown steeltoed work boots i havent missed any payments boone says placing himself between the hook and the van okay one two dude im good for it boone says tow truck guy shrugs like not so far you aint good for it boone looks like hes going to cry as tow truck guy starts to tighten the chain you put the hook on the boonemobile he thinks it might not be able to take the strain stop petras voice freezes tow truck guy in his tracks then again petras voice could freeze a polar bear in its tracks if she pronounces you damage this rare vintage automobile by as much as a scratch ill keep you in litigation until you are no longer capable of recalling exactly why your personal and professional life is in such a shambles rare vintage automobile tow truck guy laughs its a piece of shit in which case it is a rare vintage piece of shit petra says and unless you are in possession of the appropriate seizure orders i shall have you arrested for grand theft auto the papers are in my truck kindly go fetch them tow truck guy kindly goes and fetches them he hands them to petra and stands there nervously while she peruses them they seem to be in order she says she pulls her checkbook out of her purse and asks how much is owed tow truck guy shakes his head no checks he writes checks mine dont bounce petra says says you she gives him the full benefit of the withering glare to which boone has become so quickly accustomed dont get cheeky with me she says simply enlighten me as to the required amount and we shall all be on our separate ways tow truck guy is tough my boss told me dont take a check petra sighs credit card histhis strikes tow truck guy as pretty funny mine ill have to call it in she hands him her cell phone five minutes later tow truck guy has driven off and the cold sweat of terror has evaporated from boones face i must say im shocked petra says that im behind in the payments that you have payments thanks for what you did boone says its coming out of your fee ill write you a receipt boone says as he settles himself into the comforting familiarity of the wellworn drivers seat the upholstery of which is held together by strips of duct tape so you think this is a rare vintage automobile its a piece of shit petra says now may we please go and collect ms roddick that would be good boone thinks collecting tammy roddick would be really good epic macking good two minutes later boones still trying to get the engine to turn over while he balances a styrofoam goplate on his lap and tries to eat eggs machaca with a plastic fork he turns the ignition key again the engine moans then grudgingly starts like a guy with a hangover getting up for work petra sweeps some rubios and innout wrappers off the seat takes a handkerchief from her purse wipes the cushion then delicately sits down as she considers how this might fit into her drycleaning schedule stakeouts boone says petra looks behind her this is a hovel on wheels hovel is a little harsh boone thinks he prefers randomly ordered the van contains north shore board trunks a couple of sweatshirts a dozen or so empty gocups from various fastfood establishments a pair of duck feet fins a mask and a snorkel an assortment of sandals and flipflops several plaid wool shirts a blanket a lobster pot a stick of deodorant several tubes of sunblock a sixpack of empty beer bottles a sleeping bag a tire iron a sledgehammer a crowbar an aluminum baseball bat a bunch of cdscommon sense switchfoot and the kaau crater boysnumerous empty coffee cups several containers of board wax and a torn paperback copy of crime and punishment doubtless you thought it was an s and m novel petra says i read it in college you went to college almost a whole semester which is a lie boone got his bs in criminology from san diego state but he lets her think what she wants he doesnt inform her that when he goes home which doesnt contain a television set pleasantly tired from a day of surfing his idea of bliss is to sit with a cup of coffee and read to the accompaniment of the sound of the surf but its the sort of thing you keep to yourself you dont trot this out for the dawn patrol or anyone else in the greater southern california surfing community who would consider any overt displays of intellectuality to be a serious social faux pas not that any of them would admit to knowing the term faux pas or anything else in french for that matter its all right to know that stuff you just arent supposed to talk about it in fact having someone find a skanky porn book in the back of your van would be less embarrassing than a volume of dostoyevsky johnny banzai or dave the love god would give him endless shit about it even though boone knows that johnny is at least as well read as he is and that dave has an almost encyclopedic and very sophisticated knowledge of early western films but boone thinks let the brit chick indulge in stereotypes speaking of which is this actually your vehicle petra asks or the primary residence for an entire family of hygienically challenged amphibians leave the boonemobile alone boone says you may be old rusty and need bondo yourself someday although he doubts it you named your car petra asks well johnny banzai did boone says feeling about as adolescent as he sounds your development isnt just arrested petra says its been arrested tried and summarily executed get out of here no im serious so am i boone says get out she digs in im coming with you no youre not boone says why not he doesnt have a good answer for this she is the client after all and its not like finding some wayward stripper is exactly dangerous the best he can come up with is look just get out okay you cant make me petra says boone has the feeling that shes uttered these words many times and that shes usually been right he glares at her i have pepper spray in my bag she says you dont need pepper spray pete says boone some dude attacks you just talk at him for a minute and hell take him selfout perhaps we should take my car petra says let me ask you something pete says boone do you have a boyfriend i dont see how that is just answer the question boone says im seeing someone yes is he like miserable petras a little surprised that this remark actually hurts her feelings boone sees the little flinch in her eyes and the slight flush of color on her cheeks and hes as surprised as she is that shes capable of hurt he feels a little bad about it ill try one more time he says then well take your car he cranks the key again and this time the engine starts its not happyit coughs gags and sputtersbut it starts you should have your mechanic check the gaskets petra says as boone pulls out onto garnet avenue petra yes pleaseshut up where are we going petra asks the triple a cab office why because roddick now dances at tng and thats the cab service the tng girls always use boone replies how do you know boone says its the sort of specialized local knowledge youre paying the big bucks for he doesnt bother to explain to her that most barsstrip clubs includedhave arrangements with certain cab companies when tourists ask a triple a driver to take them to a strip club hell take them to tng in exchange whenever the bartender or bouncer at tng has to call a cab for a customer who might otherwise be charged with dui he returns the courtesy so if tammy roddick called a taxi to pick her up at her place she probably called triple a how do you know she didnt have a friend pick her up petra asks or that she didnt just walk i dont boone replies it just gives me a place to start even though he doesnt think that roddick took a cab anywhere what he thinks is that silver or some of his muscle or all of the above came and took her on a long trip to somewhere and that theyll never find tammy roddick but he has to try when you get on a wave you ride the wave all the way to the end if it lets you he drives through pacific beach pacific beach pb the old beach town sits just a few miles northwest of downtown san diego just across mission bay from the airport the marshlands that used to separate it from the city were drained and now the old swamp is the site of seaworld where thousands of people come to see shamu on the coastline itself running south to north you have the great playground stretch of ocean beach mission beach and pacific beachob mb and pb to locals people too busy to speak in entire words or to readers of windshield decals ocean beach is cut off from the other two by the mission bay channel but mission beach runs seamlessly into pacific beach the only division being the arbitrary border of pacific beach drive at the head of mission bay pacific beach started as a college town back in the real estate speculators who had bought the barren stretch of dirt then a long carriage ride from the city were trying to figure out how to attract people and came up with the idea of higher education so they built the san diego college of letters this was during the great boom of the late s when the railroads were offering sixdollar fares from nebraska minnesota and wisconsin and midwesterners flocked to san diego to play real estate hot potato things did boom in pacific beach for the first couple of years the railroad stretched from downtown so the city dwellers could come out to the beach to play and new pilgrims lived in tents on the beach while their gingerbread cottages were being built on lots some of which doubled in value between morning and noon a weekly newspaper came into being largely funded by real estate ads the american driving park was built alongside the beach where the sundowner and boones office now sit and wyatt earp on the run from an arizona murder indictment came out to race his horses it was all good for about a year then the boom went bust in a single day lots that had been worth hundreds were finding no buyers at twentyfive dollars the san diego college of letters shut its doors and the american driving park slowly yielded to the salt air the hot sun and sad abandonment wyatt earp left for los angeles a few committed hangerson kept their lots and built cottages a few of which still cling to life among the hotels and condo complexes that line ocean boulevard like fortresses but for the most part pacific beach slid into decline well as the trite saying goes when god hands you lemons plant lemon trees left with little but dirt and sun the developers of pacific beach used them both to plant lemon trees and around the turn of the century the community proclaimed itself the lemon capital of the world it worked for a while the flats now occupied by rows of houses were then rows of citrus trees until cheap steamship rates and relaxed import laws made sicily the lemon capital of the world instead the lemon trees of pacific beach were no longer worth the water it took to irrigate them and the community was back to a search for an identity earl taylor gave it one earl came out from kansas in and started buying up land he built the old dunaway drugstore now the on the corner of cass and garnet a block east of boones current office and then put up a number of other businesses then he met earnest pickering and the two of them conspired to build pickerings pleasure pier yeah pleasure pier right at the end of presentday garnet avenue the pier jutted out into the ocean and this wasnt a pier for docking ships this was a pier for well pleasure it had a midway with all kinds of carnival games and cheap food treats and a dance hall replete with a corklined dance floor it opened for business on the fourth of july to flags fanfare and fireworks and was a massive success and why not it was a beautifully simple hedonistic ideacombine the beauty of the ocean and the beach with women in bathing costumes junk food and then the nocturnal roaring twenties pleasures of illegal booze jazz and dancing with sex to follow at the beachside hotels that sprang up around the pier all good except that earl and earnest forgot to creosote the pilings that supported the pier and waterborn parasites started eating the thing the uncharitable would have it that waterborn parasitesthat is surf bumsstill infest pacific beach pickerings pleasure pier started crumbling into the ocean and a year after opening had to be closed for safety purposes the party was over truly because with exquisite pacific beach timing the town had reinvigorated itself just in time for the great depression the tents went up again but the depression wasnt as severe in san diego as it was in a lot of the country because the navy base in the harbor cushioned the unemployment and a lot of people loved pacific beach in those years for precisely what it didnt have a lot of people houses traffic they loved it precisely because it was a sleepy friendly little town with one of the best stretches of beach in these united states and the beach was free and accessible to everyone and there were no hotels or condo complexes no private drives what changed pacific beach forever was a nose dorothy fleets sensitive nose to be exact in her husband reuben owned a company called consolidated aircraft which had a contract with the us government to design and build seaplanes the problem was that consolidated was located in buffalo and it was hard to land seaplanes on water that was usually ice so reuben decided to move the company to warm and sunny california and he gave his wife dorothy a choice between san diego and long beach dorothy didnt like long beach because of the smelly oil wells nearby so she picked san diego and fleet built his factory on a site near the airport where he and his eight hundred workers came out with the great pby catalina airplanes had a lot to do with creating modern pacific beach because japanese bombers hitting pearl harbor launched the consolidated factory into high gear suddenly faced with the job of producing thousands of pbys plus the new b bomber fleet imported thousands of workers by early by the wars end working they pumped out aircraft during the war they had to live somewhere and the nearby empty flats of pacific beach made the perfect location to put up quick cheap housing and it wasnt just consolidated aircraft for san diego became the headquarters of the pacific fleet and between the navy bases around san diego harbor and the marine training bases at elliott and pendleton up by oceanside the whole area became a military town the citys population jumped from in to by the government built a number of housing projects in pacific beachbayview terrace los altos cyanneand a lot of the men and women who came to live in them temporarily never went home a lot of the sailors and marines who were stationed in san diego on their way to and from the pacific front decided to come back and build lives there much of pb especially inland from the beach still has that blueandkhakicollar mentalityunlike its tonier neighbor to the north la jolla and a fiercely egalitarian ethic that is a holdover from the closeliving pooled ration card and backyard party days of the war notoriously casual pb residents arent at all bothered by the fact that two of their major streets are actually misspelled felspar should be feldspar and hornblend should be hornblende but nobody cares if they even know so much for the san diego college of letters nobody seems to know why the major eastwest streets were named after precious stones in the first place except that it seemed to be some kind of lame effort to suggest that pb was the gem of the west coast and you know a pb locie by the way he or she pronounces garnet avenue if they say it correctlygarnet you know right away theyre from out of town because the locals all mispronounce it saying garnette anyway if you drive west on garnet however the hell you say it youre going to run into pickerings old pleasure pier renamed crystal pier another pb landmark revived by the pby and b the midway is gone and so is the dance hall replaced by the white cottages with blue shutters that line the north and south edges of the pier then give way to empty space for fishermen who have been known to hook the occasional surfer trying to shoot the pilings but the concept of pleasure remains pb is the only beach in california where you can still drink on the sand between noon and eight pm you can slam booze on the beach and for that reason pb had become party town usa beach division the party is always on at the beach along the boardwalk in the bars and clubs that line garnet between mission and ingraham youve got moondoggies the pb bar amp grill the tavern the typhoon saloon and of course the sundowner on weekend nightsor any nights in the summer spring or fallgarnet is rocking with a young crowd many of them locals a lot of them tourists whove heard about the party all the way from germany italy england ireland japan and australia youve got a drunk and horny united nations general assembly down there and the bartenders on garnet have probably done more for world peace than any ambassador ever doubleparked outside tiffanys yeah except that something different has been creeping up the past few years as gangs from other parts of the city have been drawn to the pb nightlife and fights have broken out in the clubs and on the street its a shame boone thinks as he drives past the strip of nightclubs and bars that the laidback surfer atmosphere is giving way to alcohol and gangfueled rage scuffles in bars that turn into fights in the streets outside its weirdwhere you used to see signs that readno shirt no shoes no service and might just as well have added and no enforcement now you see signs in the club doorways banning gang colors hats hooded sweatshirts and any gangrelated gear pb is getting a seedy almost dangerous reputation and the family tourist trade is starting to move to mission beach or up to del mar leaving pb to the young and single to the booze hounds and the gang bangers and its all too bad boone has never much liked change anyway certainly not this change but pb has changed even from the time boone was growing up in it he saw it explode in the reagan eighties a hundred years after its first real estate boom pacific beach hit another one but this time it wasnt lots of land for little onestory cottages this time it was condo complexes and big hotels that bulldozed the little cottages into memories and robbed the few survivors of their sunlight and ocean views and with the condos the chain stores moved in so a lot of pacific beach looks like a lot of everywhere else and the small businesses that gave the place its charmlike the sundowner and koanas coffeeare now exceptions and prices continued to rise to the point where the average working person the man or woman who built the town cant even think about buying a place anywhere near the beach and will soon be priced out of the market entirelythreatening to turn the beachfront area into that weird dichotomy of a rich persons ghetto where the rich lock themselves inside at night when the streets are taken over by drunk tourists and predatory gangs now boone drives east on garnet past all the clubs and bars and into the area of coffee shops ethnic restaurants tattoo parlors palmreading joints usedclothing stores and fastfood restaurants then into the mostly residential neighborhood of the flats he crosses the where garnet becomes balboa avenue and pulls into the parking lot of triple a taxi just around the corner from the old consolidated aircraft factory where reuben fleet won the war and pacific beach got lost the taxi office is a small formerly white clapboard building in need of a paint job a metal security screen is open revealing the company logo stenciled in fading red on the front window off to the left is a garage where a taxi is up on a rack another half a dozen cabs are parked haphazardly around the parking lot wait in the van okay boone says as he turns off the engine and flirt with hepatitis c for what reason petra asks just stay in the van boone says and try to look aggro aggro aggravated boone translates angry annoyed pissed off that shouldnt be difficult she says i didnt think so he takes his watch off and hands it to her take this keep it in your lap you want me to time you just do it please she smiles cheerful said youd have a sundial yeah hes a hoot boone walks across the parking lot into the dispatch office a young ethiopian guy has the chair tipped back and his feet on the desk almost all the cab companies in san diego are run by east african immigrants triple a taxi is a strictly ethiopian operation boone knows while united taxi is eritrean sometimes they get into border skirmishes in the taxi line at the airport but usually they get along okay can i help you the dispatcher asks as boone walks in hes a kid barely out of his teens skinny dressed in a ratty brown sweater over new jeans that look freshly pressed he doesnt take his air jordans off the desk boone isnt dressed so youd have to take your feet off the desk for him dude boone drawls so it sounds more like duuuuuuude im in trouble breakdown break up boone replies see the chick in the van the dispatcher swings his feet off the desk brings the chair down on its wheels adjusts his thick glasses on his nose and looks out the window into the parking lot he sees petra sitting in the vans passenger seat shes pissed off the dispatcher says way how come boone holds his left wrist out showing white skin in the exact shape of a watch and band your watch is missing the dispatcher says boone nods in petras direction she gave it to me for my birthday what happened to it boone sighs you keep a secret yes i hope not boone thinks then says my boys and me partied last night some girls dropped in and i got a little friendly with one maybe a little too friendly you know what im saying and i wake up and shes gone dude with the watch youre fucked totally boone says so i told my girlfriend that it was my roommate dave who was with the stripper but that he was in my room because johnny was in his and i passed out by the pool you know but id left the watch in my room and the dancer this tammy chick just like took it you know because she thought it was daves and shes pissed he called her a cab so i was wondering maybe you could tell me where she went im not supposed to do that the dispatcher says unless youre the police bro boone says pointing out the window i aint nailing that again until i get that watch back i mean check her out the dispatcher does shes hot shes filthy you shouldnt have gone with that other girl the dispatcher says looking indignantly outraged for the pretty girl in the van i was hammered boone says but you are right brother so you think you can toss a drowning man a rope here see if you sent a cab to del vista mar chick named tammy where you took her ill do a solid for you sometime like what nice to see that the ethiopians have adapted to the american way of life boone thinks mtv fast food capitalism cash on the barrelhead he takes his wallet out of his pants and holds out a twenty its all i have bro which is pretty much the truth the dispatcher takes the twenty goes into his log and comes back with you say her name was tammy yeah gilooley gilbert roddick thats it boone says one of our drivers took her to the crest motel well ill be damned boone thinks he says right here in pb five oclock this morning a stripper on the move at five am boone thinks strippers arent up at five unless theyre still up at five he says hey thanks brah your girlfriend yeah shes beautiful boone looks out the window to where the dispatcher is staring petras sitting erect in the seat looking into the mirror as she carefully applies fresh lipstick yeah boone thinks she is he walks back to the van and gets in six minutes and thirtyeight seconds she says consulting the watch what you wanted me to time you she says it took rather longer than i would have expected from a professional of your reputation tammy went to the crest motel boone says right here in pacific beach you owe me twenty bucks ill need a receipt you want a bribe receipt she considers this just get me any kind of receipt boone cool in fact its the first cool thing hes heard her say lets go pick up your witness then i can shed you boone thinks get my bigwave gear rigged out and be in the water in plenty of time for the big swell the first thing he sees when he pulls the van into the crest parking lot is an alarming band of yellow caution tape police tape with police behind it including johnny banzai of the sdpd homicide squad this cant be good boone thinks thats what johnny banzai thinks too when he sees boone normally johnny likes to see boone normally most people do but not here not now not when theres a dead woman who dived off a thirdfloor balcony and missed her body now sprawled a scant two feet from the swimming pool her red hair splayed on her outstretched arm her blood forming a shallow inadequate pool of its own a tiny angel is tattooed on her left wrist behind the pool are the four floors of the crest motel built in two angular wings one of a dozen ugly indistinct hotels thrown up in the early eighties catering to budgetminded tourists economypriced hookers and anonymityseeking adulterers each room has a tiny balcony overlooking the pool complex with its small rectangular swimming pool and requisite jacuzzi which johnny thinks of as basically a swirling bubbling mass of potential herpes infections now he ducks under the tape and steps into boones way get out of here before the lieutenant sees you johnny says boone looks over his shoulder at the body who is she what are you doing here anyway matrimonial johnny sees the woman in boones van with the wife in tow some people have to see for themselves boone says he juts his chin at the crime scene where the me is squatting by the body doing his voodoo lieutenant harrington squats beside him his back to boone whos the jumper in his gut he already knows the answer but being an optimist he hopes his gut is wrong one tammy roddick johnny says gut one optimism zero boone thinks she checked in early this morning johnny says checked out a little while later you calling it a suicide im not calling it anything johnny says until we get the blood work back sure boone thinks to see what drugs are running through her system happens all the time in a party town like san diegoa girl starts thinking the drugs are peter pan and shes wendy and neverland starts looking not only good but reachable the problem is well one of the problems is that the second she jumps she already knows its a mistake and she has those long seconds to regret her impulse and know she cant take it back gravity being gravity every surfer knows the sensation that big wave you get in and get in wrong but then its too late and youre just up there knowing youre about to go down and theres nothing you can do about it but take the fall and you just have to hope that the waters deep enough to slow you down before you hit the bottom like maybe tammy was hoping shed make it to the pool now get out of here before harrington scopes you johnny is saying too late harrington straightens up turns around to look for johnny banzai and sees him talking to boone daniels a cat and a dog a hatfield and a mccoy steve harrington and boone daniels harrington comes across the tape looks at boone and says if youre looking for cans and bottles sorry the trash guys already came harringtons got a face like barbed wirehis bones are so sharp you think you could cut yourself on them even his blond hair is sharp cut short and gelled wiry and his mouth looks like it was slashed with a knife between his thin lips he wears a gray herringbone jacket a white shirt with a brown tie black trousers and highly shined black shoes harrington is hardcore always has been what are you doing at my scene surf bum harrington asks him i thought youd be too busy getting little girls killed boone goes for him johnny banzai grabs boone let him go harrington tells him please john do me a favor let him go do me a favor johnny says to boone backpaddle boone backs off good choice harrington says then adds pussy boones head clears enough for him to see petra breezing past all of them striding right toward the scene hey harrington yells but its too late petra is standing over the body boone sees her look down then straighten up and walk real fast back to the van she lays both hands on the car as if shes being frisked her head is down boone walks over to her go ahead and throw up he says everyone does the first time she shakes her head go on he says you can be human its all right but she shakes her head again and says something although he cant quite make it out what he asks she speaks a little louder thats not tammy roddick she says boone hustles petra into the van the thing starts up first try and he drives for two blocks before he pulls over and asks what thats not tammy roddick petra repeats are you sure yes im sure she says i interviewed her half a dozen times for gods sake okay and i didnt have to vomit she says i was just trying to get you away from the police officers so i could tell you sorry i didnt mean to imply that you were a fleshandblood human being he says but she does look paler if thats possible look you want my advice no we should go back right now and tell them theyve got a wrong id boone says youre an officer of the court and if you withhold information thats material to the investigation of an unattended death hello she says waving her hand imthe attorney stanford law top of my class and if i withhold information they could yank my license then forget i told you she says look ill swear that i didnt tell you all right how did you do in ethics class boone asks an a she says like what else what did you cheat on the final when did you become such a goody twosandals she asks i thought you were so laidback i need my pi license to eke out a meager living boone says realizing as it comes out of his mouth that it makes him sound totally lame the rules were not made to be broken but they were made to be bent and any pi who doesnt bend them into pretzels isnt going to be in business for long besides boone thinks theres a solid reason for not telling the sdpd that the dead woman at the crest motel isnt tammy roddick the deceased checked into the motel pretending for some reason to be tammy its possible that someone bought the act and killed her because of it so the real tammy out there somewhere is safe until the truth gets out the problem is to find her before the killer realizes his mistake petra is saying something about could put her in danger im there already boone says which to his surprise shuts her up must be the shock he thinks seeing as how hes ahead of her in the wave he decides to ride it out then the first step is to find out if the dead woman isnt tammy she isnt i got that boone says thinking well it was nice while it lasted then who was she i dont know boone shakes his head to make sure he heard her say that she didnt know something then he says wed better find out how are we going to do that werenot boone says iam because boone knows you want to find out about physics you go to stephen hawking you want to learn about basketball you go to phil jackson you want to know about women who take their clothes off for a living you go to dave the love god sits on his lifeguard tower at pacific beach and intently scopes two young women making their way up the beach visible tan lines fresh dave tells boone whos sitting beside him on the tower in violation of god knows how many rules the two women one a slightly overweight blonde with a big rack the other a taller skinnier brunette are walking past now definitely flatland barbies i say minnesota or wisconsin secroreceptionists sharing a double room which makes for a challenge but not one without its rewards dave i have needs boone im not ashamed of them he smiles well i am ashamed of them but it doesnt stop you no dave is a living legend both as a lifeguard and a lover in the latter category daves a tenthlevel black belt of the horizontal kata hes been spread over more tourist flesh than bain de soleil johnny banzai insists that dave is actually listed in chamber of commerce brochures as an attraction right alongside seaworld no really johnny has said they go see the shamu show they check out the pandas at the zoo and they fuck dave you know what i love about tourist women dave now asks boone the list of possible answers is staggering so boone simply says what they leave its the truth they come for a good time dave gives them one and then they go home usually thousands of miles away they go away but they dont go away mad they like dave every bit as much when they go to bed with him as when he doesnt drive them to the airport they even give him references truly they go home and tell their girlfriends youre going to san diego you have to look up dave and they do doesnt it make you feel cheap and used sunny asked him one morning out in the lineup yes dave said but there are drawbacks too although he couldnt think of any at the moment it was dave the love god who actually coined the term betty and this is how it happened the dawn patrol was out one glassy morning and there were long waits between sets so there was ample time for a nowinfamous and admittedly sick conversation to kick up about which cartoon character theyd most like to have sex with jessica rabbit got a lot of run although johnny banzai went with snow white and hang twelve admitted to having a thing for both the girls in scoobydoo sunny was torn between batman and superman mystery versus stamina and while she was trying to make up her mind dave made himself an immortal in surf culture by chiming in betty rubble there was a moment of stunned silence then boone said thats sick why is that sick dave asked because it is but why johnny banzai asked dave why betty rubble shed be great in the sack dave replied calmly and it was chillingly clear to everyone that he had given this considerable thought im telling you those petite sexual hysterics once they cut loose how do you know shes a sexual hysteric sunny asked already having forgotten they were discussing a literally onedimensional character that existed only in the fictional prehistoric town of uh bedrock barneys not getting the job done dave replied with supreme confidence anyway it was just about a half hour later when a petite blackhaired woman came down the beach and johnny banzai scoped her grinned at dave and pointed dave nodded a real betty he said it was done daves specific figment of perverted imagination entered the surfing lexicon and any desirable woman regardless of hair color or stature became a betty but dave is also legendary as a lifeguard and for good reason kids in san diego talk about lifeguards the way nyc kids discuss baseball players theyre role models heroes guys you look up to and want to be like a great lifeguard male or female is simply the best waterman around and dave is one of the greats take the time that riptide hiton a weekend like they always seem to do when there are a lot of people in the waterand swept eleven people out with it they all made it back in because dave was out there almost before it happened he was already running for the water as it started and he commanded his crew with such cool efficiency that they got a line out beyond the tide and netted the whole eleven in or the time that snorkler got caught up underwater in the kelp bed that had drifted unusually close to shore dave read it by the color of the water got out there with a knife dived down and cut the guy loose got him back to shore and did cpr and the snorkler who would have drowned or at least suffered brain damage if dave hadnt been such a powerful swimmer was just freaked out instead or take the famous tale of daves shark daves out one day showing a young lifeguard some of the finer points theyre on those lifeguard boards bright red longboards the size of small boats paddling south cutting across the long bend of coast from la jolla shores to la jolla cove and suddenly the young lifeguard sits upright on his board and looks deathly pale dave looks down and sees blood flowing into the water from his boys right leg and then he sees why a great white cruising the cove for its favorite dish has mistaken the rookies black wetsuited leg for a seal and taken a chunk out of it now the shark is circling back to finish the meal dave paddles between themand you get this story from the rookie not from davesits up kicks the shark in the snout and says get out of here kicks it again and repeats i said get your skanky shark ass out of here and the shark does it does a dorsal flip and scoots then dave cuts the leash off his board ties it off as a tourniquet for the newbies leg and tows him to shore gets him into an ambulance announces hes hungry and walks over to la playa for a burger at jeffs burger thats dave you know what i did after i had that burger dave told boone privately i went to the can by tower thirtyeight and threw it all up i was that scared man lifeguard candidates go to great lengths either to get into daves training classes or to dodge them the ones who aspire to be great want him as their instructor the ones who just want to get by avoid him like wetsuit rash because dave is brutal he tries to wash them out doing everything this side of legal to expose their weaknessesphysical mental or emotional if theyre going to fail he said one day to boone as they watched one of his classes do underwater situps in the break i want it to be now not when some poor kook whos about to drown needs them to succeed thats the thing it doesnt matter if theres twenty people taken out by the undertow or blood in the water and sharks circling a lifeguard has to arrive in the middle of that chaos as cool as a march morning and ask in a mellow tone if people would like to work their way to shore now but theres like no rush because the thing that kills most people in the water is panic they brainlock and do stupid thingstry to fight the tide or swim in exactly the wrong direction or start flapping their arms and wearing themselves out if theyd just chill out and lie back or tread water and wait for the cavalry to arrive ninetynine times out of a hundred theyd be okay but they panic and start to hyperventilate and then its overunless that calm cool lifeguard is out there to bring them back this is why dave keeps trying to recruit boone he knows that bd would make a great lifeguard boones a natural waterman with geniuslevel ocean smarts an indefatigable swimmer his body ripped from daily surfing and as for cool well boone is the walking definition of cool the panic gene just skipped boone and its not just speculation on daves part boone was out there that day the riptide took all those people just happened to be there shooting the shit with dave and deliberately swam out into a riptide and paddled around calming the terrified tourists propping up the ones who were about to go under and smiling and laughing like he was in a warm wading pool and dave will never forget what he heard boone saying to the people as the lifeguard and his crew were desperately struggling to save lives hey no worries weve got the best people in the world out here to bring us in what brings you to my realm dave asks him now business anytime youre ready to sign on the dotted dave says i have a gig for you you could be wearing a pair of these waycool dayglo orange trunks inside a month its a joke between themwhy lifeguard trunks life jackets and even life rafts are manufactured in the exact color that research has shown is most tantalizing to sharks dayglo orange is just catnip to a great white you have an encyclopedic knowledge of local strippers boone says and a lot of people think thats easy dave says they dont realize the long hours the dedication the sacrifices you make the sacrifices dave agrees but i do and i appreciate that bd dave says how can i be of service to you boones not sure he can but hes hoping he can because the dead woman at the pool had that stereotypical teasedout stripper hair and a stripper body and its been boones experience that strippers have stripper friends this is because of the odd hours and also because women who arent strippers usually dont want to have friends who are because theyre afraid the dancers will steal their boyfriends so hes playing the odds that say the jane doe is a stripper i need to id a dancer boone says redhead an offtherack rack an angel tattoo on her left wrist gimme putt dave says angela hart angel heart a nom de strip dave says what about her she a uh friend of yours a gentleman doesnt tell bd says dave but thats a serious tone youve adopted whats underneath it shes dead dave stares out over the ocean the waves are starting to get bigger and choppy and the color of the water is a dark gray dead how dave asks maybe suicide dave shakes his head not angela she was a force of nature she ever work at silver dans didnt they all was she friends with a girl named tammy they were tight dave says whats she got to do with this i dont know yet dave nods he and boone sit and look at the water together boone doesnt rush things he knows his friend is working through it and the ocean never gets boringits always the same and always different then dave says angela was pure nectar you need any help finding out who killed her you give me a shout no worries daves back on the nocs scoping the flatland barbies back to their hotel room boone knows that hes looking but he isnt you know boone doesnt get far from the lifeguard tower hes on the boardwalk heading back toward his ride when who should he see on a kids dirt bike with tires thicker than a kansas prom queen than red eddie red eddie is a harvardeducated hawaiianjapanesechineseportugueseanglocalifornian with trafficcone red hair yeah yeah yeahtraffic cones arent red theyre orange and eddies first name isnt eddie its julius but there isnt a soul on this earth who has the stones to call the dude orange julius not boone not dave the love god not johnny banzai not even high tide because red eddie is usually surrounded by at least a sixpack of super size hawaiian moke guys and eddie dont think nothing about letting the dogs out red eddie deals pakololo his old man who owned a few dozen grocery stores in oahu kauai and the big island sent eddie from the north shore of oahu to harvard and then to wharton business school and eddie returned to the island with a sound business plan it was eddie who put the wowie in maui the high in hydro he brings massive amounts of the stuff in by boat they drop it offshore in watertight plastic wrap and eddies guys go out at night in zodiacs the small doublepontoon motorboats and bring it in im a missionary eddie said to boone one night at the sundowner remember how missionaries sailed from america to hawaii to spread the good word and totally fuck up the culture im returning the favor except my good news is benevolent and your culture needs fucking up benevolence has been good to red eddie giving him an oceanview mansion in la jolla a house on the beach in waimea and a foot motor yacht docked in san diego harbor red eddie is totally pacific rim the epitome of the current west coast economic and cultural scene which is a mйlange of caliasianpolynesian like a good salsa boone thinks with a little mango and pineapple mixed in boone and eddie go back like a lot of stories in this part of the world it starts in the water eddie has a kid from a high school indiscretion the kid doesnt live with eddiehe lives with his mother in oahubut keiki eddie comes for visits he was about three years old on one of these visits when a big swell hit the coast and keiki eddies idiot nanny decided it would be a good idea to take her charge for a walk on la jolla cove to see the big waves like he had never seen them on the north shore right one of the big waves smashed into the jetty and took keiki eddie back with it so the kid was really getting a closeup look at the big mackers these things usually end badly like the best news is they find the body call it luck call it god call it karmabut boone daniels designed by dna for just this situation was also there checking out the big waves using the long view from la jolla to scope the best break he heard a scream saw the nanny pointing and spotted keiki eddies head bobbing in the surf boone jumped into the next wave grabbed keiki eddie and kept them both from being smashed into the rocks it made the uniontribune local surfer rescues child next day boone was hanging at home chilling out from the big wave session hed done after hauling the kid out of the water when the doorbell rang boone opened the door to see this diminutive guy with red hair tattoos on every part of his exposed skin except his face anything you want the guy said anything you want in this world i dont want anything boone said eddie tried to lay cash on him dope on him eddie wanted to buy him a freaking house a boat boone finally settled for dinner at the marine room eddie offered to buy him the marine room i dont see myself in the restaurant business boone said what do you see yourself in eddie asked you want in my business brah speak the word ill set you up i play for the other team boone said not meaning that he was a lesbian allfemale outrigger canoe paddler but a freaking police officer not that it got in the way of their friendship boone wasnt on the narc squad and he didnt make judgments he had done a little herb in his grom past and even though hed grown out of it he didnt much care what other people did so he and eddie started hanging out a little bit eddie became sort of an adjunct member of the dawn patrol although he didnt turn up too often because dawn for eddie is about one pm but he did come around got to know dave and tide hang sunny and even johnny who kept a little distance due to the potentially adversarial nature of their professions boone dave and tide would go over to eddies house and watch mma matches on his flatscreen plasma eddies really big into the mixed martial arts which sprang up in hawaii anyway and sponsors his team of fighters named unsurprisingly enough team eddie so theyd hang and watch the fights or go in eddies entourage to the live shows in anaheim and eddie even got boone to voyage as far away from the ocean as las vegas to catch some fights with him and dave and most of the dawn patrol was present at eddies notorious housewarming party in la jolla eddies sprawling modernist mansion occupies an acre on a bluff overlooking the ocean at bird rock the neighbors were like appalled what with the moke guys coming and going and the parties and the pounding music the sounds from eddies skateboard tube eddie has been known to board off the roof of his house into the barrel his skeetshooting range and his racing up and down the street on his mountain bike while screened by a squadron of heavily armed bodyguards so the pink polo shirt yellow golf trouser set that live around eddie was seriously geeked by him but what were they going to do about it nothing thats what nada they werent going over there to complain about the noise they werent going to call the police they werent going to go to the zoning board with questions about whether a skeetshooting range or private skateboard park were even allowed in their heretofore quiet neighborhood they werent going to do any of these things because the neighbors were scared shitless of red eddie eddie felt bad about this and tried to alleviate their anxieties by inviting the whole neighborhood over for a luau one sunday afternoon of course it turned into a shipwreck and one of the first people eddie invited aboard the titanic was boone you gotta come eddie said into the phone after hed explained the purpose behind the invitation moral support bring your whole hui the ohana by which he meant the dawn patrol boone was reluctant to say the least it doesnt take a weather vane to know which way the wind blows and it didnt take a savonarola to predict how this little sunday afternoon gathering was going to turn out but misery does love company so boone brought the subject up at the very next meeting of the dawn patrol and was surprised when most of them actually expressed enthusiasm about going youre kidding right boone asked i wouldnt miss this circus for the world johnny banzai said yeah well circus was about right the hula dancers were fine the ukulele slackkey guitar and surfreggae combo was interesting if somewhat esoteric and the sumo wrestlers were well sumo wrestlers high tide a late entry nevertheless took the bronze while cheerful wondered aloud just what the hell fat men in diapers were doing bumping bellies in a circle of sand so far so good boone thought it could be a lot worse but maybe it was when eddieblissedout on a buffet of ecstasy maui wowie vicodin rum colas and the sheer joy of neighborlinessdemonstrated his walkingoverhotcoals meditation technique and insisted that some of his guests share in the transcendental experience that things got seriously weird after the emts left eddie persuaded the surviving guests to lie down side by side between two ramps and then knieveled them on his mountain bike after which he released his psychotic rottweiler dahmer from its cage and went manoapawo with it the two of them rolling around on the patioblood saliva fur and flesh flying until eddie finally pinned the dog in a rearnaked chokehold and made it bark uncle as the guests offered some weak somewhat stunned applause eddie sweating bleeding huffing but flushed with victorymuttered to boone jesus these haoles are hard to entertain im busting a hump bruddah i dunno boone said i guess some people just dont have an appreciation for the finer points of humancanine combat eddie shrugged like go figure he leaned over and scratched dahmers chest the dog panting bleeding huffing and embarrassed by defeat nevertheless looked up at eddie with unabashed adoration so what should i do now eddie asked boone maybe just chill sunny suggested dial it down a little let people enjoy their food the food is great eddie sunny looks great boone thought with her long flowerprint sarong a flower in her hair and a dot of barbecue sauce on her upper left lip i had it flown in eddie said yes he had boone thought mounds of poi huge platters of fresh ono and opah pulled pork chili rice grilled spam and several pigs the baking pits for which had been dug out of eddies back lawn with backhoes maybe its time for the tattoo artist eddie said maybe not so much sunny said fireeater eddie asked there you go boone said he looked at sunny raising her eyebrow what everyone likes a fireeater well maybe not everybody maybe not a la jolla crowd whose usual entertainment tended more toward chamber orchestras playing in museum foyers cocktailbar pianists warbling cole porter tunes or investmentfund managers pointing toward every upwardclimbing diagonal line the la jollans stared at the performerwho was clad only in ankletoneck tattoos and something resembling a loincloth as he shoved rods of fire down his throat with a lovelacian dexterity that would have sent a porno superstar into a paroxysm of envyand prayed to a host of episcopal saints that eddie was not going to ask for any more volunteers from the audience they surreptitiously eyed the front gate with its promise of relative safety and sanity but none of them wanted to earn eddies attention by being the first to leave boone found eddie a little later out by the saltwater wading pool bad for the glass bad for the glass johnny b delighted in repeating in a conversation with dave eddie and i were just talking about the searchers dave said he has it below high noon but above fort apache above them both but nowhere near butch cassidy boone said ah butch cassidy dave said good flick dave had dressed for the party in an expensivelooking silk hawaiianprint shirt in reds and yellows featuring parrots and ukuleles and a pair of white slacks over his best dress sandals his blond hair was neatly brushed back and he was wearing his social as opposed to his business shades a pair of wraparound nixons shanesaid eddie another one dave said the party was definitely winding down as was eddie whose constant toking had finally soothed his manic drive toward being the perfect host the guestswho were much more afraid of eddie than when theyd arriveddeparted in possession of stolen property their whiteknuckled hands clutching gift bags that contained among other things boxed sets of izzy kamakawiwoole cds ipods rolex watches little balls of hashish wrapped in festively colored foil gift certificates for a hotrock massage at a local spa godiva chocolates ribbed condoms a selection of paul mitchell haircare products and ceramic bobblehead dolls of hula dancers withahola misprinted on their stomachs dave left in possession of a gift bag and two of the other guests eddie thought the party a great success and was surprised disappointed and even a little hurt when a forest of for sale signs went up on his block and none of the guests ever came back not even for a cup of coffee or a breakfast blunt in fact the neighbors would actually cross the street while walking their dogs for fear of bumping into eddie and being invited inside not that living in eddies proximity was all negativeit wasnt the residents had neighborhood watch but they didnt need neighborhood watch not with the twenty or so hui guys armed like afghan warlords constantly peering from the walls of eddies estate no b and e guy in his remotely right mind would take a chance on robbing any of the houses lest he fuck up and break into red eddies you may may may break in but you aint ever breaking out and the only fate worse than being an invited guest is being an uninvited one what with eddie already having trouble finding playmates for dahmer now eddie does a couple of wheelies on his bike and throws the bike sideways squeaking the front tire an inch from boones feet boone dawg red eddies retroafro orange hair is jammed under a brown volcom beanie he has a sleeveless rusty shirt over a pair of cargo pants that are at least three sizes too big for him no socks cobian sandals arnette shades that have to go two bills and he reeks of the chronic eddie boone says sup not much thats not what i hear eddie says okay what do you hear i hear eddie says flashing boone forty g of cosmetic dentistry that youre dogging some stripper who thinks she saw something she didnt see that didnt take long time is monaaay well boone thinks time is money if you actually make money if you dont time is just time so bruddah red eddie says can you back out dis wave which rings some alarm bells in boones head like why does eddie care eddie goes to dans clubs from time to time but theyre not like boys that boone knows of anyway so he asks whats it to you eddie i come to a bruddah with an ask red eddie says i have to have a reason it would help wheres your aloha wheres da love red eddie asks with a tone of hurt disappointment you can be very haole sometimes boone i am a haole boone says okay red eddie says talking story now dan silver is a degenerate gambler bruddah boone bad at picking basketball games he got in deep water i pulled him out now he cant pay me he owes the big dog a pile of bones he dont have which he aint going to have if he doesnt win his lawsuit against the insurance company we on the same wave coz its beach break straight simple easy to read so red eddie says you would be showing me your aloha if you would sit out on the shoulder for a while now im hip that you need to rake lettuce to live boone brah so whatever the haoles are paying you to do ill double you to dont you know me cozi never come with my hand out i dont have something in the other yeah but what eddie wonders it brings up the ageold christmas shopping conundrum what do you give to the man who has everything more precisely what do you give to the man who wants nothing thats the problem with trying to bribe the boone dawg hes unique in the fact that his needs are simple basic and already met the man needs cash but it doesnt mean enough to him to be a swaying factor so whats the tipping point what can you offer bdog that would move him off his perfectly balanced ball boone looks down at the weathered wood of the boardwalk then back to red eddie i wish youd come to me a couple of hours ago he says then i could have said yes what happened then and now a woman was murdered boone says that puts it over the line red eddie doesnt look happy so much as i hate to say no to you boone says i have to ride this one through bro red eddie looks out to the ocean big swell coming he says theres gonna be some real thunder crushers out there wave like that can suck you in and take you over the falls mans not careful boone dawg he could get crushed yeah boone says i know a little about big waves sucking people in eddie i know you do brah eddie says i know you do red eddie does a doughnut and pedals away shouts over his shoulder e malama pono take care of yourself johnny banzai goes back into room at the crest motel its your basic pacific beach motel room away from the water cheap and basic two twin beds a television set bolted to a counter the remote control bolted to a bedside table beside a clock radio a couple of sunfaded photographs of beach scenes hang on the walls in cheap frames a glass slider opens out to the little balcony its open of course and a light breeze blows the thin curtain back inside the room it took johnny a while to settle harrington down you put boone daniels in front of harrington its the proverbial red cape before a bull the lieutenant wanted to know just what the fuck boone was doing there and truth be told so does johnny for a pi boone is a shitty liar and besides he does very little matrimonial work and no pi in his right mind brings the wife along to see live and in color what the husbands been up to not to mention the fact that the woman is a real looker who is not likely to be cheated on and that she wasnt wearing a wedding ring so boones story is bullshit totale and one of the very next things that johnny is going to do is track boone down and find out what he was doing at a motel where a woman played rocky the flying squirrel with tragic results now johnny banzai and boone daniels are boys they go way back together all the way to fifth grade where they would drop their pencils at the same time so they could duck under their desks together look at miss oliveiras legs and giggle that was before johnny got into the softcore porn business what johnny would do was buy back issues of playboy from an older cousin cut out the pictures and slip them into the lining of his threering binder which he had carefully sliced and covered over for the purpose then hed sell them in the boys room for fifty cents to a dollar each johnny was doing a brisk trade in the boys room one day when some ninth graders came in and decided to take him off boone came in like here i am to save the day the surfer dude ready to rescue his little yellow brother except that johnny didnt exactly need rescuing boone had heard the word judo before but he had never seen judo and now he watched in sheer awe as johnny literally wiped the floor with one of his attackers while a second sat against the wall trying to remember his name and the third just stood there rethinking the whole idea boone punched him in the stomach just to help the thought process along a little bit that was it he and johnny had been friends before but now they were friends and when johnny took his porn money down to pacific surf and bought a board with it they were locked in theyve been buddies ever since and when all the shit went down with boone johnny was the only cop who stood by him johnny would kill for boone and knows that boone would do the same for him but they inhabit roughly the same professional sphere and there are times when the venn diagram intersects usually when this happens theyre on the same sidethey cooperate share information theyve even done stakeouts together but there are other times when they find themselves on opposite sides of a case which is a problem that could fuck up a friendship except being friends they work it through what they call the jumpin rule the jumpin rule states the following if johnny and boone find themselves on the same wavefollowing the metaphor its just like when someone jumps in on your waveits on you do what you have to do and its nothing personal johnny and boone will go at it like the sheepdog and the coyote in those old cartoons and at the end of the day when they punch out theyll still meet at the beach grill some fish together and watch the sunset its the jumpin rule and if one guy asks a question the other guy cant answer or asks the other guy to do something he cant do all the other guy has to say is jumpin rule and enough said game on this is what johnny plans to say when he finds booneask him some very pointed questions and if boone doesnt have some very good answers then johnnys going to arrest his ass for impeding an investigation doesnt want to do it wont like doing it but he will do it and boone will understand then johnny will go in and spring for bail money because johnny has a thing about loyalty of course he does if youre japanese and you grew up anywhere in california you have a thing about loyalty johnnys too young to remember itjohnny was a long way from even having been bornwhen the us government accused his grandparents of disloyalty and hauled them off to a camp in the arizona desert for the duration of the war hes heard the stories though he knows the history hell the cop shop that he works out of is just blocks away from what used to be little japan down on fifth and island on the south edge of the gaslamp district san diegos nikkei community had been in the area since the turn of the century first as immigrant farmworkers or tuna fishermen down in point loma theyd worked their asses off so that the next generation could buy land in mission valley and up in north county near oceanside where they became small independent farmers hell johnnys maternal grandfather still grows strawberries up east of oside stubbornly hanging in there against the dual enemies of age and urban development johnnys paternal grandfather moved into little japan and opened up a bath and barber shop where the japanese men came in to get their hair cut and then take long hot baths in the steaming furo down in the basement johnnys father has walked him through the old neighborhood pointing out the buildings that still survived showing him where hagusis grocery store was where the tobishas had their restaurant where old mrs kanagawa kept her flower shop it was a thriving community mixed in with the filipinos and the few chinese who stayed after the city tore down chinatown and the blacks and the whites and it was a nice place to be and to grow up then pearl harbor happened johnnys father heard it on the radio he was seven years old then and he ran to the barbershop to tell his father by the next morning the fbi had rounded up the president of the japanese association the faculty of the japanese school the buddhist priests and the judo and kendo instructors and thrown them in a cell with the common criminals within a week the fishermen the vegetable growers and the strawberry farmers had been arrested johnnys father still remembers standing on a sidewalk downtown and watching as they were marchedin handcuffsfrom one jail to another he remembers his father telling him not to look because these menleaders of their communitywere looking down at the ground in their humiliation and their shame two months later the entire nikkei community was forced out of its homes and taken by train to the racetrack at santa anita where they stayed for almost a year behind wire before being moved to the internment camp in poston arizona when they returned to san diego after the war they found that many of their homes businesses and farms had been taken over by whites some of the nikkei left others yielded to reality and started over somelike johnnys maternal grandfatherbegan the long and tortuous legal process to recover their property but little japan was no more and the oncetight nikkei community scattered all over the county johnnys father went to college on to medical school and then set up a successful practice in pacific beach he always thought his son would join the practice and take it over but johnny had other ideas young johnny was always a little different from his siblingswhile he dutifully fulfilled the stereotype of the diligent asian student johnny preferred action to academics he got through the school day to get to the baseball field where he was an allcity second baseman when he wasnt on the diamond he was in the water a hardcharging grom ripping waves or he was in the dojo learning judo from the older japanese men johnnys one real bow to his heritage when it came time for johnny to choose a career path he had the grades to go premed but went prelaw instead when it came time to go to law school johnny checked out of that wave he dreaded more hours at the library more days behind a desk what he craved was action so he took the police exam and shredded it when johnny told his father about his decision to become a cop his father thought about the police who had led his own father in handcuffs through the streets of downtown san diego but he said nothing heritage he thought should be a foundation not an anchor johnny didnt become a doctor but he married one and that helped to ease the sting the important thing was that johnny become a success in his chosen field and johnny rocketed through the uniformed ranks to became a very good detective indeed his connections to the japanese community though are tenuous he retains enough japanese to be an annoyance in a sushi bar he goes to the buddhist temple with less and less frequency and hes even missed one or two of the monthly visits to his grandfather at the old farm its just the way things are in this modern american southern california life the kodanis are just busy peoplebeth puts in brutal hours at the hospital and johnny works his files like a machine with no off switch then theres all the stuff with the kidssoccer games little league karate ballet tutoring sessionsits small wonder theres little room in the schedule for the old traditions now the good detective opens the cheap lightweight sliding door which reveals a narrow closet no clothes on the wire hangers no shoes on the floor a womans suitcasemore of an overnight bagis set on a freestanding rack and now johnny goes through it a pair of jeans a folded blouse some underwear the usual assortment of cosmetics either tammy roddick wasnt planning on being gone long or she didnt have time to pack but why would a woman contemplating suicide pack an overnight bag johnny goes into the bathroom it hits him right away two toothbrushes on the sink one of them is pink and small achilds the girl walks on the trodden dirt path on the side of the road her skin is a rich brown her hair black as freshly hewn coal she trips over a brown beer bottle that was thrown out the window of a car the night before but she keeps walking and as she does she fingers a small silver cross held by a thin chain around her neck it gives her courage its her one tangible symbol of love in an unloving world in shock not really sure where shes going she keeps the ocean to her left because its something she recognizes and she knows that if she keeps the water to her left she will eventually reach the strawberry fields the fields are bad but they are the only life she has known for the past two years and her friends are there she needs her friends because she has nobody now and if she can find the strawberry fields she will find her friends maybe even see the guero doctor who was at least nice to her so she keeps walking north unnoticed by the drivers who rush past in their carsjust another mexican girl on the side of the road a gust of wind blows dirt and garbage around her ankles boone stops off at the sundowner for a jolt of caffeine and a delay in trying to explain the inexplicable to petra hall attorneyatlaw and allaround pain in the ass high tides there his bulk perched with surprising grace on a stool at the bar his huge hands clutching a sandwich that should have its own area code he wears the brown uniform of the san diego public works department in which hes a foreman tide is basically in charge of the storm drains in this part of the city and with the oncoming weather he knows he could be in for a long day boone sits down beside him as sunny looks up from wiping some glasses walks over to the coffeepot pours him a cup and slides it down the bar thanks boone says dont mention it she turns back to wiping the glasses whats she torqued about boone wonders he turns to tide i just had a conversation with one of the more interesting members of the greater oceania community how is eddie tide asks worked up boone says i thought you island types were supposed to be all laidback and chill and stuff weve picked up bad habits from you haole tide says protestant work ethic calvinist predetermination all that crap whats got eddies balls up his curly orange short hairs dan silver tide takes a bite of his sandwich mustard mayonnaise and what boone hopes is tomato juice squirt out the sides of the bread dont make no sense eddie dont go to strip clubs when he wants all that the strip club comes to eddie says dan owes him a big head of lettuce tide shakes his head i aint ever heard that eddie puts money on the street not to haoles anyway eddie will front to pac islanders but thats about it maybe hes expanding his customer base boone says maybe tide says but i doubt it way it works you owe eddie money and you dont pay he dont take it up with you he takes it up with your family back home and its a disgrace boone a big shame so the family back on the island usually takes care of the debt one way or the other thats harsh welcome to my world tide says its hard to explain to a guy even a friend like boone what its like straddling the pacific boones literally lived his whole life within a few blocks of where theyre sitting right now theres no way he or dave or even johnny can understand that tide who was born and bred just up the road in oceanside is still answerable to a village in samoa that hes never seen and the same thing applies to most of the oceania people living in californiathey have living roots back in samoa hawaii guam fiji what have you so you start making some money you send some of it home to help support relatives back in the ville a cousin comes over he stays on your couch until he makes enough scratch at the job you got him to maybe get his own place where hell have another cousin crash you do something good a whole village five thousand miles away celebrates with pride you do something bad the same village feels the shame all thats a burden but your kids have grandmas and grandpas aunties and uncles who love them like their own kids even in oside the children go back and forth between houses like they were huts in the village if your wife gets sick aunties you never knew you had show up with pots of soup cooked meat fish and rice its aiga family and if you ever get in trouble if someone outside the community takes you on threatens your livelihood or your life then the whole tribe shows up over your shoulder you dont even have to ask just like the dawn patrolyou call the wolf you get the pack back in the day tide was a serious gang banger a matai chiefin the samoan lords sway it was you grew up in oceanside back then especially in the mesa margarita neighborhood you played football and you gd up with your boys thank god for football high tide thinks now remembering because he loved the game and it kept him off the drugs tide wasnt your driveby guntoting banger hooked on maa no tide kept his body in good shape and when he went to war with the other gangs he went polynesianstylefleshtoflesh high tide was a legend in those oside rumbles hed place his big body in front of his boys stare down the other side then yell faaumu the ancient samoan call to war then it was on hamo fists flying until it was the last man standing that was always high tide same thing on the football field when high tide came out of the womb the doctor looked at him and said defensive tackle samoan men play football period and because oside has more samoans than anyplace but samoa its high school team is practically an nfl feeder squad high tide was where running games went to die hed just eat them up throw off the pulling guard like a sandwich wrapper then plow the ball carrier into the turf teams that played oside would just give up on the ground game and start throwing the ball like the old air coryell chargers scouts noticed tide would come home from practice to stacks of letters from colleges but he was interested only in san diego state he wasnt going to go far from hometo some cold state without an ocean to surf in and he wasnt going far from aiga from family because for a samoan family is everything so tide started for four years at state when he wasnt slaughtering ibacks he was out surfing with his new friends boone daniels johnny banzai dave the love god and sunny day he gave up the gang bangingit was just old tired deadend shit hed still go have a beer with the boys sometimes but that was about it he was too busy playing ball and riding waves and became sort of a matai emeritus in the gang highly respected listened to and obeyed but above it all he went early third round in the nfl draft played one promising season second string for the steelers until he got locked up with a bengals center and the pulling guard came around and lowjacked him tide heard the knee pop sounded like a gunshot he came home to oside depressed as hell his life over sat around his parents house on arthur avenue indulging himself in beer weed and selfpity until boone swung by and basically told him to knock that shit off boone practically dragged him back down to the beach and pushed him out into the break first ride in he decided he was going to live used his sdsu glory days to get a gig with the city found himself a samoan woman got married had three kids life is good now he explains to boone some of the intricacies of oceania business protocol thats why eddie only deals with the ohana bro tide says he knows if he goes to a haole family with a debt they say whats it got to do with us familys a different concept on this side of the pond boone yes it is yes it is boone eyes sunny whos very deliberately not eyeing him back whats her problem he asks tide tide has heard all about the british betty from dave he slides off his stool shoves the last bite of the sandwich into his mouth and pats boone on the shoulder i got work to do for a smart man boone youre a fucking idiot you need any more anthropological insights give me a ring he pulls his brown wool beanie onto his head slips on his gloves and goes out the door boone looks at sunny hey hey whats up not much sunny says not looking at him whats up with you come on sunny she walks over to him okay are you sleeping with her who bye boone she turns away no shes a client thats all all of a sudden you know who im talking about sunny says turning toward him again i guess its obvious yeah i guess shes a client boone repeats then he starts getting a little pissed that he has to explain and by the way whats it to you its not like were no its not like were anything sunny says you see other guys boone says you bet i do sunny shot back and she has but nobody even close to serious since she and boone split up so so nothing sunny says i just think that as friends we should be honest with each other im being honest okay okay okay she walks away and goes back to wiping glasses boone doesnt finish his coffee dan silver and red eddie are also having an unhappy conversation what did you do danny eddie asks nothing killing a woman is nothing well apparently danny drops his head which is a mistake because eddie shoots a wicked slap across his cheek did you think i wouldnt find out i have to hear this from boone when i go to him with an ask for you you let me do that not tell me you went ahead like some kind of cowboy you dress up like she was going to talk eddie dan can still feel the burn on his cheek and for a nanosecond he considers doing something about ithes about twice eddies size and could toss him against the wall like a pingpong ballthen decides against it because eddies hui boys linger on the edge of the conversation like sharks thats why you were going to take her out of town wasnt it eddie asks nobody ever said nothin bout killing nobody things got a little out of hand dan says eddie looks at him incredulously they hook her to you they hook you to me im gonna cut you loose like tangled fish line danny boy dans getting a little tired of eddies superior shit so the tattooed little freak went to harvard so fucking what theres a lot of things you cant learn at harvard so he decides to educate eddie a little a stripper takes a walk off a motel balcony how long you think thats going to occupy the cops an hour hour and a half nobody gives a crap eddie daniels does is he going to back off probably not eddie says backing off aint boones best thing dan shrugs daniels is a lowrent surf bum who couldnt cut it with the real cops hes fine for a skip trace or throwing a drunk out of the sundowner but hes in over his head here i wouldnt worry about it i were you well you aint me eddie says youre you and you better fucking worry about it let me tell you something about that surf bum dans cell phone rings what he listens its a cop from downtown a sergeant who drinks free at silver dans and gets a lap dance comped every once in a while he wants to let dan know that one of his girls has been positively idd doa from a jump at a pacific beach motel her name is angela hart dan thanks the guy and clicks off what was that eddie asks nothing but its a big freaking nothing dans head is whirling his stomach doing trampoline routines tweety killed the wrong piece of ass petra starts to ask something then changes her mind what cheerful asks as pretty as the woman is cheerfuls getting tired of her sitting around the office waiting for boone to get back its a bad idea clients involving themselves in the minutebyminute of a case they should pay the bill back off and wait for results he mumbles something to that effect sorry petra asks if you have something on your mind cheerful says get it off boone used to be a police officer petra asks you already knew that cheerful says this girl does her homework cheerful thinks shed have done due diligence on boone what happened petra asks why do you think thats any of your business cheerful asks well i dont cheerful looks up from the adding machine its the first time hes seen this girl nonplussed what i mean is he says are you asking as a client or as a friend because theres a difference im not asking as a client petra says boone pulled his own pin cheerful says he wasnt thrown out it wasnt for taking money or anything like that i didnt think that petra says she saw the interaction between boone and the detective at the motel she didnt hear what was said but she saw that boone had to be restrained it was rather intense money doesnt seem to be a priority for him boones too lazy to steal cheerful says im not trying to pick a fight i was just wondering it had to do with a girl cheerful snaps of course petra thinks of course it did she looks at cheerful as if to say go on but cheerful leaves it at that she seems like a good person but its early some stories have to be earned rain sweeny was six years old when she disappeared from the front yard of her house just like that gone her mother had been out there with her heard the phone ring and went in to answer it she was only gone a minute shed say between sobs at the inevitable press conferences later a beautiful summer day a little girl playing out in her yard in a nice middleclass neighborhood in mira mesa and then tragedy it didnt take long for the cops to get a lead on who did it russ rasmussen a twotime loser with a short eyes sheet was renting a room in a house just down the street when the detectives went to interview him he was gone and the neighbors said that they hadnt seen his green corolla parked on the street since the afternoon that rain went missing coincidence maybe but no one believes in that kind of coincidence an apb went out on russ rasmussen boone had been on the force for three years he loved his job he loved it it was just perfect for himactive physical something new happening every night hed come off his shift and go straight to the beach in time for the dawn patrol then get some breakfast at the sundowner and go home to his little apartment to grab some sleep then get up and do it all over again it was perfection he had his job he had sunny and he had the ocean never turn your back on the ocean thats what boones dad always taught him never get relaxed and turn your back on the ocean because the second you do that big wave is going to come out of nowhere and smack you down a week after rain sweeny was kidnapped boone was cruising one night with his partner steve harrington who had just tested out and was headed to the detective division it had been a quiet night and they were taking a spin down through the east part of the gaslamp district over near the warehouses that the tweekers liked to break into when they spotted a green corolla parked in an alley did you see that boone asked harrington see what boone pointed it out harrington pulled over to the entrance to the alley and flashed a lamp on the cars license plate holy shit harrington said it was rasmussens car the man was sound asleep in the front seat id have thought hed be far away by now harrington said should i call it in boone asked fuck that harrington said he got out of the cruiser pulled his weapon and approached the car boone got out on the passenger side and walked behind him and to the side covering him harrington holstered his weapon jerked the corolla door open and yanked rasmussen out of the car before rasmussen could wake up and start screaming harrington dropped a knee on his neck twisted his arm behind his back and cuffed him boone slipped his revolver back into its holster as harrington hauled rasmussen to his feet and pushed him against the car rasmussen was a big man over two and a half bills but harrington lifted him like he weighed nothing the cops adrenaline was screeching so was boones as he walked back to the cruiser stay off that fucking radio harrington snapped boone stopped in his tracks help me get him in the car harrington said boone grabbed one of rasmussens elbows and helped harrington drag him to the blackandwhite then held rasmussens head down as harrington pushed him into the seat harrington slammed the door shut and looked at boone what harrington asked nothing boone said lets just get him to the house were not going to the house the orders are yeah i know what the orders are harrington said and i know what the orders mean the orders mean under no circumstances do you bring him in until hes told you what he did with the girl i dont know steve i do harrington said look boone if we take him to the house hell lawyer up and well never find out where that little girl is so so we take him down to the water harrington said we hold his head under until he decides to tell us what he did with the girl no bruises no marks no nothing you cant just torture a man maybe you cant harrington said i can watch me jesus steve jesus nothing boone harrington said what if the girl is still alive what if the sick fuck has her buried somewhere and the air is running out you really want to wait to go through the process boone i dont think the kid has the time for your moral scruples now get in the fucking car were going to the beach boone got in sat there in silence while harrington headed the car toward ocean beach and started in on rasmussen you want to save yourself some pain short eyes youll tell us right now what you did with that little girl i dont know what youre talking about keep it up harrington said go ahead make us madder i dont know anything about any little girl rasmussen said boone turned to look at him the man was terrifiedsweating his eyes popping out of his head you know what we have in mind for you harrington asked peeking into the rearview mirror you know what its like to drown when we pull you out after a couple of minutes breathing water youll be begging to tell us what did you do with her is she alive did you kill her i dont know okay harrington said pushing down on the gas pedal were going to the submarine races rasmussen started to shake his knees knocked together involuntarily you piss your pants in my cruiser harrington told him im going to get really mad russ im going to hurt you even worse rasmussen started screaming and kicking his feet against the door harrington laughed it didnt matterrasmussen wasnt going anywhere and nobody was going to hear him after a couple of minutes he stopped screaming sat back in the seat and just whimpered boone felt like he was going to throw up easy surfer boy harrington said this isnt right theres a kid involved harrington said suck it up it didnt take long to get to ocean beach harrington pulled the car over by the pier turned around looked at rasmussen and said last chance rasmussen shook his head all right harrington said he opened the car door and started to get out boone reached for the radio unit we have suspect russell rasmussen were coming in you cunt harrington said you weak fucking cunt rasmussen never told what he did with the girl the sdpd held him for as long as they could but without evidence they couldnt do anything and had to kick him every cop on the force looked for the girls body for weeks but they finally gave up rasmussen he went off the radar and life got bad for boone he became a pariah on the force harrington moved to detective division and it was hard to find another uniform who wanted to ride with boone daniels the ones who would were bottomofthebarrel types cops whom other cops didnt want to ride withthe drunks the losers the guys with one foot out the door anywayand none of the pairings lasted longer than a couple of weeks when boone would call for backup the other cops would be a little slow in responding when he went into the locker room no one spoke to him and backs were turned when hed go to leave hed pick up mumbled commentsweak unit child killer traitor he had one friend on the forcejohnny banzai you shouldnt be seen with me boone told him one day im poison knock off the selfpity johnny told him seriously boone said they wont like you being friends with me i dont give a shit what they like johnny said my friends are my friends and that was that one day boone was leaving the locker room when he heard a cop named kocera mutter fucking pussy boone came back in grabbed him and put his brother cop into a wall punches were thrown and boone ended up with a months unpaid suspension and mandatory appointments with a department counselor who talked to him about anger management the subject of rain sweeny didnt come up boone spent most of the month on sunnys couch hed get up by eleven in the morning drain a couple of beers and lie there watching television looking out the window or just sleeping it drove sunny nuts this was a boone shed never seenpassive morose angry one day when she gently suggested that he might want to go out for a surf session he replied dont handle me okay sunny i dont need handling i wasnt handling you fuck he got up off the couch and went back to bed she was hoping things would get better when he went back to work they didnt they got worse the department took him off the street altogether and put him behind a desk filing arrest reports it was a prescription to drive an active outdoor man crazy and it did the trick eight to five five days a week he sat alone in a cubicle entering data hed come home bored edgy and angry he was miserable quit dave the love god told him im not a quitter boone replied but three months into this bullshit he did quit pulled his papers turned in his badge and gun and walked away no one tried to talk him out of it the only word he heard was from harrington who literally opened the door for him on the way out the word was good two hours later boone was back on sunnys couch surfing was out boone went awol from the dawn patrol he never showed up anymore he didnt go out at all one night sunny came home from a long shift at the sundowner found him stretched out on the sofa in the sweatpants and tshirt that hed had on for a week and said we have to talk about this which really means you have to talk about this youre clinically depressed clinically depressed boone asked youre a shrink now i talked to one fuck sunny it got him off the couch anyway he went out to her little porch and plopped down on one of the folding beach chairs she followed him out there i know youre angry she said i dont blame you i do what i do boone repeated staring out toward the ocean she could see tears running down his face as he said i should have done what harrington said i should have helped him hold that guy under the water beat him hurt him whatever it took to make him give up what he did with rain sweeny i was wrong and that girl is dead because of me sunny thought that this was a cathartic moment that hed start to heal after this that things would get better she was wrong he just sank deeper into his depression slowly drowning in his guilt and shame johnny banzai tried to talk to him came over one day and said you know that girl was almost certainly dead before you picked up rasmussen all the data show that sunny ask you to come over what difference fuck your data johnny fuck you the whole dawn patrol tried to work him out of it no good even red eddie came by i have all my people out eddie said looking for your girl looking for that sick bastard if he raises his head anywhere boone ill have him thanks eddie anything for you bruddah eddie said anything in this world but it didnt happen even eddies soldiers couldnt find russ rasmussen couldnt find rain sweeny and boone sank deeper and deeper into his depression a month later sunny gave him an ultimatum i cant live like this she said i cant live with you like this either you go get some help or or what come on say it sunny or find another place to live he took the or she knew he would you dont give a guy like boone an ultimatum and expect any other result the truth was she was relieved to see him go she was ashamed of it but she was glad to be alone in her place alone was better better for him too he knew that he was just taking her down with him if youre going to sink he told himself at least have the decency to sink alone go down with your own ship alone so he left the police force he left sunny he left his friends the dawn patrol and he left surfing never turn your back on the ocean you may think you can walk away from it but you cant the pull of the tide brings you back the water in your blood yearns for its homecoming and one morning after two more months of lying around his apartment boone picked up his board and paddled out alone he didnt think about it had no intention of going out that morning he just went the ocean healed himslowly and not completely but it healed him he went out in the roughest baddest surf he could find he wandered from break to break like odysseus trying to navigate his way home at tourmaline rockslide blacks d street swamis boone sought the pounding he felt that he deserved and the ocean gave it to him it beat him battered him scrubbed his skin with salt and sand hed trudge home exhausted and sleep the sleep of the dead get up with the sun and do it again and again and again until one morning he reappeared at the dawn patrol it was nothing dramaticthere was no moment of decisionit was just that he was there in the lineup when the rest of them paddled out johnny high tide dave and sunny nobody said anything to him about it they just picked up where theyd left off as if hed never been gone on the beach at the end of that session johnny asked him what are you going to do now youre looking at it just surf boone shrugged did you win the lottery johnny asked you need to make a living dont you yeah dave offered to get boone on as a lifeguard hed need to take a couple of courses dave said but it should only take about six months boone declined he figured he wasnt that good at guarding peoples lives it was johnnys idea for boone to get his pis license all kinds of work for excops johnny said insurance investigations security bond jumpers matrimonial stuff boone went with it he wasnt thrilled about it but that was the point he didnt want a job that he loved you love something it hurts when you lose it which is what worried sunny to the rest of his world boone was back same as he ever waslaidback joking refining the list of things that are good grilling fish on the beach at night making supper for his friends wrapping everything in a tortilla among the dawn patrol sunny was the only one who knew that boone wasnt back not fully she suspected that he now inhabited a world of diminished expectations both of himself and of other people of life itself that boone only wanted to work enough to support his surfing jones might have seemed hip but she understood it as the disappointment that it was disappointment in life in himself they stayed close they stayed tight they even slept together now and then for old times sake or out of loneliness but they both knew it wasnt going anywhere and they both knew whysunny knew that boone was still missing a piece of himself and neither she nor he was willing to settle for anything less than the whole man the ironic thing was that it was boone who pushed her to be everything she could be boone who did for her what she couldnt do for herself and what she couldnt do for him it was boone who told her that she couldnt settle for anything less than her dream when she was discouraged and ready to sell out get a real job it was boone who told her to hang in keep waiting tables so that she could surf that success was riding the next wave her way boone wouldnt let her quit the way he quit on himself what sunny doesnt know is that boones still trying to find russ rasmussen in those soulful hours of the morning he sits at his computer at home tracking him down trying to find a traila social security number showing up on a job a rental application a gas bill anything when he runs into skells he asks them if theyve heard anything about rasmussen but none of them have when the man disappeared he disappeared maybe hes dead taking the truth with him but boone doesnt give up boone daniels one of the most peaceful creatures in the universe keeps a in his apartment he never takes it out never carries it he just saves it for the day when he finds russ rasmussen then hes going to walk the man to a quiet place make him talk and then put a bullet in his head boone walks back to the office to the office not into the office what hes going to do is just get in his van and take off to angela harts place if angela took tammys place theres a good chance that tammy took angelas anyway its the best shot he has and he needs to hurry because johnny banzais gonna figure out on the quick that hes got the wrong id and hell be on it so will danny silver boone thinks cops get comped at strip bars for the same reasons he gets free nosh at the sundowner so theres any number of guys who could have given danny the headsup it doesnt really matter who it is boone thinks it only matters that it is and now were in a race to get to tammy roddick so if tammys lying low in angelas place boone thinks id better get over there first and i sure as hell dont need pete coming with me endlessly busting balls getting in the way better she busts cheerfuls balls he likes being miserabletheyre perfect together but when he gets to the boonemobile petras sitting in the passenger seat like a dog that knows its going for a ride ive been meaning to get that lock fixed boone says as he gets behind the wheel so petra asks where are we going boone heads south through mission beach why do they call this mission beach she asks is there a mission here sure boone says he knows what the mission is too lie on the beach all day pound beer and get laid where is it petra asks wheres what the mission petra says id like to see it oh that kind of mission they tore it down boone tells her lying to build that he points seasideto belmont amusement park where the old wooden roller coaster looms over the landscape like a funky manmade wave its been there a long time and is one of the last of the oldstyle wooden coasters there used to be a lot of them all up and down the coast seemed like the first thing people did when they settled a beach town was to build a wooden roller coaster of course that was before the hawaiians taught us to surf boone thinks speaking of missionaries we sent people over there with bibles and they sent guys back with boards the hawaiians sure got the shitty end of that stick anyway thank you mahalo boone heads to ocean beach ocean beach is not a place that time actually forgot its more like time got up to about and said fuck it ob as the obeachians call it has old hippie shops where you can buy crystals and that shit bars that still do blacklight effects and usedrecord stores that sell actual records including ones by a staggering variety of obscure reggae bands the only thing that ever roused the obeachians from their usual peace dude torpor was when starbucks wanted to move into the neighborhood then there was civil insurrection or the obeachian version of it anyway the frisbees will be flying tomorrow johnny banzai had correctly predicted and indeed there was a mass frisbee demonstration a marathon hacky sack show of force and a sitin along newport avenue which didnt really work because a bunch of people sitting on the sidewalk doing nothing looked pretty much like any other day so corporate culture in the personification of starbucks won out but its really there for tourists because the obeachians wont go near the place neither will boone i respect all local taboos he says and you have to love a community that named one of its major streets after voltaire and that voltaire street leads to a beach set aside for dogs dog beach occupies a prime piece of real estate that curls around from the floodway onto the open ocean and you can see some of the best quadrupedal frisbee athletes in the world there of course they cant throw the disk but they can sure as hell run and catch it doing sometimes spectacular leaps and spins to bring it down you also have surfing dogs at dog beach some of them ride in tandem in front of their masters but others actually ride on their own their masters setting them on the board just in front of the white water all of which inspired a conversation the day the dawn patrol went down to check out the frisbee demonstration got bored and walked over to watch dogs surf have you ever pulled a dog out of the water boone asked dave no dogs are generally smarter than people plus they have better traction johnny observed lower center of gravity and four feet on the board instead of two paws sunny said huh not feet sunny said paws right but they cant paddle hang twelve said maybe a little jealous because prior to this conversation he held the most toes on a board honors dogs cant paddle high tide asked no hang said you ever heard of the dog paddle tide said that thing little kids do in swimming pools hang asked yeah yeah ive heard of it where did they get the name tide asked hang thought about this for a few seconds then said but dogs cant paddle boards thats what i meant dogs werent meant to surf that thing that runs from the board to your ankle tide said whats it called the leash hang replied end of story said tide they eventually resolved that if dogs could paddle boards theyd be the world champion surfers every year because dogs never fall they jump off at the end of the ride shake the water out of their fur and wait to go back out again kind of like you dave said to tide you jump off shake your fur and go back out again because tide is one hairy guy theyve been looking for bigfoot all over those remote forests johnny chimed in they should have just come out to pb and looked into the water surfing sasquatch sunny said film at eleven anyway they hung out for a while watched dogs surf and chase frisbees then went back to newport street to find that the protestors had gotten bored sitting around there and had gone to find another place to sit around and maybe get some coffee you gotta love ocean beach now boone turns inland onto brighton avenue pulls up in front of angela harts fourstory apartment building and tells petra to i know she says wait in the van youre an officer of the court boone says digging around the back of the van for his burglary tools do you really want to witness breaking and entering stay here be a lookout he finds the thin metal jimmy what should i do if i see something petra asks warn me he gets out of the van how honk how many just freaking honk okay he goes into the building and walks up to the third floor ready to slip the lock but someone already has boone listens for a few seconds but doesnt hear anyone moving around unless he thinks whoevers in there heard me coming up the stairs and is staying still waiting behind the door to blast me when i come in boone opens the door a little then quickly shuts it again doesnt hear anything so he kicks the door wide open and goes in hard hands up and ready nothing whoever was here came and went which is really bad news because whoever was here might have taken tammy with him boone has a sickening thought killers usually kill the same way they dont mix it up a guy who fucked up and tossed the wrong woman off a balcony would probably try to redeem himself by tossing the right woman off a balcony boone sees the slider that opens off the small living room the slider is open a slight breeze blows the curtain back he walks across the room steps out onto the balcony and looks down nothing but the little garden no womans body splayed and broken boone takes a deep breath and steps back inside its your typical onebedroom san diego apartmenta living room with a small kitchenette attached separated by a breakfast bar furniture from ikea there are as boone might have noted in his cop days no signs of a struggle everything looks tidymagazines neatly arranged on the coffee table no drag marks on the blue carpet if someone took her she went without a fight which she would have done boone thinks if they had a gun pointed at her the bad news is that whoever broke in didnt toss the place wasnt looking for clues to tammys whereabouts maybe because he already had her he steps into the kitchenette most of a pot of coffee sits in the white krups automatic maker the little red light shows its still on a halffull cup sits on the counter cute little mug with smiling hippos holding red balloons coffee with milk in it a half piece of wheat toast no butter on a small orange plate and a small jar of nail polish the lid on but not tight she left willingly or not in a hurry he goes into the bedroom the beds unmade and smells like a woman what is it johnny b calls me when he wants to bust my chops sheet sniffer its true and the bed does smell like a woman slept in it recently one woman alone its a double bed but the covers are only pulled back on the left side the room is very feminine frilly girlie pink a teddy bear with a red ribbon around its neck sits on the right side of the bed up against the headboard strippers boone thinks and their stuffed animals he checks out the framed photos on top of the chest of drawers angela and what looks to be her mother angela and a sister angela and tammy its weird sad to look at these pictures of a smiling woman with her family and friends and think of the body lying by the pool her head in a halo of blood boone studies the picture of tammylong red hair a chiseled face with a long nose that totally works for her thin lips but its her eyes that get to you catshaped green eyes that glow out of the photo like a big dangerous cat staring at you from out of the dark a lot of strength in those eyes a lot of power it surprises him her myspace photo that hed had hang pull up had showed the typical dumb stripper this picture shows something else and hes not sure what that is shes smiling in this picture her arms around angelas shoulders the picture looks like it was taken on some sort of outingbiking maybe angela has a white ball cap jammed on her head her red ponytail sticking out through the back shes laughing happyboone can understand why she framed this picture a good memory of good times hed bet that hed find the same picture at tammys place he opens the closet and flips through the clothes theyre all in angelas size not tammys whos a good couple of inches taller and also a little thinner so if tammy was here she brought an overnight bag didnt unpack it and left with it which is a good sign because kidnappers dont usually let their victim take along luggage unless they played her told her she was just going on a vacation until things blew over let her take her bag to reassure her boone goes into the bathroom opens the shower curtain its still wet on the inside as are the shower walls the toothbrush on the sink is still moist so is the cap on the tube of facial cleanser she slept alone boone thinks got up late showered cleaned up made toast and coffee and sat down on a stool at the kitchen counter to do her nails while she ate but she didnt finish neither her nails nor the meal he opens the medicine cabinet the usual array of girl stuff on the shelves only one prescription bottle for biaxin written for angelaan antibiotic that she didnt finish taking some tylenol aspirin makeup bottles no birthcontrol pills which he would have expected to find he walks out of the bedroom and heads out stopping to take the bottle of nail polish and put it in his pocket he also shuts the slider door even in san diego you never know when it might rain well petra asks when he gets back to the van youre sort of a woman boone says do you remember what kind of scent tammy wears ck petra replies ignoring the insult why he pulls out the bottle of nail polish and shows it to her thats what she wore to our meeting she was just there boone says slamming his hand into the wheel she was just there petra is a bit surprised and pleased to see him display a little frustration my god she thinks could it be a sign of some drive in the man shes also amused and a little intrigued that he has a knowledge of womens perfumes they might have her boone says he explains what he saw in angelas apartment what do we do she asks we cruise the neighborhood he says in case shes still around not knowing what to do or where to go next if we dont see her you take a taxi back to your office while i canvass the neighborhood he would have just said while i hang out and talk to people but he thought shed like canvass the neighborhood better besides it might distract her from the back to your office part it doesnt why is my absence required she asks because no one will talk to you boone says and they wont talk to me if im with you im some sort of social leper yes sort of a woman she thinks social leper then she says men will talk to me pleased by his lack of response she adds hang twelve talked to me cheerful talked to me they gave you up to me in a heartbeat they did boone thinks in less than a heartbeat okay he says you can hang lovely she thinks i can hang yeah she hangs but that doesnt produce tammy roddick if tammy is walking the streets of ocean beach shes disguised as a wino an old hippie a middleaged hippie a young retro hippie a white rasta dude with blond dreads an emaciated vegan a retired guy or one of the dozen or so surfers waiting for the big swell to go off at rockslide petra talks to all of them having established the point that she can talk to men she feels obligated to do just that and she gets a lot of useful information the wino for two dollars tells her that she has a lovely smile the old hippie informs her that rain is natures way of moistening the earth the middleaged hippie hasnt seen tammy but knows a wonderful place for green tea the young retro hippie hasnt seen tammy either but offers to give petra a reiki massage to ease her obvious tension and his the white rasta guy knows exactly where tammy is and will take petra there for the price of a cigar except that he describes tammy as a fivefootfour blonde while the vegan informs her that his clean diet makes his natural essences taste sweet and the retired guy hasnt seen tammy but offers to spend the rest of his life helping petra look for her the surfers tell her to come back after the big swell guys will definitely talk to you boone says when petra tells him about her conversations no question and i suppose you on the other hand have produced a definite lead nope nobodys seen anybody who looks like tammy nobody on the street saw her leaving angelas building nobody saw nothing so now what do we do petra asks we go to her place of employment boone says i hardly think shes at work petra snaps i hardly think so either boone says but someone there might know something oh petra says she looks at her watch but its only two in the afternoon dont we want to wait until evening strip clubs are open twentyfourseven they are petra says then of course i suppose youd know believe it or not boone says as he gets back into the boonemobile i really dont spend that much time in strip clubs as a matter of fact i rarely go to them at all sure you dont boone shrugs believe what you want but its the truth he thinks strip clubs are interesting for about five minutes after that theyre about as erotic as wallpaper besides which the music is terrible and the food is worse youd have to be basically mentally ill to eat in a strip club anyway naked asses and buffet line being two phrases that should never ever be matched in the same sentence guys who are coming off a prison hunger strike wont eat at a strip club unless theyre actually braindamaged speaking of which hang twelve had eaten like a starved baboon when they took him to silver dans for his birthday the kid scarfed the buffet like a vacuum cleaner from one end of the table to the other its amazing said high tide no stranger to the sin of gluttony himself watching him its almost admirable in a disgusting kind of way i feel like im watching something on the nature channel dave said as hang stacked a handful of luncheon meats on a kaiser roll spread a huge glob of mayonnaise over the meat and started to eat with one hand while dipping a spear of broccoli into a tub of onion dip with the other animal planet tide asked yeah at least hes eating his vegetables johnny said thats good yeah dave asked i wonder if he saw the guy that just had his hand on his package get to the broccoli first over the jeans or under johnny asked under god then johnny said hes going for the shrimp guys guys hes going for the shrimp ill just dial now boone said that extra second could save his life hang came back to the table and set the heaping plate of food down his goatee was festooned with crumbs mayonnaise onion dip and some substance that nobody even wanted to try to identify shrimp anybody they all passed hang consumed a couple of dozen shrimp two huge sandwiches some unidentifiable hors doeuvres that nobody even bothered to make the obvious pun about twenty miniature pigs in a blanket ditto a pile of cottage fries three helpings of silver dans pasta medley and some strawberry jello with grapes and god knows what else floating around in it then he wiped his chin and said im going back go for it boone said its your birthday his last johnny said as they watched hang work his way down the table again like a piece of machinery on a massproduction line overunder on the number of hairs hes swallowed dave asked scalp or pubic asked johnny forget it dave said hang came back to the table with a plate of food that would have dismayed a roman orgiast good thing i went back he said they put out fresh cheese boone looked at the fresh cheese it was sweating i need a little air he said but he hung in staring at hang twelve with a mixture of awe and horror the kid never came up to breathe he just kept robotically shoveling food into his mouth as his eyes never left the stage hangs wholehearted devotion to free food and naked women was almost touching in its religiosity we could get him a lap dance dave suggested could kill him tide said but quickly johnny said but none of the girlsany one of whom would have cheerfully ground her ass on adolf eichmanns crotch for twenty buckswould go anywhere near hangs lap hes going to puke tawny said puke heather said hes going to erupt do you know theres a whole magazine devoted to that dave said people who vomit to express their love its a whatchamacallit mental illness boone said fetish johnny said and dave shut up im not going to puke hang said through a mouthful of penne carbonara what did he say johnny asked he said hes not going to puke boone said the fuck he isnt said a guy from the next table tide instantly took up for hang the fuck he is here we go boone said oh yeah said dave its on yeah it was ten minutes later the dawn patrol sans sunny who had adamantly refused to come and bought hang an icecream cake instead had five hundred and change on the table that hang could consume another plate of food and keep it down for a periodestablished after a tough and bitter negotiationof fortyfive minutes a number of side bets bypassed that issue altogether and focused on which would come up first the shrimp the penne or the cheese i have fifty on the cheese johnny confided to boone as hang was devouring his third plate of buffet food you have seventyfive that hes not going to throw up at all boone said johnny said im trying to make some of it back you think hes going to yank you dont well yes but you have to take up for your guy the next hour made its way into san diego strip club lore as everyone in the entire clubhorny guys plain degenerates sailors marines bartenders waitresses bouncers and naked womenstopped what they were doing to observe a twentyoneyearold soul surfer struggle to keep the contents of his bloated stomach right there in his stomach even dan silver took a break from counting money in his office to check out the scene boone watched as hangs face turned a little green and beads of sweat popped out on his forehead hang shifted in his chair he reached down and touched his toes he took deep breathsat johnnys suggestion based on two trips to the labor room with his wifehe panted like a dog at one point he let out an enormous belch no vomit no vomit high tide quickly said as several of the official judges looked closely at the front of hangsjerry garcia is god tshirt hang managed to well hang the crowd counted down the entire last minute it was a triumph a tickertape parade new years eve in times square with dick clark as half of the onlookers counted the numbers and the other half chanted hang twelve hang twelve hang twelve hangs face shone with victory never before in his life had he been the object of this much attention he had never won anything certainly never won a lot of money for himself or other people he had never been the hero and now he was he was glowing accepting the pats on the back the congratulations and the shouts of speech speech speech hang smiled modestly opened his mouth to speak and spewed trajectory vomit all over the innocent bystanders johnny won his initial bet plus the fifty on the cheese it was the only even semi fun time that boone had ever spent in a strip club but if tammy were a nurse he thinks wed be going to the hospital if she were a secretary wed be going to an office building but shes a stripper so you dont have to come he tells petra praying shell take him up on the bailout offer no i want to really its pretty sleazy boone says especially in the daytime if a strip club at night is tedious in the daytime its the birth of the bluesthirdstring strippers grinding halfhearted dances to a mostly empty room scarcely populated with lonely alcoholics coming off graveyard shifts or horny losers figuring wrongly they have a shot with the cteam girls its horrible and annoyed as he is with petras type a bullshit he still wants to spare her the full hideousness shes having none of it im going with you she insists there wont be any male strippers he says i know she says i still want to go oh what do you mean oh she asks look boone says theres nothing wrong with it personally i think that petras eyes widen totally striking amazing oh oh she says i understand just because im immune to your neanderthal anticharm you jump to the conclusion that i therefore just have to be youre the one who wants to go to a on business i dont know why youre getting so worked up boone says i thought you were this politically correct i am look around here its all good boone says ill bet half the women i know well not half okay a tenth anyway of the women i know play for the other i do not play for petra says its none of your business whom i play for for whom i play boone says correcting her dangling uh preposition she says otherwise she doesnt talk to him the whole way to the strip club which makes him wish hed thought up the lesbian thing a lot sooner petras quiet for the whole drive which is a relatively long one because the club tng is all the way up in mira mesa in north county boone takes the east then turns north on the through the broad flatland of strip malls fastfood joints and wholesale outlets he turns onto aero drive just south of the marine corps airtraining base and pulls into the parking lot of tng tng is the name of the club and the stripper cognoscenti know that the initials stand for totally nude girlsas opposed boone thinks as he parks the van to partially nude girls or sortof nude girls no the owners of tng wanted to make sure that prospective customers knew that the girls were completely absolutely totally nude its not too late for you to wait in the van he tells petra and potentially miss meeting my alice b toklas she asks as she gets out no way is she a friend of tammys or something boone asks never mind they go in all strip clubs are the same you can dress them up all you want create any dumb gimmick you can think of go for the downlow sleazy or the gentlemens club faux sophistication but at the end of the day it all amounts to a girl on a stage with a pole or in this case one totally nude girl on a pole and another totally nude girl unenthusiastically writhing on the stage without the benefit of a pole tng has no pretense at sophistication tng is a barebones strippeddown as it were stroke joint same where guys come to look at naked women maybe get a lap dance or if theyre feeling fat go with a dancer behind a beaded curtain into the vip room to get a deluxe lap dance the club is pretty empty at this time of the day this is a working guys hang and most of the working guys are working two marines judging by their haircuts sit on stools at the stageside bar a depressedlooking salesman type playing hooky from his calls sits alone one hand on a dollar bill the other on his lap other than that its just the bartender the bouncer and a totally nude waitress serving her apprenticeship on the floor before she can make the giant leap to the stage the bouncer makes boone right away boone sees the flicker of recognition and then he sees the guy move away a little bit and make a cell phone call so were working on a clock boone thinks as he steers petra away from the stageside stool and into a booth along the back wall the waitress comes over and stands expectantly what would you like boone asks petra a wet wipe she asks i meant like a drink yes hemlock with an arsenic twist please the lady will have a ginger ale boone says and ill have a coke the waitress nods and walks away petra looks at the stage i thought you said this was a strip club she says i did it is but dont you have to have some clothing on she asks in order to strip it off i guess so but theyre already nude totally so they just stand there petra says and sort of dance and thats all they do no thats not all they do boone thinks but he really doesnt want to get into that and hes relieved when the waitress comes with their drinks petra reaches into her bag comes out with a linen handkerchief with which she carefully wipes the rim of her glass then uses the handkerchief to hold the glass well we all have our own brand of paranoia boone thinks hers is catching a venereal disease from a glass mine is getting knocked into tomorrow by a daterape drug that the bouncer told the bartender to slip into my drink except the purpose wouldnt be to take sexual advantage of me it would be to drag me out in the alley and beat me half to death because clearly the bouncer got a be on the lookout for boone daniels notice and hes called dan silver to get his instructions thats the bad news the good news is if theyre protecting something here it means that theres something to protect he thinks about sharing that gem with petra then thinks better of it anyway shes staring at the girls on the stage either of them do anything for you boone asks its fascinating petra says sort of the car crash phenomenonyou dont want to look but you cant look away yeah you can boone thinks feeling his thirtysecond curiosity clock running down the girl twisted on the pole is your stereotypical blond knockout with big hair and bigger boobs shes too attractive for the day shift and she knows it but she must have done something to piss the manager off shorted him on his kickback refused to give him a blow job or maybe she was just getting uppity and talking about moving to a better club downtownand now shes being punished by having to slog it out for the lowmoney losers in the afternoons now shes working the salesman hard hoping that hes drunk enough to spring a hundred for a trip to the vip room so she can start earning her way back to nights the other girl is strictly day shift shes petite her face really isnt pretty and shes smallchested her best feature is her long brown hair and shes working it hard to make up for her other deficiencies she has that look of a girl whos been told by everyone everywhere that she just isnt good enough so she works her ass off making up for it she works harder at being a better lay she gets up early to make her latest boyfriend his breakfast she bails him out of jail after hes beaten her up shes the kind of girl wholl end up doing bottomofthebarrel porn videos because some producer tells her shes pretty shes looking down at the stage in her own world grinding her hips to the musicbut in reality shes moving to a private sound track of her own she glances up and sees boone then looks right back down again as she turns flinging her long hair across her back like a flogger then looks over her shoulder at him again sure enough when the song ends and a new one begins she dances off the stage down onto the floor and over to his booth im amber she says would you like a lap dance would you like a lap dance boone asks petra aware that she probably thinks a lap dance is something they do in lapland amber turns her attention to petra i find girls so sensual she says its a rehearsed line and comes off that way no thank you petra says and boone can tell shes actually trying not to hurt the girls feelings which is nice boone thinks how about you amber asks boone would you like a lap dance or for a hundred we can go into the vip room wouldnt you like to have some private time with me yeah i would boone says you what says petra ill make you happy amber says give me two hundred boone says to petra i beg your pardon give me two hundred dollars boone repeats i want to go into the vip room twice just shut up and give me the money amber doesnt react to any of this she totally gets digging into her purse and giving her boyfriend money its going on your expense account petra says slapping two bills into boones outstretched palm youcan explain to alan burke why you no worries he takes the two hundred and follows amber through the beaded curtain into the vip room the vip room has a line of easy chairs against one wall kind of like an old shoeshine shop amber sits boone down in one of them as the waitress comes in with a glass of cheap champagne she hands it to amber who in turn hands it to boone as she says you can feel my tits but no kissing and no touching below the belt the belt boone wonders she starts to climb on his lap you feel good she says boone lifts her up by the arms and puts her back on the floor forget about the dance he says i want to ask you some questions she rolls her eyes no i wasnt molested as a child no im not a victim of incest no im not putting myself through college no i dont do you know tammy roddick amber says im not supposed to talk about her who told you that i dont want to get in trouble she says look i need this job i have a kid at home of course you do boone thinks of fucking course a hundred for the dance boone says another hundred for anything you can tell me i cant tell you anything cant or wont both she glances through the curtain to see if the bouncer is there he isnt did you know angela hart what do you mean did shes dead boone says they threw her off a motel balcony itll be on the news tonight oh my god theyll do the same to tammy boone says im trying to find her before they do if you know anything that can help me youll be helping her he keeps an eye on the curtain and an eye on her while she tries to make up her mind then she says i dont want the money angela used to watch my kid sometimes when i couldnt find a sitter whats your kid look like whats it to you it might help hes never mind all i know about tammy she says is that she has a boyfriend who his name is mick amber says he hangs out here a lot does mick have a last name penner are you asking me or telling me im pretty sure amber says boone asks has he been in today i havent seen him in a while amber says then she looks over boones shoulder boone turns and recognizes tweety hes a pb local hanging around the gym the gnc store the bars tweety is a juicedup roid freak with a head even bigger than his huge body big flat face with small blue eyes and hes giganticsixsix and largeframed already and whatever shit hes shooting into himself its working he wears a golds gym muscle shirt on the if you got it flaunt it fashion theory gray sweatpants over doc martens tweety sports shortcropped yellow hair not blondbright yellow hence the tweety tag out he says to boone i didnt kiss her or touch her below the figurative belt boone says out now boone hands amber a hundreddollar bill thanks for nothing bitch way to help your friend fuck you asshole tweety grabs boone by the elbow you dont understand out yeah i do boone says for example are you out of the closet yet is your skull going to pop out of your skin has your dick shrunk out of sight yet oh heres another one have you thrown a girl out of a building lately tweety would be the perfect candidate for the job he could easily have pressed angela and heaved her off the balcony tweetys face turns red guilt roid rage or both boone wonders well have you boone asks adding tweety tweety pops a beautiful right cross plenty of leverage in the hips weight balanced and coming forward boone isnt there to take it he steps to the left feels the air whoosh by his nose as the heavy fist comes through then smashes the blade of his foot down into the side of tweetys kneecap which dislocates with a sickening pop tweety crashes to the floor rolls into a fetal position grabs his knee and howls in pain boones not exactly eaten up with sympathy he reaches down gets his middle and index fingers into tweetys nostrils and pulls because there are no weights you can pump to strengthen your nose steroids might make your head big but they dont make your nostrils any stronger it hurts like crazy and where the nose goes the head and neck are bound to follow however if they dont your nose is coming off so basically boone tries to rip tweetys nose off his face presenting him with a choicesuffer rhinoplasty or talk do you have her who you know who tweety boone says im going to ask you one more time do you have tammy roddick no boone lets him go tweety makes a valiant effort to get up it works okay on the one leg but when he tries to put weight on the dislocated knee it gives out under him and he falls forward onto the floor but boone backs up just in case hes tempted to give tweety another kick in the knee but it would probably be bad karma something sunnys always talking about since deciding to become a buddhist boone doesnt totally get the whole karma thing but he decides that kicking a guy in his dislocated knee would probably compel sunny to chant a few thousand more mantras another concept hes not totally with you should have a mantra sunny told him i have one boone replied everything tastes better on a tortilla sunny said its a start anyway boone doesnt kick tweety in the knee and further decides he should get out of there before the bouncer decides to check out whats happening in the old vip room but tweety says daniels ill be seeing you again and when i do boone comes back and kicks him in the knee what sunny doesnt know boone walks out of the vip room that was quick petra says sated our absence has been requested boone explains ive been thrown out of better places petra says she follows him out the door dave the love god looks out at the burgeoning ocean and thinks about george freeth george freaking freeth freeth was a legend a god the hawaiian wonder was the father of san diego surfing and the firstever san diego lifeguard if you dont know about freeth dave thinks you dont know your own heritage where you came from you dont know about freeth you cant sit in this lifeguard tower and pretend to know who you even are it goes back to jack london at the turn of the last century london was in honolulu trying to surf and he saw this brownskinned god go flying past him turned out it was freeth son of an english father and a hawaiian mother he taught london to surf london talked freeth into coming to california around the same time henry huntington built a pier at his eponymous beach and was trying to promote it so he hired freeth to come give surfing demonstrations he billed freeth as the man who can walk on water thousands of people went down to the pier to see him do just that it was a smash and pretty soon freeth was going up and down the coast teaching young guys how to ride a wave he was a prophet a missionary making the reverse journey from hawaii the man who could walk on water hell freeth could do anything in or on the water one day in a japanese fishing skiff capsized in heavy surf off santa monica bay freeth swam out there righted the skiff and standing up in it surfed it back to shore saving the seven japanese on board congress gave him a medal of honor it was the only gold medal hed receive though he tried to

some of the answers he created the crawl stroke which lifeguards still use he invented the torpedoshaped life float that they still use eventually he migrated down to san diego and became the swim

that in april of after rescuing another group off ocean beach freeth got a respiratory infection and died in a flophouse in the gaslamp district broke he had saved seventyeight people from drowning so now daves thinking about george freeth in his thirties now dave is wondering if hes headed for the same fate alone and broke its all good when youre in your twentieshanging out picking up tourist chicks slamming beers at the sundowner jerking people out of the soup the summer days are long and you think youre going to live forever then suddenly youre in your thirties and you realize that you arent immortal and you also realize that you have nothing no money in the bank no house no wife no real girlfriend no family and every day youre out there rescuing people who have all that so that time back at red eddies hilarious housewarming party eddie made the offer a little night work use your skills eddie said to make yourself some money some real money brah easy money easy work just drive a zodiac out there pick up the product bring it in or go down to rosarito bring a boat back up wheres the harm whats the bad not like its heroin or meth or coke i dunno eddie dave said nothin to know or not to know eddie replied when youre ready just say the word just say the word later that same week he went out into a riptide to pull in a turista whod let herself get sucked out the woman not small was so hysterical that she damned near pulled dave under with her she grabbed on to his neck and wouldnt let go and he damned near had to knock her out to get her under control and onto the sled when he got her back to the beach all she could say was he hit me he watched her and her indignant hubby get into their mercedes and drive away no thank you just he hit me dave thought about george freeth brought surfing to california saved seventyeight lives died broke at thirtyfive dave called eddie and said the word there are thousands of mick penners a strippers boyfriend who hangs around strip clubs is not exactly a unique profile hes a definite type this guy and you can see him everywhere hes that weird dude who gets his rocks off watching his girlfriend take her clothes off for a roomful of guys and hes alternately turned on and repulsed by it on the one hand he thinks hes a stud because he has a hot chick that other guys want on the other hand hes jealous that other guys want her so when the girl comes homeand a mick penner usually lives with her while she pays the renthe works out his ambivalence by slapping her around and then taking her to bed you can see a mick penner hovering in the back of any strip club keeping an eye on his girl chatting up the other dancers bothering the bartender generally being a pain in the ass the more benign mick penners leave it at that the worse ones mooch off the girl taking her tip money as soon as she makes it the worse ones yet use her to get to other girls the very worst pimp her out the mick penners of the world always have something cooking always have something on the stove always are running some scam or the other and its always the next big thing financed by the stripper girlfriend until the ship comes in a real estate investment a startup tech company waiting for the bustout ipo a screenplay that spielbergs people have expressed interest in a web site its always going to bring in a million bucks and it never does something always happens somewhere along the way to the big payoff but no worriesby that time a mick penner is on to the next big thing how do we find this mick penner petra asks youre in luck boone says i know the dude you do yup boone says on the way to the hotel milano he tells her how he knows mick penner mick penner parks cars this is how boone knows him if youre a private investigator in a resort town like san diego you know the parking valets at the major hotels and restaurants if youre a more financially successful private investigator than boone daniels you go around at christmastime handing out twentydollar bills to the parking valets at the major hotels and restaurants not that boone hasnt handed out a few bills in his day he has lots of times and more than once to mick penner who is a daytime valet at the hotel milano in la jolla you do this because nobody in california goes anywhere except in their cars you want to track somebody in cali you track their vehicle and vehicles have to park somewhere and when they park at a hotel you have a good idea about what theyre doing there you want to know whos having lunch with whom whos laying out big bucks for a dinner party to make a deal whos banging somebody they shouldnt be you stroke the parking valet you want to stake out someone at a hotel and you dont want to be seen you lay off a couple of blocks and let the valet call you when the person rings for his car you need video of a husband wife boyfriend girlfriend getting in or out of a car in a hotel parking lot you pay one of the valets to let you park in there youre looking for some highrolling scam artist you want a parking valet to give you a jingle when your guy checks into his hotel parking valets concierges desk clerks roomservice waiterstheir base salaries are just that a base the smart ones make their real money from tips and tip offs and mick penner is one of the smart ones mick is a goodlooking guy slim but built about sixone with black hair deep blue eyes and white teeth he has what you might call movie star good looks hed better have mick parks cars and fucks trophy wives this is why he works the day shift see youd think a parking valet would want nights when the tips are bigger but mick does matinees when he can flash that smile at the ladies who lunch its a numbers game mick smiles at a lot of ladies who lunch and enough of them are going to have lunch and then have mick and enough of them are going to tell their friends that mick spends some of his afternoons up in the rooms sharing the unique joy that is mick the ladies dont give him cashthat would make him a prostitute and mick doesnt see himself that way they give him giftsclothes jewelry watchesbut thats not where the money is the money is in their homes when mick gets tired of banging a woman or she gets tired of him or the gifts get thin mick cashes out hes very careful about which women he picks to give him his severance paythey have to be married have to have signed a prenup have to have a real rooting interest in keeping their marriages intact but if a woman qualifies then mick puts in a call to a friend who does highlevel house burglaries mick has her keys right he gets them copied and he knows for a fact when shes not going to be in the house so the woman is snuggled up with mick in bed in a room overlooking the ocean while micks pal is in her house taking the jewelry she decided not to wear that day and maybe her silverware crystal artworks loose cash anything portable even if the woman figures out that sweet mick fucked her over she isnt going to tell the cops where she was shes not going to tell them who might have access and knowledge shes going to keep her mouth shut because at the end of the day its the insurance companys problem its not that mick does this a lot just enough to help finance the next big thing micks a screenwriter he hasnt written a word in about three months but he has an idea thats drawn some attention from the assistant to a senior vp at paramount its a sure thing just a matter of time just a matter of sitting down and doing it but micks been too busy boone pulls the van up to the valet stand at the milano an exclusive bucksup hotel in the heart of la jolla village calling la jolla village a village is like calling the queen mary a rowboat boones always thought of a village as a place with grass huts and chickens running around or a quiet row of thatchroofed cottages in one of those english movies that a girl made him go to so hes always been amused at the folksy pretentiousness of calling some of the most expensive real estate on earth a village the village occupies a bluff overlooking the ocean with a magnificent sweep of a view a cove that features some of the best diving in california and a small but tasty reef break there are no grass huts running chickens or thatchroofed cottages no this village features platinumcard boutiques exclusive hotels art galleries and froufrou restaurants that cater to the beautiful people the boonemobile looks distinctly out of place in the village among the rollses mercedeses bmws porsches and lexuses boone thinks that the locals might figure that hes a cleaner or something but the housecleaners in the village drive better cars than the boonemobile anyway he pulls it up to the valet stand at the milano a valet ambles over ready to tell whoever this is that he has the wrong address boone thinks he might have the wrong place too several parking valets are standing around none of them mick boone rolls down his window hey hey its you the valet says he and boone touch fists what brings alex right right mick around its his day off alex says his day off boone asks or he just didnt show okay door number two alex says glancing at petra he lowers his voice and adds you need a room i can probably hook you up boone shakes his head im good alex shrugs dude didnt show today didnt show yesterday hes gonna lose the gig he doesnt straighten up dyou cover for him i made up some bullshit story i dunno the flu boone asks where does he lay his head these days he was crashing with this stripper chick alex says in pb i tried boone says hes not there oh you know her yeah fucking mick huh alex says with a smile of envious admiration fucking mick boone agrees anyway you have his phone number right its in the shack i can get it it would be a help man id appreciate it be right back alex trots away shes with this mick person petra says thats how i read it boone says do you think theyre still in town not if theyre smart if theyre smart theyre two days drive away maybe up the coast in oregon or even washington or they drove out to vegas where tammy could get work easily hell they could be anywhere alex comes back and hands boone a slip of paper with micks number on it thanks bro no worries mick still drive that little silver bmw boone asks oh yeah he loves that car well late man he slips alex a ten late parking valets driving beemers boone thinks the trophywife business must be booming he backs out into the street and drives down to the cove and finds a parking spot overlooking the beach where the seals gather a couple of big males are lying out on the rocks with tourists standing above them snapping pictures so we think that mick and tammy have disguised themselves as sea lions petra asks boone ignores her he grabs his cell phone what are you doing petra asks im calling mick to tell him were on our way over youre kidding yeah yo i mean pacific surf hang says when he picks up hang boone get off whatever porn site youre on and run a reverse for me boone says he gives him micks phone number thats a cell phone boone i know gonna take a minute boone knows this too hang will use the number to go on the service providers web site get a new password for the one he lost then access the billing record to get a home address its going to take at least five minutes hangs back on in three twoseveneighttwo vista del playa apartment b down in shores boone asks hold on a sec boone hears him tapping at some keys then hang says yup you take no i got it thanks boone pulls out of the slot and heads back up to the village then heads north for la jolla shores micks place is only ten minutes away and boone already knows what hes going to find there no mick no micks beemer no tammy dan silver is already irritable and concerned what had eddie said open mike night at ha has is over big man its time you got serious you feel me yeah dan felt him felt him like a rock lodged in his belly felt what red eddie was telling him too clean up your mess and what a fucking mess it is that dumb goddamn roid case tweety going out and killing the wrong gash amber is scared she looks small and pale and weak next to him which she is all of those three things he has her sitting in a plain woodenback chair in the vip room and he stands over her staring down i didnt tell him anything amber says didnt say you did dan says in his best calming voice what im asking you is where is tammy i dont know do you like working here dan asks yes they treat you good dont they amber nods uhhuh so you dont want to get fired i need this job i know dan says you have a kid right yeah amber says and you know food rent day care i feel you dan says he slowly walks behind her then hauls off and hits her with a lazy punch to the kidneys lazy for him but with his strength its enough to knock her off the chair and send her sprawling on the floor gasping in pain now you feel me he picks her up with one hand and sets her back down again very gently squatting in front of her he says if i hit you in the kidneys one more time you dont dance for a month or two it hurts you just to try to get up off the couch dont even think about going to the bathroom amber drops her face into her hands and starts to cry she babysat my kid for me so i could go to a movie sometimes thats nice he walks behind her and raises his fist all i know is that she has a boyfriend amber says quickly his name is mick penner where does he live i dont know amber says i swear i believe you amber dan says he takes a roll of bills out of his jeans pocket hands her a hundreddollar bill and says you buy something nice for that kid of yours lets go get tweety taken care of dan says back in the main room boone makes the short drive down to la jolla shores it might be the prettiest beach in san diego boone thinks a gentle twomile curve from the bluffs of beautifulpeople la jolla village to the south all the way to the scripps pier in the north with the pale sienna cliffs of torrey pines in the background just off to his left to the south are the twin hotelsthe la jolla shores and the la jolla tennis and beach clubthat sit right on the beach and the tennis and beach club houses the famous marine room restaurant where on a stormy night you can sit and eat shrimp and lobster with the waves hitting right against the window boone likes shores as the locals simply call it even though the surf usually isnt very challenging because its calm and pretty and people always seem to be having a good time there whether theyre in the water playing on the sand strolling the boardwalk or having a cookout in the little park that edges the beach at night people come down and make bonfires and sit and talk or play guitars or dance to the radio and you can hear all kinds of music down here at night from rasta to retro folk to the exotic twisting chants that the groups of muslim students like boone likes to come down here for that reason because he thinks its what a beach is supposed to bea lot of different kinds of people just hanging out having a good time he thinks thats what lifes supposed to be too micks car is parked in the narrow alley behind his building a silver beemer with the hopeful vanity plate that readsscrnritr ill be a son of a gun boone says theyre here petra asks her voice a little high and excited well his cars here boone says trying to lower her expectations but the truth is hes pretty hopeful that theyre in there too wait in the van he says no way way boone says if i go in the front they might come out the back oh all right then its total bullshit boone thinks as he gets out of the van but it will keep her out of my way he walks up the stairs to micks door and listens faint voices coming from the television other than that nothing boone tries the door its locked there are two windows on this side of the apartment the venetian blinds are closed on both but even through the glass boone can smell the dope mick and tammy must be having a hell of a party boone raps on the door mick nothing yo mick no response so either theyre in there hiding or in the bedroom stoned and cant hear anything well boone thinks if they cant hear anything he kicks the glass in reaches through the hole unlocks the window and slides it open then he climbs through mick penner is asleep on the sofa passed out is more like it hes lying facedown one arm dangling to the floor his right hand still holding a bottle of grey goose boone walks right past him into the bedroom no tammy he opens the bathroom door no tammy he looks at the back door still locked from the inside tammy isnt here and she didnt just go out the back there are no womens clothes no makeup in the bathroom no smell of perfume moisturizer hair spray nail polish nail polish remover it smells like a guys place a guy on a steep downhill slide stale sweat old beer unchanged linens garbage a trace of eau de vomit mick himself reeks when boone steps back into the living room its instantly apparent that the guy hasnt hauled himself into a shower for a few days mick isnt cute or pretty right now if his trophy wives could see him passed out on this couchhis dirty hair disheveled his teeth green with grime dried grunge caked around his lipsthey wouldnt be slipping between the clean crisp sheets of the milano with him if they were in a good mood they might might drop a quarter into his hand and keep moving mick boone gently slaps him across the face mick he slaps him again a little harder mick opens one jaundiced eye what its boone boone daniels wake up mick closes his eye i need you to wake up dude boone grabs him by the shoulders and sits him up the fuck you doing here mick asks you want some coffee yeah you got any boone walks into the kitchen area dirty dishes are piled in the sink or strewn over the counter empty boxes of microwave meals overflow the garbage can or have just been tossed on the floor boone opens the fridge and finds an opened bag of starbucks espresso on the door shelf he dumps the grounds out of the filter in the coffeemaker washes the carafe finds a new filter puts the coffee on and scrubs out a cup while he listens to mick puking in the bathroom mick emerges his face dripping with water where he splashed it on himself fuck dude mick says youve been slamming it boone says hard mick sniffs his armpits god i stink i noticed sorry no worries boone hands mick a cup of coffee thanks its hot bro dont toss it mick nods and takes a sip of coffee boone sees his hand quiver tammy roddick doesnt ring a bell mick says something in micks facea little tension along the jawline the blue eyes going hard the look is unmistakableits the look of a guy whos in love with a woman whos dumped him does this ring a bell boone asks a burglary at the home of a mr and mrs hedigan in torrey pines about three months ago maybe i should go over and ring the hedigans bell ask them if your name nice boone real nice mick says i thought we were friends not really boone says i dont slip my friends twenties to answer questions my friends arent sleazy matinee call boys have you seen

looking at her she had these green cat eyes man that you couldnt take your own eyes off of they were hanging out watching tv one night they had the animal channel on and it was a documentary about leopards and mick looked at her and said those are your eyes babe you have leopard eyes yeah but it wasnt just the sex and it wasnt just her eyeshe loved just being with her man all that corny romantic chickflick bullshit he never believed in mick started doing it man walks on the freaking beach breakfast in bed holding hands talking she was smart man mick says she was funny she was mick

md boardcertified cosmetic surgeon teddy dcup does boobs yeah well he does noses and chins too liposuctions facelifts and tummy tucks but boobs are teddys profit center hence the moniker teddy is the michelangelo of bosoms his work is displayed at society functions beaches runways movies television shows and of course strip clubs wherever finer breasts are seen they are status symbols prestige items its gotten to the point where women actually boast that their tits are by teddy strippers will work for years to save up the cash to get a pair by teddy although the word is that good dr cole does have a scholarship program for girls he considers especially uh promising like tammy according to mick she wanted a bigger rack mick says i told her she didnt need one that she was gorgeous but you know chicks not really boone thinks but he goes along with it i told her if she was going to do it she had to go to the best mick says teddy dcup sure mick says i knew all about him from the hotel believe me i know teddys work up close and personal women who go to the milano can afford teddy but tammy couldnt she saved up mick says you dont know hershes singleminded man once she sets her sights on something i mean it was like work work work money money money so mick shakes his head i drove her to him bro i literally drove her to the first consultation she comes out were in the car were not two blocks away and she tells me maybe we should stop seeing each other do you believe that she traded me in for a new set of tits so shes seeing teddy now shes with him all the fucking time man how do you know that ive followed them mick says is that pathetic or what ive banged half the hot rich babes in this town and im sneaking around following this fucking mercenary cunt stripper sitting in my car like some doof that cheap fuck takes her to this little motel up around oceansidedo you believe that a guy with his kind of money boone gets this sinking feeling hey mick what you didnt do anything to her did you no mick says i thought about it then he asks is she okay boone is she in some kind of trouble why are you looking for her she ever talk about dan silver boone asks the fire at his warehouse she mentioned it happened hes alarmed now all geeked is she okay is she hooked up with dan again i dont know boone says but as your friend im going to strongly suggest you get out of town for a while some people are looking for her who are going to be looking for you you dont want them to find you theyre going to ask the same questions i did but they may not believe your first answers shes in trouble mick says throw some shit in a bag boone says put some serious distance between you and here i have to find her i have to help her you gonna rescue her boone asks then shell take you back i just want her to be okay mick says is that fucked up or what actually boone thinks it might be the least fuckedup thing hes heard all day he warns mick to get out of town again and then he leaves to go see dr theodore cole tweety sits in the office of tng looking at his swollen knee it looks bad it looks like its going to keep him out of the weight room for a while we better get you to the hospital dan says tweety looks sad i dont have health insurance not a problem dan says i got you covered come on dan and the bouncer lift tweety to his feetwell foot carry him outsideand squeeze him into the front seat of a ford explorer the bouncer gets behind the wheel dan gently swings tweetys legs in then gets in the backseat tweety says im gonna kill that fucking daniels well do it for you dan says he tells the bouncer to head south on the down to sharp hospital the nearest urgentcare facility oh man tweety says anybody got any vike or oxy or something i need something to kill the pain dan sticks a pistol in the back of tweetys head and pulls the trigger twice oughta do it he says you roidshooting wrong womankilling stupid son of a bitch did you take a nap petra asks when boone gets back to the van i call them siestas boone says it sounds better he fills her in on his conversation with mick so now we think that tammys with this teddy person petra asks or at least he knows where she is boone says not that this is necessarily good news if tammy went to teddy and asked him for help he could have bought her a firstclass ticket to tahiti for all they know shes sitting on a beach with a mai tai resting on her new chest laughing at everybody wheres this doctors office petra asks right back in la jolla village boone replies within sight of the milano its been that kind of backandforth day but first were going to fuel up she leans over and looks at the fuel gauge the tank is threequarters full i meant me boone says you too if you want its just a couple of blocks to jeffs burger its a matter of nearreligious devotion to boone never to enter the vicinity of jeffs burger without having one of his burgers luckily theres a parking spot right out front boone pulls the van in turns off the engine and asks you want something actually a caesar salad with dressing on the side would be nice you got it he goes in and orders two cheeseburgers with everything when the burgers arrive he dissects one puts the meat into his own burger then scrapes the lettuce tomato and onions into the lid of the plastic goplate and goes back to the van whats this petra asks when he hands her the plate caesar salad dressing on the side in what country may i ask mine boone says if you dont want it the seagulls will she closes the plate and tosses it over her shoulder into the back of the van he shrugs and eats as he drives back up to la jolla village the burger tastes great and makes the drive back there go quickly as they pull into the parking lot of teddys building boone calls information and gets teddys number youre phoning petra asks hard to put one over on you pete why not just march in there and demand to speak with him the receptionist has the perfect cultured voice and boone guesses that she has the perfect chiseled face to match as the first face youd see when you walk into a cosmetic surgeons office she has to be perfect may i help you id like to speak to dr cole boone says do you have an appointment for a telephone consultation no boone says are you a patient is this an emergency im not a patient but id really like to talk to him let me see dr cole had a cancellation in may i could perhaps squeeze you in boone says i was thinking more like now now she asks incredulously now boone says that would be impossible tell teddy that tammy roddick wants to talk to him dr cole is in a consultation the receptionist says i am not going to interrupt him yeah you are boone says because if you dont ill call teddys house and see if mrs dr cole would like to talk with tammy so unless you want to make the current mrs cole the next exmrs cole with all the hassle and alimony that entails not to mention the potentially deleterious effect on your next christmas bonus i suggest you get teddy on the horn and interrupt his consultation im betting hell thank you theres a long stony silence she breaks first ill see if he wants to be interrupted thanks she comes back on a second later with a voice edged in aggravation can you hold for dr cole oh you bet a few seconds later teddy comes on the line this is dr cole my name is boone daniels boone says im a private investigator representing the law firm of burke spitz and culver we have reason to believe that you might have information as to the whereabouts of tammy roddick i dont think i know a tammy roddick teddy says smoothly and without hesitation hes used to denying knowledge of women not only to the gossip media but also to his wives and girlfriends think some more boone says he describes tammy then continues a guy named mick penner says she dumped him for you its credible information doceveryone knows you have a thing for strippers boone daniels teddy says you have a friend whos a prodigious eater hang twelve teddy says i was there that night i lost two hundred bucks can we quit paddling around doc boone asks its important we find tammy roddick theres good reason to believe shes in serious trouble silence while teddy thinks about this and silence isnt the response youd expect boone thinks usually if you tell a guy something like this he instantly asks trouble what kind of trouble so maybe teddy already knows in any case teddy says i dont have to talk to you no you dont boone says but you should look if i figured you out the cops are going to be about a half step behind me and there are other parties what other parties i think you know dan silver another silence then jesus christ teddy says strippers are always trouble if its not one thing its another if they dont want a free boob job then its a nose job or theyre knocked up or they want to go into therapy or they want to get married or they threaten to call your wife what are you going to do boone asks right no boone says i mean what are you going to do look teddy of the possible choices of people you can talk to im the least worst option the cops will charge you with impeding an investigation and you dont even want to know what dan might do hes sort of a cosmetic surgeon himself i see what you mean youre in the deep water boone says i can pull you out you and tammy more thinking can i get back to you on this teddy asks right back five minutes sure boone says im in my office use this number he gives teddy his cell number five minutes teddy says before he gets off the phone you dont think hes actually going to ring you back petra asks i told you we should have just marched right in there she starts to open the door dont do that boone says why not because were not looking for teddy boone says were looking for tammy symmetrical and yet cryptic petra says but what do you mean i mean sit tight she shuts the door then asks deleterious means having a negative or destructive effect boone says youve been holding out on me ape man you dont know the half teddy dcup comes out of the building and strides toward his car teddy cole is a beautiful man literally teddy is a living testament to the reciprocal professional courtesy that exists among topline plastic surgeons teddys been chinsculpted botoxed nosejobbed skinpeeled hair transplanted eyetightened facelifted tummytucked dentalworked lasered and tanned a walking advertisement of his own trade hes about fiveten slim his skin glowing with artificial health the muscles under his black calvin klein silk shirt showing hours at the gym his hair is blond with ash tips his eyes blue his teeth perfectly white teddy has to be in his late fifties but he looks like hes in his early thirties except that his face has been lifted so tight and high that his eyes have a slightly asian look to them boones afraid that if teddy smiles too wide he might actually break but no cause for concern right now because the good doctor isnt smiling his face is set in fierce concentration as he heads for his mercedes youre actually smarter than you look petra says to boone low bar to jump boone says he waits for teddy to pull out of the lot then starts the van and follows can you tail him without him seeing us petra asks tail him well can you if i dont screw it up boone says well dont okay thanks its one of your slower chases as chases go lots of brake lights and waits at traffic signals as they follow teddy up prospect avenue and then north on torrey pines road teddy takes a left onto la jolla shores road and they follow him through the beach community then up the steep hill onto the campus of the university of california at san diego where they meander through the narrow winding road past classroom buildings dorms and graduatestudent apartments boone drops a couple of cars back and follows teddy up to torrey pines past the salk institute and the whole complex of medical research buildings that define the area then its through torrey pines state reserve up to the top of the hill where theres this great sudden view of the ocean stretching out in front of them from torrey pines beach all the way up to the bluffs at del mar highway us highway the pacific coast highway the pch the boulevard of unbroken dreams the yellow brick road you may get your kicks on route but you get your fun on highway you may take to find america but you wont find the american dream until you hit the pch sixtysix is the route but is the destination you travel you arrive at its the end of the road the beginning of the ride back in the backinthe those early surfers lugged their heavy wooden boards up and down what was then a virtually empty highway they had the joint pretty much to themselves a small wandering band of george freeth disciples searching for the promised wave and they found it breaking all up and down they could just pull off the road and hit the beach and they did from ocean beach to santa cruz then world war ii came along and america discovered the california coast hundreds of thousands of soldiers sailors and marines were stationed in san diego and los angeles on their way to the pacific and when they came back if they came back a lot of them settled in the sun and the fun like how are you going to keep them down on the farm after theyve seen laguna while their counterparts were reengaging with american society by creating suburbia and making a religion of conformity these cats wanted to get away from all that they wanted the beach they wanted to surf this was the genesis of the surf bum the image of surfing as not only a culture but as a counter culture for the first time surfers defined themselves in contrast to the dominant culture not for them the ninetofive job the gray flannel suit the tract home two kids manicured lawn swing set and driveway surfing was freedom from all of that surfing was sun sand and water it was beer and maybe a little grass it was timeless time because surfing obeys the rhythms of nature not the corporate time clock it was the antithesis of mainstream america at the time and there came into existence little surfing communitiescall them colonies or even communes if you have toup and down highway and a lot of these surfers were beat man they were the west coast beatniks southern california division who instead of hitting the streets of san francisconorth beach coffeehouses and poetry readingstook their bongos to the real beach and found their dharma in a wave these guys had seen civilization on the battlefields and in the bombedout cities of europe and asia and didnt like it and they came to pacific beach san onofre doheny and malibu to create their own culture they camped on the beaches collected cans to buy food for the cookouts played guitars and ukuleles drank beer and wine screwed beach bunnies and surfed the little surf towns that sat on the like knots on a string grew up around them fastfood stands sold quick cheap burgers and tacos to surfers with didnt have a lot of jangle in their pockets and were in a hurry to get back and catch the next set beachside bars served guys in huaraches and damp board trunks and it was no shirt no shoes no problem in those joints movie theaters in those little towns on the started to show the first primitive surfing movies to packed houses party to follow the surf bums were so far out of mainstream america and yet so very american at the same time in their belief in technology because some of these boys were your tom edison wright brothers geewhiz cando americans who just couldnt help but try to build a better surfboard they took all that technology that came out of world war iiaerodynamics hydraulics and especially the new materials that had emerged and revolutionized the sport bob simmons in la jolla and hobie alter in dana point invented the first practical lightweight board out of a new material polyurethane with the advent of the foam board anyone could surf you didnt need to be a greek god like george freeth anyone could now carry a board down the beach and into the water and these lightweight boards could do maneuvers that the heavy old wood boards just couldnt do instead of riding straight down the face of the wave now the surfer could cut across its face change directions cut back it was the golden age of surfing the s there along the so many goddamn legends were out there challenging the waves testing the limits cruising that highway with their classic woodies looking for the next great break the sweet new ride the secret spot that the newcomers hadnt found miki doraaka da catand greg nollaka da bulland phil edwardsaka the guayule kidthey rode waves nobody had ridden and in ways nobody had ridden them edwards was fifteen fifteen freaking years old when he paddled out into the wave known as killer dana and rode it then he stayed on the beach all summer with his girlfriend cooking potatoes over an open fire living to surf surfing to live along the it must have been heaven then boone thinks as the road plunges down toward the ocean like some kind of water slide like its going to dump you right into the water but then at the last second it veers right and hugs the coastline paradise boone thinkslong lonely stretches of beach with legends walking on water he knows his surf history he knows all the stories knows about da cat da bull the guayule kid and dozens of others you cant not know them and be a real surfer you cant not see their stories every time you drive this road because that history is all around you you drive right past hobies old shop right past the break where bob simmons died in a wave back in past san o where dora and edwards went out together and combined their styles and created modern surfing in that golden age like all golden ages boone thinks as he veers right again crosses the railroad track and climbs up to the famous old beach town of del mar it had to end the golden age was done in by its own success as the culture of highway became the culture of america itself gidgethit the screens in creating a new kind of sex symbolthe california girl freshfaced suntanned bikiniclad sassy healthy and happy gidget its a girl no its a midget its a gidget became a role model for girls all across america girls in kansas and nebraska wanted to be gidget to wear bikinis and cruise the strips of the beach towns gidgetbegat a slew of beach movies which would be forgettable except for lingering images of annette funicello previously of the mickey mouse club who swapped her mouse ears for a bikini these movies featured handsome guys like frankie avalon and bodacious babes like annette and had just a suggestion of sex about them beach blanket bingoin never revealed what was happening on or under the blanket and they usually had a beatnik replete with beret and goatee wander on playing the bongos and they always featured the kids dancing on the beach to music surf music it also came right out of technology in fender guitar developed a reverb unit which produced the big hollow wet sound that became the trademark of surf music in the same year the immortal dick dale and the deltones used the reverb on misirlou featuring the classic dick dale guitar run that sounded like a wave about to break the chantays responded the same year with pipeline in the surfaris released the first breakout national surf hit wipe out with the sarcastic laugh then the famous percussion riff that every teenage drummer in america tried to copy and the surf music craze was on boone inherited all this music from his old man all those old surf bands like the pyraminds the marketts the sandals the astronauts eddie amp the showmen yeah yeah yeah and the beach boys they just blew it up the beach boys had kids all across the world singing surfin safari surfin us a and surfer girl mimicking a lifestyle theyd never lived mouthing the names of places theyd never been del mar ventura county line santa cruz trestles all over manhattan and down doheny way swamis pacific palisades san onofre sunset redondo beach all over la jolla all along highway boone doesnt know the answer to that old ethics question from his freshman year in collegeif knowing what you know now you had a chance to strangle little adolf hitler in the cradlebut hes clear about the answer for brian wilson youd splatter his baby brains all over the bassinet before youd let him make it to the recording studio to turn the into a parking lot by the midsixties every kook with a record player or a transistor radio was hitting the surf crowding the breaks jamming the waves people who never wanted to surf wanted the lifestyle theres a messedup inbred mongrel of a nonword boone thinks lifestyletrying to be both and ending up neither life stylelike pseudo life a bad imitation of something worth living like you dont want the life just the style so they headed out to sunny southern california and fucked it up what was it the eagles sangyou call some place paradise kiss it goodbye well pucker up for highway so many people moved to the socal coast its surprising it didnt just tilt into the ocean it sort of did the developers threw up quickanddirty condo complexes on the bluffs above the ocean and now theyre sliding into the sea like toboggans those little beach towns swelled into big beach towns with suburbs and school systems endless strip malls with the same shit in each of them you had traffic jams traffic jamson the not people trying to go surfingalthough it can be hard to find a parking space at some of the more popular surf spots nowadaysbut commuters on their way back and forth from work so boone missed the golden age of surfing he figures maybe he got in on the bronze age but to him the is still the highway to heaven i never saw the golden age he explained to his dad one time i only see the age im in there are still some golden days along the particularly during the week when the road is relatively free and the beaches arent crowded and the truth is you can still find an empty beach some days you can still have a break all to yourself and there are days when that drive along the is so beautiful it will break your fucking heart when you look out the window and the sun is painting masterpieces on the water and the waves are breaking in a single white line from cardiff to carlsbad and the sky is an impossible blue and people are playing volleyball and your brother and sister surfers are out there just having a good time just trying to catch a wave and you realize you are living in the dream or drive it at dusk when the ocean is golden and the sun an orange fireball with dolphins dancing in the break then the sun flames red and it slips quietly over the horizon and the ocean slides to gray and then to black and you feel a little sad because this day is over but you know it will begin again tomorrow life on highway this is the road that boone takes following teddy north along the coast boone needs to be on his game going through del mar because there are plenty of side streets for teddy to turn onto but the doctor doesnt turn off toward the beach or up into the hills he stays on the main drag and heads north across the old bridge over the san dieguito river on past the famous old racetrack then up through eden gardens and solana beach now the road old highway parallels the railroad track on its right through the town of solana beach and then onto the narrow open stretch of coastline at cardiff which is one of boones favorite places in the world where the highway edges the beach and you feel like you could reach out the car window and touch the water the whitecaps are already peaking tall but nothing to what theyll be this time tomorrow even from the van he can hear the ocean getting ready to go off the big swell starting to build a heavy heartbeat that matches his own the big swell sunnys shot onewave one macker and it changes her life one great photo and she makes the net the magazines she gets the sponsorship shes been working for and its her takeoff shell be all over the world making the tournaments and the big wave contests shell surf hawaii oz indo you name it where did you just go petra asks huh where were you you looked like you were a million miles away just now nope on the job but aware that theyre fast coming up on the funky old surf town of encinitas and the great right break called shrinks arguably the best wave in socal maybe the place to be when the swell rolls in if he werent on the job hed turn in at the small parking lot on the bluff and take a look at how its building out there but i cant he thinks because i have to follow dr dcup to locate a stripper teddy drives up through leucadia where the big eucalyptus trees line the road on the inland side and cheap motels drivethru burgertaco stands and little shops take the ocean side ocean side boone thinks oceanside isnt that where mick penner said that teddy takes tammy for their little matinees well he thinks as he follows teddy through leucadia and across the bridge that spans the batiquitos lagoon into carlsbad were on our way to oceanside the road drops back down again and flanks the long stretch of open beach with its promenade along the breakwater then takes a right jog into the fauxtudor village of carlsbad with its english shingled roofs theres a store here where you can buy all kinds of english food and boone thinks of mentioning this to her but then he figures that she probably already knows about it so he keeps his mouth shut the route curves right again then crosses buena vista lagoon and takes them into oceanside heads up boone thinks teddy takes a right turning east onto highway drives all the way through town and out into the suburbs and developments that house a lot of the marines from camp pendleton then takes a left into the countryside where the hell is he going boone wonders boone drops back a ways because the traffic has thinned out so much then teddy takes a right and heads inland what the hell boone thinks theres not much out here now its one of the few even semirural spaces left in metro san diego county out here by the old sakagawa strawberry fields they cling to the landscape these pieces of old farms they dot the local map like small shrinking atolls in a roiling sea of real estate development in housinghungry san diego buildings are going up everywhere housing developments condo complexes and highrise apartment buildings are taking the place of the old fields of flowers tomatoes and strawberries with the residential developments come the strip malls the highend shopping complexes the starbucks java juices and rubios the vons albertsons and stater bros once a steady but slow tide the building boom became a tsunami flooding the little islands of agricultural land theyre still there but harder to find especially this close to the coast farther inland along highway are the avocado orchards of fallbrook then the vast orange groves among the hillsides and canyons farther south in the flatlands of carmel valley and rancho peсasquitos small fields fight a slow losing war against development surrounded now by new milliondollar spec homes built on the plateaus between the wooded canyons where the illegal workers live in camps of jerryrigged tents and tinroofed shacks up here in oceanside along the banks of the san luis river some of the old strawberry fields stubbornly hold out drought insect infestations depression racism voracious developmentit doesnt matter the farmers hang on they could easily sell the land for far more than they make farming it but that doesnt matter either its a way of life not that you could find a single japaneseamerican a nisei actually working these strawberry fields theyre two generations removed from that the kids and grandkids having moved into the city and the suburbs where theyre now doctors lawyers accountants entrepreneurs and even cops the old man who owns these particular fields wouldnt have had it any other way upward mobility was always the idea and now a different generation of immigrants field hands from mexico guatemala and el salvador work his fields and the kids come to visit for an afternoon in the country old man sakagawa loves seeing his greatgrandchildren he knows that hell be leaving this world soon and he knows that when he passes this world these fields this way of life will pass with him it makes him sad but he also believes what the buddha said that the only constant is change but it does make him wistful that the sakagawa fields will fade like morning mist under a blazing dawn now boone follows teddy east along north river road past a gas station and a food mart then past an old church and then son of a bitch boone thinks fuckedup lovesick mick penner was right the motel is one of those old s places with an office and a line of little cottages in the back someone has tried to freshen the place upthe cottages have recently been painted a bright canary yellow with royal blue trimone of those attempts to make it so retro that its hip teddy pulls into the gravel parking lot and gets out he doesnt stop at the office but goes right toward the third cottage like he knows just where hes going we got her boone says you think so yeah i do he pulls into the parking lot and parks on the other end from teddys car you have your subpoena of course then lets deliver it boone says then ill call johnny banzai and let him know that we have a potentially important witness for him in his fresh murder case then ill go home catch some sleep and be fresh and ready when the big waves hit hes thinking these happy thoughts when teddy suddenly walks back from the cabin carrying a small black bag he walks right past his car then he crosses the road and walks up about fifty yards to a thick bed of reeds that stands between the san luis river and the western edge of the old sakagawa fields whats he doing petra asks i dont know boone says he reaches behind and grabs a pair of binoculars and trains them on teddy as the doctor walks to the edge of the reeds teddy looks around then steps into the reeds inside of two seconds he disappears from sight boone sets the binoculars down and jumps out of the van go look in the cabin see if shes there he says to petra and then he crosses the road and jogs down to the edge of the reeds foot traffic has trampled down the front edge of the reed bed and narrow paths cut into the standing reeds like tunnels soda cans beer bottles and fastfood wrappers lie among small white plastic garbage bags boone picks up one of the bags unties the top and then gags fighting back the vomit the bag is full of used condoms he drops the bag and steps into one of the tunnels that lead through the reeds its like being in another worlddark narrow and claustrophobic the lateafternoon sunlight barely penetrates the tall reeds and boone cant see five feet in front of him so he doesnt see the shotgun the curtains on the cabin windows are open and petra can see into the small front room which has a sofa a couple of chairs a kitchenette area and a table but no tammy petra walks around to the side where another window offers a view of the small bedroom where there is likewise no tammy maybe shes in the bathroom petra thinks she walks around to that side puts her head against the thin wall and listens no sound of running water she waits for a minute hoping to hear the toilet flush or the taps running or anything but its perfectly still for one of the few times in her life petra doesnt know what to do should she wait here in case tammy is inside should she go back to the van and wait in case tammy just hasnt shown up yet but is on her way and how does she know its even going to be tammy and not some other bimbo that teddy is shagging in his bang for boobs program and where was teddy going what could he possibly be doing in a bed of reeds looking for the baby moses for gods sake and what if anything has boone found should i follow him she wonders she decides to go back to the van and wait except waiting isnt her best thing she gives it a shot she does but it isnt going to happen what she really wants to do is go see what boone is finding out she makes it about three minutes then bails mick penner should have bailed that is should have taken boones advice thrown his shit into a bag gotten into his beloved bmw and hit the highway he doesnt though he intended to one of those road to hell deals he meant to get moving but then he decided that one beer and a quick toke would help him get his shit together hes on his third corona when the door comes in dan silvers first punch goes into micks liver and crumples him micks on his knees hunched over in agony sucking for air when the kick comes into his solar plexus and makes breathing an impossibility mick flops on the floor like a fish on the dock then theyre kicking him shoes and boots smashing into his thighs his shins his ankles his ribs he rolls over on one side and pulls his arms over his head and manages to blurt out not my face please not my face his face is his living and he knows it knows now in one of those stark moments of clarity that hes never going to be scrnritr no matter what his license plate reads that the best he can hope for is a few more years of being a parking valetmale whore but he doesnt even get that if they fuck up his face they pick him up and set him down on the sofa you dont want your pretty face messed up dan asks you better tell me what i want to know anything man except what he wants to know is how to find tammy love is a powerful thing elusive ephemeral enigmaticlove can make you do some fuckedup shit it can drive you to depths you never thought youd go it can lift you to heights you never knew you could climb it will show you the worst and the best in yourself love can strip you down to bare shame love can reveal pure nobility mick holds out a long time he loves her he knows that these guys want to hurt her will hurt maybe kill her and he loves her in the end he gives them everything they want but it takes them a while to get it he gives them teddy gives them the motel in oceanside gives them boone he gives up everything and hates himself for it dan leaves almost admiring the dumb shit had to fuck him up real bad before he caved when he comes to they start beating him kicking him cursing him barely conscious boone rolls into a fetal position and covers up his head as the boots fists and the shotgun butt rain down on him and the words pendejo lambioso picaflor a shotgun butt slams into his ankle a few more of these boone thinks and im never walking out of here he opens his eyes sees a pair of feet grabs them and lifts the feet go flying and boone pushes himself up and topples over on the man boones real lucky because this turns out to be the guy holding the shotgun who doesnt really know what hes doing because the safety is still on so boone is able to rip the gun out of his hands boone rolls onto his back points the shotgun up and flips off the safety its only a little the kind farmworkers use to shoot crows but at this range it would do the job there are three mencampesinosmexican farmworkers the man who was holding the shotgun looks about forty maybe a little younger deep brown weatherworn face and a black mustache already flecked with silver his black eyes glare at boone as if to say go ahead and pull the trigger pendejo ive seen worse the kid standing beside him looks scared eyes wide long black hair stuffed under an old yankees cap dirty longsleeved tshirt jeans and ancient torn new balance sneakers hes holding a machete wondering what to do with it the old man has his machete ready to strike poised beside his white straw hat he wears the oldstyle campesino shirt under overalls and old cowboy bootsboone felt the sharp pointed toes digging into his ribs if they wanted to kill me id be dead boone thinks as he struggles to his feet holding the shotgun on them they could have blown my head off or chopped me to pieces with the machetes but they didnt what they wanted to do was to give me a good beating which they sure as hell did teach me a lesson but what boone thrusts the shotgun out a little like i will shoot you and backs his way to the clearing in front of the reed caves a little girl sits there her arms wrapped around her knees rocking herself her legs are dirty under her cheap cotton dress her hair is long and stringy she looks terrified and fingers a small crucifix that hangs around her neck from a thin chain its okay boone says she scoots back deeper into the cave dont be scared boone says fucking moron he tells himself you really think shes not going to be scared by a gьero holding a shotgun he reaches his hand down for her the teenage boy rushes in with the machete i dont want to shoot you boone thinks backing off but the boy keeps coming the blade of the machete gleaming gold in the light of dusk boone takes another step back and raises the gun then at the last second ducks under the blade and swings the gun butt into the boys stomach the boy collapses onto his knees boone sees that the boy is sobbing more in frustration than pain he kicks the machete away from the kids hand hauls the boy up wraps a forearm lock around his throat and sticks the shotgun barrel into the side of his head im leaving now take one step toward me ill paint the air with him he turns around puts the boys body between him and the two campesinos and backs out of the reeds when he gets to the clearing he shoves the boy away the boy turns and stares at him a look of pure hatred the kid spits on the ground then turns and walks back through the reeds boone watches him for a second when he turns around petra is standing there my god she says what happened blood drips from the corner of his mouth and from his nose and he looks like hes been rolled in the dirt youre supposed to be watching the motel he says i was concerned about you she replies apparently for good reason where did you get a shotgun someone gave it to me voluntarily sort of he walks back up the road to the motel teddys car is still there did you find teddy petra asks no he says we should get you to a hospital not necessary he opens the side door of the van and digs around until he finds a small firstaid kit he gets into the front seat twists the rearview mirror and looks into it as he cleans the cuts and scratches on his face swabbing them with pads and then rubbing in antiseptic then he places a bandaid on the cut over his left eye can i help petra says i asked you for help boone says you were supposed to be watching the motel i already apologized for that he finishes applying the bandaid then grabs a vial of pills shakes one out and swallows it what vicodin he says karate candy i didnt find teddy or tammy all i found was a mojado camp a mojadosboone repeats wetbacks illegals they work the fields some of them live in camps usually the camps are tucked up in the canyons this one was in the reeds along the river i wasnt exactly welcome but its weird he thinks that the mojados were so aggressive usually theyll do anything to avoid attention the last thing in the world they want is trouble and beating up a white guy is definitely trouble boone leans forward and rubs the back of his neck annoyed at the ache but grateful that the shotgun hadnt snapped a vertebra and what was teddy doing in there boone asks himself there arent a lot of cosmetic surgery candidates in the mojado camps not any that could afford teddy anyway and why did teddy apparently get a pass while i got a shotgun butt to the neck or maybe teddy didnt get a free ticket maybe hes lying in a heap somewhere maybe worse but what the hell was teddy doing there in the first place well the only thing to do is wait and ask him boone grabs a beanie from the back and pulls it over his head then he slides down in his seat rests his neck against the back of it and closes his eyes what are you doing petra asks grabbing a few zs he says until teddy gets back from doing whatever hes doing but what if you fall asleep i am going to fall asleep boone says thats the idea besides its rule number four these are boones four basic rules about stakeouts if you have a chance to eat eat if theres a place to go to the bathroom go if theres a space to lie down lie down if you can sleep sleep because you never know when youre going to have a chance to do any or all of the four things again but arent you worried about being asleep when teddy comes back petra asks no boone says because youre going to wake me up what if i fall asleep boone laughs and what if you should give up those whatifs boone says theyre gonna kill you he slides farther down in the seat pulls the beanie over his eyes and falls asleep sunny spreads the mat out on the polished floor of her little house in pacific beach and lies down the old bungalow is just a half block from the beach it was her grandparents house they bought it back in the twenties when average people could afford something like that her grandfather died a long time ago her grandmother passed just a few years back after a long sad struggle with alzheimers eleanor day had been quite a woman sunny holds on to the memories of long walks on the beach with her and building sand castles and how her grandmother bought sunny her first surfboard and called her gidget like the tv show sunny loved to stay with grandma at the beach it was her favorite place in the world sunny visited her a lot in the home some days eleanor would know who sunny was other days shed get her confused with her daughter or her sister or an old friend from college it made sunny sad but it didnt stop her from visiting she knew who eleanor was sunny was living in a small apartment when she got the word that her grandmother was gone the dawn patrol came to the funeral and no one was more surprised than sunny when the lawyer told her that she had inherited the old twobedroom bungalow near the beach her grandmother had wanted sunny to have it because she knew that she would appreciate it she does of course it holds a lot of memories a lot of love now she takes a few deep breaths then launches into the rigorous pilates exercises that make up her daily routine she goes at it hard for an hourstretching twisting moving into heavy aerobic drills then stretching it down then she moves over to the old surfboard that she stretched across two cinder blocks she lies down on the board jumps to her knees then instantly up to her feet then she lies back down again she does this a hundred times until the movement is as smooth powerful and automatic as it can be her heart pounding a fine sheen of sweat coating her skin she moves to the free weights and lifts first working her upper body and arms she wants the arm and shoulder strength for paddling and for that sudden burst of speed and energy needed to get into a big wave then she works the trapezium and neck muscles which will help keep her neck from getting snapped in the worstcase scenario of going over the falls headfirst after that she straps weights to her ankles and does leg lifts then picks up a bar and does toe lifts and deep squats strengthening her quads calves and thighs which will help keep her on the board in the big waves while her long legs are an advantage in swimming they work against her in staying on the board so she has to make sure that theyre like steel sunny is a finely honed athlete fiveeleven bigboned with a swimmers broad shoulders negligible body fat and those long legs youre a gazelle dave the love god once said to her as he watched her walk in from the water shes not the gazelle boone said correcting him shes the lioness sunnys always loved boone for saying that well for a lot of things but his saying that was enough to love him and she keeps her body in superb shape with running swimming lifting stretching truth be told its not the ideal surfers body most of the best woman surfers have smaller more compact frameseasier for balance and for the lightningquick turns and shifts that win competitions but sunny plans to turn her size to her advantage a big body she thinks for the big waves so far bigwave riding has been pretty much a male preserve there are a few women starting to ride them but still plenty of room for a female surfer to stand out in a male lineup she knows she has the size weight and strength to handle the thunder crushers up to now shes been caught in a vicious circle you need money to travel to the big waves in hawaii and tahiti but without sponsorship she doesnt have the money but she cant get a sponsorship until she rides the big waves but in order to ride the big waves she has to travel but now the big waves are coming to her almost literally to her back door and all she has to do is walk outside paddle out and catch one of the big mackers the beaches and bluffs will be lined with photographers and video guys and all she needs is one ride one monster ride with her tawny hair waving like her personal flag against the black wave and she knows that her picture will be on the front cover of the mags and the sponsorship will follow so lift she tells herself push past the pain its only pain every fiberripping lift will help you stay up in that wave this is what youve been training for for months for years all your life so do one more one more one more the lifting done she goes back on the mat and stretches some more then lies back breathes and imagines herself riding the big wave its not mere fantasizing she carefully breaks it down moment by moment from the paddle in to the drop to the heavy right break into the tube then out again with the blast of spray she imagines it again and again each time in more detail and in each repetition she does it stronger and better she never imagines missing the wave or wiping out or getting sucked over the falls sunny keeps it rigorously positive the sound of her moment coming to her she gets up wipes herself down with a towel and sits and listens to the ocean petra watches boone sleep its a somewhat edifying experience in that shes never actually watched a man sleep before not that there havent been men in her bed but she has typically fallen asleep before they have or preferably they have gotten up and left after the sexual act and a decent period of cuddling although truth be told she could do without the latter it seems to be expected however even though she suspects that the man could dispense with it as well if shes in the mans bed she gets up and leaves after the polite interval because she prefers to sleep alone and especially wake up alone shes hardly decentphysically emotionally or psychologicallyuntil shes had that first cup of lapsang souchong and besides the last thing she wants to be doing in the morning is looking after a mans needs feigning cheerfulness as she makes him coffee eggs sausages and the like thats what restaurants are for now she watches boone daniels sleep and shes fascinated one moment the man was totally utterly awake and one second later he was just as totally utterly asleep as if he didnt have the proverbial care in the world as if he werent financially bereft as if he didnt have a crucial witness to locate as if an apparently violent gangster wasnt out to harm him as if i werent even here she admits to herself is that whats bothering you she asks herself that this man can simply ignore you to the extent of actual unconsciousness ridiculous she tells herself why would you care if this primitive doesnt find you as fascinating as lets face it most men do its not as if you have any interest in him not as if youve made the slightest effort to attract him of course you never make the slightest effort she thinks be truthful woman youre very lazy when it comes to that lazy because you can be because a frank assessment in the mirror tells you so and because men tell you so they act like idiots and theyre ridiculously easy to bring into your bed if thats what you want not that there have been that many a few wellselected wellheeled polite appropriate sexual partners one or two of whom she had considered as potential husbands and who she supposes have evaluated her as a potential wife but they are all much too careeroriented and face it selfish for marriage at least at this point in her life in any case perhaps after she makes partner she might seek out a more serious relationship perhaps find a man who might be a suitable husband in the meantime shes content to find the occasional young lawyer or banker whos appropriate to take to company dinners and even more occasionally to bed or am i she wonders so content you are lonely she admits to herself it isnt a sudden revelation an epiphany of sorts but more of a creeping realization that shes been missing something something she never thought she wanteda close emotional connection with another person the realization shocks her shes always been as long as she can remember totally selfsufficient which is the way she likes it but now shes beginning to feel that she needs somebody and she doesnt like the feeling at all she regards boone again how can the man sleep at a time like this she briefly considers waking him up but then rejects the idea maybe im just jealous she thinks envious at this ability to sleep so easily she doesnt fall asleep easily or sleep particularly well instead she lies awake thinking about cases about things she needs to do secondguessing herself about decisions shes made worrying about them worrying about how shes perceived at the firm whether shes working hard whether shes working too hard and arousing dangerous jealousies she worries about her wardrobe her hair she worries about worrying half the time she cant sleep because shes worrying about not getting enough sleep if it werent for ambien she might not sleep at all but this waterlogged cromagnon with a pi license she thinks he sleeps like a baby it must be true then ignorance is bliss her mind turns to the girl at the restaurant that morning the tall athletic creature with the tawny hair clearly hes sleeping with her and who could blame him shes gorgeous but what on earth could she see in him she could have any man she wanted so why does she choose this could he be that good in bed worth having to wake up to certainly not its a mystery shes working it through when she sees teddy walking up the road ouch boones awake even before he feels petras elbow dig into his ribs you develop a sixth sense on stakeouts after a while you can be asleep but theres an internal alarm clock that will wake you up when somethings going down boone pulls his beanie up and sees petra pointing down the road at teddy he has a little girl with him the girl from the reeds stay in the van but i said stay in the fucking van boone snaps in a voice that even petra doesnt question he gets out of the van and walks toward the cabin it has a central front door with a small window on either side a front sitting room leads into a back bedroom and a bath the curtain is open on one of the windows and boone sees teddy sitting on the bed next to the girl shaking some pills from a vial into his hand boone feels like kicking the motel door in then beating the uncouth piss out of teddy until the good doctor needs a cosmetic surgeon for himself because teddy dcup with access to literally hundreds of beautiful women is feeding roofies to a little girl in a motel room preparatory to raping her and now boone knows what the good dr cole was doing in the strawberry fieldsshopping for a family so fucking desperate theyd sell their daughter to him and the mojados who worked boone over in the reeds were taking his back its a beautiful world boone throws his shoulder into the door which splinters around the bolt lock and opens hes into the bedroom in three long strides and has teddy by the shirtfront on the fourth he lifts teddy up and holds him in the air the girl screams and runs out the door this isnt what it looks like teddy says christ boone thinks does every fucking child molester have to say that every fucking time no dude its always what it looks like boone pivots and slams teddy into the wall pulls him in toward his own chest and then slams him again teddy yells im helping her yeah ill bet you are boone thinks he takes his right hand off teddys shirt clenches it into a tight fist and cocks his arm ready to blast teddys face into oatmeal except suddenly it isnt teddys face its russ rasmussens boones world goes red tilting crazily like a bad wipeout boone through the red haze he hears petra gets that she disapproves but he doesnt care boone he turns around to tell her to butt out dan silver is holding a gun to her head two of his boys stand behind him let him go boone dan says the world comes level again back into focus boone says hes a short eyes well take care of him dan says let him go now or ill put two in her pretty head before i do you boone looks at petra her pale skin is absolutely white her eyes are big and full of tears and her legs quiver shes scared to death boone lowers his clenched fist but then jams his palm into teddys ribs before releasing his grip on the man teddy slides to the floor good thing for you i showed up dan says to him before this barbarian beat the shit out of you i feel like the cavalry riding in nick of time and all that happy bullshit youre coming with me voluntarily arent you dr cole yes i am help him up dans boys take teddy by the arms and walk him out the door this isnt over teddy says boone dan gestures at petra you banging this daniels boone doesnt answer no you aint dan says shes much too juicy for you he turns to petra you get tired of slummin you want a real man you come see me honey ill take good care of you she hears herself say id rather fuck a pig dan smiles but his face turns red maybe we can work that out for you bitch enough boone says youre in no position to i said enough boone repeats something in his voice tells dan to back off before he has to shoot this guy and this guy is eddies asshole buddy something about him pulling eddies brat out of the drink or something and the last thing in the world dan needs right now is more problems with red eddie stay in here for a few minutes dan says you come out friend of eddie or not ill smoke you her too he takes a moment to leer at petra and then walks out you okay boone asks petra she sits down heavily on the bed and puts her head in her hands boone understands it you get a gun pointed at your head it changes you it makes you realize how quickly you could not exist anymore in that second all you want is your lifedesperately ferventlyand youd give almost anything for it and that moment of realization changes you as a person youre never quite the same after you realize youd do almost anything to live but talk about guts id rather fuck a pig to a guy who has a gun pointed at your head thats a crazy sick kind of courage he walks over and puts his hand on her head strokes her hair a little and says its all right youre okay i was so afraid she says then boone realizes that shes crying you were amazing he says really brave a second later they hear two shots pop pop what they call executionstyle the girl runs back into the reeds because she doesnt have anywhere else to go her name is luce she doesnt find anyone in the reeds theyre all gone now so she crawls into one of the little caves huddles there and says the rosary as she rubs the little crucifix it will be a cold night she knows but the other girls will be back at dawn she wraps her arms around her knees and waits for the sun to rise again dan silver sits beside teddy cole in the backseat of the explorer he grabs teddys right index finger and says your hands are your life arent they doc teddys chinsculpted botoxed nosejobbed skinpeeled hairtransplanted eyetightened facelifted tummytucked dentalworked lasered and tanned face turns absolutely white with fear he tries to speak but the words get jammed in his throat all he can manage is a weak shaky nod hands of a surgeon right dan asks thats what you are cosmetic surgeon to the stars niptuck so what if i start breaking your fingers one by one starting with your thumbs its going to hurt like you wouldnt believe doc and afterward no more strippers starlets and trophy wives for you teddy tries to hold out for luces sake for tammys sake for the sake of his own soulif that isnt a hopeless antiquated concept he holds out until dan starts counting down from ten he makes it to six im only going to ask you once dan says and im really hoping i dont have to ask you ten times where is tammy roddick the boonemobile rests on its front bumper like a wounded bull on its front knees exhausted in the ring its front right tire is flat boone looks at the van god damnit i thought they shot teddy petra says she goes into the front seat and roots around in her purse they took my phone mine too boone says its a good thing i took teddys he pulls teddys razr out of his pants pocket and scrolls through teddys call history seventeen calls in the past two days made to the same number he punches it in tammy picks it up right away like shes been waiting for the call teddy tammy asks her voice sounds anxious worried scared where are you tammy who is this wherever you are boone says get out now what are you teddy is on his way boone says with dan and some of his thugs he gave you up tammy he wouldnt do that he wouldnt want to boone says but i guarantee you if he hasnt already he will get out let me meet you somewhere i can help you who are you petra hall is here with me oh fuck you want to talk with her no tammy says look boone says you have no reason to trust me but you have to get out now i dont know let me meet you somewhere boone says ill pick you up take you somewhere safe she clicks off damn it boone says he gets on the horn to hang twelve while he goes into the back of the van pulls out a spare tire and a jack then goes to work on the car i could do that for you petra says ill bet you could boone says fitting the tire on but i dont want you to wreck your clothes boone gets the tire on tightens down the lugs and releases the jack hes putting it back into the van when hang calls back he has the number traced the institute of self awareness was founded back in the s of course if there was any single word that typified that decade it was self some shrink came down from esalen with a head full of acid and a trust fund and bought the old episcopalian retreat that had been founded on a bluff above one of the best right breaks on the entire west coast the shrink didnt surf but didnt mind those who did using the stairs on the south side of his property to go out and hit that marvelous break to honor that generous man and because the institute of self awareness was too cumbersome to pronounce all the time the beach below the retreat simply became known as shrinks the institute of self awareness became first a hippie and later a new age retreat where people could check into a room eat vegetarian meals take meditation seminars yoga classes and otherwise become aware of themselves what does that mean dave the love god asked boone one day while they were sitting in the lineup at shrinks waiting for the next set and looking up at the retreats cottages it has nothing to do with masturbation sunny told hang twelve i dont know boone said i guess you just do it yeah but do what dave asked whatever it is then the set came in and they forgot about the question boone had only been vaguely aware that the place was even called the institute of self awareness anyway he had always known it as shrinks had carried his board down those wooden steps probably hundreds of times and there was no way he was ever going to check into a room eat vegetarian meals take meditation seminars yoga classes and otherwise become selfaware for one thing he couldnt afford the steep room rate for another thing he wasnt introspectively inclined for a third and final thing he was already pretty aware of who he was if there is one thing that can be said about boone sunny day proclaimed during a reasonably drunken session at the sundowner after closing time it is that he knows who he is thats true boone said i surf i eat i sleep i work sometimes high tide said sometimes boone said and every now and thenmore then than nowi make love and thats about it but now he wishes that he had gone to the place at least once so hed know the lay of the land because now hes pretty sure thats where tammy is the institute of self awareness has developed a specialized and lucrative clientele to wit peopleespecially famous peoplewho have become aware that their real selves might need a little cosmetic surgery need a place where they can hide from the prying eyes of the public while the swelling goes down the black eyes fade and time passes before they reemerge into the world with their new noses breasts faces lips stomachs butts or all of the above so the isa now makes a lot of its income by providing a cocoon in which celebrities can hide until they fully morph into their new selves and the institute zealously guards its clientele against the paparazzi the tabloids and the just plain curious the founding shrink may not have thrown up any fences against the surfers but the new management has built high walls to shield its guests against even the longest lenses of the paparazzi the walls are topped with strands of barbed wire and motion sensors lest anyone should try to climb in beefy security guards patrol the perimeter and man the front gate of the reception room barring entrance to everyone but expected visitors and attending physicians so while tourists and local visitors can walk around the gardens all they want to get into the private part of the retreat itself is akin to entering the gates of troy teddy can walk right in theodore cole md is a cash cow for the institute of self awareness teddy not only has strippers in there recovering from boob jobs he has hollywood stars and starlets orange county trophy wives who want a little distance from their home turf and san diego society matrons from la jolla who have coincidentally discovered their need for spirituality along with their facelifts so if teddy wants to store a girlfriend inside the walls for a night or two the welcome mat is out and if teddy says that no one is going to get in there to look for her then no one is going to get in there to look for her when the explorer pulls into the parking lot of the institute of self awareness the driver rolls down the window and teddy now in the front passenger seat leans across and waves to the guard good evening dr cole the guard says giving a slight stink eye to the car full of guys who dont look like theyre seeking any kind of awareness self or otherwise im just going in to check on a client teddy says feeling dans pistol jammed into the back of the seat against his spine should i call ahead the guard asks no dan murmurs no teddy says the gate swings open the explorer goes through and the gate swings shut behind it teddy directs the driver to a small parking lot now take us to where she is dan says and doc if you mess with me im going to put one in your spine teddy leads them along the curving walkways lit by the little solarpowered lamps most of the guests are in their cottages but a few are out taking a stroll around the grounds one in particular a tall redheaded woman in a white terrycloth robe attracts dans attention hey is that dan says then names a famous movie actress could be teddy says whats she getting a boob job nose teddy says she wanted her nose shaved down a tuck around the eyes a little something to hold off the day when she has to play the bitch mother or the eccentric aunt but teddys mind isnt really on that hes thinking about some way that he can tip tammy off get her out of there before he doesnt even want to think about what happens after the before as they approach tammys cottage he can see lights on through the curtain of the front window you got a key dan asks him well its a card what the fuck ever dan says you let yourself in you leave the door open behind you got it doc yeah doc what if youre thinking about trying to be a hero dan says stop thinking you may be boss hog in the operating room but this aint your world hoss it will just get you in the wheelchair basketball league tell me you understand i understand good open the door teddy walks up to the lotus cottage its always been one of his favorites redolent with memories teddy has put some serious talent in the lotus cottage and has gotten some head in there that you wouldnt believe hand shaking he fumbles with the card and eventually manages to insert it into the lock the little green light comes on followed by the soft click of the lock opening teddy gently pushes the door open a crack and says tammy its me dan shoves him out of the way and steps into the cottage the living room is all done in white bone white walls with blackandwhite photographs of lotuses in silver frames and a flatscreen plasma television set a white sofa white chairs the wood floor is painted black but the carpets white tammy isnt in the living room dan moves toward the closed bedroom door he nudges it open with the toe of his boot and then steps through pistol up and ready to shoot shes not in the bedroom which is similarly decorated white walls blackandwhite photos white bedspread on the double bed and a flatscreen television smaller than the one in the living room the guests must watch a fuck of a lot of tv while theyre selfactualizing dan thinks as he moves to the bathroom door and listens the shower is running one of them fancy new rain showers by the sound of it he leans into the bathroom door its locked women always lock the door when theyre taking a shower dan thinks he blames it on psycho dan leans back and launches a kick into the door the jamb splinters with a crash dan steps into the bathroom and points the gun to his left toward the shower but she aint in it and the window is open a steep set of stairs runs down to the beach from the back of shrinks it cuts through a berm of red clay planted with succulent anklehigh ground cover that blossoms red in the spring but now looks silver and glossy under motionactivated lamps set in the ground every twenty feet dan negotiates the stairs with surprising grace for a big man he holds the pistol in one hand the other glides along the pipe railing as he calls tammy i just want to talk with you baby if shes out there she doesnt answer the night fog is coming in fast already obscuring the water and the beach dan pauses on a landing and listens tammy dan yells theres nothing to be afraid of we can work this out girl he waits for an answer the pistol poised to shoot in the direction of a voice no response comes but then he hears footsteps running down the stairs below him dan chases her down the stairs onto the beach into the fog boone and petra run down the stairs at sea cliff park just south of shrinks boone trying to hear tammy as she whispers into her phone hes coming i can hear him keep coming this way boone says were almost there he makes it down to the beach and looks north the direction tammy should be coming from but its tough to see anythingthe fog has moved in and set up housekeeping for the night and the moon hasnt thought about getting up yet tammy boone says can you see me no boone peers into the fog then he sees her dressed only in a white robe she looks like a ghost or maybe an escapee from a mental hospital her long red hair disheveled and wild in the moist night air shes running as much as she can run in the heavy sand her long legs working against her struggling for balance shes not even sure what shes running toward just a voice on the other end of a telephone saying he was going to help her at first she didnt believe him but there was something in the voice that changed her mind she sees him and tries to run faster boone trots toward her grabs her as she falls into his arms gasping for breath hes behind me she says dan she nods and gulps some air petra comes up and helps boone lift tammy to her feet tammy looks at her ill testify ill do anything you want good thank you lets get you out of here boone says the shot comes out of the fog johnny banzai hears the shot you dont hear a lot of gunshots in encinitas especially not west of the pch and certainly not in the proximity of the institute of self awareness where people do not tend to find themselves at the wrong end of a gun no the guns around shrinks tend to be surfboards not firearms gunshots are going to grab any cops attention but these shots really reach out and grab johnnys head because theyre coming from the direction of his destination the aforementioned isa and johnnys aware that hes getting there in the wake of boone daniels boone caught this wave first and johnny jumped in and now theyre both pumping it to get to the real tammy roddick first johnny has some very pointed questions to ask her he has some equally sharp queries for boone and he wants to know from both of them what they have to do with the jane doe lying beside the motel pool it didnt take all that long to find out that the jane doe wasnt tammy then he went to roddicks place of employment totally nude girls and found out that a tammys boyfriend had been mick penner b she dumped him for teddy dcup and c boone was a step ahead of him a quick visit to teddys la jolla office and the flash of a badge got teddys receptionist to give up that the good doctor was on his way to make a house call at shrinks after getting a phone call from a man who claimed that he was tammy roddick classic boone goddamn him except now johnny hears shots and he hopes to hell that he gets to arrest boone and not do an investigation on his killing he opens his window attaches the flasher unit to the roof of the car and hits the siren then he gets on the radio and calls for uniformed backup shots fired plainclothes officer approaching the scene its dark and rainy out and he doesnt want to be standing there with a gun in his hand when nervous uniforms show up they might see the gun before they see the badge then he pushes the pedal to the floor banzai chess with guns in the night and fog cool game in theory scarier than shit in practice adrenalinepumping assclenching heartracing scary a paintball freaks wet dream but these bullets arent loaded with paint theyre lead and if you fuck up youre not going to get splattered youre going to get splattered boone tries to move himself and the two women through the muted fireworks display without getting shot which isnt easy because the beach is narrow at high tide and dan and his two boys keep closing off the space boone cant make a break toward the bluffs because they have that covered and he cant get them up or down the beach because they have that sealed off dan shoots and makes his target move shoots and makes them move againand each time they move he directs his guys and closes off the space just like in the ring hes patiently walking them down working them into the corner for the kill boone hears sirens in the distance cops are coming but are they going to come in time in the dark and fog the shooters will take more chances than they otherwise would knowing they can probably get away in the mist and confusion so the question he thinks as he pushes petra and tammy to the sand and lies on top of them is whether or not he has time to wait for the cavalry to ride in a spray of bullets zipping just over his head makes up his mind the police are going to get there in time to find their bodies so they have to make a move theres only one place left to go high tide sits in the sundowner enjoying an end of the workday beer the end of the workday beer is the best beer there is with the possible exception of the occasional weekend morning breakfast beer or the post surf session on a hot afternoon beer but high tide likes the end of the workday beer best because as a supervisor for the san diego public works department he puts in a hard long workday josiah pamavatuu aka high tide is a busy man when weather like this pulls in hell have crews out for the next few days and hell have to keep track of them all making sure that theyre getting the job done keeping the water flowing smoothly underneath the city its a lot of responsibility thats okayhigh tide is up to it hes enjoying his brew when red eddie comes in and sits down on the stool beside him howzit brah eddie asks howzit buy you a beer tide shakes his head driving brah just one before home to the kids good man what you want eddie tide asks bruddahcant have a beer wid a bruddah he dont want somethin eddie asks he raises a finger points it at tides beer and the bartender brings him one of the same youre about da business eddie tide says okay business eddie says your buddy boone what about him hes on a wave he shouldnt be on i dont tell boone what he can ride if youre his friend you would eddie says you threatening him tide asks his fist tightens on the beer mug dopposite eddie says im trying to toss him a line pull him in hes looking for some wahine shes causing a lot of aggro if certain peoples was to locate the chick first boones out of the impact zone you know what i mean boone can take care of himself tide says but hes worried why eddies approaching him about this he waits for the other sandal to fall doesnt take long you have a cuz in waikiki eddie says zeke its true like a lot of samoans zeke moved to hawaii five years ago to try to make some money it didnt work out that way what about him hes an icehead tell me something i dont know the whole familys been worried sick about zeke his mother cant sleep cant eat her dinner she begged tide to go over straighten him out and tide took some sick days flew to honolulu sat down and tried to talk some sense into zeke got him into rehab zeke was out three days went back to the pipe last time tide heard zeke was sleeping rough out in waimalu park only a matter of time before he ods or some other icehead takes him out for a dime ice is the devil what you saying tide asks im saying i can get the word out eddie says zeke is taboo you help boone see things right deliver this girl to the proper address no dealer in the islands will sell zeke a taste tide knows its a serious offer red eddie has that kind of reach all he has to do is put out the word and no dealer in his right mind would even be seen talking to zeke theyd run away from him like he had leprosy zeke would have to straighten out dont say yes dont say no eddie finishes half his beer lays a twenty on the bar and gets up dont say nothin ill know by your actions what your answer is i just think brah we island guys have to stick together were the ohana eh aiga eddie heads for the door one of his moke boys opens it for him and he walks out flashing tide the shaka sign as he goes the devil comes in many forms the serpent to eve ice to a tweeker this time its a rumor that wafts through the sundowner like warm air under the ceiling fans the boonemobile is parked by shrinks daniels must be checking out shrinks if daniels is there he must be scoping it out for the big swell its going to peak at shrinks tide finishes his beer walks out to his truck and heads north family is family johnny banzai rolls up to the security shack at the institute of self awareness and stops in front of the gate im sorry sir the guard says this is private property you cant come in here actually i think i can he shows the guard his badge the guard tries to hang do you have a warrant detective yeah johnny says my warrant is if you dont open that fucking gate like two seconds ago im going to drive through it anyway then first thing in the morning a battalion of health inspectors is going to arrive for a close look at the sushi and the celebrities then the fire inspectors are going to the gate opens johnny drives through navy seals do it in training but theyre freaking navy seals lie in the ocean in winter at night that is not moving as frigid water washes over them drops their body temps toward hypothermia makes them shake uncontrollably their bones and flesh aching with cold but thats what boone petra and tammy do as danny and his boys hunt the beach for them boone wraps an arm around each woman and holds her as hard as he can feels them shiver as he tries to relax his own body its the only way to survive psychologicallyforce yourself to relax not tighten up cold and wet are a deadly combo you can survive cold you can tolerate wet but the two of them together can kill you send your body into shock or force you out of the water into lethal gunfire boone knows they dont have a lot of time left he looks over at petra her face is set in grim determination stiff upper lip and all that happy crap but the woman is holding on shes a lot tougher than she looks tammys eyes are shut tight her lips clamped together her jaw muscles locked shes holding on boone tightens his grip on both of them dan is puzzled he had daniels and the two broads in a box and theyre gone just gone like the fog wrapped them up and took them he looks out toward the surf no way he thinks no fucking way thats suicidal the cop sirens come closer and dan hears footsteps running down the stairs turns to see those big cop flashlights piercing the fog time to boogie high tide turns into the parking lot at sea cliff park and pulls up next to the boonemobile boone aint in it what the hell tide wonders is boone doing up here on the bluff over the south end of shrinks at night checking out the surf really bruddah tide heads down the stairs toward the beach hurts his knee walking down stairs but what are you going to do he has to have a word with boone and down the stairs is where boone is apparently at except he aint when tide gets down on the sand he doesnt see boone standing there checking out the waves all he sees is fog then he spots something in the shallow white water at first he thinks its a dolphin but a dolphin wouldnt be in the trench in this weather and he sees only one and dolphins travel in groups must be driftwood something came in with the tide the driftwood stands up boone high tide yells hamo brother high tide walks into the water and grabs boone then sees that there are two women with him boone grabs one of them tide the other and they stagger onto the beach boone mumbles tide easy bro are they theyre okay tide takes off his jacket and wraps it around the smaller woman whos shivering uncontrollably then he takes off his wool beanie and puts it on the head of the tall redheaded woman its not enough but it will help for the time being boone says how did you beachbongo telegraph high tide says words all along the coast youre here we gotta get off this beach boone says he hefts the smaller woman into a firemans carry petra starts to say i can i know you can he carries her anyway tide easily sweeps up the redheaded woman and holds her close to his chest as they climb the steps back up to the parking lot when they get there tide grabs two blankets and some towels from the back of his truck as boone starts to undress petra what are you doing she murmurs have to get you out of these boone says hypothermia give me a hand hamo boone his fingers trembling with cold strips petra down to her underwear wraps her tightly in the blanket then vigorously rubs her hair dry while tide does the same with tammy how about you tide asks im okay boone says they get the women into the cab of tides truck then tide starts the engine and cranks the heater on full blast boone goes to the back of his van strips down towels off and changes into a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt tide climbs into the van sup brah its complicated tide boone says can you give me a hand i need to buy some time what you got in mind when boone tells him high tide objects its the boonemobile man but boone puts the van in neutral and he and tide push it to the edge of the bluff then take a running start and shove it through the thin wooden guardrail goodbye boone says the van launches off the edge stays upright for a second then somersaults down onto the beach a second later a muffled explosion goes off then a small tower of flame rises up through the fog hell of a bonfire on the beach tonight a viking funeral for the boonemobile the devil doesnt give you easy choices if he did he wouldnt be the devil just some gyppo piker wannabe masquerading as the real deal the real devil doesnt ask you to choose between good and evil for most people thats too easy most people even when faced with temptations beyond their previous imaginings will choose to do good so the real devil asks you to choose between bad and worse let a family member die of a horrible addiction or betray a friend thats why hes the devil man and when hes really on his game he doesnt make you choose between heaven and hell he gives you a choice between hell and hell josiah pamavatuu is a good man no doubt about it now he drives his truck with two wet and shivering women at his side and his best friend in the back a man who is like family to him but like aint is is is is johnny banzai finds a shaken teddy dcup drinking an organic martini in the lotus cottage wheres tammy roddick johnny asks him teddy points his thumb in the general direction of the beach from whence comes an explosion and a ball of flame hang twelve runs pushing off on all twelve toes he hoofs it as hard as he can toward sunnys house like hes trying to pump the fear through his bloodstream and out of his body it aint working hang is terrified word traveled down to pacific beach with the speed of rumor itself the boonemobile went off the bluff at sea cliff park and burst into flames boone daniels hasnt been found the firemen are there now theres already talk of a paddleout and a memorial service after the big swell is over hang doesnt know what to do with his fear so he takes it to sunny you gotta understand where hes coming from where he came from father a tweeker mother a drunk brian brousseaus home life if you want to call it that was a bad dream during a nightmare brian got about as much care and attention as the cat and you dont want to see the cat he was about eight when he started picking up the leftover roaches lying around the crappy little house brian liked the feeling he got from smoking the roaches it eased his fear muffled the fights between his mom and dad helped him get to sleep by the time he was in junior high he was toking up every day before and after school when school was finally over hed wander down to the beach smoke up and watch the surfers one day he was sitting in the sand just toasted when this surfer came out of the water walked up to him and said i see you here every day grom brian said uhhuh how come you just watch boone asked how come you dont surf dont know how brian said dont have a board boone nodded thought about it a second looked down at the skinny little kid and said you want to learn ill show you brian wasnt so sure you a fag man you want to ride or not dude brian wanted scared as shit but he wanted i cant swim he said then dont fall off boone said he looked down at brians feet dude do you have six toes twelve boone chuckled thats your new name gremmiehang twelve okay stand with your feet about shoulder width boone said hang got up boone shoved him in the chest hang stepped back with his right foot to keep his balance what youre a goofyfoot boone said leftfooted lie down on the board hang did on your stomach boone said jesus hang turned over now jump up on your knees boone said good now into a squat good now stand boone made him do it twenty times by the time hang finished he was sweating and breathing hardit was the most exercise hed done maybe in his lifebut he was totally into it this is fun dude its even more fun in the water boone said he led hang out to where some small waves were coming in shallow had him lie down on the board and pushed him into a wave hang rode it in like a boogie board instalove hang kept boone out there all frigging afternoon until the sun set and after on his third ride he tried to stand he fell off on that wave and the next thirtyseven the sun was a bright orange ball on the horizon when hang stood up on the board and rode it all the way to shore first thing hed ever achieved the next day was saturday and hang was out there first thing in the morning standing on the beach and staring out at the dawn patrol whos the grem dave asked from the lineup a stoner kid boone said i dunno he looked lost so i took him out a stray puppy sunny said i guess boone said he took to it though grems are a pain in the ass dave warned we were all grems once sunny said not me dave said i was born cool anyway it was tacit permission to go bring the kid in boone got off the board on his next ride and went up to hang you wanna surf hang nodded yeah okay boone said i have an old stick in my quiver over there its a piece of shit a log basically but it will ride get it out wax it then ill show you how to paddle out you stay close to me out of other peoples way try not to be a total kook okay okay hang waxed the board paddled out and got in everyones way but thats what grems doits their job the dawn patrol ran interference for him both with the ocean and the other surfers no one messed with the kid because it was clear that he was under the dawn patrols collective wing hang took the board home that night leaned it against the wall next to his bed hang might have been invisible at home he might have been a nothing at school but now he had an identity he was surfer he was dawn patrol now he runs toward sunnys house gets to her door and pounds on it a few minutes later a sleepy sunny comes to the door hang what its boone he tells her about boone cheerful sits at the hovel that is boones desk trying to balance the books boone daniels is a perpetual pain in the ass immature irresponsible a hopeless businessman but what were you cheerful asks himself before boone came into your life a lonely old man boone once saved him several million dollars in alimony when the businessman uncharacteristically fell head over heels in love with a twentyfiveyearold hooters waitress for whom he bought a new rack and fuller lips to heighten her low selfesteem her selfimage lifted she promptly felt herself attractive enough to screw a twentyfiveyearold wannabe rock star and begin a television career that she intended to finance with california community property boone felt bad for the lovesick old guy and took the case took the pix made the video and never showed either of them to cheerful he did show them to the soontobe exmrs cheerful and told her to take her big tits full lips guitarstroking boyfriend and a k alimony settlement get out of san dog and leave cheerful the hell alone why should i she asked because hes a nice old man and you fucked him over he got his moneys worth she said then she looked at him with an expression of lust she no doubt learned from porn videos and asked you want proof look boone replied youre hotter than hell and im sure youre the whole barrel of monkeys in bed but one i like your husband two id cut my junk off with a jagged shitencrusted tin can lid before id ever stick it anywhere near you and three ill not only take your home movies and photo album into court but ill put them on the net and then well see what that does for your television career she took the walkaway deal and made it big on tv playing the second lead the sassy best friend on a sitcom thats been draining viewer iqs for years what do i owe you cheerful asked him afterward just my hourly but thats a few hundred cheerful said you saved me millions you should take a percentage im offering just my hourly boone said that was the deal cheerful decided that boone daniels was a man of honor but a crap businessman and therefore he made it his hobby to try to get boone on some sort of sound financial footing which is something like trying to balance a threelegged elephant on a greased golf ball but cheerful persists anyway you had money sure he tells himself now but nothing else youd do your books count your money and sit around your condo eating microwave meals watching television cussing out the padres middle relief and thinking about how miserable you were ben carruthersmultimillionaire real estate genius total personal failure no wife no kids no grandkids no friends boone opened up the windows let some air and sunshine in the dawn patrol brought youth into your life hell it brought life into your life much as you grouse about themwatching these kids getting to be a part of their lives sticking your beak into boones cases playing the curmudgeonthey make it worth getting up in the morning boone dave johnny high tide sunny even hang twelvetheyre precious to you admit it you cant imagine life without them without boone the kid hang twelve sits staring at the phone willing it to ring cheerful thinks he needs to say something to the kid hes okay i know but he doesnt neither of them do you hungry he asks hang no you have to eat cheerful says he takes a twenty from his wallet hands it to hang go over to the sundowner get us a couple of burgers bring them back i dont really feel like it hang says did i ask you what you felt like cheerful says go on now do what i tell you hang takes the money and leaves cheerful goes to the yellow pages gets the number of silver dans and calls it let me speak to dan silver he says tell him ben carruthers is on the line he waits impatiently for silver to get to the phone dan takes his time getting to the phone hes a little uneasy about what ben carruthers might have to say to him the real estate mogul is asshole buddies with boone daniels or the late boone daniels if the word on the street is right dan had sent one of his guys over to the sundowner to keep his eyes and ears open to find out if anyone had seen or heard from daniels after he did his houdini on the beach daniels is a major fucking pain in the ass and now he has tammy roddick except the word came in that daniels drove his piece of shit vehicle off the cliff and went out in flames so dan has constructed a hopeful scenario he hit daniels with one of his shots the dumb fuck made it up to his van somehow but weak with loss of blood put the car in drive instead of reverse and went airborne crash and burn the even more optimistic version is that tammy roddick and her big fucking mouth went over the cliff with him and the fire guys are going to scrape out two crispy critters instead of one and then theres the mouthy british broad the one that would rather fuck a pig well maybe her stuckup twat is melted to the seat springs too now this old man is calling whats up with that he picks up the phone dan silver yeah you know who i am carruthers says im going to give you my accountants number hell tell you exactly how much im worth ill pay off your debt to red eddie cash interest ill put it to bed why would you do that so you call the dogs off boone daniels carruthers says the fuck dan asks himself is daniels alive he decides to check it out i heard he had an accident i heard that too carruthers says thats the other reason i want you to know how much im worth its in the eight figures somewhere and dan silver if boone is dead ill spend every cent of it to have you tracked down and killed dial tone cheerful had bought the crystal pier back in the day when it was pretty rundown he renovated it and flipped it with the proviso that he retain the last cottage on the north side of the pier he gave the cottage to boone boone didnt want to take it its too much cheerful he said way too much you saved me millions from that golddigging little bitch cheerful responded take the cottage then youll always have a place to live boone didnt take the cottage not ownership anyway what he took was a longterm lease at a lowerthanmarket rent so boone became a permanent resident of the crystal pier hotel he lives literally over the ocean he can and does hang a fishing pole outside his bedroom window right into the water the cottage itself is made up of a small living room with a kitchenette a bedroom off to one side and a bathroom off to the other now high tide drives up to the gate at the base of the pier kills his headlights and punches in the code he knows by heart the gate slides open and high tide drives the van down the pier all the way to the end and into a little parking spot now vacated by the late boonemobile next to boones cottage boone has been lying down in the back he gets up quickly slips over the side and walks around to the drivers door as the women slide out the passenger side thanks bro tide shakes his head and touches his fist to boones dawn patrol tide turns the truck around and drives off the pier turns left and parks the truck just behind the new lifeguard station that dave rules like a feudal warlord he sits and juggles the phone in his hand thinking about what he needs to do then he does it boone wasnt in the van he says into the phone hes at his place then josiah pamavatuuformer gang banger football star surfing studlays his head on the steering wheel and sobs boone lowers all the window shades and turns on one lamp by the side of the sofa then he goes into his bedroom opens the drawer of his nightstand and takes out the that hes saving to shoot russ rasmussen you guys need to take hot showers he says then he runs water into a kettle and puts it on the stovetop ill make something hot to drink petra is surprised that the place is so neat and clean everything stored in its placethe efficiency of small spaces a surprisingly good collection of pots and pans hangs from a rack above a small but goodquality butchers block on which two expensive global knives are set on magnetized strips the man likes to cook petra thinks who would know unsurprisingly the white walls of the living room are decorated with framed photos of waves which give petra an involuntary shudder after what theyve just been through she cant know it but the pictures are of local breaksblacks shores d street bird rock and shrinks ill get you guys something to change into boone says walking into his bedroom tammy jumps when a big wave goes off like a cannon sounding like its crashed right on the cottage are you all right petra asks i want to talk to teddy im not sure thats a good idea petra says boone emerges from the bedroom carrying a stack of sweatshirts sweatpants and socks theyll be big for you he says but theyll keep you warm anyway warm is good tammy says she takes a blue hooded la jolla surf systems sweatshirt and a pair of black sweatpants and goes into the bathroom boone and petra hear the shower running god that sounds good petra says yeah it does i still have salt water running from my nose she says i must look a fright you look nice boone says meaning it listen you did good out there in the water i mean you were great you didnt panic thanks she says boone says would you like some tea that would be lovely i have herbal or earl grey earl grey is perfect just plain right boone asks no milk or sugar actually lots of both please she says perhaps its the neardeath experience but i feel greedy nothing like almost dying to let you know how good life is boone says yeah how good life is with her full lips and warm neck and sea gray eyes there for the reaching out and her looking in his eyes her mouth already tasting his and then the pot whistles like an alarm and their lips dont touch life imitating bad art she says yeah boone pours the water into a mug and hands it to her thanks youre welcome how about you she asks ill make some coffee tammy comes out of the bedroom its the first time boone has really seen her shes tall not sunny tall but tall with long lean legs her face has clean strong natural lines and her eyes although they look smaller without makeup are still catlike but its a different breed of catwild feral but somehow calm shes a striking woman and its easy to see why mick penner and teddy fell hard for her she sits down on the small couch in the middle of the living room and puts her feet up on the coffee table boone says have something hot to drink first warm you up inside go change petra says i can take care of her she can take care of herself tammy says getting up she goes into the kitchen chooses the herbal tea and makes a cup go get some dry clothes on tarzan ill make the coffee boone goes into his room to change i need to talk with teddy tammy says petras gobsmacked certainly tammy realizes that teddy revealed her hiding place to dan silverin fact served her up on a plate to save himself she says im sure dr cole is fine after all he did what dan wanted i want to talk with him lets check with boone about that petra says youre going to do him tammy says to petra i beg your pardon if i wasnt here youd jump him in the shower we have a professional relationship uhhuh hes a barbarian whatever whatever petra thinks but is it possible am i really feeling something for daniels is it some sort of animal attraction or perhaps just a residue of the gratitude im feeling for him for not letting me die on the beach of course he put me on the beach in the first place the incompetent boob but he was pretty damn competent when the bullets were flying wasnt he he was pretty damn competent in the freezing water in the dark wasnt he boone comes back into the room ill think ill have that shower she says yeah get warm boone says she takes some clothes from the stack and goes into the bathroom first words out of tammys mouth i want to talk to teddy your boyfriend is a pedophile boone says he tells her about what he saw at the motel up near the strawberry fields her face doesnt register any of the possible reactionsshock anger indignation disgust betrayal i want to talk to teddy she says i need to talk to teddy boone sighs and runs it down for her first they dont know where teddy is second teddy already gave her up once if she calls him now hell give her up again third at least for a little while dan and the rest of the world have good reason to believe that shes dead and if she talks to teddy theyll have good reason to believe shes alive and try to do something about it shes real impressed by the argument wheres my phone soaked in cold salt water boone says i dont think youre going to get a lot of bars let me use yours i was in the water beside you you dont have a phone in your house she asks no what if people want to get hold of you thats why i dont have a phone in my house boone says he doesnt tell her about the three other cellies he has in a kitchen drawer hes blown away the woman hasnt said one word or asked one question about her friend angela who took her rap for her all she cares about is a slick boob butcher who likes to do little migrant girls a guy who gave her up in a heartbeat to save his own worthless ass nice do you think hes all right she asks couldnt care less i want to see him youre not going anywhere you cant keep me here against my will she says hes had it thats true go out there tammy go find dr short eyes see what happens but dont expect me to come to your funeral fuck you tammy says im a payday to you thats all you need me alive so you can pick up your check it doesnt give you the right to moral judgments cowboy youre right and i dont need you to tell me that tammy says i know what you think of me im a strippera dumb piece of meat either i have a drug problem or im fucked up because my daddy didnt pay me enough attention or else im just too lazy to get a real job im a skank but it doesnt stop you from coming in with your dollar bills does it true boone thinks and it doesnt stop me wanting to keep you alive or is it that i just need to deliver you to the courtroom stay away from the windows boone says keep your head down in fact you might be better off in the bedroom you think youre the first guy to tell me that she asks eyes hard as emeralds ill make you a deal boone says i dont judge you and you dont judge you easier said than done yeah she sneers what would you know about it surfer dude you dont have a monopoly on regrets tammy boone can feel the ocean swell literally under his feet the waves push against the pilings wash through and then pull on their way out the big swell is coming and when it goes out again it will take with it the life he knew he can feel it and it scares the hell out of him he wants to hold on but he knows theres no holding on against the sea when a tsunami comes in it hits with incredibly destructive force crushing lives and homes but its almost worse when it recedes dragging lives out into the endless sea that is the irredeemable past petra gets out of the shower then wanders into boones bedroom telling herself shes going to catch a quick nap but really to snoop no not snoop she thinks simply to find out a little more about the man like the rest of the place the bedroom is neat and clean nothing remarkable about it save for the fishing pole sticking out of the window except books used paperbacks on a bedside table and in a small bookcase in the corner some stacked by the bed and not just the sports books or crime novels that she might have expected if she thought that he actually read but genuine literaturedostoyevsky turgenev gorky over in the corner is a stack ofcan it be she thinkstrollope our oceangoing nature boy is a cryptophineas finn she thinks of all the little jibes shes given him all day about being an uneducated philistine then thinks about the books that are stacked on her bedside tabletrashy romance novels and bodice rippers that she doesnt have to read anyway and hes been having me on all day his private little joke bastard she keeps snooping theres a small desk in the corner with a computer and terminal on it guiltily she slides the desk drawer open and sees photographs of a little girl a darling almost a stereotype of your classic california girlblond hair big blue eyes a spray of freckles across her cheeks shes looking directly into the camera without a trace of selfconsciousness a happy little girl petra picks up the photo and sees the little nameplate at the edge of the frame rain the girls name bastard petra thinks he never told me he had a daughter he never even mentioned that hed been married maybe he wasnt maybe the girl is a love child and boone never married her mother still he might have mentioned it be fair she tells herself he had no obligation to tell you she digs deeper more pictures of the girl carefully preserved in plastic sleeves photos of her playing at a birthday party opening presents in front of a christmas tree oddly not a single photo of rain with boone not a single daddydaughter shot that one would expect and the pictures seem to stop when the girl is around the age of five or six so boone daniels has a sixyearold daughter petra thinks whom he clearly adores but doesnt talk about disregarding the better angels of her nature petra digs under the photos and finds a file folder she opens it to see some pencil sketches artists renderings some would call them of a girl as she would look as she got older her name is rain rain at seven rain at eight rain at nine is boone not allowed to see his daughter anymore petra wonders theyre so sad these sketchesall he has of his little girl there are other files in the drawer all labeled rasmussen must be another case hes working on petra thinks although boone hardly seems to be the type to bring work home you are full of surprises mr daniels she thinks feeling ashamed she quickly puts everything back in order and goes into the living room ive been told i belong in the bedroom tammy says she gets up from the couch goes into the bedroom and shuts the door behind her she wants to talk with teddy petra says sitting down on the couch she mentioned that boone replies the sweatshirta black sundowneris huge on her and shes had to roll the legs of the sweatpants way up but boone thinks she looks prettier than hell you look good he says youre a liar she says but thank you no he says you should go with that look hardly lawyerly maybe thats it the doorbell rings boone takes the moves to the side of the door nudges the curtain aside and looks out sunny stands at the door her blond hair shiny in the moist night air peeks out from under the hood of a dark blue sweatshirt arms folded inside the waist pouch she hops up and down with chill and anxiety boone opens the door yanks her inside and shuts it behind her boone tide told me she sees petra sitting on the couch in boones sweats which she used to wear herself in happier times after long mornings in the water and afternoon lovemaking excuse me sunny says her voice colder than the water i didnt realize its not what it looks like she glares at boone for a second then slaps him hard across the face i thought you were dead boone you let me think you were dead im sorry she shakes her head ill tell cheerful and hang they were worried about you you have to get out of here sunny boone says no kidding i meant i know what you meant its not safe boone thinks is what i meant but shes already walking away he looks out the window and sees her taking long strides down the pier into his past out of his life im sorry petra says a moment after the door slams not your fault boone says ill talk to her if youd like petra says explain the misunderstanding boone shakes his head its been over with us for a long time maybe its good this happened clean break sort of thing yeah petra feels bad but not as bad as she thinks she should a door has been opened and she wonders if she should step through it not immediately that would be inappropriate and tawdry to say the least but the door is open and she has this feeling it will stay open for a while but she does take a small tentative step forward is sunny the mother what rains mother the door slams shut try to get a little sleep boone says in the morning you can go out and get tammy some decent clothes well take her to court she can testify and well be done with this shit he pulls a chair up near the door his back to her and sits with the on his lap no bodies the fireman says to johnny banzai youre sure johnny says the fireman gives him a hard sarcastic look hes real thrilled to be out on the beach on a cold damp night with the surf spitting spray into his face to put out a fire on a pieceofcrap van that some clown apparently pushed off the bluff for shits and giggles he says im going to send this joker a hell of a bill do it johnny says he leaves the scene and walks back up the stairs to shrinks where teddy dcup is still sitting in the lotus cottage johnny has no real reason to hold teddy but he didnt tell him that and the doctor seems to be in a cowed and obedient frame of mind hes also about half shitfaced which makes johnny wonder whats in an organic martini that makes it organic johnny sits down across from teddy the plasma television has a lakers game on the purple and gold of their uniforms as vivid as a mardi gras parade so johnny asks its a standard opening of his never start by asking a witness a closedended question just get them talking and theyll tell you the first thing on their minds doesnt work with teddy he looks blankly at johnny and repeats so so what are you doing here johnny asks visiting a patient would that patient be tammy roddick johnny asks in the background kobe totally works a defender blows around him and slams the ball home what if it is teddy says where is she johnny asks he sees a different look come over teddys face an expression that looks like is it relief i dont know teddy says she wasnt here when i got here how did you get here huh how did you get here johnny asks your car isnt in the lot thats a good question teddy says thats why i asked it johnny says kobe has the ball again and hes dribbling around will not pass it typical johnny thinks doctor teddy looks serious and thoughtful he looks johnny in the eye and says i dont really have an answer to that question why why what why dont you have an answer theres a long silence then teddy says i dont really have an answer to that question either look asshole johnny says i have a dead woman in the morgue who was carrying the id of a stripper youre probably banging now the real tammy roddick is missing boones vehicle is iraq war footage and i find you in tammys room which you certainly arranged for now you can answer my questions in this civilized setting or i can take you down to the precinct leave you in a smelly interview room for a few hours and then see if you can get your thoughts collected it sobers teddy up a little which turns out not to be a good thing because it seems as if he suddenly remembers that hes a highpriced surgeon with connections he looks at johnny and calmly says its not illegal for a doctor to visit a patient and i cant control the fact that she wasnt here as for exploding vans how did you know it was a van i have no idea about it teddy says as i will explain to the beautiful wife of your chief when i see her she has a beautiful smile dont you think and those eyes ive never met her id be happy to introduce you the banzai part of johnny would like to whip the cuffs on teddy take him to the house and show him the other side of life in san diego but his more rational side knows that it would be futile and selfdefeating teddy will have a highpriced lawyer there in five minutes who will make the correct point that johnny has no reason to hold his client no reason at all so johnny swallows the smarmy power play about the chiefs wife along with the hard facts about being a cop in a city where great wealth lives alongside great poverty johnny banzai is neither naпve nor idealistic he generally takes life as he finds it and doesnt waste his time or energy tilting at windmills but sometimes it gets to him the knowledge that if teddy for instance was mexican black filipino samoan or just plain old white trash hed be in the back of johnnys car already but teddy is rich and white with a good address in la jollasubstitute del mar rancho santa fe or torrey pines if you wantso he skates an obvious fact of life johnny thinksthe next time a rich white guy gets worked by the cops will be the first time so get over it but sometimes hed like to take the badge wing it into the ocean and join boone on the beach rather than take any more shit from any of the beautiful people now he says dr cole i have reason to believe that tammy roddicks life is in immediate danger im trying to find her before the bad guys do if you have any knowledge that would help me do that you should give it to me right now i really dont teddy says can you get home all right johnny asks they have a courtesy car teddy says with a driver johnny asks jutting his chin at the martini of course of course johnny thinks boone gets up to make another cup of coffee hes trashed aching from the beating he got back by the strawberry fields and the adrenaline surge from the beach is long gone his body screams for sleep but its just going to have to wait until he delivers tammy to the courtroom so he goes for more caffeine petras out sound asleep on the sofa snoring softly boone tries to work up some righteous indignation over sunnys false unspoken accusation but he cant the truth is that he does feel some attraction to pete and if sunny hadnt come to the door when she did he might have done something about it he looks over at pete angelic when she sleeps but hes pissed off at her for snooping in his room looking at his books digging up the stuff about rain women he thinksits always a mistake letting them into your space because they prowl it like cats check it out to see if they can make it their own so hes pissed at her but attracted to her at the same time what is that he wonders is it that opposites attract thing he always thought that was some cheesy paula abdul song attached to some cartoon but here it is if you had to pick a woman whos totally wrong for him out of every woman in the entire world youd choose pete ambitious elitist snobbish careeroriented fashionconscious argumentative belligerent sarcastic ballbusting highmaintenance nosy but there it is fuck too complicated for me he thinks just get this case over deliver tammy roddick to court get back in time to get into the big swell the ocean is simplenot easy but simple and a wave is something you know how to handle just stay in the water never come out but it isnt that simple is it a womans been killed a pedophile is out there and somebody has to do something about both those things dan silver has to go down for angela harts murderjohnny will be on that until he gets it doneand teddy dcup has to get squared for his little trips to mister rogers neighborhood first things first though boone tells himself as the water starts to boil he takes the kettle off the heat before it whistles and wakes pete up first get through the night then get tammy to testify then clean your head out in the big waves then see to dan and teddy yeah except he sees movement through the edge of the kitchen window out on the pier he pulls the curtain back for a better view and sees them out there moving like cats hunting in the night one of them is edging along the pier railing on the near side another one takes the opposite side boone thinks he can make out two more on the base of the pier but hes not sure and now a hummer rolls slowly past in the street its hard to really see them in the dark and the mist but just by the way they move boone can see theyre hawaiians he touches petras arm and wakes her up she looks around the room not knowing where she is go into the bedroom boone says shut and lock the door behind you lie down on the floor what just listen boone says and to her surprise she does if you hear shooting take tammy and go out the window you can swim into shore easily all right she says will you ill be fine he says go he waits until she goes into the bedroom and he hears the lock click then he walks over to the cottage door checks that he has a round chambered and waits tide he thinks what did eddie offer you loves a funny goddamn thing makes you do shit youd never thought youd do then suddenly youre doing it in teddy coles case it makes him take the chauffeured ride home go to his garage instead of the house take one of his other mercedeses and head straight for the strawberry fields he knows hes not going to find her there at nightshes never there at nightbut its the best shot he has so thats what he does love is a funny goddamn thing red eddie sits in the back of the hummer and watches the guys move up the pier toward boones cottage he checks out the two others lingering around the base of the pier and knows that for every one he sees there are probably two he cant large respect for the samoans guarding boone dawg from harm theyre good at what they do respect to josiah pamavatuu also the guy went the other way bad for his icehead cousin to be sure but good for him gonna be rough on the big man though samoans are huge on family and boone daniels is a cockroachyou just cant kill the kanaka eddie had actually been very relieved when he got the word that boone wasnt charcoal its a blessing what is a curse is dan silver who is gripping she testifies tomorrow dan says she saw everythingshell kill us red eddie draws the herb smoke deep into his lungs holds it for the count of three then exhales he passes the blunt to dan as he sings oh danny boy the lights the lights are shining relax daniel spaniel you relax dan snaps shaking his head to refuse the smoke red eddie shrugs i will relax and think relaxation red eddie knows is the prerequisite for efficient thought no sense in getting all geeked upyou just cut off the flow of blood to your brain exactly when you need it the most so he takes another hit of the weed to boost his intellectual capability and then comes to a conclusion eddie turns to dan silver and says sorry chief youre out of luck danny doesnt want to accept it you telling me your guys cant take a bunch of sammy gang bangers the hummer is full of very moke hui boys and another car also packed with muscle waits just a block away doubtless they could do some serious damage to the sammies and blow their way into boone dawgs crib eddie knows but thats the problemthe last thing in the world eddie wants is to trigger a transoceanic war and thats what it would be too let one of these sammy guys get scratched it would start a blood feud with obligations for revenge so the sammies would crack a hawaiian then eddie would have to crack back and it would never end and not just here either it would speed back to honolulu in a heartbeat and thered be aggro there and in freaking pago pago too it would get out of freaking control cause a lot of heartache and interfere with business and eddies all about the business no the high tide dude was smart eddie thinks he figured all this out and put a screen around his boy boone a screen of ohana that he knew i would never attack round to you tide sorry he says to dan it just aint on man that cunts going to testify in the morning dan says god knows whats going to come out of her stupid fucking mouth you better hope eddie says she confines her remarks to the little pig roast at your dumbass warehouse because dan has dumped him in the shit letting this wahine see things she shouldnt have seen and the timing couldnt be worsehe has a shipment due to come in tomorrow night and he doesnt want dans sloppy business practices shining a spotlight on that part of his business thats why im saying dan says lets go in and take her now eddie shakes his head aint gonna happen not only are the samoans standing in the way but theres boone to consider no way is boone going to stand aside and let danny cancel that girls reservation eddies already told his boys if they have a clean shot at the wahine take it but nothing nothing better happen to boone daniels now nothings going to happen at all not right now anyway so what am i supposed to do dan asks try using your head for a change eddie says his cellie goes off what fiveoh rolling up one of his guys in the other car says one cop a jap time to take the party someplace other eddie says the hummer rolls out johnny makes the samoan gang bangers right away osidesamoan lordstides old crew which is interesting what the hell high tide has to do with all this johnny fronts one of the kids call your matai tell him johnny b wants to go through and hes not in the mood to take any shit the kid gets on the phone talks in samoan for a second looks at johnny with undisguised hostility and says its cool thanks so much johnny walks down the pier goes to boones cottage and bangs on the door boone open the damn door its johnny boone opens the door youre a dick johnny says no argument you had a lot of people worried boone johnny says i thought i was going to have to organize a paddleout for you you could have called your friends let them know youre okay im okay does sunny know johnny asks that she doesnt have to grieve for you she knows i guess tide must have told her huh johnny says gesturing generally to the gang bangers who seem to have melted into the landscape what do you mean the samoan lord bodyguards johnny says i thought they were hawaiians boone says feeling stupid and ungrateful for thinking that tide had sold him out they all look alike to me too johnny says can i come in boone or are you going to keep all your friends out in the cold you have a warrant not yet johnny says then i guess ill stand out in the cold with you so you have tammy roddick johnny says boone doesnt answer how did we end on different teams on this thing b johnny asks i dont think we have divergent interests here you want roddick to testify against dan silver in a civil suit tomorrow morning the sdpd could care less we just want to talk to her about angela harts death hell ill walk her to the courtroom myself if she was still alive whats that supposed to mean boone hesitates you got something on your mind says johnny say it dan silver got the word pretty fast that it was angela and not tammy dead at the motel johnny boone says im worried he got it from cops fuck you boone i didnt say it was you johnny fuck you boone johnny says okay fuck me you think it was harrington asks johnny hes a lot of things but hes not dirty boone shrugs sanctimonious asshole johnny says only boone daniels knows the truth because he walks on water jesus johnny so to speak can you protect her boone asks can you johnny asks i mean you can in the short run but what about after she testifies have you thought of that you think dan silvers just going to forget she just cost him a pile of money youre going to devote your life to protecting this girl boones thought about it its a problem its an insurance company boone johnny says theyve got lots of jangle they can afford to take a hit roddick was right to run i only wish shed run farther because the company doesnt give a shit what happens to her after she lays it down for them do they her only chance is if i put dan in the hole and that isnt going to happen on the arson charge but if shes a witness on a capital case i can protect her we each have jobs to do johnny so fuck angela hart right johnny says tag it a suicide just another dead stripper no humans involved shes not my job no shes mine johnny says put your hands behind your back really johnny boone says i have reason to believe that you are interfering with an ongoing investigation johnny says i have reason to believe that you have knowledge material to at least one homicide investigation ill get the warrant to search your place but in the meantime im taking you in on a vandalism charge vandalism pushing your van through a municipal guardrail johnny says causing a fire on a public beach boone turns around and puts his hands behind his back johnny gets his handcuffs out cuffs john hey you want to act like a skell is there a problem officer a woman comes to the door dressed sort of in boones clothes her hair is damp as if she just came out of the shower johnny recognizes her as the woman boone was with when he arrived at the crest motel the woman who went over and looked at the body her accent is clearly english who are you johnny asks petra hall attorneyatlaw johnny laughs boones lawyer among other things yes from the looks of her johnny has a good idea about what the other things are its unlike boone to sleep with clients but its hard to blame him in this case the woman is a stunner and the voice and the accent are well its hard to blame him sorry boone she says now but i couldnt help but overhear a bit of your conversation i dont know what you think you saw officer detective johnny says sorry detective petra says but i can assure you that mr daniels was not on any beach tonight i can quite personally vouch for the fact that hes been snug and warm right here all evening as for removing mr daniels in handcuffs i can also assure you that my client will have nothing further to say that based on my representations you no longer have a justification for detaining him and that if you do so i will have a writ of habeas corpus awaiting you when you arrive at what i believe you refer to somewhat quaintly as the house release my client detective immediately johnny lowers the handcuffs and clips them back on his belt hiding behind women now b boone turns around to look at him ive evolved apparently johnny says he looks at petra tell your client that ill be back with the appropriate paper advise him not to go anywhere counselor and i suggest you further advise him that hes risking his pi card with this bullshit and on the topic of cards im sure you know that any attorney as an officer of the court who lies to the police in the course of an ongoing investigation i know the law detective so do i counselor johnny says he looks at boone ill be back with a warrant you do what you have to do johnny dont worry about that johnny says im glad youre alive boone but youre riding this one all wrong selling out for an insurance company its turning you into a real jerk he turns and walks down the pier boone watches him go wondering if hell have any friends when this is over this case is tearing the dawn patrol apart boone thinks and he doesnt know if theyll ever be able to put it back together again teddy dcup stumbles through the reeds trips falls picks himself up and pushes toward the light of a small campfire in the clearing in front of the little caves hes greeted with a shotgun a teenage boy grabs a machete and gets up the old man just sits by the fire and looks up at him then the man with the shotgun sees teddys face and lowers the barrel doctor їtomas dуnde estб luceteddy asks gone with the others tomas says їdуnde la encuentroteddy asks where do i find her hes learned a little spanglish in his days in the reeds you dont the guy learned a little english from his days in the reeds teddy sits down heavily in the dirt and puts his head in his hands a madrugadatomas says wait until dawn boone stands with one foot on the railing and looks out at the ocean might as well be out in the open theres no real danger nowtides crew has the pier covered red eddie would never try to go through them and he wouldnt let dan silver do it either johnny b has gone to try to find a judge in the middle of the night good luck with thatbut has called a blackandwhite which is parked at the end of the pier maybe johnny was right boone thinks maybe i am becoming an asshole just look at what i thought about tide that he sold me out to red eddie a total asshole thing to think johnny was right about something else tammy roddick is a dead woman if she testifies if they cant kill her to prevent it theyll kill her to avenge it and i should have thought of that would have thought of it if i wasnt so busy proving to pete what a hotshot pi i am asshole he stares out at the ocean the whitecaps barely visible in the fog and faint moonlight the ocean is ripping getting itself geared up for the big party petra comes up behind him am i intruding she asks i mean any more than usual no no more than usual she stands next to him is your swell coming in yup youll be able to catch it now yup i thought that would make you happy she says i thought it would too boone replies you know what the best thing is about a wave no a wave boone says puts you in your exact place in the universe say youre just all full of yourself you think youre the king of the world and you go out and then this wave just slams youpicks you up throws you down rolls you scrapes you along the bottom and holds you there for a while like its god saying listen speck when i let you back up take a gulp of air and step away from yourself a little bit or say youre really low you go out and youre feeling like crap likes theres not a place for you in the world you go out there and the ocean gives you this sweet ride like its all just for you you know and thats god saying welcome son its for you and its all good awave always gives you what you need its

cereal and hands one to boone eddie digs in like he hasnt eaten since he was in seventh grade this is good boone says its crunch eddie says putting the dvd on pause so boonebabadoone what do you want

years at wharton you can sum up what he learned in four words everybody has a price the girl luce lies on a bare dirty mattress shes sad and scared but somewhat comforted by the presence of the other girls who lie around her like a litter of puppies she can feel the warmth of their skin hear their breathing smell their bodies the sour but familiar smell of sweat and dirt in the background a shower nozzle drips with the steady rhythm of a heartbeat luce tries to sleep but when she closes her eyes she sees the same thinga mans feet as seen from under the hotel bed she hears angelas muffled cry sees her feet being lifted feels again her own terror and shame as she cowered under the bed as the feet walked out again remembers lying there in an agony of indecisionto stay hidden or run recalls the nerve it took to get up go to the balcony and look over the edge sees again the hideous sightangelas broken body like a doll tossed on a trash pile back in guanajuato now she hears footsteps again she pulls the thin blanket tightly over her shoulders and clamps her eyes shutif she cannot see perhaps she cannot be seen then she hears a mans rough voice which one is she heavy footsteps as men walk around the mattresses stop and walk again she pulls the blanket tighter squeezes her eyes shut until they hurt but it does no good she feels the feet stop above her then hears a man say this one she doesnt open her eyes when she feels the big hand on her shoulder she risks moving her hand to grab the cross on her neck and squeeze it as if it could prevent what she knows is going to happen hears the man say its all right nena no one is going to hurt you then she feels herself being lifted dawn comes to pacific beach a pale yellow light that infiltrates the morning fog like a faint unsteady glimpse of hope alone surfer sits on his board on the burgeoning sea it isnt boone daniels nor is it dave the love god or sunny day or high tide or johnny banzai only hang twelve has come out this morning now he sits alone waiting for people who are not going to show up the dawn patrol is missing the girls emerge from the tree line that edges the strawberry fields walk like soldiers on patrol toward the bed of reeds teddy cole watches them come hes slept rough in the reeds his body aches with cold and he shivers as he tries to focus on the girls forms peers through the mist trying to make out individual faces he smells the acrid smoke of a cook fire behind him tortillas heating on a flat pan set on the open flame teddy watches as the girls become distinct forms and now he sees the subtle differences in their stature and gait he knows each of these girls their arms and legs the texture of their skin their shy smiles his heart starts to pound with anxiety and hope as distinct faces come into focus but hers is not one of them he looks again fighting against disappointment and an ineffable sense of loss but she isnt there luce is gone from the dawn patrol sunny sits at her computer with her herbal tea and checks on the swell not that she needs a sophisticated computer program to tell her that the big swell is coming like christmas tomorrow morning she can feel it burgeoning out there a heavy pregnant sea she can feel her heartbeat matching the intensity of the coming wavesa heavy bass drumbeat in her chest sunny goes back to the computer checking for wind and current to see where the best spot will be to grab the wave her wave she checks the surf cams but its still too dark to really see anything but the imagery on the computerthe current the windits unmistakable her wave is headed right for pacific beach point restless she gets up again goes to the window and looks out at the actual ocean its dark and foggy but the sun is starting to penetrate the marine layer and it feels odd to her unhappy and strange not to be out on the water with the dawn patrol its the first morning in years that she hasnt shown up she thought about going but just couldnt make herself do it it seemed impossible to be there with boone its ridiculous she thinks now silly she knows boone has been with other women since they split up shes been with other men but there was something about seeing itseeing that woman in her clothes looking so comfortable and at homethat felt like a terrible betrayal and boone letting me think that hed been killed when he was doing her so shed skipped the dawn patrol maybe its a good thing she thinks time to move on catch my wave tomorrow and ride it into my new life she goes to get dressed it will be busy at the sundowner with all the surfers coming in and chuck could probably use the extra help so she decides to go in early high tide thinks about going to the sundowner too hes hungry and cold and a cup of hot coffee and a stack of banana pancakes soaked in maple syrup sound pretty damn good its been a long night sitting in his car a half block south of boones crib directing his old troops like a general whos come out of retirement to fight a war and it felt good in a weird way to know that he could issue the battle cry and the boys would respond as if no time had passed but it felt bad too bringing back the old days that he had left behind that bad feeling was nothing compared with the heartache that came with letting his cousin down but life is full of tough choices and he chose one family over the other done but now he looks out at the ocean and sees that the family he chose isnt together he didnt go out this morning because he was busy guarding boone and god knows where he is now johnnys not out there because hes probably well and truly pissed off at boone and working the murder case and sunnys madhurt and betrayed only hang twelve is out there sitting like a latchkey kid waiting for mom or dad to come home hes thinking this when someone taps on his window boones standing there tide rolls down the window its over boone says thats good theres still time for you to hit the water boone says you boone shakes his head then looks up at his cottage stuff to take care of yeah i think ill give it a pass this morning tide says get me some breakfast instead sounds good boone says and tide thanks huh no worries brah youre aiga johnny banzai grabs a few hours of sleep gets up and picks a shirt slacks sports jacket and tie from his closet then he rejects all of it in favor of a charcoal gray suit he has to be in court today maybe in front of a judge and hes found that the extra touch of formality is usually worth it it feels odd going to work from the house instead of the beach changing clothes in his bedroom instead of his car hes missed sessions of the dawn patrol before because of work or family obligations but this feels different like the end of something the start of something else phases and stages i guess johnny thinks as he knots a bloodred knit tie and checks it in the mirror at a certain time in your life you think youll never get married then you are then you think youll never have kids and then suddenly you have two and youve always said that youd never leave the dawn patrol but maybe now that stunt boone pulled not the thing with the boonemobilethat was classic boone although its hard to see him sacrifice the old van that held so many memories for all of them so many road trips up and down the coast the waves the beer the music the girls hard to see that all go up in flames but maybe it was necessary no it was the stunt with the lady lawyer the brit maybe it was the accent that pissed johnny off but more probably it was boone pulling the shit that johnny expected from the la jolla beautiful people the rich and influential and not a lifelong surfing buddy face it he tells himself as he looks down at his wife beth sleeping in bed you never thought youd see boone go for the money never thought youd see him go for that kind of woman the whole ambitious professional thing well never say never johnny kisses his wife and receives a murmured morning then stops off at each of his kids rooms to check in on them his son brian is sound asleep clad in spiderman pajamas stretched out in the bottom bed of the set of bunks hed wanted so that he could have friends for sleepovers abbie is likewise curled into her wonder woman blanket the lightest sheen of sweat on her upper lip and thank god johnny thinks that she takes after her mother he looks at her lying there so peaceful and innocent and hopefully so safe and it makes him think of the little girls toothbrush in the room at the crest motel who was the girl what was she doing there where is she now johnny walks over kisses his daughter softly on the cheek and heads out the door its going to be a tough day dan silvers civil trial starts at nine and tammy roddick is scheduled to take the stand shortly afterward and johnny is going to be in the gallery when she does so hell have to get into a judges chamber early to get a warrant written for both boone and roddick shell probably be on the stand for a couple of hours or more then johnny intends to pick them both up and get some answers about angela harts death sorry b he thinks im invoking the jumpin rule boone stands on the pier and watches hang twelve sit out in the water by himself kids not even bothering to catch any of the good waves that are coming in like a machines cranking them out just sits beyond the break and lets them roll under him like hes catatonic or something boone waves his arms and yells hang hang twelve looks over sees boone and then looks away a few seconds later he paddles in boone watches him pick up his board walk up the beach and head up the street petras sitting at the kitchen table when boone comes in her hands are wrapped around a mug of tea look its all good he says its over its taken care of what do you mean she asks youre good to go boone says tammy can testify about the arson tell the cops whatever she knows about angelas murder dannys not going to do a thing why not because he wants to live boone says i cant tell you any more cant tell them that he made a deal that in effect cuts danny off from red eddie and danny would take a fall on the lawsuit even the murder before hed hurt tammy because shes now under eddies protection and violating red eddies protection is a capital offense no appeals no lastminute calls from the governor you want to go to the sundowner boone asks grab some breakfast what did you trade petra asks huh you obviously made a deal with red eddie petra says what im asking is what did you give in return not so much he says when he sees her skeptical look he adds i did him a solid once i cashed in the chip must have been quite a chip sort of shes touched you did that for me i did it for tammy boone says and for you and me we cant have breakfast in the sundowner petra says why not because it would be too awkward petra says it would be rubbing it in her face sunny doesnt care boone says men are idiots petra thinks shes still in love with you no shes not boone says yes she is petra thinks the question is are you still in love with her i dont think so because you have too good a heart to be in love with her and kissing me but you might still be in love with her boone and not know it just as you might be falling in love with me and not know it we dont have to go to the sundowner boone says yeah but a lot of people do with the swell headed toward pb point maybe half the bigwave surfing world is jammed in the sundowner macking down talking about whats going to happen tomorrow sunnys in hyperdrive pouring coffee taking orders and running trays to the surfers the jet ski drivers the clothing and gear execs the photographers and filmmakers magazine editors and plain old hangerson whove gathered for the big eventthe first monster wave to hit the socal coast in years everybodys been waiting for this for so longfor the golden age to come home its going to be big not just the waves but the moment its a media event its going to be splashed all over the mags the videos and dvds the clothing catalogs reps are going to get made or ruined rivalries fought out like these waters are the plains of troy huge egos fighting for waves fighting for rides fighting for the glory fame endorsement contracts sponsorships someones going to be in the big picture the cover shot someone is going to be the star of the movie and the rest arent and the knife hasnt been made the steel not forged that could cut the tension the vibe in the sundowner this morning or the testosterone sunny thinks its all about the boys today talking trash acting all cool being guys together shes invisible to them except shes the waitress who brings them their food getting to you dave asks sitting at the counter not talking to anybody reading his newspaper the most famous surfers in the world are all around him and its nothing to him tomorrow he might have to haul some of these guys out of the soup out of the white water and then theyll have his total attention this morning he doesnt give a damn a little sunny says theyll know who you are tomorrow dave says i dont know thats an understatement she hates to admit it but she is intimidated its the hall of fame in here laird and kalama and the whole strapped crew in from maui the irons brothers with the kauai wolf pack mick and robby and the boys from oz flea and malloys down from santa cruz and the socal localsmachado and gerhardt and mike parsons who rode that monster wave out on the cortes bank these are the established guys with nothing to prove and theyre all pretty cool and laidback because of it but the younger ones the upandcomers theyre a different breed of cat for example tim mackie breakout surfer of holds his mug in the air like a trophy and points at it handsome as well sculpted cockythe whole world is going his way so why shouldnt he expect an instant refill its good being tim mackie pour it on his crotch dave says no she goes over pours him a fresh cupno thanks no eye contactand then comes back to the counter to pick up her order for the table of billabong execs ill tow you in if you want dave says she knows where hes going with this most of the surfers here are towin guystheir jet ski partners will put them into the big waves and the surfers who simply paddle in will be at a huge disadvantage it might be worse than thatthe waves might simply be too big and therefore too fast for her to catch without a ski thanks she says but shes never done the towin thing and it takes technique and training besides shes not equipped for ither big boards are shaped for paddlein surfing i think ill just stick to what i know usually a good idea dave says but hes worried about her she could get shut out by the other surfers or by the waves themselves and even if she catches one she needs someone to look after her to pull her out of the impact zone if something goes wrong boone will be out there so that will be good sunny takes off with a shoulder full of western omelets and dave goes back to his paper she hustles back to the sound of the bell announcing her next pickup this is for tomorrow she thinks my big chance either i do it or this is my life humping coffee and eggs tim mackie holds up his mug again and points sunny holds up her middle finger tammy comes out of the bedroom into the kitchen boone gives her the good news her response is underwhelming but predictable i want to talk to teddy once again petra says i dont think thats such a good either i talk to teddy tammy says or i dont testify you think it over let me know what you decide she walks back into the bedroom succinct boone says they reach teddy at his home number wife must be out of town boone thinks he hands the phone to tammy teddy she asks are you alone thats all she asks thats it after all the i want to talk to teddy ocd she asks that one question apparently gets her answer and punches off then says okay ill testify downtown san diego is surprisingly small you can easily walk around it in the better part of an hour and it might be the only major city in the country where a healthy person can walk from the airport to downtown with no problem that walk would take you along the bay that borders downtown on the west and south and created the city mexican explorers stopped in san diego back in the s for its excellent harbor and left behind the usual mixture of soldiers and missionaries that defined most of southern california until the anglos took it in by the s a fleet of chinese junks fished for tuna from the harbor but were later moved out by anglo and italian fishermen downtown was pretty sleepy until the big real estate boom of the s when town fathers like the hortons crosswhites and marstons built up a legitimate downtown with office buildings stores banks and restaurants the seedy stingaree district with its bars gambling joints and brothels thrived between downtown and the southern harbor and madams like ida bailey and gamblers and procurers like wyatt earp and his wife made fortunes and gave san diego the risquй reputation that still clings to it today down in what is now known as the gaslamp district but it was the us navy that really defined downtown san diego and still does from virtually anywhere you stand in downtown you can see a navy base or a ship take that walk from the airport and youll see aircraft carriers docked in the harbor navy planes landing at their base on north island sometimes youll see a submarine pop up from underwater right in the bay and glide into port san diego is a navy town back in the good city fathers chased all the brothels out of the gaslamp but then they had to invite them back when the navy threatened to stop its ships from calling in port an embargo that would have bankrupted the city and its more than symbolic that downtowns major street broadway ends on a pier a few blocks east on broadway sits the courthouse petra with boone in the passenger seat and tammy in the back pulls into the parking structure of her office building and finds her designated spot tammy looks great cleaned up in a creamcolored blouse over a black skirt that petra bought for her in the ladies department at nordstrom which is really no surprise what did surprise petra was how good boone could look she didnt think he owned a sports jacket never mind the tailored black suit with a crisp white shirt and a sedate blue tie wow she said i had no idea i have two suits boone replied a summer wedding and funeral suit and a winter wedding and funeral suit this is the winter wedding and funeral suit which doubles as a goingtocourt suit do you go to court a lot no nor to very many weddings boone thinks and even more fortunate to fewer funerals they walk out of the parking structure and walk the two blocks to the courthouse the courtroom is small and modern on the third floor of the superior court building here in the downtown area the room is painted in those institutional blue tones that are meant to soothe and dont the two counsel tables are uncomfortably close together and the witness stand is close to the jury the gallery holds only about twenty people but thats ample space for this morning an insurance badfaith case isnt sexy and rarely attracts much of a crowd a few of the courthouse regulars trial junkies mostly retired people who have nothing more exciting to do are sitting in the gallery looking bored and vaguely disappointed an insurance company representative conspicuous in his gray suit sits in the front row taking notes johnny and harrington are there semipissed off because they couldnt find a judge whod let them take tammy in before she testified in the civil case semi because they really want to talk to her about the angela hart case but on the other hand if shes here to fuck danny silver that cant be a bad thing let her get deeper into the shit with silver so she has no place else to go except to them petra sits at the defense table you couldnt tell from her looks boone thinks as he slips in and sits down in the back row that shes been up for more than twentyfour hours almost shot and nearly frozen she looks fresh and focused in a pinstriped charcoal gray suit her hair pinned up subtle makeup on her eyes very professional maximum cool she turns and favors him with a smile as subtle as her makeup before she turns around to watch alan burke who is just starting his examination of tammy roddick she looks good just enough like a stripper to believe that she was with silver dan the night his warehouse burned down not enough like a stripper to lose credibility shes wearing a lot less eye makeup but those green cat eyes still jump out at you and shes calm ice alan burke always looks good hair combed straight back like a blond pat riley his skin tanned from surfing but glowing from the spf lotion he uses religiously alan may be the last guy left in the western world who still looks good in a doublebreasted suit and this morning he has on a navy blue armani a white shirt and a canary yellow tie hes smiling alan is always smiling even when things are going bad but especially when hes shredding an opposing witness but he has a friendly witness now one whos about to kill his opponent for him dan silver sits beside his lawyer at the plaintiffs table giving tammy the stink eye dan is one of those guys who never look good no matter what you dress them in if its true that the clothes make the man then nothing can make dan silver hes forsaken the cowboy rig this morning for an illfitting suit tight across the shoulders but baggy against his trunk the suit is a greenish gray which does nothing to help dans sallow skin bad complexion and heavy jowls his hair is in an oldfashioned pompadour with a little ducktail a statement that things were better in the s now he sits at the plaintiffs table and glares at tammy silvers lawyer is the infamous todd the rod eckhardt a plaintiffs lawyer known around the greater san diego bar community for his shameless willingness to sue anybody for anything todd has sued for all those reasons that make the general public loathe and despise lawyers the hot coffee spilled on the lap of a driver doing seventy in a thirtyfivemph zone the food product that came out of a microwave hot and boones personal favorite a lady of the evening who sued a blessedbynature john for neck injuries that would prevent her from ever effectively again carrying out her trade and earning a living so todd the rod is a millionaire many times over and doesnt try to disguise the fact he comes into depositions and hearings with a valet yes a valetwho looks like he came out of some s british blackandwhite film about exploring the irrawaddy or something carries todds briefcases and red files and helps him off with his coat todd leaves him at home for trials however lest it provoke jealousy from the jurors at the trial level todd is strictly a man of the people his only saving grace as far as boone is concernedand todd has tried to hire boone on several occasionsis that todd is perhaps the homeliest human being ever to waddle into a courtroom todd would have to approach obese from the upsidelooking at todd its hard to believe that he has a skeletal structure more like hes a singlecellwell a fat single cellorganism with a shock of white hair bug eyes and a very large brain if you propped todd up beside dave the love god you could only come to the conclusion that extraterrestrials do roam the earth because these two specimens could not possibly spring from the same species todd doesnt sit down he sort of oozes into a chair and assumes a slouching posture that makes you think hes playdoh that some negligent child left out in the rain greasy sweat runs out of his pores like an oil leak hes disgusting todd the rod got his sobriquet back in the nineties when a lot of san diego beachside houses were collapsing todd would stick a metal rod into the dirt of the building pad pronounce it improperly compacted file suit against the contractor the city engineers the building inspector and the insurance company and usually win alan has a different version of how todd got his name dont let his prehuman appearance fool you alan told boone before a trial against todd a couple of years ago if you give him the slightest opening hell jam a rod so far up your ass it will come out your mouth so alan has no intention of giving todd the rod an opening in fact hes getting ready to counterjam the rod he asks tammy the usual warmup questionsname addressand then gets right into it and where were you employed at that time alan is asking silver dans tammy replies what did you do there alan asks i was a dancer tammy says looking calmly at the jury a dancer a stripper tammy says objection todd mumbles the judge justice hammond is a former federal prosecutor a bythebook nononsense hardass not known for his patience with courtroom antics or his sense of humor like most members of the human race he despises todd the rod but hes keeping his emotions very much in check overruled hammond says alan continues and were you at silver dans the night of october yes tammy says and were you there after closing alan asks yes i was why i was dating dan at the time tammy says we were going to go out to breakfast and did you go out to breakfast not directly tammy says looking at dan where did you go dan said he had an errand to do tammy says at a warehouse he owned and did you go to the warehouse alan asks closing in he spots boone in the gallery and gives him a quick wink before turning back to tammy we did tammy says alan turns his back to her to look at the jury then at dan then at toddjust to stick it in a littlethen back at the jury he walks over to the jury box and asks with the immaculate timing of a really good standup comic when you went there did you get out of the car yes then what did you do i went inside and alan pauses to signal the jury that something important is coming up did you see anything unusual here it comes boone thinks a few more words out of her mouth and were done we can all get on with our lives and i can try to find a little peace inside a giant wave tammy looks straight at dan who pulls a little silver cross on a chain out of his pocket and fingers it nervously yeah boone thinks as he watches this like jesus is going to jump in on your side pull you out of the deep water no tammy says shit boone thinks alan keeps the smile on his face but it definitely tightens up this wasnt the answer he was expecting boone can see petras back stiffen her head straighten up dan silver just smiles alan moves away from the jury and walks up to the witness stand im sorry ms roddick perhaps i wasnt being clear when you went into the warehouse that night did you see mr silver there yes and was he doing something yes what he was just looking around checking the back door that kind of thing tammy says then we went to dennys she looks at the jurors with an expression of total innocence ms roddick alan asks his voice edging toward threat didnt you tell me that you saw mr silver pouring kerosene on the floor in the basement no tammy says you didnt tell me burke says that you saw him run a twisted sheet into that kerosene objection no or hold his cigarette lighter to that sheet and set it on fire burke asks objection no ob i have your sworn deposition here burke says i can show it to you if youd like jection boone sees petra start hammering on her laptop bringing up tammys deposition transcript the jurors are literally leaning forward in their seats totally awake now the case has suddenly become really interesting like they see on law amp order yeah okay i told you those things tammy says thank you alan says but hes not happy torching your own witness as it were is never a good thing because the other side gets to stand up and confront her with the conflict in her own testimony but its better than nothing except tammy says because you promised me money to say it thats not good boone thinks the jurors gasp the trial junkies in the gallery sit up with ears pricked petra turns in her chair and looks at boone then she shakes her head sadly and goes back to her computer todd the rod morphs into a semivertical position that could be mistaken for an actual human being standing up move for a directed verdict your honor not to mention sanctions for gross misconduct alan says mistrial your honor ill see you both in chambers hammond says now fucked boone thinks as he watches todd the rod ooze toward the judges chambers epic macking fucked boone intercepts tammy as she walks out of the courtroom they got to you didnt they boone asks she just shakes her head and pushes past him into the hallway he follows her just a few steps ahead of johnny and harrington what did they offer you boone says taking her by the elbow thats worth more than your friends life she turns those green eyes on him if youd seen what ive seen what have you seen tammy jerks her arm away hesitates for a second then says theres a world out there you know nothing about educate me but johnny steps between them he shows his badge and says sergeant kodani sdpd ms roddick we have some questions for you regarding the death of angela hart i dont know anything about that you might know more than you think johnny says in any case wed appreciate your coming down to the station to discuss it with us it wont take long am i under arrest she asks not yet harrington says pushing in would you like to be i have things i have to what harrington says youre late for the pole just come with us ms roddick johnny says he guides her toward the door harrington looks at boone another stellar performance from you daniels congratulations at least this time you got a grownup killed maybe next time itll be an old lady boone punches him tammy roddick is stone thats what johnny banzai thinks angela had your credit cards he says why tammy shrugs did you give them to her she stares at the wall or did you check into the motel with her johnny asks she checks her fingernails the interview room is nice small but clean with the walls painted in a soothing light yellow a metal table and two metal chairs the classic oneway mirror a video camera with microphone bolted to the ceiling so as much as harrington would like to bust into the room call her a stupid fucking twat and bounce her off the walls he cant do it without making a guest appearance on americas worst police videos all he can do is watch through a swollen eye as johnny takes another tack hey tammy johnny says you saw her get killed didnt you you were there you got away you could give us the guy who did it she finds an interesting stain on the table wets her finger and rubs it out thats the goodparts version johnny says you want to hear the bad version she goes back to the shrug the bad version johnny says is that you set her up you both saw danny set the fire but you made a deal and she wouldnt so you got her in that room to be killed try to follow along here tammy because im presenting you with a very important choice its a onetime offer it goes off the table in five seconds but right now you get to choose which you want to bewitness or suspect were talking firstdegree homicide premeditated and ill bet i can get special circumstances tossed in so youd be looking at i dont know let me get my calculator i want a lawyer tammy says which is some sort of progress johnny thinks at least weve gone verbal now the problem is shes verbalized the magic words that will stop the interview are you sure about that johnny says playing the standard card because hes not holding any better ones because once you ask for a lawyer you choose suspect twice she says excuse me this is twice im asking for a lawyer she says johnny pushes his luck who was the kid tammy what kid i want a lawyer the kid in the room with angela a little girl pink toothbrush i dont know i want a lawyer but she knows johnny sees it in her eyes dead as stone until he mentioned the kid and then there was something in there fear youre a cop for more than a few weeks you know fear when you see it he leans over the table and says real quietly for the kids sake tammy tell me the truth i can help let me help you let me help her shes at the tipping point again he knows it when he sees it she could go either way shes going toward johnnys when theres a commotion in the hall im her attorney i demand access get out of here harrington says has she asked for a lawyer she has hasnt she tammy sets her jaw and looks at the ceiling johnny gets up opens the door and sees todd the rod standing in the hallway the lawyer looks over his shoulder at tammy its okay now he says im here not one more word he has her out of there in thirty minutes boones in a lot longer after all he hit a cop a detective no less in a courthouse hallway and boone didnt just punch harrington once he went off on himbig heavy hands and muscles hard from years of surfing slamming punch after punch into harringtons face ribs and stomach until johnny banzai managed to get some kind of judo hold on him and choke him out now boone lies on a metal bench in the cell and nobody fucks with him he shares the cell with mostly blacks mexicans and some whitetrash drunks bikers and tweekers and nobody fucks with him he hit a cop a detective no less in a courthouse hallway boone could run for president of the cell and win by acclamation they love him in there guys are offering him their bologna sandwiches hes not hungry too fucking miserable to eat its over he thinks i took harringtons bait like the chump fish i am and now im looking at a felonious assault rap on a law enforcement officer that means certain jail time and my pi card is gonzo half the dawn patrols pissed at me and the other half must think im a total barney and theyre totally correct in that i let this roddick babe play me like a fish make me chase her like she didnt want to be caught and then bang she turns around and rams a hole in the boat and were all going down with it roddick set us up she was never going to testify against danny she sold the insurance company a story so it would deny silvers claim then he could sue for the big bucks when she changed her story the whole chase thing was to make us want her more and it worked judge hammond will deny alans motion for a mistrial and grant todds motion for a directed verdict when court reconvenes in the morning hell instruct the jury that the insurance company has already been found guilty and that all they need to decide is how much to award in punitive damages which will be in the millions and alan will be referred to the state bar association for ethics charges not to mention the district attorneys office for suborning perjury so will pete her career is fucked shell be lucky if she keeps her bar card never mind make partner if she does manage to stay in the law biz shell be doing fender benders and slipandfalls until her hair is gray a skinny white tweeker approaches boone and shoves a couple of pieces of stale bread at him you want my sammich no thanks the tweeker hesitates his shrunken methreduced mouth trembling with anxiety you want a blow job get away from me the tweeker sidles off but this is what lifes going to be boone thinks stale sammiches tweekers for friends and offers of jailhouse love he rolls over and faces the wall his back to the cell no ones going to fuck with him petra sits on a plastic chair bolted to the wall of the receiving station at the downtown jail shes glad to be there though glad to be anywhere that isnt in the proximity of alan burke whod gone off on her like a pit bull on crank good job hed said storming down the street outside the courthouse i didnt know she said working hard to keep up with him he stopped and whirled on her its your job to know its your job to get witnesses ready to testify for our side petra not the other side its my fault for not having mentioned that earlier i guess youre right of course im right he yelled holding his arms out like christ crucified spinning in a and yelling to everybody on broadway hey im right did you hear that the associate attorney whos never tried a case in her fucking life tells me im right does it get any better does life get any happier than this people walked by them chuckling im sorry petra said sorrys not good enough my resignation will be on your desk by the end of the business day petra said no no no no alan said too easy youre not walking away from this no youre going to stay for the whole long miserable march to death humiliation and destruction right by my side all right certainly yes are you sleeping with him alan asked with whom with todd the rod alan yelled boone who did you think i meant petra turned beet red and stared at him mouth agape then she said i dont think thats an appropriate question for an employer to ask an employee sue me alan said and walked away then he turned around came back and said look we fell for a trick older than dirt its not your fault i should have spotted it they set us up burned a cheap building down produced a phony arson witness then had her flip on us in court to get a punitive damages award they win we lose it happens now go bail boone out we dont shoot our wounded so now petra sits on the plastic chair waiting for the desk sergeant to process paperwork he seems to be working at glacial speed its a beauty and the beast scene tammy roddick walking down broadway in the company of todd the rod draws smirks from passersby whose sole thought is that the ugly fat man has maxed out an amex black card for a matinee at the westgate hotel they go to the westgate all right but not up to a room todd the rod walks her into the parking structure right to a gold humvee where red eddie sits in the backseat eating a fish taco smothered in salsa he stops chewing long enough to say get in pretty lady tammy balks todd the rod is already sleazing his way toward the elevator no worries sistuh eddie says no one going to touch a hair on your head on the life of my child she gets into the backseat with him where is she she asks he holds up a white paper bag taco where is she shes safe i want to see her tammy says not yet right fucking now youre a real tita huh eddie says you know tita hawaiian for tough girl i like that we got some time to kill tita maybe we can kill it together oooh look at them green cat eyes getting so angry gets me hot tita gives me wood i held up my end of the deal tammy says and well hold up ours eddie replies just not yet you have to develop a little patience tita its a virtue when when what eddie asks taking a huge bite of the taco the salsa drips from the side of his mouth when do you hold up your end of the deal some things have to happen first eddie says things go as planned you keep that sexy mouth shut tomorrow morning where eddie smiles wipes the salsa from his lips and sings let me take you down cos im going to boone cant let go of teddy dcup lying there on the metal bench his mind keeps going back to teddy in the motel room with the little mojada girl natch you cant let go of it he tells himself face it you have a serious jones going for pedophiles dont let it twist your thinking on this yeah but its not boone thinks theres something there something about the teddytammy connection that doesnt jive work through it tammy leaves mick penner for teddy no surprise thereshes trading up except most of teddys strippers work him for some cosmetic work and tammy hasnt had a stitch of plastic surgery okay maybe she just didnt want any or they havent gotten around to it yet mick knows his girl is doing teddy because he followed them to the cheap motel up near the strawberry fields which doesnt make any sense because teddy could do his matinees at any upscale hotel in la jolla or even at shrinks and a girl like tammy would expectin fact insist on a little luxury so why does he take her to the cheap joint all the way up in oside because its near the strawberry field where he picks up a little mojada girl but that doesnt make any sense youd think thats the last place hed take tammy youd think the good doctor would want to keep that little assignation way deep on the down low it doesnt make sense on another level pedophiles are pedophiles because they like little girls not grown women but teddy is notorious for banging fully grown strippers and got his nickname for giving them big fully grown triplex adult boobs teddy dcup likes women yeah except you saw him in the room with the child so a guys staring at him from across the cell big guy who looks like he hits the weight room pretty regularly what boone asks you remember me the whole cell is quiet watching this develop hoping for a little relief from the mindnumbing monotony of jail no boone says should i you tossed me out of the sundowner once okay like big freaking deal boone thinks ive thrown a lot of idiots out of the sundowner the guy gets up and stands over boone but you aint got your big samoan buddy or that other guy with you now do you boone sort of remembers him now east county guy who got a turista drunk and was going to take her somewhere for a gang bang he makes a point of looking around the cell then says no i dont see either of them here so so im going to beat the shit out of you i dont want any trouble the guy sneers i dont give a fuck what you want a biker sitting against the wall asks boone you want us to take care of this no but thanks boone says hes had a bad day a really bad day thats not going to get any better he hasnt had any sleep hes aching and tired and irritable and now this pumpedup kook is trying to make his day even worse get up the guy says i dont want to pussy okay im a pussy boone says youre my bitch if you say so boone says folding his arms across his chest and closing his eyes he feels the guy reach out to grab him flicks his hands out to separate the guys arms then knifeedges both his own hands into the guys neck the guy is done now he just doesnt know it yet stunned from the double strike to the carotids he cant react quickly enough as boone slides his hands around the back of his neck holds his head and brings his knee up three times into his chin boone lets go pushes and the guy slides to the floor unconscious blood trickling from his mouth boone lies back down theres a short pause then the tweeker who had offered boone a bologna sandwich and a blow job scoots over to rob the unconscious man he reaches inside his shirt and yanks out a small chain with a little crucifix on it holds it up to boone and asks you want this because jailhouse law says it belongs to boone by right of conquest boone shakes his head thinking youre an idiot daniels a total barney he gets up from the bench steps over a few guys to get to the bars and calls out to the jailer yo bro any word on me getting out of here yeah as a matter of fact ten minutes later he walks out of the building with petra she tries to put a brave face on things at least now she says you can catch your big swell doesnt matter boone says it doesnt petra thinks because it certainly seemed to matter a great deal just a day ago my god could it have been just a day boone asks can i borrow your car to go to the beach she wonders she starts to ask but theres an energy to him that makes her stop its a man she hasnt seen before intense focused its admirable but also a little frightening youre not going to push it off a cliff are you she asks not planning on it she digs into her purse and hands him the keys thanks boone says ill get it back to you im taking that to mean petra says that you dont want me to go with you he looks at her with seriousness that again she hasnt seen in him before and again that simultaneously scares and excites her look he says there are some things you have to do alone can you dig that i can im going to make this all right i know you are he leans down and kisses her lightly on the cheek then turns and walks away with a stride that she can only describe to herself as purposeful she gets it thinks you have a few things to make right yourself petra calls a cab and tells the driver to take her to the sundowner boone drives to tammys place she wont be homedanny will have whisked her away somewhere by now he parks petras car right out front takes the stairs up to tammys place and picks the lock the apartments the usual usual he heads right for the bedroom because thats where people keep their secrets there or in the bathroom tammys bedroom looks a lot like angelas right down to the same framed picture of the two of them on top of the bureau and youre an idiot boone thinks you look at her in those pictures she hasnt changed a bit teddy didnt do any work on her so whats up between them he goes into the bathroom and opens the medicine cabinet nothing on the shelves of any interest but a small walletsize photo is carefully wedged into the seam between the glass and the frame on the lower left corner of the inside of the cabinet door its a face shot of a young girl the picture was taken outdoors but the background is indistinct due to low light and the closeup on the face but the girl from the strawberry fields the reeds the girl in the motel room with teddy probably latina judging from the brown skin long straight black hair and dark eyes but she could be native american hard to tell what she definitely is is a very pretty sweetlooking little girl with a shy hesitant smile wearing a cross on a thin silver chain the same cross and chain that dan silver took out of his pocket just before tammy flipped on her testimony so it was no setup boone thinks at least not on tammys part she was responding to a threat silver has the girl whoever she is and he was letting tammy know that the right words had better come out of her mouth boone takes the picture out and looks on the back a childs handwriting te amo luce well at least we have a name now boone thinks at least the kid has a name but who is she boone wonders and why is her picture on the inside of a medicine cabinet door why do you hide a picture but want to be reminded of it every day how does a stripper meet a mojada girl and why does she care think think he tells himself trying to fight through the fatigue thats smacking at him as the adrenaline drains tammy left mick and went to teddy why go back to your cop days he thinks chronology do the time line tammy leaves mick just after the fire at dannys warehouse she becomes obsessed with making money she spends her time with angela she goes to teddy teddy and she start going up to oceanside but if theyre not having sex what are they doing teddy knew right where to go to find the girl right down into the reeds by the old sakagawa strawberry fields obviously hed been there before with tammy and not just once but lots of times between the fire and the arson trial at which tammy does a if youd seen what ive seen what tammy what did you see sunny takes a moment to watch the sun go down a bright red ball today painting the sea a carmine red beautiful dramatic but somehow a little ominous tonight is the last night of your old life sort of thing indeed the oceans kicking it up getting it into gear she can feel it in the air in her blood it makes her heart pound she watches it for a few moments and then starts to walk to her house chuck wanted her to work a double but she wants to go home and get some rest before the big day tomorrow shes walking home along the boardwalk when petra catches up with her could i have a word with you depends on the word sunny says without stopping or even slowing down petra has to struggle to keep up with her longlegged stride please that always worked when i was a kid sunny says she stops and turns to look at petra what do you want her subtext is clear to petra what do you want now you already have the man i love sunny day is a beautiful woman petra thinks even more beautiful in the soft dusk that casts a glow on her face even clad in old jeans and a thick sweatshirt and not wearing a bit of makeup the woman is simply lovely i just wanted to tell you petra says that what you saw at boones cottage wasnt truly indicative of the reality of the situation in english boone and i havent been together sexually well yippee for you girl scout sunny says but dont let me stop you she starts to walk away again petra reaches out and grabs her elbow if you want to keep that hand sunny says oh stop it stop what the toughgirl act youre going to find out its no act sunny says if you dont let go of my arm petra gives up she drops her hand and says i just came to tell you something about boone she turns away shes a few steps down the boardwalk when she hears sunny call after her hey flatland babe you dont have anything to tell me about boone no i suppose not petra says my apologies sunny blows out a stream of air then says look ive been slinging plates to a restaurant full of testosterone cases all day i guess im a little aggro aggravated right sunny says so what did you want to say about boone petra tells her about boone attacking harrington im not surprised sunny says thats where it all started where what all started boones she searches for words boone going adrift i guess petra asks what is his story anyway whats his story i mean i dont understand him petra says why hes so underemployed beneath his abilities why he left the police department sunny says it didnt work out what happened sunny gives a long sigh thinks about it and says rain his daughter what sunny says doesnt boone have a daughter named rain petra asks i mean i thought he had her with you actually where did you get that sunny asks i saw some pictures at his place sunny tells her the story of rain sweeny i understand petra says no you dont sunny replies boone still works that case he never stops trying to find her it eats him up but surely the poor girl is dead yes but boone wont let it go closure petra says well sunny replies boone wouldnt know that word or hed pretend not to but between you and me yeah i guess closure gets it done anyway thats boones story as for you and him boone and me we dont own each other now if you dont mind i have a wave to catch petra watches her walk away a golden girl on a golden beach wonders how and if boone could ever let her go sunny wonders the same thing she gets back to her place peels off her sweatshirt and flings it against the wall is it really over over with boone and me can he just let me go like this i guess so she thinks recalling the image of the little brit curled up on boones couch even if what she said about not having sex with boone was true its only a matter of time the woman is pretty sunny thinks a total betty of course boone would want her yeah but its more than sex isnt it sunny thinks as she goes to her computer to log on to the surf report shes so different this chick and maybe thats the point maybe boone wants something totally different for his life and thats fair so do i and its coming she sees it on the screen a big whirling splash of red spinning its way toward her bringing the hope of a different life the hope and the threat she thinks am i ready for this ready for change i guess thats what boone wants is it what i want she sits down in front of her little statue of kuan yinthe female personification of the buddha and the chinese goddess of compassionand tries to meditate clear all this relationship shit out of her head theres no room for it right now the big swell is coming it will be here tonight and shell be in the water at first light and will need every ounce of concentration and focus she possesses to ride those waves so breathe girl she tells herself push out the confusion breathe in the clarity its coming dave the love god tries to tell red eddie the same thing he sits on the deck of the new lifeguard station at pb looking out at an ocean that is getting sketchier by the second and tries to tell eddie that basically its not a fit night for man or beast or boatloads of boo eddies not buying it he thinks its shaping up to be a perfect night to do thisblack foggy and the coast guard sticking close to shore you are dave the motherfucking love god he says youre a freaking legend if anyone can do this daves not so sure freaking legend or no hes going to have all he can handle tomorrow and more the water is going to be a freaking zoo with every bigname surfer and a few dozen wannabes out there in surf that should be blackflagged anyway trying to ride waves that are genuinely dangerous people are going to go into the trough get trapped in the impact zone under the crushing weight of the big waves and someone is going to have to go in there and pull them out and that someone is probably going to be dave so being out all night and then coming into a situation where he needs to be absolutely on top of his game is not a good idea he doesnt want to lose anyone tomorrow dave the love god lives his life by the proposition that you can save everybody he couldnt get up in the morning if he didnt think that all evidence and personal experience notwithstanding the truth is that he has lost people has dragged their blue and swollen bodies in from the ocean and stood watching the emts trying to bring them back knowing that their best efforts will be futile that sometimes the ocean takes and doesnt give back he doesnt sleep those nights despite what he teaches his young chargesthat you do your best and then let it godave doesnt let it go maybe its ego maybe its his sense of omnipotence in the water but dave feels in his heart that he should save everybody get there in time every time that he can always snatch a victim out of the oceans clutches never mind what the moana wants hes lost four people in his career a teenager who got sucked out on a boogie board and panicked an old man who had a heart attack outside the break and went under a young woman distance swimmer who was doing her daily swim from shores over to la jolla cove and just got tired a child the child a little boy was the worst of course he was the screaming mother the stoic father at the funeral the mother thanked dave for finding her sons body dave remembered diving for him grabbing him knowing the instant he touched the limp arm that the boy was never going home remembered carrying him to shore seeing the mothers hopeful face watching the hope dissolve into heartbreak the night of the funeral boone came by with a bottle of vodka and they got good and drunk boone just sat there and poured as dave cried boone put him to bed that night slept on the floor beside him made coffee in the morning before they went to the sundowner for breakfast never talked about it again never forgot it either some things you dont forget you just wish you could and the chances of losing another one tomorrow are very real dave thinks running through his mind the list of highly skilled experienced surfers who have died in recent years trying to ride big waves there were lifeguards out there those days too great watermen who did everything they could but everything wasnt enough what the ocean wants it takes so now he interrupts eddies streamofconsciousness polyglot rap and says sorry bro its not on for tonight gots to be tonight eddie says get someone else then i want you he mentions the pricethree months of daves salary for plucking people out of the current three freaking months of sitting on the tower looking out for other people who go home to their houses their families their bank accounts their trust funds then he says you take a walk on me tonight david you keep walking you retire on a lifeguards pension take a job delivering the mail or flipping burgers bruddah fuck it dave thinks i aint no george freeth theres a world out there you know nothing about boones thinking about this as he leaves tammys apartment gets back in the bmw and starts to drive its getting dark and the streetlights are coming on the ocean is going slate gray and headed toward black what were you trying to say tammy boone thinks okay back it up again tammy has a picture of a girl named luce in her apartment teddy goes into the reed beds by the strawberry fields and protected by a bunch of armed mojados comes out a little while later with the same girl he takes her to a motel room feeds her drugs and is about to rape her when you bust in you put teddy into the wall the girl runs dannys muscle comes in they grab teddy and he leads them right to where hes stored tammy at shrinks you get there first they try to shoot her but it doesnt work you get her back to your place tell her about angela and shes not surprised tammy knew already she didnt send angela to the crest motel to switch places she went with her she was in the motel the night angela was murdered was it a jealousy thing did tammy set angela up did she kill her herself tammys a big strong girl she could have pitched angela off that balcony that would be crazy because when she left the motel she went to angelas place she took a shower she lay down made coffee she didnt drink toast she didnt eat then she called teddy who hid her out at shrinks you put some heat on him and he ran not to tammy but to the strawberry fields looking for the girl and teddy knew right where to look for her because hed been there before he drove right to the strawberry fields and when i tried to follow him i got the shit beat out of me by a trio of very angry mojados kicking and punching me and calling me a pendejo lambioso bastard asslicker picaflor child molester so they were used to guys coming to the reeds to look for little girls thats what they thought i was doing there so that must be a place where pedophiles go and the guy with the shotgun the kid with the machete the old man they were fed up with it they saw a chance to do something about it and they did it except it was okay for teddy to go to the strawberry fields to find a little girl but not me they let him through but they stopped me so youre a moron daniels he tells himself the mojados werent selling the kid they were protecting her but they let teddy take her to the motel room he pulls onto crystal pier gets out of the car and goes into his place walks into the bedroom goes to the desk and opens the drawer rain sweeny looks up at him she has a silver chain with a cross around her neck talk to me boone says please honey talk to me theres a world out there you know nothing about if youd seen what ive seen boone sets the picture of rain down and gets the pistol from his nightstand sticks it in the waistband of his jeans and heads back out hes going to make this right but he has one place to stop first make that right too sunny goes over to the wall to inspect her quiver of boards her quiver is her toolbox her fortune her biggest investment every spare dollar left after food and rent has gone into boardsshort boards long ones of different shapes and designs for different kinds of surf now she selects her big gun pulls it off the rack takes it from its bag and lays it on the floor its a real rhino chaserten feet long customshaped for her it cost twelve hundred dollars a lot of tips at the sundowner she examines it for nicks or hairline cracks then finding none she checks the fins to make sure theyre in solidly shell wait until morning to wax it so she puts it back in its bag and up on the rack then she takes down her other big gun a spare because waves like this could easily snap a board in half and if that happens she wants to have another ready to go so she can get right back out there then she checks her leash the fivefoot cord that attaches at one end to the board on the other end to a velcro strap around her ankle the invention of the leash made it possible to ride big waves because the surfer could retrieve the board before it crashed into the rocks but its a doubleedged sword the leash on the one hand it helps potential rescuers find a surfer trapped underwater in the impact zone because the board will pop to the surface and headstone and divers can follow the leash down to the surfer on the other hand though the cord can get tangled on rocks or coral reefs and trap the surfer under the water hence the velcro easy release strap and now sunny practices her release she straps the leash to her ankle and lies flat on the floor then bends all the way forward and rips the velcro off removing the leash she does this ten times from a lyingflat position then rolls onto her side and does it ten more times each from the right and left side then she puts her feet up on the back of her couch lies on the floor and pulls herself up to rip the velcro off the routine builds the abdominal strength that could one day save her life if shes trapped underwater and has to do one of these situps against a strong current of water pushing her back its a mental discipline too practicing in the calm dry apartment so that the move will become so automatic that she can do it underwater with her lungs burning and the ocean exploding over her satisfied with the maneuver she gets up goes into the narrow kitchen and makes herself a cup of green tea she takes the tea to the table turns on her laptop computer and logs on to wwwsurfshotcom to check the progress of the big swell its a swirling red blotch on the electronic map of the pacific building now up around ventura county the crews up there will be in the water in the morning getting their big rides making the mags but the swell is clearly moving south she stays on the site and checks buoy reports water temperatures weather reports wind directions it takes the perfect combination to produce the really big swell all the kite strings have to come together at the same moment a failure of any single element could destroy the whole thing if the water gets too warm or too cold if the wind changes from offshore to onshore if she leaves the table and sits in front of the little shrine made of a pine plank over cinder blocks the plank supports a statue of kuan yin a small bust of the buddha a photo of a smiling dalai lama and a small incense burner she lights the incense and prays please kuan yin please dont let it stall out there blow itself out in the sweeping curve of the south bay please compassionate lord buddha let it come rolling to me please dont let it lose its anger and its force its lifechanging potential before it gets to me ive been patient ive been persistent ive been disciplined its my turn om mani padme hum the jewel is in the lotus life is going to change she thinks whatever happens tomorrow if i get a sponsorship go out on the pro circuitno she corrects herself not if wheni get my sponsorship go out on the pro circuit ill be traveling a lot all over the world i wont be at the sundowner i wont be at the dawn patrol and boone boone will never leave pacific beach hell say he will well promise that well make time for each other well talk about him coming out to where i am but it wont happen well drift literally apart and we both know it to be fair to boone hes been supportive she remembers the conversation they had two years ago when she was struggling with the decision of where to go with her life they were in bed together the sun just creeping through the blinds he had slept as always like a rock she had tossed and turned am i good enough she asked him out of the blue but he knew just what she was talking about totally good enough i think so too she said ive been thinking i need to get serious really get ready to take my shot you should he said because you could be great i could she thinks now i can i will theres a knock on the door she opens it and sees boone standing there dave the love god launches the zodiac into batiquitos lagoon this is freaking crazy he thinks and hes absolutely right heavy surf warnings are out the coast guard has issued a small craft advisory and if anything qualifies as a small craft its a freaking zodiac he steers the zodiac out of the lagoon toward the open ocean its near to being closed out its going to be tough busting out through the break but red eddie is right dave knows these waters he knows the breaks the current the sweet spots if he can get out on a board he can get out in a boat he does takes an angle drives through the shoulder between two breaks gets outside and points the zodiac south he decides to hug pretty close to the coast until he gets far enough south to turn seaward toward the coordinates that eddie had given him to meet the boat thats coming up from mexico with the cargo i was just thinking about you sunny says bad stuff no sunny lets boone in and he sits down on the couch she offers him a cup of tea but he doesnt want anything well he doesnt want anything to drink but he seems to want to say something and cant seem to get there she helps him out what happened to us boone i dont know we used to be great together she says maybe its the big swell boone says it seems to be bringing something in with it she sits down beside him ive been feeling it too its like how a big swell washes in and sweeps things away with it and its never the same again its not necessarily better or worse its just different and theres nothing you can do about it boone says sunny nods so this other chick petra okay are you and she no boone says i mean i dont think so you dont think so i dont know sunny boone says i dont know what it is i dont know what i used to know all i know is that things are changing and i dont like it the buddha said that change is the only constant sunny says good for him boone says old dude with a beer belly and a stoned smile boone thinks sticking his nose between me and sunny change is the only constantnew age retrohippie birkenstock bullshit except its sort of true you look at the ocean for instance its always changing its always a different ocean but its still the ocean like me and sunny our relationship might change but were always going to love each other you look tired sunny says im trashed can you get a little sleep she asks not yet he says how about you you need your restbig day coming ive been hitting the chat rooms she says all the big boys are going to be there a lot of towin crews im going to give it a shot anyway but youll shred it he says youll kill them i hope so i know so god she loves him for that whatever else boone is or isnt hes a friend and hes always believed in her and that means the world to her she gets up and says i really should be getting to bed yeah he gets up they stand close for a few painful silent moments then she says youre invited he wraps his arms around her after today after she rides her big wave everything is going to be different shes going to be different theyre going to be different i have something i have to do boone says tonight okay she squeezes him tightly for a second feels the pistol hey boone theres a few dozen bad punch lines here but its okay she squeezes him tighter for a second then let go holding on the buddha says is the source of all suffering youd better go before we both change our minds i love you sunny love you too boone and thats a constant that will never change the small boat pitches and rolls in the heavy swell waves smashing over the bow the boat slides into the trench and then climbs out again threatening to tip over backward before it can crest the top of the next wave out of control the crew has experienced rough seas before but nothing like this juan carlos and esteban have seen the perfect storm but they never thought theyd be in the fucking thing they dont know what the hell to do and there might be nothing they can dothe ocean just might decide to do them esteban prays to san andrйs the patron saint of fishermen a fishermans son who found life in their small village too boring esteban went to the city in search of excitement now he fervently wishes that hed listened to his father and stayed in loreto if he ever gets off this boat hes going back and never take his boat out of the sight of land radio in a distress call esteban yells to juan carlos with what weve got down below juan carlos replies they have thirtytolife in the hold so they keep banging north against the tough southern current trying to make the rendezvous point where they can turn over their cargo the cargo is down below terrified crying whimpering vomiting up on top juan carlos says to esteban this things going under he might be right esteban thinks the boat is a dog a bottomheavy tub built for calm seas and sunny days not for sledding down the face of mountains its bound to capsize theyd be better off in the lifeboat which is what juan carlos is thinking esteban can see it in the older mans eyes juan carlos is in his forties but looks older his face is lined with more than the sea and the sun his eyes show that hes seen some things in his life esteban is just a teenagerhes seen nothingbut he knows he doesnt want to carry this memory on the inside of his eyelids for the rest of his life what about them esteban yells pointing below juan carlos shrugs there isnt room in the life raft for them its a shame but a lot of things in life are a shame im not doing it esteban says shaking his head im not just leaving them out here youll do what i tell you esteban plays the trump card what would danny say hed kill us man fuck danny hes not out here is he juan carlos replies youd better worry about not dying out here then you can worry what dannys going to do esteban looks down at the children below its wrong im not doing it the fuck youre not juan carlos says he whips the knife out from beneath his rain slicker and thrusts it toward estebans throat two will have a much better chance handling the lifeboat in these seas than one okay okay esteban says he helps juan carlos unlash the lifeboat and swing it over the side it takes a while because they have to wait several times as the boat slides and then crests almost tipping over he and juan carlos have to grip the rails with all their strength just to hang on and not be pitched into the sea they swing the boat out but they cant climb into it because the boat rolls in that direction almost lying flat on the water the sea just inches from the gunwales juan carlos slides toward the water but catches himself on the rail his strong hands gripping for his life esteban kicks at the older mans hands holding on himself he kicks again and again as juan carlos screams at him but esteban keeps kicking him juan carlos never breaks his grip but estebans feet break his fingers and the older man loses his hold and slips into the ocean he tries to grab estebans leg and take the boy with him but his hands are too smashed to hold on and the ocean takes him juan carlos cant swim esteban watches him struggle for a moment and then go under when the boat rights itself again esteban hauls himself up staggers to the wheel and turns the boat back into the oncoming wave with his other hand he unties his rope belt then uses it to fasten himself to the column of the wheel and prays san andrйs i have fallen so far into evil that i would sell children but i would not kill them so i beg you for mercy have mercy on us all the sea rises up in front of him dave cant believe what hes looking at he crests the top of a wave and sees the boat sitting in the trench sideways to the oncoming wave dangerously low in the water sitting like a log to be rolled the lifeboat dangles to the starboard side on its davits as if the abandon ship order had been given but not executed where the hell is the captain dave wonders whats he thinking dave surfs the zodiac down the wave racing the break to the boat he gets there seconds before enough time to jump on tie on and hold on as the wave smashes into the side and knocks the boat on its side miraculously it bobs back up again and dave makes his way to the wheelhouse the pilots unconscious lying on the deck next to the wheel blood running from a cut on his head dave recognizes young esteban from several of these pickups but what the fuck is the boy doing tied to the wheel and where is juan carlos dave turns the boat back into the surf locks the wheel on that setting and kneels down beside esteban the kids eyes open and he smiles san andrйs saint andrew my ass dave thinks then he hears voices its a night for weird voices it could be the wind playing tricks but these voices seem to be coming from below he walks around and opens the hatch cant fucking believe what he sees six maybe seven young girls huddled together dave gags even standing on deck in the sea air the bottom reeks of vomit urine and shit and dave has to fight not to gag dave the love god is seriously shaken up maybe for the first time in his entire life stay there he yells shoving his palms out to make his point just stay there he strides back to the wheelhouse esteban is picking himself up off the deck dave grabs him by the front of the shirt and shoves him against the wheel what the fuck dave yells esteban just shakes his head i didnt sign up for this dave hollers nobody told me about this im sorry wheres juan carlos esteban points to the water he fell over good dave thinks adifuckingos hed just as soon toss esteban over the side too but he needs him to help get these kids off the sinking boat and into the zodiac it isnt easy the girls are sick dizzy and scared to death reluctant to leave what little safety they have on the boat for the pitching sea it takes all of daves lifeguard demeanor to calm them down and get them into his boat he gets in first and stretches up his arms while esteban hands them down one by one he settles them into the zodiac carefully arranging them to balance the weight the boat is going to be too heavy and sit too low in the water to be really safe but there isnt really a choice he either leaves them out here or he does his best to get them all in hes not so worried about the open seathe storm is calming down and he can negotiate the swells the critical moment is going to be busting through the shore break where the overloaded boat could easily flip or swamp he doubts any of these kids are strong swimmers if he doesnt bring the boat in upright most of them will probably drown in the heavy white water that comes with the big swell esteban hands the last girl down and then starts to climb in dave stops him youre not on the list pacheco what am i supposed to do turn the boat around and take it back to mexico dave says what do you usually do i cant go back esteban says why not esteban hesitates then says i killed juan carlos he was going to leave them out here get in dave works his way to the aft of the boat theres no place for him to sit down so he stands boone pulls into teddys driveway and gets out of the car the night air is wet somewhere between mist and gentle rain the light coming from teddys living room window looks soft and warm boone can see them through the window teddys at the bar fixing a stiff and dirty martini tammy paces the room he tries to give her the drink but she wont take it so teddy sips it himself he looks startled when boone rings the doorbell looks to tammy who looks back at him and shrugs boone waits as teddy opens the door a crack the chain link left on boone shoves the pistol through the crack and says hi can i come in yeah he can a gun is its own invitation teddy unhooks the chain lock and opens the door boone goes in and kicks it shut behind him teddys house is as beautiful as hed expected huge living room with a vaulted ceiling expensive custom paint with faux brush techniques expensive modern paintings and sculpture a grand piano the center of the room is taken up with a floortoceiling column thats a saltwater aquarium a startlingly bright panoply of tropical fish circle serenely around the column tall green undersea plants stretch up toward the surface and wave like thin fingers in the mild motordriven current at the back of the room a slider gives a view of a huge spotlighted deck and beyond that the open ocean nice boone says thanks hi tammy she glares at him what do you want just the truth trust me you dont want it theres a little girl involved boone says now youre going to tell me the truth or i swear ill splatter both of you all over this pretty room teddy walks back toward the bar would you like a drink he asks youre going to need one just the story thanks suit yourself teddy says but im sitting down its been an exhausting couple of days as you know he sits down in the large leather easy chair and looks at the fish in his tank tell him tammy its almost over now anyway tammy tells her story tammy grew up in el cajon out in east county the usual stereotypical stripper back story her dad wasnt around a lot her mom made an unsteady living as a waitress in a local restaurant and usually stayed for a few beers after her shift was over she was a lonely little girl a latchkey kid who made herself instant macaroni and cheese which she ate while watching celebrity shows on television and dreaming about becoming one of the actresses on the red carpet it didnt seem likely thenshe was skinny and gangly and had red hair which the boys made fun of they stopped making jokes around the time she turned fourteen tammy didnt blossomshe exploded into a sexuality that seemed to happen overnight and was scary and confusing to her suddenly boys wanted her and she saw the way that grown men looked at her when shed go to the restaurant to say hello to her mom she wanted to say to them im fourteen years old im a kid but she was afraid to speak to or even look back at them a good thing men would see the intensity in those incredible green eyes and mistake it for something else okay she learned to use it she admits it freely why not high school was a nightmare she was never good at schoolthere were diagnoses of dyslexia and addso being an actress wasnt going to happen she couldnt read a script out loud and never got cast in the drama club productions she thought about being a model but you dont exactly bump into eileen ford in el cajon and she couldnt afford the money for photographers to create a portfolio she did a little modeling for a local sportswear catalog and made a couple hundred dollars but that was about it tammy graduated from high school with a cminus average and it looked like waiting tables was her future she did it for a year or so enduring the crappy tips the leers the comments and the offers and then one day when she was twenty she was walking home in the hundredplus heat along the flat sunbaked sidewalk and decided that she had to do something anything to get out of there so she took her red hair amazing green eyes and long legs got on a bus to mira mesa walked into a strip club and auditioned she thought it would be hard but it wasnt so hard taking her clothes off okay so it wasnt the red carpet it was a platform and a pole and yes it was a clichй but tammy learned quickly that if she paused in her dance and cast those eyes out over the front row she would get tips if she picked out one guy and trained those cat eyes on him she could easily get him into the champagne room or the vip room or whatever the hell room where the bigger money got made a year or so later she found her way to silver dans a couple of weeks after that dan silver found his way to her of course he did the owner of a strip clubin this case a chain of strip clubshas a sort of droit du seigneur when it comes to the girls they dont have to date him and if they do date him they dont have to sleep with him but its a good professional move if they do you sleep with the boss you dont have to blow the night manager to get a good shift the bartenders pour your drinks without coming on to you or wanting a cut the other girls find space for you in front of the mirror the really creepy customers pick up on the vibe and keep their distance tammy had been around long enough to know that and even if she hadnt angela would have told her angela was her best friend at silver dans they hit it off right awaysimilar background similar outlook same tough attitude it was angela who told her that if the boss came calling shed better open the gates or life could get impossible for her at the club so she dated dan yeah but it was more than that wasnt it if she really wants to look at the truth of herself dan wasnt just a convenient lay or a good dinner like most pimps he was a daddy he was that fucking father figure shed been missing clichй clichй stereotype and clichй but there it was he treated her like a daughter and a fuck incest sans the dna and felony concerns made her obey him and wear the clothes he picked out made her call him daddy as he did her from behind and pulled her hair like youd jerk on the reins of a recalcitrant filly she hated it and she loved it she started sleeping with mick penner as rebellion he was the opposite of a daddya boychild ladykiller who fucked up and fell in love with her shed still come when dan beckonedand god knows how many other women he was doing on the sidebut shed go bang mick and play house with him and mick treated her gently and with consideration and she couldnt get too much of that she was with danny the night of the fire he told her to wait in the car but she got bored and impatient she stood outside and smoked a cigarette but when that was done she thought fuck danny and went inside what she saw changed her world dirty mattresses on a concrete floor an old showerhead surrounded by a torn plastic curtain strung on a clothesline an open toilet in the corner random blankets no sheets some stained pillows without covers the girls were like zombies later tammy would learn that these behaviors were symptomatic of severe and repetitive trauma but that night tammy just saw a group of young girls looking at her with dead eyes except one one little girl came over threw her arms around tammys legs pressed her head against her thighs and held on tight that was of course luce tammy didnt know what to do didnt know how to handle this girl didnt know who these children were she guessed at their agesthe oldest seemed to be a young teenager the youngest couldnt have been more than eight the girl clutching her legs was probably eleven or twelve all the girls had brown skin black hair dark eyes they wore cheap clothes that looked like theyd come from the salvation army or an am vets store most were holding some vestiges of childhood or familya stuffed dog a plastic flower a book luce wore a silver chain with a small cross tammy stroked the girls hair it was greasy and dirty but tammy didnt mind she stroked the girls hair and made soft cooing sounds dan didnt dan blew fucking up he came down the hallway saw tammy in the room and yelled what the fuck are you doing in here i told you to wait outside most of the girls threw themselves facedown on their mattresses and did their best to cover their heads with blankets luce held tighter to tammy and pressed her face harder against her legs tammy didnt back down what the fuck am i doing here she yelled back what the fuck is this dan dan grabbed her by the arm and started to haul her out luce still clinging to tammys legs dan stopped and grabbed the girl trying to peel her off but tammy shoved and hit out at him and dan had to let go of luce to grab tammy by the wrists you leave her alone tammy yelled or ill youll what danny asked youll fucking what she brought a knee up into dannys balls that was fucking what dan keeled over luce regained her grip on tammy one of dans bouncers came out of a back room hoisted tammy away from the crying girl hauled her out of the building and forced her into dans car as he was pushing her out the door she heard the little girl yelling ўlos campos fresas ўlos campos fresas dan came out a couple of minutes later and got into the drivers seat slapped her across the face you cunt you bastard tammy said who were those girls what are you doing with them theyre illegals all right dan said i get them jobs as maids bullfucking shit tammy said i know what business youre in dan thats right dan said im in the sex business tammy i sell sex you cant handle that theyre children in mexico half of them would be married by now theyd be churning out babies already keep telling yourself that you sick motherfucker theyd be starving back home dan said yeah they look like theyre doing great here tammy said fuck you dan im calling the cops he clamped his hand around her throat pulled her face close to his and said if you do that you stupid twat ill kill you and just in case you dont care about your own useless life think about the kids their families owe money to the guys who bring them in if they dont produce the snakeheads take it out on their families capisce she nodded but he didnt let her go for a few seconds just to make a point to make the point further he unzipped his fly and forced her head down you open your mouth its for this when he let her up she could see through watery eyes the bouncer loading the girls into an old van a few seconds later flames blew out the windows dan drove her home she didnt go to the cops she went to the insurance company and told them that she saw him set the fire that she could put him at the scene it was a mistake shed tell teddy later she wanted to get back at dan silver and she wanted them to look harder at the fire maybe theyd find something that would put them onto what was really happening there she did something else she looked for luce tammy went out to the strawberry fields los campos fresas and looked for the girl her first few trips all she saw were the workers in the fields and then one day she left the new strip club she was working at and went straight out to the fields arriving there shortly before dawn she saw a bunch of men leave the fields and walk down to the side of the river where a stand of tall reeds hid the men from view she drove down the road to the other side parked her car and walked in a little ways tammy waited until all the fieldworkers had gone away and then went in a mexican man with a shotgun went to stop her but tammy ignored him and he let her pass she found luce on a bed of stampeddown reeds tammy took some hand wipes out of her bag and helped the girl clean herself off speaking broken spanish and english she and the girl talked but mostly she held the girl and stroked her hair the man with the shotgun told her shed have to go that the pimps would come very soon to take the girls back to where they lived where do they live tammy asked all over the place the men move them around he told her they go to different fields all day or to hidden factories sometimes to the mojado camps at night but they always bring them to this place the strawberry fields at sunrise every day the local pedophiles had a cute name for it they called it the dawn patrol the man with the shotgun told tammy again that she had to go tell her ill be back tammy said whats her name the man pablo asked the girl her name luce luce im tammy ill come back to see you okay tammy did go back three or four times a week pablo always escorted her in and even the pimps who brought the girls in the van came to tolerate her when they saw that she wasnt going to go to the police she took luceand all the girlsfood clothing cold medication books she took them condoms she took them female love and affection it wasnt enough tammy confided in angela told her all about luce and the strawberry fields they need medical care tammy said they need a doctor angela took her to see teddy he had done angelas boobsshe had done him to get the insider discount teddy didnt believe her at first thought she was a psycho he felt sorry for her figured she had been an abused child who had twisted her trauma into delusion he was going to recommend a good psychiatrist but tammy challenged him to go and see for himself so teddy rode up one day with her he wanted to call the police tammy begged him not to told him why what she needed what the girls needed was a doctor im hoping thats you she said it was he went back again and again at first pablo was hesitant and the van drivers absolutely forbade it but teddy overcame their resistance with wads of cash and assurances of silence and the men werent total animals they had some compassion and teddy convinced them that it was in their interest to have the girls checked for venereal disease that it was just good business the girls are raped multiple time a day six days a week teddy tells boone now they give them sundays off the men pay five to ten dollars to have sex with them it doesnt sound like this would add up to a lot of money but multiply it by several locations a day all over california hell all over the country more and more now youre talking serious money the variety of potential and actual stds is staggering no matter what we do a third of these girls are going to become hivpositive and then theres vaginal trauma anal tears not to mention the daytoday gardenvariety colds flu respiratory infections hygiene issues you could set up a clinic there and staff it twentyfourseven and youd still be overwhelmed but teddy did what he could he did set up a clinic he rented a fulltime room at the motel and stocked it with antibiotics and other drugs hiding them in locked cabinets as otherwise the room would be broken into and the drugs stolen he went up there two three five times a week as his schedule allowed usually with tammy the pimps tolerated them as long as they got the girls in and out as long as the girls met their schedule as long as nobody breathed a word it was okay just there was always the threat that the operation would be shut down and teddy no matter how hard he tried to argue no matter what kind of cash he threw at them was never ever allowed anywhere near the safe houses where the girls lived safe houses he says to boone theres a tasty irony more like petri dishes fecund hothouses for bacteria if i could get to them and institute just some basic hygienic procedures we could eliminate at least half of the chronic diseases they suffer from but it was no good they could never find out where the girls were housed and they were afraid to push it and the girls themselves changed all the time they were shuffled around disappearing sometimes returning new girls arriving every few weeks it made tammy crazy with fear once luce went missing for two weeks and teddy had to sedate tammy when the girl returned tammy swore that she couldnt go through that again that they had to do something she loved the girl teddy says do you have kids boone shakes his head i have three teddy says by a couple of different wives you fall in love with them you know and the thought of anything happening to them she decided to take luce tammy and angela decided that they would take the girl and raise her themselves they knew they just couldnt take herthat would endanger luces family back in guanajuatoso they decided to buy her what kind of life could luce have otherwise if she survived the chronic rape the stds the trauma the exposure the beatings the malnutrition psychological abuse emotional deprivation if she lived through her teenage years then into her twenties what could she expect to be moved to an actual brothel to a sweatshop if she went through all of that without going to crack or getting hooked on meth even then what kind of life would she have whats the price of a twelveyearold girl twenty thousand dollars because they not only had to pay for the price of a lucrative working girl they also had to pay the alwaysaccruing interest on her debt the money she owed the smugglers for getting her into the country and the interest on the debt she owed for room and board twenty large growing every day so tammy and angela ramped it up they worked extra shifts they used every trick they knew to manipulate men into taking them into the vip room once inside they turned on all their charms to make the men fork over big tips every dance every slide down the pole every lap they ground themselves on went into the purchase price for luce it wasnt enough teddy gave them the rest of the money tammy went to danny and bought luce cash on the barrel it was good it was done and then the lawyers came knocking boone says teddy nods danny went ballistic he was terrified about what might come out in court never mind just the arson suit he made all kinds of threats he told tammy she could forget about luce the women decided to run and take the girl with them they left their apartments and checked into the crest motel intending to get a train out of town the next morning they never made it luce had an sick stomachshe was upset and nervous the vending machine at the motel was broken so tammy walked down to a convenience store to get a soda to try to settle luces stomach when she got back angela was dead and luce was gone tammy panicked she was afraid to go to her place so she went to angelas got scared there too and called teddy he picked her up and took her to shrinks then volunteered to go and try to find luce which he did the girl had gone back to the only familiar place she could find the strawberry fields where boone found them the rest of the story he knows boone saved tammy from dan at the beach below shrinks and then took her home he made his deal with red eddie that she wouldnt be touched but dan figured out something that was worth more to her than her own life worth more than revenge or even justice for angelas killing luce do you have her now boone asks thinking youre a total fucking idiot daniels you read both these people so wrong its pathetic youre not looking at a dumb dishonest stripper and a pervert plastic surgeon youre looking at two heroes and the late angela hart was a third tammy drops her face into her hands and starts to cry teddy says no they said if everything went well theyd call late tonight or early tomorrow morning and turn luce over to us the deal is that tammy takes luce and never comes back dan gets away with having angela killed but whats more important justice or a girls life if we could talk to angela shed tell us to make that trade we cant save them allhell we cant save most of them but we can save one one girl gets a life whats the life of one little girl worth boone asks himself alot everything i can call john kodani boone says hell understand hell no cops tammy says through splayed fingers silver said that if he as much as smells the police teddy says hell kill luce hell kill the three of you anyway boone thinks a man that evil wont keep his word not to you not even to red eddie a man who sinks that far into darkness fears nothing no one not even god or eternity tammy lifts her head and looks right at boone her emerald eyes are wet with tears swollen and rimmed with red shes been crying a lot since boone last saw her what ive seen im begging you she says im begging you leave it alone let the girl have a shot at a life hes going to kill you ill take the chance tammy says boone says ill go with you no tammy says he said just me not even teddy hes setting you up tammy she shrugs then says promise me promise you what boone asks promise me you wont call the police she says promise me you wont interfere okay promise i promise boone starts to leave he stops at the door looks back and says im sorry for what i thought about you both i was wrong and im sorry teddy lifts the martini glass and smiles tammy nods boone looks back through the window at them as he walks to the car teddy stands behind the chair with his hands on tammys shoulders they look like worried parents in a hospital waiting room below the house the ocean smashes against the bluffs in a fit of rage dave hears the breakers from about two hundred yards away he cant see them in the dark but the sound is unmistakable rhythmic steady real bombs esteban he yells tell these kids to hold on what was it boone always said dave thinks that i could surf these waters blindfolded well i hope he was right you feel surfing more than you see it but thats on a board not a glorified rubber raft overloaded with helpless kids doesnt matter he tells himself thats what you have to do surf this boat in he guns the engine to get as much speed as he can and prays that its going to be enough the last thing he wants to do is get into one of the mackers late because hed go over the top for sure and flip the boat and he has to keep the boat straight its bow perpendicular to the wave because if he gets it even a little sideways it will roll so he has to get into the wave right angle the boat into the left break and keep it moving when it crashes on the bottom or it will get swamped in the white water he feels the wave swelling under the boat picking it up and pushing it forward its just another fucking wave he tells himself nothing to it esteban yes whos that fucking saint you pray to san andrйs well hook us up the wave lifts and takes them over the top the kids scream hes in time now he tilts the rudder to break left and move diagonally down the face of the wave he can feel the water rising behind him then curling over him and then theyre out of the tube and the boat crashes heavily into the white water it bounces hard and for a second hes afraid hes going to lose it let it slip out from under him and turn sideways and get rolled but he manages to keep it straight and it settles into the wash and glides into the mouth of the lagoon dave says a quick prayer of thanks to san george freeth esteban take the rudder dave says when the kid visibly shaken but grinning like a fool takes over dave digs in his pocket for his cell phone sop let the guys know the delivery is on the way boone drives up the pacific coast highway through all the beach towns past all the great breaks thinks about all the waves the rides the wipeouts the long leisurely hours in the lineups or hanging out on the beach talking story the cookouts grilling fish for tacos watching the sun go down the bonfires at night sitting close to the flame to get warm watching the stars come out listening to someone play the guitar or the uke doing things you love in a place you love with people you love thats what life is what it should be anyway if you spend your life that wayand i have boone thinksthen you should have no regrets when its over maybe just a little sorrow knowing that youre riding your last wave if you even know its your last what ive seen what ive seen boone thinks ive seen the world from the inside of a wave the universe in a single drop of water theres a world out there you know nothing about the sun will come up soon the dawn patrol will be out shooting for the big waves sunny will be taking her shot hed like to be out there with them would like to be out there forever but there are some sunrises you have to see alone boone turns inland from the ocean and heads for the strawberry fields hes on the dawn patrol johnny banzai and steve harrington sit in their car and wait below them an old van makes its way down the narrow dirt road to a clearing at the edge of batiquitos lagoon you think thats them harrington asks johnny shrugs since daves call johnny doesnt know what is what he doesnt know anything about anything anymore the call was surreal its dave im coming into batiquitos lagoon with a load of wetbacks johnny theyre kids but he bets its them its four oclock in the morning theres not a lot of reason to be driving a van down to the lagoon unless youre picking up something youre not supposed to be picking up he lifts the night scope and scans the lagoon a few minutes later he sees the boat jesus god he murmurs handing the scope to harrington theyre kids harrington says little girls johnny takes the glasses back and counts seven little girls a young male hispanic and dave you want to take them here harrington asks fuck no what if we lose them then ill commit ritual seppuku johnny says whats that harrington asks some sort of jap thing you should read a book every once in a while johnny replies he turns the glasses onto the van and can make out the license plate he calls it and a description of the van into the sex crimes unit waiting on the then he turns back to the boat which is making a gentle perfect landing onshore dave hops out of the zodiac the ground feels funny under his feet i thought i was delivering herb he says to the guy who gets out of the van a cute little shit named marco you thought wrong marco says you got a problem no problem dave says because the guy is holding a wickedlooking little machine gun under one arm just tell eddie im out youtell him marco says he reaches into his pocket pulls out a fat envelope and hands it dave help me get the merchandise into the van do it yourself dave says stuffing the envelope into his jacket im done whatever bro another guy gets out of the van and starts herding the girls into it they go obediently passively like theyre used to being moved around jesus they stink marco says whatd you do with them seasick dave says it was a little rough out there bro and you might have let me know i was driving people i would have been better prepared you know life jackets shit like that if i had told you marco says would you have gone no so what do they do now dave asks theyre like maids or something like that yeah marco says okay something like that look much as id like to stand around and shoot the shit yeah dave says he goes back to the zodiac praying that johnny got his call he casually opens his cell phone and sees the text message backpaddle dave starts the engine then takes the boat to the other side of the lagoon where he left his truck when he lands the boat he says to esteban disappear dude what va te dave says pinta le get the fuck out of here esteban looks at him for a second then gets off the boat and disappears into the reeds dave kneels bends over the edge of the boat and throws up they follow the van out to the then north to the and east to the town of vista where the van pulls up to a nondescript house in a lowermiddleclass neighborhood nothing special just your basic suburban culdesac a garage door opens and the van pulls in johnny gets on the radio the sex crimes unit is there in five minutes with a swat team the scu lieutenant is a woman named terry gilman who used to work homicide and then jumped from the frying pan into the shit fire she walks up to johnnys car whered you get this johnny she asks youre looking good terry she straps a vest on checks the load in her mm and says if we dont find evidence will your source testify lets find the evidence johnny says as he gets out of the car sounds good to me terry gilman is pissed she hates snakeheads in general and snakeheads who run children in particular shes almost hoping this thing goes south so she can use the nine on one of them they hit the front door like normandy a swat guy swings the heavy ram and the door cracks open johnny is the first guy through he ignores the adults scrambling to get away swat will wrap them up he just keeps pushing through until he comes to a door that opens to a basement stairway pistol in front of him he goes down the stairs its a dormitory a barracks of sorts dirty mattresses are set side by side on the concrete slab a rough open shower in one corner an open toilet in the other blankets everywhere a few dirty stained pillows an old tv set hooked up to a video player kids movies a few childrens books in spanish the girls from the boat have jammed themselves into one corner they stand there holding one another staring at him in sheer terror its all right johnny says to them lowering his pistol its all going to be all right now maybe it is he thinks i have these kids but where are the children who were living here boone drives past the reed bed and keeps going until he finds a place where he can turn off and see the fields and the road now he sits and looks at the fields silver and dewy as the sun starts to rise behind the hills to the east on the far side of the fields where they dip to meet the river the reed bed stands like a wall sealing the fields off from the rest of the world blending into a line of trees that old man sakagawa planted as a windbreak so many years ago on the other side of the fields on a small rise near its eastern edge old sakagawas house sits in a small grove of lemon and walnut trees the old man will be getting up soon boone thinks if he isnt already sitting at his table with his tea and his rice with pickled vegetables the workers are already coming out filing onto the fields with their tools over their shoulders like the rifles of soldiers moving out on a earlymorning mission an army of phantoms they come from nowhere they hide at night in the creases and folds of the san diego landscape emerge in the soft light of the early dawn coming into the open to work and then disappear again at dusk into the wrinkles and seams the last unwanted places theyre the invisible the people we dont see or choose not to see even in the bright light of day theyre the unspoken truth the unseen reality behind the california dream there before we wake up gone before we fall asleep again boone settles back and watches them start to work they fan out in wellorganized lines practiced almost ritualistic silent they work with their backs bent and their heads down they work slowly in a methodic rhythm theres no hurry to get done the field will be here all day was here yesterday will be here tomorrow but not for many tomorrows boone thinks he wonders if these men know that someday soon they will not be out here it will be the bulldozers and road graders that will come out at dawn machines not men who work like a collective machine exhaust fumes instead of sweat in place of the fields there will be luxury homes and condominiums a shopping plaza or a mall in place of the workers there will be residents and shoppers and diners and these men will have disappeared to some other netherworld boone feels a bit of welcome warmth come through the car window the sun has crested the mountains johnny goes back upstairs lieutenant gilman is standing beside the prisoners who are sitting on the floor their arms cuffed behind them three men two women whoever they had here johnny whispers to her theyre gone she looks to him and harrington do what you need to do harrington steps over to one of the skells who made the mistake of making eye contact he lifts him to his feet whats your name marco lets you and i go have a little chat marco harrington says he walks him down the hall toward the bedrooms you dont have to come johnny no im in johnny says he follows harrington down the hallway into one of the bedrooms and closes the door behind him harrington bounces marco off the wall catches him on the rebound and knees him in the balls he lifts his head and says i am not fucking with you asswipe youre going to tell me where those kids are or youre going to pull a gun on me and im going to have to paint the wall with your brains and thats my second shot my first goes into your gut їcomprende amigo i speak english marco says well youd better start speaking it harrington says he pulls his pistol and jams it into marcos stomach they just left marco says left for where the fields whatfields the strawberry fields johnny feels his skin go cold what whatdid you say the strawberry fields marco says the old sakagawa strawberry fields johnny feels dizzy like the room is spinning shame flows through his blood he lurches to the door and shoves it open staggers down the hall through the living room and out the door he leans on the car and bends over to catch his breath its coming on dawn the first faint rays of sunlight hit pacific beach warming if only psychologically the crowd of photographers magazine people surf company execs lookieloos and hardcore surfers who stand shivering on pacific beach point in the cold morning waiting for the light the bluff theyre standing on is historic ground surfers have been riding that reef break almost since george freeth and it was way back in the s when this was still a japanese strawberry field that baker and paskowitz and some of the other san diego legends built a shack on this bluff and stored their boards here and proudly adopted the name that the farmers gave themthe vandals just off to the north the big swell is pounding the reef sunny stands at the edge of the crowd her board beside her like a crusaders shield and watches the sunlight turn the indistinct gray shapes into definitive waves big waves the biggest shes ever seen mackers thunder crushers dreams she glances around her half the bigwave riders in the world are here most of them professionals with fat sponsorships and doubledigit mag covers behind them worse most of them have jet skis with them jet skis with trained partners who will pull them into the waves sunny doesnt have the cash for that shes one of the few paddlein surfers out here and the only woman thank you kuan yin she says softly she isnt going to bitch about what she lacks shes going to be grateful about what makes her unique the only woman and a woman whos going to paddle into the big waves she picks up her board and heads down toward the water daves out there already he sits out behind the massive break on a jet ski ready to pull people out if they need it its his sacrifice his penance not riding the big waves he hasnt slepthes exhaustedbut somehow he felt that he had to be here but not surf there was just something that felt wrong about it going out there and having the time of his life when hes seriously questioning what his life has even become he cant shake the image of the girls huddled in the hold of the boatwho they were where they were headed whether or not johnny managed to intercept them and then theres all that johnnys going to want some questions answered and the answers are going to blow up life as they know it which maybe isnt such a bad thing dave thinks as he checks his equipmentmask snorkel finsthings he might need if he has to get off the ski and dive into the soup maybe this life needs a little blowing up achange even if johnny doesnt ask the questions boone will but where the fuck is boone he should be out here with me and tide and sunny should at least be here for sunny backing her up helping her deal with the bigname jet ski crews that will try to block her out boone should be here for her the girls look like ghosts boone spots them coming out of the trees the last of the morning mist hugs their legs and mutes their footsteps they dont talk to one another walk side by side or chat and laugh like girls going to school instead they walk single file almost in lockstep and they look straight ahead or down at the ground they look like prisoners they are now boone sees two men walking behind them theyre not carrying gunsat least boone doesnt see anybut theyre clearly herding the girls along it doesnt take much effort as the girls seem to know where theyre going and the men are behind the girls not in front of them its a drill a routine the men in the fields look up as the girls come out of the tree line some of the workers stop their work and stare others lower their heads quickly and go back to work as if theyve seen something shameful then boone spots her thinks he does anyway its hard to tell but it sure looks like luce she wears a thin blue vinyl jacket with a hood she hasnt bothered to pull up her long black hair glistens in the mist her jeans are torn at the knees and she wears old rubber beach sandals she moves like a zombie shuffling steadily ahead then she turns all the girls doas if on a conveyor belt they turn away from the strawberry fields and toward the bed of reeds boone gets out of the car stays as low as he can and runs toward the trees i know i promised you tammy he thinks but there are some promises you cant keep some promises you shouldnt he picks up his pace old men dont sleep much sakagawa is already awake and now sits at the small wooden table in his kitchen and impatiently waits for first light there is much work to be done and the endless battle against the birds and insects to be fought it is a daily battle but if sakagawa were to be honest with himself he would admit that he actually enjoys it that it is one thing that keeps him going so he sits sips his tea and watches the light flow onto his fields like a slow flood of water from his vantage point he can just make out some of the workers the mexicans who come just as the nikkei had come so many years ago to work the land that the white man didnt think he wanted coated as it was with salt spray and blasted by the sea winds but the nikkei were used to salt and wind from the home islands they knew how to farm worthless land along the sea and from the salted soil the old man thinks now we grew strawberries and doctors and lawyers and businessmen and judges and politicians maybe these workers will do the same he bends over slowly to pull on his rubber boots which keep his old feet dry in the damp earlymorning fields when he straightens up again his grandson is standing there grandfather its johnny john kodani of course i know you johnny bows deeply his grandfather returns the gesture with a short stiff bow as much as his ninetyyearold body can muster then johnny pulls out one of the old wooden chairs that have been in this kitchen for as long as he can remember and sits down across from the old man would you like tea sakagawa asks johnny wouldnt but to refuse would be brutally rude and with what he has to tell the old man he wants to exercise every gentle kindness that would be nice the old man nods its a cold morning it is the old man takes a second cup and pours the strong green tea into it then slides it to johnny youre a lawyer a policeman grandfather yes i remember perhaps he thinks it is good that the nikkei are now police this is very good tea johnny says its garbage the old man says even though he has it specially imported from japan every month what brings you i am always happy to see you but i havent been here for months johnny thinks ive been too busy to stop by for a drink of tea or to bring his greatgrandchildren for him to see now i come by at five in the morning with news that will break his heart grandfather johnny begins then he chokes on his own words has someone died the old man asks your family are they well theyre fine grandfather johnny says grandfather down by the old creek where we used to play when we were kids have you been down there lately the old man shakes his head its very far to walk he says a bunch of old reeds i tell the men to clean up the garbage people toss from the road he shakes his head again it is hard to understand the disrespect of some people why do you ask i think people your men your foreman are doing something down there doing what johnny tells him the old man has a hard time even understanding what his grandson is saying and then he says thats impossible human beings do not do such things im afraid they do grandfather here the old man says on my farm johnny nods he looks down at the floor unable to face his grandfather when he looks up again the old mans face is streaked with tears they run down the creases in his face like small streams in narrow gullies did you come to stop them the old man asks yes grandfather i will go with you he starts to get up no grandfather johnny says its better you stay here those are my fields the old man yells i am responsible youre not grandfather johnny says fighting back tears himself youre not responsible and im too old its my job grandfather the old man composes his face and looks johnny in the eye do your job johnny gets up and bows then he walks out of the kitchen and down into the fields the air smells like strawberries the acrid smell rushes through boones nose as he breathes heavily sprinting toward the trees hoping not to be seen he makes it into the tree line then turns west toward the reeds he can run more upright now in the cover of the trees and he makes it quickly to where the tree line ends and the reeds begin the reeds are taller than he is they loom over him vaguely threatening the tops blowing in the breeze as if waving him back he pushes his way in and is soon lost in thick foliage he can hear voices in front of him thoughmens voices speaking in spanish the last time you did this he thinks you got beaten half to death he takes the pistol from his waistband and keeps it ready in his right hand pushing back reeds with his left he plows ahead until he makes it to the creek he jumps in and wades toward the caves sunny cant paddle into this surf the beach break is totally closed out there isnt space enough between waves or sets to paddle out there and the waves are too big to paddle over she comes out of the water and moves about two hundred yards south between breaks and paddles out onto the shoulder then starts back north on the far side of the break shes not alone in this maneuverall the jet ski crews are out there making the same approach buzzing around like giant noisy water bugs she paddles strong smooth and hard her wide shoulders an advantage for a change the jet ski crews linger farther out giving them room for the highspeed runup into the wave the biggest wave sunnys ever seen looms up behind her with another after that she paddles herself into perfect position for the next wave it rolls toward her a blue wall of water its whitecaps snapping like cavalry guidons in the stiff offshore wind a beautiful wave herwave she lies down on her board takes a deep breath and starts to paddle the shame is unbearable the sakagawa family name is disgraced to think this was happening on my land the old man thinks in my fields under my nose and i am such a fool as not to have seen it it is intolerable there is only one way the old man decides to redeem the familys honor he looks around the kitchen to find a suitable knife then doubts that he has the physical strength to do what is necessary with a knife so he takes up the old shotgun the one he uses against the birds it is not ideal but it will have to do boone crawls up the edge of the creek bed and looks over at the little clearing where he had his confrontation with the mojados now pablos on guard an ax handle in his fist ushering about twenty fieldworkers into a ragged line in the clearing in front of the caves one of the men who herded the girls walks up the line collecting money the workers pull dirty wrinkled bills from their pockets and dont look at the man as they give him the money there are a couple of white guys in line they dont look like farmworkers just guys who like to do little girls the girls go into the little caves that have been chopped into the reeds a couple of the girls sit down and just stare into nothingness a couple of the others arrange their beds boone crawls to the far edge of the clearing and sees luce take off her thin blue jacket carefully spread it out on the ground then sit down one leg crossed over the othera young female buddhaand wait for waves of men to fall on top of her and break inside her and then recede and then the next wave comes in and the next every morning inevitable as the tide a perpetual cycle of rape for as long as her short life lasts theres a world out there you know nothing about tammy steps into the clearing she comes from the other side from the road by the motel the way boone tried to come before pablo laid him out luce sees tammy springs up and runs into her arms tammy holds her tightly then she slides down squats in front of the girl and looks her in the eye ive come to take you away tammy says forever this time good boone thinks go take the kid with you give each other some kind of life then dan silver comes into the clearing dan says so we have a deal i just want luce tammy says youll never hear from me again sounds good dan says he wears his trademark outfitblack shirt black jeans black cowboy boots take her and go tammy puts her arm around luces shoulder and leads her from the clearing through the path trodden in the reeds toward the road boone loses sight of them as they go into the reeds what he does see is dan wait a second then walk into the reeds behind them sunny takes off she paddles hard two more strokes that take her onto the lip of the wave then she shifts to her knees then smoothly into her squat as she goes over the edge shes strong in the wave beautifully balanced shes picked the exact line then a jet ski zooms in and swings tim mackie into the wave if mackie sees sunny he doesnt acknowledge it he cuts right into her line sunny has to pull up she drops to her stomach on the board but shes offline and its too late to paddle back over the crest of the wave she tries to duck her nose up and under but the wave wont let her and it takes her backward over the falls her board squirts into the air as she falls headfirst boone crashes through the reeds toward the sound of footsteps he cant really see them just vague forms through the reeds then he gets a glimpse of dan who pulls his gun from the waistband of his jeans and looks around to pinpoint the sound of the footsteps coming at him run boone yells tammy pushes luce in front of her turns and sees dan then with a dancers grace she whirls her long leg snaps up and she places a kick into the back of dans head it sends him reeling but he stays on his feet run luce tammy yells run and dont stop running but luce doesnt run she wont leave tammy not again dan recovers the grip on his pistol and aims it at tammy who puts herself between him and the girl boones almost there tammys too close for boone to risk a shot especially on the run in the confused tangle of the reeds so he just dives at dan who turns the gun away from tammy and on boone and fires just as tammy kicks his hand boone plows into him waisthigh and drives him backward dan cant get his hand turned to press the pistol into boone so he clubs him with the butt slamming it into the back of boones head and neck again and again boone feels a searing burning pain the world turns red and he feels like hes somersaulting a bad bloody wipeout remember when you were a kid in the swimming pool and youd see how long you could hold your breath underwater this isnt that getting caught in the impact zone is different from holding your breath in a swimming pool for one thing you cant come up youre being rolled over the bottombounced somersaulted slammed and twisted the ocean is filling your nasal cavities and sinuses with freezing salt water and it isnt a matter of how long you can hold your breath its a matter of whether you can hold your breath long enough for the wave to let you up because if you cant you drown and thats just the beginning of your problems because waves dont come to the party alone they usually bring a crew waves tend to come in sets usually three but sometimes four and a really fecund mother of a set might bring a litter of six so even if you make it through the first wave you might have time to take a gasp of air before the next wave hits you and the next and so on and so forth until you drown the rule of thumb is that if you dont manage to extricate yourself from the impact zone by the third wave your friends will be doing a paddleout for you in the next week or so theyll be out there in a circle on their boards saying nice things about you maybe singing a song or two definitely tossing a flower lei out onto the wave and its very cool but you wont be there to enjoy any of it because youll be dead sunnys in the washing machine and it rolls her tumbles her somersaults her until she doesnt know up from down which is another one of the dangers of the impact zone you lose track of which way is up and which way is down so when the wave finally lets you up you budget that last bit of air for the plunge to the sweet surface only to hit rock or sand instead then unless youre a really experienced waterman you just give up and breathe in the water or theres already another wave on top of you either way youre pretty much screwed keep your head sunny tells herself as she plummets keep your head and you live youve trained for this moment all your life youre a waterman all those mornings those early evenings training with boone and dave and high tide and johnny walking underwater clutching big rocks diving down to lobster pots and holding on to the line until you felt your lungs were going to burst then holding on a little longer while those assholes grinned at youwaiting for the girlie to give up except you didnt give up she feels a jerk upward and realizes that her board has popped to the surface headstoned in surf jargon dave will be out there already watching for the board to pop up hes on his way now she forces herself to do a crunch not to release the leash but so that if she does hit bottom shell take the blow on her shoulders and not on her head snapping her neck she hits all right hard but on her shoulders the wave somersaults her three or four timesshe loses countbut then it lets go of her and she pushes up punches to the surface and takes a deep breath of beautiful air boone gets his arms around dans arms and pins them to his side dan still has his gun in his hand but he cant raise it to shoot dan slams three hard knee strikes into boones ribs driving the breath from boones body boone gasps but doesnt let go to let go is to die and hes not ready for that yet he can feel his own blood hot and sticky running down his face he pivots on one hip turning dan around toward the river then he starts walking holding tightly to dan pushing him toward the water dan tries to dig and fight but boone has the momentum dan rears his neck back then slams it forward headbutting boone on the bridge of the nose boones nose breaks and blood gushes out but he holds on and pushes dan toward the bank of the river he plants his feet pivots again and crashes into the muddy water on top of dan boone releases his grip finds dans chest and pushes him down he can feel dans back hit the muddy bottom then boone holds on and pushes its a matter now of who can hold his breath the longest and he figures thats a contest he can win but hes losing blood fast and with the blood his strength he feels dan wrap a leg around him and he tries to fight it but dan doesnt panic under the water and gets his leg locked around boones then dan turns his own hips and spins boones too weak to counter it and dan flips him under then dan sits up on top of boone grabs him around the throat and pushes down hard boone arches his back and tries to buck dan off him but he cant do it he feels weak and tired and then very sleepy his lungs scream at him to open his mouth and gasp take a nice deep breath of anything even if its water his brain tells him to give up go to sleep end the pain in his mind hes in the ocean a giant wave a mountain curls over his head suspends in time for a second hangs there as if deciding then it breaks on him kaboom johnny banzai charges into the clearing his badge is clipped to his jacket his service revolver in his hand harrington and the county people are right behind him but johnny has demanded he go in first family fucking honor he goes in hard and fast unconcerned with safety he heard a gunshot in the distance and doesnt know what the hell is going on but he hits the clearing ready for whatever it is some of the men are already running others stand there looking startled and confused johnny doesnt care about the mojados he sees three younger guys better dressed running away toward a line of trees and young girls looking around milling in confusion then he hears another gunshot it sounds like its coming from the other side of the reeds down along the river johnny calls for an ambulance and sprints toward the sound boone feels dans grip loosen then let go then dans body slides off him into the water a slough of blood pillows around boones face he pushes to the surface and sees like a weird dream an old japanese man standing at the edge of the river a shotgun in his trembling hands in the distance boone hears yelling sirens but maybe its his head playing games with him he crawls to the riverbank and pulls himself up then he hears something else a woman crying a howl of ineffable pain sunny looks up and sees that shes going to have to take another wave or two on her head but its okay because shes in a good spot close to the base of the waves away from the point of maximum impact but now she does release her leash because the board is going to go in with the wave and she doesnt want to go with it she takes the two waves then the set ends and dave pulls her onto the jet ski that kook dave says jumped in on you i saw he takes her onto the shore people are running up the beach including some lifeguards with medical equipment she waves them off im okay im good but dave is already striding over to where tim mackie is running his pie hole to his entourage and some surf press yo kook dave says yeah you im talking to you you got a problem brah mackie asks he looks surprised like people do not have problems with tim mackie no you have a problem dave says you could have killed her didnt see her bro high tide steps into it you should get your eyesight checked then bruddah you dont do that shit on my beach dave says this is your beach thats right dave says he moves in ready to separate mackies head from his body but tide steps in front of him sunny steps in front of both of them and pushes the boys aside i can take care of myself thanks but i dont need you to bigbrother me id do the same dave says if it was boone or i can take care of myself great she thinks as the crowd stares at her i wanted the wave of the day instead i got the wipeout of the day and a hassle with golden boy tim mackie that wasnt cool she says sorry mackie says my bad but he has this smirk on his face ahole she says he laughs at her theres only one response to that she picks up her board and starts back down the beach to the point where she can paddle out again she can hear the crowd murmuring words to that effect shes going out again do you believe it after that the chicks going back out there damn right she thinks the chick is going back out there going back out there to take the biggest wave johnny banzai runs its tough going through the heavy reeds which cut his face and slice at his arms as he tries to beat them back in front of him then he hears as if from a far distance a womans keening luce lies in tammys lap tammy strokes the little girls hair and sobs her hands are hot and sticky with the girls blood which runs from the little hole in her neck stop it tammy says stop it now tammy presses her hand on luces neck but the blood bubbles around it she feels stupid and weak and dizzy and theres pain somewhere in her body but she cant figure out where and luces eyes are wide and she cant hear her breath and the bleeding just wont stop she hears a mans voice saying ive got her she looks up and daniels is there trying to take luce from her tammy holds her tighter ive got her boone says shes dead no shes not not yet boone thinks the girl is in really bad shapeshes bleeding out going into shockbut shes still alive its like a dream in the waking moments part real part illusion everything is still at a distance as if from the wrong end of a telescope and he feels as if hes wrapped in cotton but he knows he has to keep moving if the girl is going to live the old japanese man is already taking his jacket off boone takes it and wraps it around luce then he kneels beside her runs his hand up her neck finds the little entrance wound and presses his thumb into it he picks her up with the other arm cradles her against his chest and starts to move back through the reeds toward the road where an ambulance can reach them stay with us luce he says stay with us but the girls eyes are glassy her eyelids flutter sunny wipes the spray from her eyes and looks again she saw what she saw about fifty yards out but coming fast waves generally come in sets of three and theyve done the three but every once in a while a set has a fourth this bonus wave is a freak bigger stronger meaner amutant known among waterman as the oh my god wave which is what sunny says as she sees it oh my god the wave of a lifetime mylifetime sunny thinks my shot at the life i want barreling right at me im in the perfect spot at the perfect time she rises up on her hips to look around and see what the jet ski crews are doing theyre lying out on the shoulder waiting for the next set well the next set is here boys she thinks as she sees mackies jet ski start forward easily fast enough to steal this wave from her but then she sees high tide paddle out between mackies ski and her golden boy tim is going to have to go through him and he isnt going to go through him not high tide normally that would bother her but she made her point on the beach and shes over it its only the dawn patrol looking out for one another and she accepts that this wave is mine she thinks as she lies down on her board turns it in and points it toward shore she starts paddling hard looking once over her shoulder to see the big wave kick up behind her she lowers her head as she feels the wave pick up the board then lift it like a splinter and then shes on top of the world she can see it allthe ocean the beach the city behind it the green hills behind the city she can see the crowd on the beach see them watching her see the photogs aiming the big cameras on their tripods she can see a little boat moving in photographers on board getting close enough for shots but staying out of her line overhead a helicopter zooms in and she knows the video guys are up there ready to get her ride if i ride it she thinks as she gets to her knees ready to push up into her stance ifhell no if about it then she stops thinking the time for thought is over now it has to be all instinct and action the nose of the board drops suddenly and she pushes up to her feet planting them solidly her calf muscles tensed time seems to stop as shes suspended for a second on the top of the wave she thinks im too late i missed it then the board plunges down she leans right just enough to catch the line not enough to tip her into the wave and a horrible wipeout she throws her arms out for balance bends her knees for speed and then shes off down the face of this giant wave her hair flying behind her like a personal pennant as she turns her feet right a little and cuts up higher into the wave then plunges back down with incredible speed too much speed the board bucks and bounces off the water and shes in the air for a second the board a good foot beneath her she lands on it losing her balance going sideways headfirst toward the face of the wave the crowd on the beach groans its going to be a bad one sunny feels herself going her shot getting away from her and she cranks to the left squats low and rights herself as the wave crests over and then shes in the green room totally inside the wave there is nothing else just her and the wave her in the wave her wave her life the watchers on the beach lose sight of her theyre holding their collective breath because all they can see is wave the incredibly brave chick is in there somewhere and its an open question whether shell come out then a blast of white water shoots sideways out of the tube and the woman shoots out still on her feet her left hand touching the back of the wave and the crowd breaks into a cheer theyre screaming for her yelling for her as she cuts back up on the top of the wave again shes flying now and she uses the momentum to crest the top of the wave shes in the air high over the wave and as she jumps off the board she does a full somersault before she hits the water on the far side of the wave when she pops up dave is there on a jet ski she grabs onto the sled pulls herself on pulls her board on and lets him take her in the crowd on the beach is waiting for her shes mobbed by photographers writers surf company execs it was the ride of the day they tell her no she thinks it was the ride of a lifetime its surreal what johnny sees in the reeds boone daniels staggers toward him a girl in his arms his chest soaked with blood more blood running down the side of his head boone johnny yells boone looks at johnny with glassyeyed faint recognition and stumbles toward him holding the girl out like a drowning man lifting a child up toward a lifeboat now johnny can see boones thumb pressed deep into a wound on the childs neck johnny takes the little girl from him replacing his own thumb for boones boone looks at him says thanks johnny and then crashes heavily facefirst to the ground waves alpha waves energytransport phenomena gentle vibrations run through boones jackedup brain as rain sweeny paddles out through a gentle beach break ducks under an incoming wave and pops out the other side she shakes the water from her blond hair and smiles its a beautiful day the sky a cloudless blue the water green as a spring meadow crystal pier sparkles in the shimmering sunlight rain looks up at the pier and waves boone stands at the window of his cottage smiles and waves back and then hes in the water swimming toward her in smooth easy strokes the cool water sliding along his skin a caress that eases the pain which is swiftly becoming mere memory a dream of a past life that seemed real but was only a dream rain reaches out her hand and pulls him to her and then hes sitting on his own board next to her rising and falling in the gentle swell the dawn patrol sits off behind them farther out on the shoulder sunny and dave hang and tide and johnny even cheerful is out this morning and pete and boone can hear them talking and laughing and then a wave comes in it builds from far away lifts and rises and rolls as it seems to take an eternity to crest and then rain smiles at him again lies down and starts to paddle her arms and shoulders strong and graceful and she moves into the wave with ease boone paddles after her to catch the wave and ride it with her all the way in to the beach except as he looks ahead there is no shore only an endless blue ocean and a wave that rolls forever he paddles hard trying to catch her desperate to catch her but he cant shes too strong the wave is too fast and he can make no headway it makes no sense to him hes boone daniels there is no wave he cannot catch but he cant catch this wave and then hes crying in rage and frustration until his chest aches and big salty tears pour down his face to return to the sea and he gives up and lies on his board exhausted heartbroken rain turns to him and smiles says this isnt your wave her smile turns to sunshine and shes gone over the break where did you go johnny asks i was just out surfing boone says i saw the girl did she she made it johnny says boone smiles and lays his head back on the pillow the pain in his melon is amazing an evil combo plate of a vicious hangover and a board bounce off the skull the doctors werent so sure about you b johnny says whether you were going to come home from the enchanted forest i thought i was going to have to do that paddleout for you after all it had been a hell of a scene out there boone out on the ground the little girl in shock tammy roddick bleeding from a bullet wound she had saved the girls life absorbing most of the bullets force before it passed through her into luce now tammys in a bed down the hallway not far from the little girl and theyre both going to be all right they werent the only wounded a couple of mojados went seriously john woo on the snakeheads with a shotgun and a machete though terry gilman didnt think she had enough evidence to make an arrest for that and in all the confusion the mojados managed to drift away from the scene also on the plus side dan silver with a hole in his chest you could push your fist through which was a temptation except he was already doa grandfather johnny thinks i should have known grandfather wouldnt allow the family honor to be stained without doing something about it and boy he did harrington fixed the scene put the pistol in dan silvers hand and asked grandfather questions that would elicit only answers that pointed to selfdefense which in a roundabout way it was you take an old mans honor its as good as killing him hey johnny says now what boone asks dont go back to sleep johnny says you have to stay awake boone opens his eyes and looks around the room its crowded dave sunny hang tide cheerful petes there too the nurses had objected of course tried to get them all out of there but tide had plopped himself down in a chair and asked you gonna move me not without a derrick the nurse said so the crew stayed all through the long hours when it was touchandgo when beth came in took a look at boones chart and told johnny not to get his hopes up and one of the other doctors took cheerful aside and asked him if boone had a living will a living will cheerful asked he doesnt have a checkbook hang was inconsolable sat in a chair with his head down staring at the floor dave squatted next to him and said boones too stupid to die from a few blows to the head if silver had clubbed his ass then wed have something to worry about i was mad at him hang said he waved at me but i blew him off he knows you love him sunny said he loves you too hang put his face into her shoulder and sobbed a few seconds later tide said hey not so loudyou wanna wake him up which at least made them all laugh at some point sunny had left the room to go out and get coffee for people when she saw petra in the hallway petra saw her started to walk away but sunny caught up with her where are you going i dont want to intrude youre not sunny said come on i could use some help so the two of them went to the cafeteria got some coffee and some junk food and went back together to the room and waited together through the small hours until boone woke up and asked about the little girl now he looks over at sunny and asks you ride your wave you bet youre a big star now i am sunny says im surprised im even talking to you boone sees petra hey hey she looks him in the eye for a second then looks away afraid she might start to cry or show a sudden shyness shes never felt before dave the love god rescues her he gets up walks over to the bed takes boones hand and says hey bro hey you look like hammered shit that good boone says then he adds something that convinces everyone but dave that he still has one foot in the fun house hey dave yeah eddie never saw the searchers daves still there that afternoon when boone says i have to get up you have to lie down petra says you have a major concussion they want you to stay here at least two more days for observation theyre going to run some tests see if you have brain damage although howd they tell theres something i have to do boone says he forces himself to sit up then swings his legs out and puts his feet on the floor its sketchy but he manages to get his legs underneath him and stand up boone hes not listening he gets dressed and walks down the hall toward the lobby the nurses ignore himthey have their hands full with people who want help and have no time for people who dont johnny follows him in case he falls but boone doesnt petras out in the hallway dave dont let him be an idiot she says bring him back dave opens the door for boone and follows him out they drive south on the boone sits in the passenger seat and looks out the window beautiful beautiful day deep blue ocean deep blue sky the big swell is almost over so boone asks theyve been friends forever theyve ridden a thousand waves together theyre going to tell each other nothing but the truth dave tells him all about his work for red eddie did you know boone asks about the kids not until that night dave says i called johnny i didnt know what else to do boone nods they both know what to do now boone paddles out eddies on the line on the inside shore break yo boone dawg eddie yells then he sees boones head what happened to you my bruddah a little aggro boone juts his chin to the outside reef the waves arent giant anymore but theyre big and theyre breaking outside lets go outside eddie you got the balls dangling brah they paddle out side by side then pull up along the shoulder beside the break we need to talk eddie talk the girls boone said that was your operation no brah yeah it was boone says the whole story about dan owing you money was bullshit you were just trying to cover your pathetic ass eddies not used to being talked to like that his eyes get hard watch yourself boone you broke your

around you dirty i brought you into the dawn patrol and you made it ugly you destroy everything around you eddie just like you took those little kids and destroyed them im sorry i met you im sorry i pulled your son out of the water if he grows up to be anything like you youever going to grow up boone yeah boone says i am he shoots out his leg and kicks eddie off his board eddie falls into the water boone wraps eddies leash around his own ankle and watches as eddie tries to sit up and let himself loose but eddie cant reach the velcro strap around his ankle he turns and tries to swim tries to bust to the surface but boone backpaddles like a cowboy on a pony with a calf on his rope eddie flips over again and tries to reach boone he reaches up desperately grabbing first at boones foot then at his own but boone just keeps pressing down on the leash and looks into eddies widening eyes they say drowning is a peaceful death i hope theyre wrong boone thinks he watches eddie struggle watches him suffer then he takes his foot off the leash not because he cares about eddies life but because he cares about his own eddie grabs for his board but boone kicks his hand off choking and gasping for air eddie asks what the heres the deal julius says boone i let you back on my board and tow you in to johnny banzai hes already waiting with a warrant youre looking at thirty to life or you go back in the water and this time you dont come back up and well throw a hell of a fucking party he starts to press down on the leash again personally i hope you take door number two but eddie says take me in boone lets up on the leash and hauls the exhausted eddie onto his board then tows him to shore johnnys standing on the beach slaps the cuffs on eddie does the ritual reading of the rights and shoves him into his car eddie doesnt have one fucking thing to say are we good dave asks boone were good its over three weeks later dusk on pacific beach its cool sweatshirt weather as the mist is starting to move in as if the sun were pulling a curtain around its bed before going to sleep boone stands in front of a grill carefully turning pieces of yellowtail over the low fire you have to be gentle with yellowtail you have to cook it slowly or it dries out and loses its juice johnny banzai stands beside him supervising johnny lifts a corona to his lips takes a swallow then says harrington is really pissed he cant crank you on this thing boone is too big a hero for anyone to mess with right now the bust of the childsex operation is all over the talkradio stations theres talk of medals civic awards harrington mumbled to johnny tell that shitbag this doesnt change anything it doesnt boone thinks not really angela hart is dead and rain sweeny if shes alive is still in the wind anyway johnny says the da armwrestled him into dropping the assault charges against you that boone says makes the list of things that are good yes johnny says but in what position the eternal question boone says fifth hang twelve suggests in front of free stuff high tide asks youre lolo free stuff is very very good dave says you could use some free stuff cheerful says to boone ive finished your books and free stuff would come in very handy i have a paycheck coming in boone says he gently removes the fish from the grill and sets the pieces on a plate then he lays some tortillas on the grill until they are just warm but not burned hows it coming he asks petra who sits on the sand with her legs crossed and a cutting board on her lap shes just finishing slicing up the mango and red onion and shes staring out at the sun just dipping on the horizon theyd talked after he got back from confronting red eddie right ill be the one to take the leap petra said are we going to see each other again i mean outside of our professional relationship is that what we have so far i dunno boone said what do you think i dont know either petra said i mean i dont know where it could go we want such different things from life truth but maybe thats not a bad thing petra said he knew what the smart thing would be walk away now because they are so different because they do want different things from life but theres something about those eyes you dont walk away from and something about her a lot about her shes smart tough funny hot brave cool shes a good person they decided to just take things as they come and sunny sunnys out there he thinks as he watches the sun going down what a futureall the places shell go now all the oceans shell see the waves shell ride its her world now all of it and who knows if one of those waves will ever bring them together again here petra says she gets up and hands him the cutting board boone slides the chopped mango and onion into a bowl then adds some lime juice a little jalapeсo and a handful of cilantro and mixes it all up then he takes the tortillas off the grill lays a piece of fish on each one then spoons a generous dollop of the fresh mango salsa over the fish dinners ready guys he says he hands a taco to petra god thats won derful she says boone serves the tacos then takes a moment to look at the ocean the setting sun the long beach this is his beach his world his friends his family as ive always said he pronounces everything tastes better on a tortilla
