grandma muttering its not worth packing them up it comes around so fast that before you know it youll be pulling them out again and of course grandmas right but from here it seems a long time till i get my next hit of santa clausing carols and eggnog anyway just to keep me going until next year ive indulged in the next best thing to christmas which is a christmas romance for you to enjoy as you take the decorations out again my story has all my favorite things a hero to die for drama fun dogs cows a birthoh and did i mention eggnog i loved locking my heroine on her farm with her todiefor boss a billionaire bosswhat greater gift could a girl find in her stocking on christmas morning enjoy marion lennox chapter one all scheduled flights have been cancelled until after christmas charter planes are no exception im sorry maam but nobodys going anywhere meg replaced the phone as if it was about to shatter the air around her felt sharp and dangerous she was trying hard not to breathe the door to her bosss inner sanctum was open w s mcmaster was clearing his desk filing vital documents into his lovely calfskin briefcase suave sleek and almost impossibly goodlooking the man looked what he wasa billionaire businessman moving on to the next important thing but the next important thing was in new york and w s mcmasters personal assistant was about to tell him there were no planes for at least three days noooooo oh meg im so out of here josie megs assistant was tugging off her office shoes and hauling on sixinch stilettos dans meeting me in five minutes and im free how cool to have christmas fall on monday i have two solid days of partying until i need to sober up for the family christmas day meg didnt answer she couldnt josie and the rest of the office staff departed calling christmas greetings as they left yes christmas was on monday it was friday afternoon the corporate world closed down right now except for meg whose job it was to be at hand as mr mcmasters personal assistant at any time he was in australia mr mcmaster was only in australia for maybe ten or twelve weeks of the year and there was little administration she had to do outside those times it was a fabulous job shed been so lucky to get it if shed messed this up dont go there focus on now focus on getting her boss out of the country she gave a weak little wave to the departing staff and tried one last phone call her boss was too far away to hear but there was little to hear anyway just more of the same helicopters depend on air traffic controllers too she asked bleakly no thank you i understand and theres no way the strike can be resolved until after christmas of course i know the whole country closes down from five tonight but this is vital can wei dont know take off from a paddock while no ones watching island hop to indonesia and find a flight from there im serious ill do anything no and no and no she replaced her phone and stared at it as if it had personally betrayed herand mr mcmaster was standing in the doorway ready to go he looked ready to take on the world he always did she conceded william mcmaster was thirtysix years old hed been born into money and hed inherited the gene for making it he headed a huge family corporation and the mcmaster empire was growing by the day for the last three years hed spent two or three months a year here growing the part of the firm that was opening mines all over australia he flew from one business meeting to another while he was in australia meg flew with him and as she did she realised why he had a different pa in every country hed wear one out in weeks she was worn out now and he was ready to leave he was leaning against the door waiting for her attention he was wearing a dark italian business suit that screamed money and taste with a crisp white shirt new on this morning because the hotel laundry had sent his shirts back slightly yellowed shed had a frantic scramble to get new ones his hotel was supposed to be the best in melbournehow could she top that the hotel also had the best gym in melbourne he insisted on hotels with great gyms and his body proved it tall dark and far more goodlooking than any man had a right to be he was watching her now through dark hooded eyes as if he knew something was wrong of course he knew something was wrong you couldnt get to where he was without intelligence and intuition and william mcmaster had both in spades my car to the airport he queried but softly as if he already suspected the answer theres a problem she said not looking at him her new three year contract was on her desk waiting for her boss to sign on his way out she shoved it under her fax as if somehow hiding it could protect it she so wanted to keep this job while mr mcmaster was overseas she wasnt needed but when he was in the country she moved to total commitment seven days out of seven twelve hour days or more he worked like this all the time meg knew she was in touch with his three other pas one in london one in new york and one in hong kong wherever he went the work of a dozen people followed the man was driven and he drove everyone around him he couldnt drive her now she must go home theres a delay meg managed trying desperately to sound as if this was a mere hiccup to be sorted by six six the time his plane took off and she could catch the train home and be free he didnt respond he simply waited his dark eyes barely flickering he was a man of few words he expected his people to anticipate his demands and sort them that was what she was paid to do but this time shed failed she couldnt hire a private jet helicopters needed airspace too how long would it take a boat to get to new zealand so he could fly from there a week at least no and hotels theyd been booked out for months for this holiday weekend when shed settled his account this morning the manager already sounded tired in anticipation its great hes booked out early i have people queuing theres not a room to be had in the whole city i have people offering bribes are you intending to tell me his eyes had narrowedhe knew by now that the problem was serious to her surprise though there was a gleam of suppressed amusement in his dark eyes as if he guessed the mess her thoughts were in theres been a snap strike by air traffic controllers she said feeling ill the conciliation meeting ended twenty minutes ago with no result all airlines are grounded indefinitely she could see the airport from this office meg snatched a fleeting glance outside this was the penthouse suite of the most luxurious office block in melbourne the view was almost all the way to tasmania and normally there were planes between here and the sea now the sky was empty and her bosss gaze had followed hers no planes he said slowly nothing that needs airspace until after christmas theres no guarantee even then this is absurd he snapped a private jet requires airspace she managed to meet his gaze full on he liked direct answers hated being messed around shed worked with him for three years now and she knew enough not to quail before that steely gaze sometimes this man demanded more than was humanly possible when that happened she told him and he simply moved on he wasnt moving on yet organise me a car to sydney ill fly from there the strikes australiawide thats impossible i need to be in new york for christmas why there was enough space in her muddled thoughts to wonder whator whowas waiting for him at home the gossip magazines said this man was a loner hed been an only child and his parents were wealthy to the point of obscenity long divorced and enmeshed in society living as far as meg knew he never saw them thered been an actress on his arm last time hed been in london but the tabloids had reported her broken heart at least three months ago and it hadnt been very broken meg thought wryly she knew how much the woman had received during their short relationship send this to sarah settle sarahs hotel bill and now sarah had already moved on to the next highstatus partner so who was waiting in new york i cant get you to new york she said trying to stay calm to tell it like it was youve tried everything yes sir he stared at her for a long moment and she could see his cool brain assessing the situation he trusted herhed trusted her from the moment hed hired herand she could tell by his expression that already he was in melbourne for christmas and making the best of it i can work here he said angry but seemingly resigned frequent flyers knew that sometimes factors moved out of their control and she wouldnt be fired for this ill need to make some fast arrangements though we can use the time to sort the berswood deal thats urgent enough deep breath just say it mr mcmaster the australian corporate world closes down at five this afternoon she said meeting his gaze square on this entire building will be shutting down therell be no air conditioning no servicing the place will be locked the business district will be deserted you pay me to be in charge of this office and ive already let the staff leave and you cant sort the berswood contract therell be no one at berswood to sort it with she was meeting her bosss gaze tilting her chin trying to sound calmly confident instead of defiant and scared she was definitely scared mcmasters gaze was almost blank but she knew there was nothing blank about what he was thinking this man sorted multimillion business deals in the time it took her to apply lipstick not that she had time to apply lipstick when he was around very well he conceded you and i can work from my hotel suite you and i can work from my hotel suite her face must have changed again he got it he always knew theres a problem there too sir theres no rooms if i have to change hotels i will he snapped but she shook her head this was why shed be fired it was something she should have foreseen at the first rumour she should have booked but shed missed the rumours shed been frantic in the christmas lead up and shed done her shopping in one crazy rush last night the shops had been open all night mcmaster had let her go at eleven and shed shopped until three then shed fallen into an exhausted sleepand been woken to a demand for clean shirts shed sorted it and been back in the office at seven but her normally incisive scheduling had let her down shed missed listening to the morning news fallback position what was that there wasnt one there really are no rooms she said as calmly as she could the countrys full of trapped people you left your hotel before seven this morning most people book out later by eight the rumours had started and people simply refused to leave if id figured this out this morning i didnt and im sorry theres a major hollywood blockbuster being filmed on location just out of melbourne all the cast were due to fly out tonight theyve blockbooked every luxury hotel in melbourne and theyre prepared to pay whatever it takes the cheap places are overwhelmed by groups who cant get home people are camping at the airport there really is nothing she hesitated hating to throw it back to him knowing she had no choice sir do you have friends your parentsthere must be people you know there was a moments loaded silence then youre telling me to contact my parents friends the anger in his voice frightened her no i there is no way i will contact any friend of my parentsor anyone else youre suggesting i ask for charity of course not but to impose myself on someone elses christmas i will not sir so taking away the personal option where he said in a voice that dripped ice do you suggest i stay i dont know she whispered youre paid to know he snapped his face dark with fury he glanced at his watch you have fifteen minutes ill get documents faxed from berswood to give me work to do over the weekend meanwhile find me something somewhere i can work in peace now he turned and slammed back into his office and for the first time in her entire life meg felt like having hysterics serious hysterics hysterics wouldnt help where where somewhere he could work in peace she could organise a mattress and a sleeping bag here she thought feeling more and more out of control but even this officewithout air conditioning no her job was so ended and more in a little more than an hour the train to tandaroit would leave without her christmas was waiting as well as that there was hay waiting ready to spoil if it wasnt harvested she must go home she made one more miserable phone call to a dealer in hotel rooms unless shed take the absolute dregs there was nothing nothing nothing she sat and stared at her hands until exactly fifteen minutes later when the door slammed open again well he demanded his anger was back under control he was icy calm waiting for her solution and there was only one solution to give there are no hotels so so say it just say it so you can come home with me she said trying desperately to make her voice bright and confident its the only solution and its a good one we have a comfortable private spare room with its own bathroom and we have the internet ill be on call for your secretarial needs we cant have you trapped in the city over christmas my family and i would be pleased if you could spend christmas with us if her bosss face had been thunderous before it was worse now it was as if there were a live handgrenade ticking between them the pin had been pulled who knew how long these things took to explode youre offering me charity he said at last slowly carefully as if saying the word itself was like taking poison its not charity at all she managed feeling a faint stirring of anger wed love to have you oooh what a lie but what was the choice sleeping bags here was a real possibility awful as it seemed she could spend christmas trying to make this office liveable working around a situation which was appalling or she could try and resurrect christmas if he accepted then hed spend the whole time in his room with his computer she thought thank the stars shed set up internet access on the farm it cost more than she could afford but it had made scotty jubilant and maybejust maybe it would be the decider i do not want to be part of anyone elses christmas he snapped you dont need to be you can stay in your room and work i can even bring your meals to your room if you want to take it that far i cant believe this is the only solution its the only one i can think of no matter what she did no matter what she offered she would lose her job over this meg thought miserably and then she thoughtwhy dont i quit now she could walk away and leave this man to do whatever he wanted over christmas but this was the best job and maybemaybe hed even enjoy it letty put on a great christmas miracles could happen send me a miracle she pleaded starting her santa list right now it will work she said managing to sound much more calm than she felt this is a genuine offer and wed be very pleased to have you she glanced at her watch acting as if it was time to move on acting as if the thing had already been decided you will be able to work the room has a lovely view not exactly like this one you will be comfortable and you will be left alone if you accept my offer then my train leaves in an hour im sorry you cant get home but this is the best i can do his face was still dark with fury if he was so angry why didnt he contact someone else she thought any socialite in melbourne would be pleased to be his friend he was invited everywhere surely he didnt wish to spend christmas with her but it seemed he did your house is large that was easy yes it is no young children no scotty was fifteen surely that didnt count as young and i will have privacy yes sir right he said roughly angrily ill pay your family for my accommodation and ill work from there theres no need to pay this is business he snapped business or nothing fine she said accepting the inevitable ill get changed we can walk to the station walk its christmas she said traffics gridlocked and its four blocks i will have privacy at this place he demanded again suddenly suspicious at my home she said goaded yes you will he hesitated and your family theyll be glad of the extra income she said knowing that this at least was true and it seemed it was the right thing to say he was moving on dont think im accepting this with any degree of complacency he snapped well discuss this debacle after christmas but for nowlets just get it over with chapter two where was she taking him maybe he should have paid attention but hed stalked back into his office and worked until shed decreed it was time to go then hed walked beside her to the station and stayed silent as she organised tickets hed been too angry to do anything else and too caught up in work the berswood faxes had come through just as he left and hed spotted a loophole that would have his lawyers busy for weeks had they really thought he wouldnt notice such a problem as he walked to the station he was planning his course of attackand maybe that was no accident burying himself in work had always been his way to block out the world and he was not looking forward to the next three days three days immersed in his work with little to alleviate it with no hotel gym to burn energy and missing elinor and the kidsthat hurt at least he had the berswood contract to work on he told himself as he strode beside his pa trying to think the legal implications through as she purchased tickets and hurried to the train then as the train pulled out the announcement came through that the train destination was four hours away what the he and meg had been forced to sit across the aisle from each other he looked across at her in alarm four hours we get off earlier she called two and a half hours two and a half hours he couldnt even grill her he sat hard against the window with barely enough room to balance his laptop beside him a woman was juggling two small children one on her knee and one in a carrycot in the aisle meg had someone elses child on her lap there were people squashed every which way in a train taking them who knew where he was heading into the unknown with his pa she didnt even look like his pa he thought as the interminable train journey proceeded and even the berswood deal wasnt enough to hold his attention it seemed shed brought her luggage to the office so she could make a quick getaway once hed grudgingly accepted her invitation shed slipped into the ladies and emergeddifferent his pa normally wore a neat black suit crisp white blouse and sensible black shoes with solid heels she wore her hair pulled tightly into an elegant chignon hed never seen her with a hair out of place she was now wearing hiphugging jeans pale blue canvas sneakersa little bit wornand a soft white shirt open necked with a collar but no sleeves what was more amazing was that shed tugged her chignon free and her bouncing chestnut curls were flowing over her shoulders and at her throat was a tiny christmas angel the angel could have been under her corporate shirt for weeks he thought stunned at the transformation she looked casual she looked completely unbusinesslikeand he didnt like it he didnt like being on this train he didnt like it that his pa was chatting happily to the woman beside her about who knew what he wasnt in control and to say he wasnt accustomed to the sensation was an understatement william mcmaster had been born in control his parents were distant to say the least and hed learned early that nursery staff came and went if he made a fuss they went he seldom did make a fuss he liked continuity he liked his world running smoothly his pa was paid to make sure it did meg had come to him with impeccable references shed graduated with an excellent commerce degree shed moved up the corporate ladder in the banking sector and it was only when her personal circumstances changed that shed applied for the job with him i need to spend more time with my family shed said and he hadnt asked more her private life wasnt his business only now it was his business he should have asked more questions he was trapped with her family whoever her family turned out to be while back in new york he needed to contact elinor urgently but he couldnt call her now it was three in the morning her time itd have to wait the thought of contacting her made him feel ill to give such disappointment theres less than an hour to go meg called across the aisle and to his astonishment she sounded cheerful dandle a baby if youre bored im sure the lady beside you would be grateful i couldnt let him do that the young mother beside him looked shocked id spoil his lovely suit he winced hed taken off his jacket but he still looked corporate and he knew it he had suits and gym gear nothing else surely that couldnt be a problem but where were they going hed had visions of a suburban house with a comfortable spare room where he could lock himself in and work for three days hed pay so he wouldnt have to be social something hed be forced to be if he stayed with any of melbournes social set but now where was she taking him he was a billionaire he did not have problems like this how did you get off a train there was a no alcohol policy on the train which was just as well as the carriage was starting to look like a party it was full of commuters going home for christmas holidaymakers everyone escaping the city and heading bush someone started a christmas singalong which was ridiculous but somehow meg found herself singing along too was she punchdrunk no she was someone whod lost the plot but there was nothing she could do about it she had no illusions about her job shed messed things up and even though she was doing the best she could william mcmaster had been denied his christmas and she was responsible worse she was taking him home he hadnt asked where home was he wasnt interested she glanced across the aisle at him and thought he so didnt belong on this train he looked fabulous she admitted to herself and there it was the thing shed carefully suppressed since shed taken this job w s mcmaster was awesome he was brilliant and powerful and more he worked her hard but he paid magnificently he expected the best from her and he got it and he was sooo sexy if she wasnt careful she knew she stood every chance of having a major crush on the guy but shed realised that from the start from that first interview so shed carefully compartmentalised her life he was her boss any other sensation had to be carefully put aside and shed learned from him w s mcmaster had compartments down to a fine art there was never any hint of personal interaction between employer and employee but now there needed to be personal interaction w s mcmaster was coming home to her family hed better be nice to scotty he didnt have to be nice to anyone yes he did she thought for the next few days her boundaries needed to shift not to be taken away she reminded herself hastily just moved a little she needed to stop thinking about him as her boss and start thinking about him as someone who should be grateful to her for providing emergency accommodation shed made a start deliberately getting rid of her corporate gear making a statement that this weekend wasnt entirely an extension of their work relationship he could lock himself in his room for the duration she thought shed sent a flurry of texts to letty on the subject of which room theyd put him in the attic was best there was a good bed and a desk and a comfy chair it had its own small bathroom the man was a serious workaholic maybe hed even take his meals in his room hes not singing the elderly woman beside her said meg had struck up an intermittent conversation with her so she knew the connection your boss is he not happy hes stuck in australia because of the airline strike meg said i suspect hes homesick homesick shed spoken loudly because of the singing but there was a sudden lull between verses and somehow her words hit silence suddenly everyone was looking at william homesick the woman beside meg breathed loud enough for everyone to hear loud enough to catch williams attention oh thats awful do you have a wife and kiddies back home ino william said clearly astonished that a stranger could be so familiar so itll just be your parents missing you the woman said oh i couldnt bear it wheres home new york the two syllables were said with bluntness bordering on rudeness but the woman wasnt to be deflected new york city she breathed oh where near central park my apartment overlooks central park he conceded and there was an awed hush will it be snowing there someone asked and meg looked at her bosss grim face and answered for him shed checked the forecast it was part of her job the forecast is for snow oh and the temperature heres going to be boiling the woman doing the questioning looked as if she might burst into tears on his behalf you could have made snowmen in central park i dont or thrown snowballs someone added or made a snowman santa hey did you see that movie where they fell down and made snow angels he could do that here in the dust there was general laughter but it was sympathetic and then the next carol started and william was mercifully left alone ummaybe she should have protected him from that maybe she shouldnt have told anyone he was her boss meg looked across at williamimmersed in his work againand thoughtim taking my boss home for christmas and all were offering is dust angels he could be having a white christmas in central park with who she didnt know and she was not going to feel bad about that she decided not until he told her that he was missing a person in particular if he was simply going to sit in a luxury penthouse and have lobster and caviar and truffles and open gifts to himself she was going home to scotty and grandma and a hundred cows that was a good thought no matter how appallingly shed messed up she was still going home for christmas she was very noble to share she told herself hold that thought tandaroit wasnt so much a station as a rail head thered been talk of closing it down but letty had immediately presented a petition with over five thousand names on it to their local parliamentarian no matter that letty scotty and meg seemed to be the only ones who used itand that the names on the petition had been garnered by letty dressed in gumboots and overalls sitting on the corner of one of melbournes major pedestrian malls in scottys now discarded wheelchair shed been holding an enormous photograph of a hugeeyed calf with a logo saying save your country cousins superimposed tandaroit station stayed when letty wanted something she generally got it her energy was legendary the death of her son and daughterinlaw four years ago had left her shattered but afterwards shed hugged meg and shed said theres nothing to do but keep going so we keep going lets get you another job megs first thought had been to get some sort of accountancy job in curalo their closest city but then theyd found mr mcmasters advertisement youd be away from us almost completely for three months of the year but the rest wed have you almost fulltime thatd be better for scotty better for all of us and look at the pay letty had said awed oh meg go for it so shed gone for it and now she was tugging her bag down from the luggage rack as william extricated himself from his wedged in position and she was thinking that was what she had to do now just go for it christmas here we come ready or not her bag was stuck under a load of other peoples baggage she gave it a fierce tug and it came loose just as william freed himself from his seat she lurched backward and he caught her and held he had to hold her the train was slowing there were youngsters sitting in the aisle she had no hope of steadying herself and she had every chance of landing on top of a child but her boss was holding her against him steady as a rock in the swaying train and she let him hold her she was tired and unnerved and overwrought shed been trying to be chirpy trying to pretend everything was cool and she brought someone like her boss home for christmas every year shed been trying to think that she didnt care that shed just ruined the most fantastic job shed ever be likely to have and suddenly it was all just too much for one fleeting moment she let her guard down she let herself lean into him while she felt his strength the feel of his newthismorning crisp linen shirt the scent of his halfamonthssalary aftershave ooh i hope you two have a very happy christmas the lady shed been sitting near said beaming up at them in approval no need for gifts for you two then no wonder youre taking him home for christmas and then she giggled you know i married my boss too best thing i ever did fourteen grandchildren later you go for it love and meg whod never blushed in her life turned bright crimson and hauled herself out of her bosss arms as if she were burned the train was shuddering to a halt she had to manoeuvre her way through the crowds to get out she headed for the door leaving her boss to follow if he could and she wouldnt really mind if he couldnt the train dumped them and left rolling away into the night civilisation on wheels leaving them where civilisation wasnt nine oclock on the tandaroit rail head social hub of the world or not there was a single electric light above the entrance and nothing else for as far as the eye could see sowhere exactly are we william said sounding as if he might have just landed on mars but meg wasnt listening she was too busy staring out into the night willing the headlights of lettys station wagon to appear letty was always late shed threatened her with death if she was late tonight she couldnt even phone her to find out where she was there was no mobile reception out here and as if in echo of her thoughts theres no reception her boss was staring incredulously at his phone theres a land line at the farm youve brought me somewhere with no cellphone reception hysterics were once again very close to the surface meg felt ill its better than sleeping at the airport she snapped feeling desperate how is it better he was looking where she was looking obviously hoping for any small sign of civilisation there wasnt any just a vast starlit sky and nothing and nothing and nothing shell come wholl come my grandmother meg said through gritted teeth if she knows whats good for her shell come right now your home is how far from the station eight miles eight maybe a bit more its a farm yes so tandaroit she took a couple of deep breaths hysterics would help no one its more of a district than a town she admitted there was a school here once and tennis courts not now though they use the school for storing stock feed and your farms eight miles from thishub he said his voice carefully dangerously neutral thats a little far to walk were not walking i was thinking he said of how long it might take to walk back here when i decide to leave that caught her she stopped staring out into the night and stared at her boss instead thinking how this might look to him you mean if my family turn into axemurderers she ventured ive seen deliverance her lips twitched were not that bad you dont own a car no yet i pay you a very good wage we have lettys station wagon and a tractor what else do we need you like sitting on rail heads waiting for grandmothers who may or may not appear shell appear i believe he said speaking slowly as if she was ever so slightly dim that i might be changing my mind about travelling to a place thats eight miles from a train which comeshow often a day three or four times but it only stops here once once he said faintly it stops once eight miles away from a place that has no mobile phone reception with a grandmother who even her granddaughter appears to be feeling homicidal about uhoh she ran her fingers through her hair and tried to regroup not that its not a very kind invitation he added and she choked she was so close to the edge i thought it was kind she managed kind i could have left you in the office or not it was you he reminded her who got me into this mess you could have listened to the news on the radio this morning as well as me she snapped and then thoughthad she really said that what little hope she had of keeping her job had finally gone thats what i pay you for he snapped back well if shed gone this far i left the office at eleven last night i was at your hotel just after six i dont get eight hours off i pay you for twentyfour hours on call im not fussed about what you pay me she snapped the tension of the last few hours was suddenly erupting and there was no way she could keep a lid on her emotions im fussed about the ten minutes i spent washing my hair this morning when i should have been listening to the radio and hearing about the airline strike im fussed about being stuck with my boss who doesnt seem the least bit grateful that im doing the best i can and now im stuck with someone who has the capacity to mess with my family christmas if he doesnt stop making me feel guilty and if he spends the rest of christmas playing manhattan millionaire stuck here and its all my fault she stopped out of breath out of emotion out of words and it seemed he was the same well what could he say should he agree he could hardly sack her here right now meg thought if he didshe and letty really could be axemurderers or they could just leave him here sitting on the tandaroit station until the next train came through late tomorrow dont do it he growled and she remembered too late he had an uncanny ability to read her mind he hesitated and then obviously decided he had no choice but to be a little bit conciliatory its veryclean hair he ventured thank you what else was there to say thisgrandmother letty shes backed up by other family members with other cars he was obviously moving on from her outburst deciding the wisest thing was to ignore it just letty andwho else scotty my kid brother you said no children he said alarmed fifteens not a child okay he conceded who else no one where are your parents they died she said four years ago car crash he was quick he had it sorted straight away which is why you took the job with me so i could get home more she said ironic isnt it but he was no longer listening had he been listening anyway could this be letty he demanded oh please she stared into the darkness and there it was two pinpricks of light in the distance growing bigger headlights deliverance she muttered and her boss almost visibly flinched just joking she said dont joke no jokes she agreed and took a deep breath and picked up her holdall okay heres letty and while you may not appreciate it we really are safe weve organised you a nice private bedroom with internet you can use our telephone if there are people you need to contact other than over the web you can stay in your room and work all christmas but letty is one of the worlds best cooks and here really is better than camping in the office i imagine it will be he said but he didnt sound sure and i am grateful i bet you are its lovely hair he said surprisingly it would have been a shame to leave it dirty for christmas thank you she managed again cheering up despite herself letty was coming she could send w s mcmaster to his allocated room and she could get on with christmas anger was counterproductive anger would get him no where yes his pa had messed up his christmas plans but the thing was done and no he should never have agreed to come with her to this middleofnowhere place if hed thought it through maybe he could have rung a realtor and even bought a small house anything rather than being stuck at the beck and call of one wiry little woman called letty who seemed to own the only set of wheels in the entire district they hadnt passed another car the car they were in sounded sick enough to be worrying there was something wrong with its silenceras if it didnt have one the engine was periodically missing the gearbox seemed seriously shot they were jolting along an unsealed road he was wedged in the back seat with both his and megs gear and letty was talking at the top of her lungs im late because dave barring popped over to check on millicent millicents a heifer im worried is going to calve over christmas letty was yelling at him over her shoulder daves our local vet and hes off for christmas so i wanted a bit of reassurance he reckons she should be right she told meg then i had to pick up three bags of fertiliser from robertsons robby said if i didnt take it tonight the placed be locked up till after new year so im sorry its a bit squashed in the back im fine he said he wasnt anger was counterproductive if he said it often enough he might believe it we can swap if you want meg said you wont fit in the back letty said not with killer letty was right the combination of meg and killer would never fit in the back seat with the baggage killer looked like a cross between a labrador and an old english sheepdog he was huge and hairy and black as the night around them hed met meg with such exuberance that once more william had had to steady her stopping her from being pushed right over while killer had greeted meg letty had greeted him with a handshake that was stronger than a mans twice her size then shed greeted her granddaughter with a hug that made meg wince and then shed moved into organisational mode you in the back meg in the front with killer i told scotty id be back by ninethirty so we need to move they were moving they were flying over the corrugated road with a speed that made him feel as if he was about to lose teeth so what do we call you letty said over her shoulder i told you hes mr mcmaster meg said sounding muffled as well she might under so much dog mac letty demanded hes my boss letty said sounding desperate hes not mac hes our guest for christmas what do we call you she demanded again how about mac do not let the servants become familiar master william mr mcmaster sir once upon a time a woman called hannah had called him william to her appalling cost how about bill letty demanded thats short for william or billy billy meg said sounding revolted grandma can we william he said flatly hating it willie letty said hopeful william letty sighed wills better though it is a bit short like meg meg said you know i like meggie and you know i dont answer to it we dont have to call you anything you dont like meg said over her shoulder im happy to keep calling you mr mcmaster you are not letty retorted not over christmas and why are you calling him mr mcmaster anyway how long have you worked for him three years he calls me miss jardine then the pair of you need to come off your high horses letty retorted meg and william it is and if i hear any sign of ms or mr then its meggie and willie for the rest of christmas right okay with me meg said resigned fine william said define fine he was expecting hillbilly country what he got was fantasia they sped over a crest and there it was spread out before them a house straight out of a fairy tale or not as he got closer not a fairy tale a christmas tableau the farmhouse set well back from the road among scattered gums was lit up like a series of flashing neon signs it was so bright it should almost be visible from the next state oh my meg breathed before william could even get his breath back grandma what have you done we both did it letty said proudly me and scotty you like our sleigh the house had two chimneys with what looked like an attic between them the sleigh took up the entire distance between chimneys there was a santa protruding from the chimney on the left or rather part of santa his lower half his legs were waving backwards and forwards as if santa had become stuck in descent the movement wasnt smooth so he moved gracefully from left to right then jerked back with a movement sharp enough to dislodge vertebrae the house was christmas city there were lights from one end to the other a myriad of fairy lights that made the house look like something out of a cartoon movie it took us days letty said pleased with the awed hush when you rang and said there was a chance you couldnt get home tonight scotty and i were ready to shoot ourselves weve worked our tails off getting this right i can see that you have meg said sounding as stunned as he was grandma and before you say a word we got it all over the internet letty informed her scotty found it it was a package deal advertised in july by some lady cleaning out her garage shed just bought the house and found it and she practically paid us to take it away some people she said slowing the car so they could admire the house in all its glory have no appreciation of art but running it meg said helplessly itll cost its practically all solar letty cut in except santa well theres not a lot of solar santa clauss backsides out there we havent quite got the legs right but ill adjust them before christmas still what do you think there was suddenly a touch of anxiety in her voice william got it and he thought maybe this lady wasnt as tough as she sounded she surely wanted to please this girl meg sitting somewhere under her dog you climb up on that roof again and ill give all of your christmas presents to the dogs but i love it meg said as the car came to a halt really i really love it meg giggled its kitsch and funny and those legs are just plain adorable what do you think letty said and she swivelled and looked straight at him will william um no lies she said is my meg just humouring me meg swivelled too she was covered in dog but somehow he managed to see her expression mess with my grandma and ill mess with you her look said and it was such a look that he had to revise all over again what he thought of his competent biddable pa his hostess for christmas adorable he said faintly youre lying letty said and he found himself smiling i am he agreed and he met megs glare square on theres nothing adorable about a pair of crimson trousers stuck in a chimney however its fantastical and truly in the spirit of christmas as soon as we came over the crest i just knew this was going to be a christmas to remember better than being stuck in the office meg said starting to smile better than the office maybe then thats okay letty said accelerating again if you like my decorations then you can stay the pair of you youre very generous william said we are arent we meg agreed and hugged her dog and then the car pulled to a halt beside the houseand straight away there was more dog killers relatives william opened the door and four noses surged in each desperate to reach him they were all smaller than killer he thought with some relief black and white collies fred milo turps roger leave the man alone meg called and the dog pack headed frantically for the other side of the car to envelope someone they obviously knew and loved meg was on the ground hugging handfuls of ecstatic dog being welcomed home in truly splendid style william extricated himself from the car and stared down at her any hint of his cool composed pa had disappeared meg was being licked from every angle she was coated with dog and she was showing every sign of loving it killers megs dog letty said surveying the scene in satisfaction fred and roger are mine turps and milo belong to scotty but they all love meg shes so good with dogs meg was well and truly buriedand the sight gave him pause in twentyfour hours he should be entering his apartment overlooking central park his housekeeper would have come in before him made sure the heating was on filled the place with provisions even set up a tasteful tree the place would be warm and elegant and welcoming maybe not as welcoming as this he would have been welcomed almost as much as this on christmas day he thought and that was a bleak thought a really bleak thought the disappointment hed felt when hed learned of the air strike hit home with a vengeance he didnt show emotion he was schooled not to show it but now it wasnt any use thinking of it he thought struggling to get a grip on his feelings elinor would make alternative arrangements the kids were accustomed to disappointment that made it worse not better dont think about it why rail against something he could do nothing about why was the sight of this woman rolling with dog intensifying the emotion making him feel as if he was on the outside looking in back off he told himself he was stuck here for three days make the most of it and move on meg was struggling to her feet and despite a ridiculous urge to go fend off a few dogs he let her do it herself regain her feet and her composure or as much composure as a woman whod just been buried with dogs could have no down oh ive missed you guys but wheres scotty scotty was watching them the kid in the doorway was tall and gangly and way too skinny even allowing for an adolescent growth spurt he had megs chestnut curls megs freckles megs clear green eyes but williams initial overriding impression was that he looked almost emaciated there was a scar running the length of his left cheek he had a brace enclosing his left leg from foot to hip he was looking nervously at william but as soon as william glanced at him he turned his attention to his sister whod turned her attention to him scotty dogs forgotten meg headed for her brother and enveloped him in a hug that was almost enough to take him from his feet the kid was four or five inches taller than megs meagre five feet four or so but he had no body weight to hold him down meg could hug as much as she wanted there was no way scotty could defend himself not that he was defending himself he was hugging meg back but with a wary glance at william over her head suspicious hi william said im william there hed said it as if it didnt hurt at all im scott the boy said and meg released him and turned to face william her arm staying round her brother her face a mixture of defensiveness and pride this is my family she said letty and scotty and our dogs scott scott said again only it didnt come out as it should he was just at that age william thought adolescent trying desperately to be a man but his body wasnt cooperating his voice was almost broken but not quite and aside from his breaking voice his leg looked a mess as well you didnt get to wear a brace that looked like scaffolding if the bones underneath werent deeply problematic meg had told him her parents had died four years ago had scott been in the same car crash the brace spoke of serious ongoing concerns why hadnt he found this out william had always prided himself on hiring on instinct rather than background checks a background check right now would be handy did the car get you here all right the kid asked and william could see he was making an effort to seem older than he was it needs about six parts replacing but grandma wont let me touch it you mess with that car and were stuck letty said next milk cheque ill get it seen to i wouldnt hurt it youre fifteen youre hardly a mechanic yeah but ive read no letty snapped the cars fine i tried messing with my dads golf cart when i was fifteen william said interrupting what he suspected to be a long running battle dad was away for a month he came back and id supplied him with a hundred or so extra horsepower sadly he touched the accelerator and hit the garage door the fuss talk about lack of appreciation scott smiled at thata shy smile but a smile nonetheless so did letty and so did meg and his reaction surprised him he kind of liked these smiles he decided they took away a little of the sting of the last few hours it seemed he could put thoughts of deliverance aside these people were decent he could settle down here and get some work done and maybe he could try and make meg smile again was that a thought worth considering the internets down scott said and smiling was suddenly the last thing on his mind the internet meg said sounding stunned whats wrong with it theres been a landslip over at tandaroit south and the lines are down they dont know when itll be fixed days probably he was having trouble figuring this out lines telephone lines scott said an adolescent explaining something to slightly stupid nextgenerationup you use phone lines for the internet i know dinosaur stuff and slow as scott said but satellite connection costs heaps mickey has satellite connection but megs only just figured out a way we can afford dialup and he checked his phone theres no mobile reception here either he said slowly no meg told him and now no fixed phone no meg sounded really nervousas well she might so no internet until the lines fixed well duh scott said sounding adolescent and a bit belligerent maybe he thought his sister was about to be attacked maybe she was but william wasnt focused on meg he was feeling ill to be so far from contact he should have rung elinor before he left melbourne he should have woken her he had to contact her her entire christmas would be ruined i cant stay here he said through gritted teeth the airportd be better than this hey letty said he didnt have time or space to pacify her all he could think of was elinorand two small kids i need to use a phone he snapped now i have supper on letty said this is important there are people waiting for me in new york but youre not due there until tomorrow meg said astounded theyll hardly be waiting at the airport yet i still need a phone sort it jardine he ordered he watched her long thoughtful stare the stare hed come to rely on this woman was seriously good he depended on her in a crisis he was depending on her now and she didnt let him down supper first she said at last if it can wait that long maybe it could he conceded supper first then what then ill take you over to scottyto scotts friend mickeys mickey lives two miles north of here and his parents have satellite connection you can use the internet or their skype phone for half an hour while i catch up with mickeys mum the weekend before christmas shell probably still be up i need it for more half an hour max she said blunt and direct as hed come to expect even thats a favour theyre dairy farmers and its late now but you should be able to talk to new york via skype mind itll be before seven in the morning over there so trying to wake anyone up shell wake of course she will she said almost cordially and he looked at her with suspicion miss jardine im meg she said remember meg until im back on the payroll if that ever happens i dont believe ive fired you so you havent she said and christmas miracles happen okay ill take you over to mickeys and i will try and get you in touch with new york but lets not go anywhere until weve had some of lettys mango trifle you have made me mango trifle havent you grandma of course then what are we waiting for she demanded and she grabbed her bag manoeuvred her way through her dog pack and headed inside trifle yay then she paused oh im sorry sir she said looking back i mean william do you want your mango trifle in your room do you want me to take you straight there umno he said weakly thats a shame she said if youre sitting at the kitchen table youll want seconds theres less for us that way but if youre sure lead the way grandma lets go chapter three an hour later fortified with a supper of huge ham sandwiches and a mango trifle which seemed to have stunned william they were in the car again heading for mickeys it was almost eleven but meg knew enough of mickey to believe hed still be awake net surfing this was the only option for her boss to contact home it had to work who did he have waiting for him in new york he wasnt saying and she wasnt asking they drove in silence she pulled up outside a farmhouse a lot less startling than lettys instead of knocking though while william watched from the car she tossed gravel at the lit end window mickey hauled up the window bruce that one word deflected her thoughts from her own problems once upon a time mickey would have expected scott meg thought bleakly the kids were the same age and they lived barely two miles apart four years ago their bikes had practically created a rut in the road between but the rut had long been repaired tonight scott had been too tired to come with them he was always tired hed hardly touched his supper his school work was slipping he was simply uninterested there were problems apart from his physical ones she thought in the new year shed have to talk to his doctors again about depression but how could she sort depression for a kid facing what scott was facing how long before he could ride a bike again he believed he never could she hadnt accepted it though shed fight it every inch of the way but that meant staying employed so she could pay the bills it also meant being nice to her boss over christmas or as nice as she could which meant throwing stones at a neighbours window three days before christmas bruce mickey called again and she hauled her attention back to here and now its meg she called to the kid at the window meg mickey sounded pleased and she liked that she liked coming home she liked it that every person in the tiny shopping town of tandaroit east knew her and she could go into every house in the district and find people she knew the phones are out and i have a guest here who needs to contact new york she said scottyscott said you have skype hey i do mickey said sounding inordinately pleased ive never used it for new york though i dont know anyone there would it be all right if mr mcmaster used it william said william hi will mickey was clearly delighted to have company are your parents asleep meg asked dad is hes gotta milk at five but mums making mince pies you want me to tell her youre here yes please meg said thankfully i dont want to be caught creeping round the place at night without your parents knowing yeah mickey said in a laughing voice that said such an action had indeed been indulged in on more than one occasion before now and meg thought sadly of how much of a normal kids life scotty was missing so her boss used skype while meg helped mickeys mum scoop mincemeat into pastry shells jenny wasnt much older than meg but while meg had gone to university and then to a career jenny had married her childhood sweetheart at seventeen and had mickey nine months later she could have done the same meg thought feeling nostalgic and a bit jealous as she took in the cosy farm kitchen the muddle of christmas baking the detritus of a farming family with twin girls of nine as well as mickey this place looks gorgeous meg said sitting on an ancient kitchen chair and scooping mincemeat nope jenny said and grinned gorgeous is whats up in mickeys room right now jenny had been introduced before mickey had taken william off to link him with the other side of the world and meg could see her friend adding two and two and making seventeen you mean my boss i mean the man youve brought home for christmas yum ive seen him in the gossip rags and hes even more gorgeous in the flesh hes a squillionaire hes your boss and youve got him for christmas you can have him if you want him meg said morosely he might be happier here you have a computer yeah and i have twins and ians extended family arriving tomorrow to stay for a week therell be eight kids in the house heaven help us but she was smiling as she said it and meg thought even though she had never understood jennys decision to marry and make a home so early maybe just maybe it made sense youre not getting clucky jenny demanded following her gaze and meg realised she was staring at a pile of paper chains at the far end of the table she remembered making them as a kid i have spare paper jenny said happily you can help your boss make paper chains very bonding very funny no i think its lovely jenny said getting serious to have him here for christmas oooh meg but does he have a girlfriend i have no idea no idea well im his pa and i havent been told to send flowers to anyone lately but he was desperate to use the phone so whos he ringing i have no idea ill ask mickey but mickey who wandered into the kitchen two minutes later was no help at all yeah hes talking but i put my headset on and left him to it nah i didnt hear who to mum you reckon its too late to put another cd on my christmas list ive just found this sick new band forget it his mother said santa asked for a list a month ago and you couldnt think of anything except a farm bike which you know we cant afford so what are you giving william for christmas meg love uhoh here was yet another problem she hadnt thought through on christmas morning she sat under the christmas tree and opened presents lots of presents megs mother had always believed inexcess shed loved christmas with a passion and meg had still been getting a santa stocking at twentyfive the next year with her parents dead meg had overcompensated and so had letty and to their delight so did scott hed plundered his piggy bank and asked the nurses to help him theyd had a silly overthetop christmas in scottys hospital ward and the tradition had thus continued so megs last minute christmas spree had filled her baggage with gifts but there wasnt a lot she could recycle for william he has everything she said feeling hopeless he hasnt got skype mickey said he will next week when he goes back to new york so buy him a satellite dish for the weekend mickey said cheerfully then scotty can use it after he leaves right with what thats just a bit more money than i had in mind to spend she retorted and mickey screwed up his nose and sloped off to watch television in the other room grownup problems not his so hows the debt reduction going jenny asked jenny had been one of the many whod come to megs aid after the crash she knew of megs debt scotts medical expenses were colossal and on top of that theyd had to keep the farm going when there was no one to run it its okay she told her friend as long as im not sacked she added under her breath but im probably sacked so lets not go there so its just a present for mr sexyeyes can you knit no so thats homemade socks out of the question leaves only aftershave jenny said ian gets some every year from his aunty merle only merle hasnt noticed that ians had a full beard for twenty years now im happy to donate a gallon or six i suspect he uses his own i guess he would jenny said sliding one batch of mince pies out of the oven and another in so theres nothing in the world he needs except a plane out of here out of your control love jenny said itll have to be aftershave she glanced up at the ceiling id so love to be a fly on the wall wouldnt you i wonder who hes talking to its not my business meg said a bit too primly and jenny laughed you mean the walls are too thick and theres no way we can find out lets face it youre interested and why not hes the most eligible man on the planet as well as the most gorgeous as well as that hes your house guest for three days you have him trapped meg darling if you dont try and get him interestedseriously interestedyou have rocks in your head finished williams voice growled from the door and they both jumped and meg did her blushing thing again that was twice now all i want for christmas is my dignity she thought desperately as jenny stifled laughter diddid you get onto who you wanted she managed wondering how pink her face was yes thank you how much had he heard she thought the most eligible man on the planet and you have him trapped if he thought who did you need to talk to jenny asked innocently and offered him a plate of mince pies friends he said shortly his face expressionless meg knew that expression it meant the mcmaster displeasure was about to wreak consequences there wasnt a lot of wreaking he could do right now though except wave away the mince pie plate as if it was poison eat my mince pies or ill be offended for ever jenny said the price of my internet café is a compliment for the cook and he really was trapped meg thought he was forced not to snap he was forced even to be pleasant so he ate and he somehow managed to tell jenny her mince pies were excellent while meg tried to get her face in order and she almost managed it but then jenny dog at a bone refusing to be deflected said so are you going to tell us who this friend is whos awake at six oclock in the morning in new york and meg blushed all over again jenny he doesnt have to answer no but im interested thank you very much for your internet use william said clipped tight and angry he tugged his wallet out and laid a note on the kitchen table a note so large it made jenny gasp what do you think youre doing paying he said put it away jenny said angry to match now theres no need for that jennys my friend meg said shed never charge shes not my friend whoa line overstepped she was home for christmas and there were some things which she would not put up with hurting jenny was one of them she is because she let you use the internet when she didnt have to without thought of payment you wont have to walk back to the station ill drive you she snapped jenny do you have a sleeping bag i can borrow and a water bottle give him a couple more of those mince pies so he wont starve hey i wasnt that offended jenny said her flash of hurt disappearing and being replaced by her customary laughter she took williams money and tucked it back into his suit pocket it was very nice of him to offer it was not nice meg said glowering he was being snarky snarky william said dont look at me like im speaking some other language meg retorted you know what snarky is jenny sleeping bag youre not serious jenny said if you are he can sleep here hes not your friend he just said so he wasnt serious i was william said but im having second thoughts you know i think thats wise jenny said and grinned again and waggled her finger at the pair of them birds in their little nest agree jenny go on get out of here the two of you jenny said cheerfully take him home meg and dont even think of going via the station can you just see the headlines tomorrows express train thundering through tandaroit station with william mcmaster sleeping off the effect of too many mince pies on a deserted platform so be nice to her william and if you can possibly manage it tell her who it is that you contacted tonight shes dying to know even if it isnt her business she raised floury hands and shooed them out into the hall out of the front door she banged it shut after them and then tugged it open again an afterthought had just occurred its the season for peace on earth and goodwill to all men she called after them so dont leave him on the railway station they drove home in silence meg was too embarrassed to say anything william simplydidnt she pulled up outside the house and made to get out but williams hand came down onto her arm making her pause im sorry he said but i dont take kindly to questions thats your right but you will be nice to my family and to my friends i will be nice to your family and to your friends he repeated tell me about scott sorry ive employed you for three years ive never asked about your family i dont take kindly to questions she intoned and he grimaced thats your right he conceded of course youre not obligated to tell me as youre not obligated to tell me who you just telephoned she relented then sighed and put up her hands in mock surrender no dont tell me its jenny who wanted to know that one not me and how about that for a barefaced lie she thought but some lies were almost compulsory but williams question still hung unanswered and he wasnt taking it back she glanced at the house apart from the christmas decorations it was all in darkness letty and scott would be long asleep even the dogs hadnt stirred on their return theyd be sleeping in a huge huddle at the end of scotts bed she knew turps and roger would be on the bed itselfscott had trained them to lie still so he could use them as a rest for his brace the others would be on the floor as close as they could get she loved scotty so much it hurt it hurt so much she wanted to cry and all at once it was easy to answer williams question she wanted to talk scottys my halfbrother she said staring ahead into the darkness speaking almost to herself my mum was a single mumshe had me early and she raised me the hard way with no parental support then when i was nine she met scotts dad alex was a farmer a fair bit older than she was mum was selling secondhand clothes at a market and alex had come to town to check out some new innovative water pump he never bought the pump but he took one look at mum and he fell hard love at first sight william said and he sounded a bit derisive meg glared at him he was on shaky ground derision wasnt something she was putting up with tonight and apparently he realised it sorry he said sorry sorry love at first sight it happens so it does she said and glared at him a bit longer until she was sure he was remembering the railway station and the water bottle and the express train thundering through crowded with people with cameras so it did she reiterated as he attempted to look apologeticnot a good fit for w s mcmaster but it was a start her glare faded i remember the weekend alex invited us here he was a great big dairy farmer in his forties he hardly talked that was okay mum was a talker and i remember he just kept looking at mum like she was some sort of magic and then i met letty and letty was my magic we arrived on the friday night and mum and alex couldnt take their eyes off each other all weekend and on sunday letty said call me grandma it was like wed come home we had come home alex took us back to melbourne and we threw our things into the back of his truck and we headed back here and stayed alex married mum a month later i was a flower girl letty made me the most gorgeous dress we were so happy and then five years later scotty was born and it was perfect nothings perfect william said as if he couldnt help himself and she shook her head in disgust and theres no such thing as love at first sight dont mess with my fairy tales mr mcmaster it was love at first sight and it was perfect for sixteen whole years sure the farms not big and we struggled a bit but mum still did markets and everyone helped i was good at school and we knew there was no way the farm would support scotty and meor even one of usbut i was really happy going to university i missed it more when i got a fulltime job but i was still pretty happy having this place here as my backstop and then four years ago a truck came round a bend on the wrong side of the road and it all crumpled to nothing silence im so sorry he said at last yeah she said grimly it makes you realise that when you have the fairy tale you hang on and you appreciate it every single moment just like that she shook her head shaking away nightmares anyway mum and alex were killed instantly scotty was eleven he was in the back seat he just brokeeverything for months we thought hed be a paraplegic but he had so much grit he has so much grit hes fought and fought for ages neighbours kept the farm going for us we thought wed have to sell but then letty and i figured maybe we could keep it if we use my salary to augment the income we can just get by its where scottys happy its where lettys happy and your job with me see theres the fairy tale again she said and smiled but he didnt smile back he looked intent as if trying to see meaning behind her words it disconcerted her but no matter she had to keep going i thought id get a job in curalo and commute the twenty miles she told him but then along came your advertisement and its been fabulous we have a lady who comes and milks for us while im not here lettys still active weve coped so if i sack you her smile faded then then the fairy tale ends again its not as bad as that she said and tilted her chin well manage i wont sack you i dont need sympathy im not offering it well put this behind us as an unfortunate aberration on my part on your part he agreed gravely its been a sad hiccup in your normally exemplary efficiency well get this weekend behind us and then go back to where we were youre normally an extremely competent employee gee thanks she said before she could stop herself who was being snarky now if thats sarcasm no im overwhelmed she said honestly i am she had to get herself under control here meek she told herself do meek i dont give compliments that arent deserved he said stiffly and she thoughtwhat am i doing joshing with a guy who controls my life but there was something about this day or this night this time this seasonmaybe even it was just that santa was still waggling dumbly overheadthat made her refuse to treat this as normal she wasnt going back to being miss jardine not just yet you know you dont have to simply get this weekend behind us she said cautiously you could enjoy it im hardly in a position to enjoy it because you dont have the phone or the internet because im right out of my comfort zone he said honestly and i want to be back in new york and i want my parents back she retorted but that doesnt stop me enjoying what i have the here and now thats very commendable it is isnt it she said evenly in fact if im not mistaken my boss just commended me he said i was normally an extremely competent employee so while im ahead i might just stop she swung herself out of the car and waited for him to do likewise i have an early start mr mcmaster so i need to go to bed why do you have an early start i milk cows she said heading for the back door if you cant sleep and run out of work then youre welcome to join me at dawn instead of a gym workout if i were you though i wouldnt wear a suit and she walked into the house and left him to followif he wanted what choice did he have none at all chapter four he woke to the sound of cows many cows the window of his attic bedroom was open and the notsogentle lowing was filling the room the old comfortable bed the faded furnishings and the unaccustomed sounds were so different from his normal environment that he struggled to take it in but he got it soon enough he was trapped for christmas on megs farm meg in the predawn light the name felt strange almost dangerous he linked his hands loosely behind his head and stared upward trying to assimilate how he was feeling the planked ceiling ran up to a peak hed be right underneath santas sleigh he thought and that seemed so unnerving he unlinked his hands and swung himself straight out of bed he didnt intend to lie in bed and think about santa about what hed promised about what he was missing in new york nor did he intend to lie in bed and think about meg miss jardine meg he thought the name suited her so why was lettys order to use her name unsettling he knew why as an adolescent blessed with enough insight to think about emotions hed struggled with reasons hed even wondered if one of the therapists his mother used might give him answers but finally hed worked it out himself this had been a lesson taught early to a child by a jealous vindictive mother who believed employees and friends were to be strictly differentiated theyll take advantage it was a savage line said with spite and the memory of it still had the power to make him flinch unsettled he crossed to the attic window and peered below it was barely daybreak the sun wasnt yet over the horizon and the farm looked greygreen barely lit from the night before he could see the roof of what must be the dairy and cows clustering beyond a couple of dogs were fussing around them but the cows were uninterested the cows looked as if they knew what they were about and the dogs were simply demonstrating their role a role other than licking meg meg there it was again the word theyll take advantage hed been seven his parents had been away for who knew how long it never seemed to matter because the house was much more fun with them gone it was summer school was out and ros their cook had been teaching him to make pancakes but shed turned her back and hed tried to flip a pancake before it was ready the hot batter had oozed from the spatula and onto his hand hannah his nanny had come running shed held him tight rocking him while ros rushed to apply salve there baby itll be fine see ros has ice and ointment all ready let hannah see his parents had walked in as theyd hugged him maybe he hadnt reacted fast enough he was shocked and his hand hurt so instead of rushing to greet them with the pleasure hed already begun to act instead of feel hed simply clung harder to his hannah what is this his mother had demanded with deep displeasure and hed sobbed then with fright as well as pain already he knew that voice william stop that appalling crying and get over here you do not get close to servants theyre not servants hed managed theyre hannah and ros his mothers eyes had narrowed at that and hed been sent to his room without even salve on his hand who knew where hannah and ros were now theyd been given notice on the spot he needed to learn independence his mother had decreed and he still remembered the sneer his next nanny had been nice enough but hed learned his new nanny was miss carmichael he did not get close soon after that hed been sent to boarding school his parents had split and from then on his holidays had been spent with his grandparents the only care he had there was from more servantsthough eventually his grandfather realised he had a head for figures that had resulted in a tinge of interest william was deemed the new head of the mcmaster empire so there he had it he thought ruefully his one family use his grandfather knew hed make a good businessman and that was the extent of his importance it was no wonder he was emotionally screwed he should be able to get over ithis dysfunctional familytheir fierce focus on social hierarchy and fortunetheir petty squabbles and personal vindictivenesstheir total lack of sense of family but how to get over a lifetime of dysfunction even now he didnt really understand what family love or life was hed an inkling of it through friends and associates at times he even envied it but to try and achieve itno hed learned not to need it he couldnt need something he didnt understand and the last thing he wanted was to hurt another human as his extended family had hurt each other how could he undo so many years of family malice he couldnt he told no one any lies about himself the women he dated used his social cachet as payoff and that was fine by him and the kids pip and ned he was certainly fond of them as fond as he ever allowed himself to be but they called him mr mcmaster and he knew that soon hed disappear from their lives as well that was the way things had to be like now he couldnt even be there for them at christmas a broken promise like so many hed been given as a child a whistle split the air so loud it hauled him out of his reverie maybe that was just as well there was little to be gained by trying to change at this stage of his life and maybe a lot to lose he shrugged mocking something that was part and parcel of how he faced the worldand then he tried to figure who was whistling meg had said shed be helping with the milking who else was down there there was only one way to find out he checked his watch it was fivethirty early even by his standards whoever was down there knew how to work w s mcmaster could be forgotten here she was perfectly gloriously happy she was home meg stomped across the baked dirt and whooshed her next cow into the bail friesian plodded forward with resigned equanimity thats topsy kerrie said her milk productions gone up twelve per cent this year youre ace arent you girl i thought letty decided we should stop naming them that was only when she had to get rid of half the herd it broke her heart now your incomes so good shes decided we can name them again she started with millicent and now shes moving onto the whole herd uhoh its not so stable as you might think she said cautiously kerrie released her cow and stretched and glanced across into the vat room where her three little girls were playing in a makeshift playpen we take one day at a time she said we all know that maybe everyone did meg thought as she washed teats and attached cups last year kerries husband had maxed out their credit cards and taken off with a girl half his age leaving kerrie with three babies under four milking here was now her sole income kerries income was thus dependent on megs income on megs job william had said he wouldnt fire her she had to believe him but first they had to get through christmas well put this behind us as an unfortunate aberration christmas an aberration that wasnt what hed meant but it was how it seemed what was he intending to do with himself for the next three days can i help she didnt have to show she was startled the cows did it for her backing away in alarm at this unfamiliar person in the yard the cow kerrie was ushering in backed right out again before kerrie could stop her and kerrie swore and headed after her you need to move meg said swiftly youre scaring the cows he was in his gym gear black and white designer stuff with crisp white designer trainers very neat the cows werent appreciating it he backed into the vat room where the playpen was set up the oldest of the little girls cried out in alarm and he backed out of there too meg found herself smiling her boss in charge of his world or not go back to bed she advised its early i dont like my pa working before me is there something i can do really really goodness how are you at washing udders she asked stunned i learned it at kindergarten he said promptly and she found herself chuckling hed woken up on the right side of the bed then maybe this could work if youre serious im serious the cows dont like gym gear you think i should go back and put on one of my suits umno she chuckled and saw a flare of surprise in his eyes maybe she didnt chuckle around him enough maybe she didnt chuckle at all kerries brother helps out here occasionally when the kids are sick she said rons around your size his overalls and gumboots are in the vat room gumboots wellingtons kerrie said entranced this is kerrie meg said kerrie this is william your boss kerrie asked not right this minute hes not she said firmly now hes offering to be a worker you want to use rons gear the cows will settle once you look familiar she pointed to the vat room theres babies in there william said nervously and both women burst out laughing if youre going to give me a hard time william said but to megs amazement he was smiling nah youre free labour meg said smiling right back kerrie youre responsible for keeping mr mcmaster free of all babies get changed and come out and well introduce you to cows one to a hundred only now they all have names kerrie reminded her ill teach you teach us both meg said it seems we both need to get used to names by the time they finished the sun was already spreading warmth promising a hot day to come meg set william to sluicing the dairy while she did who knew what with the equipment in the vat room sluicing was william found a curiously satisfying job controlling a hose with enough water power to drive the mess off the ramp and into the drains it was a manly sort of hose he decided and he set about enjoying himself kerrie collected her kids and made to leave ill see you tonight she called to meg and he thought suddenly she looks tired three kids so small what was she doing milking twice a day are you milking over christmas he asked and kerrie nodded letty and i milk twice a day when megs here letty gets time off she needs it when do you get a sleepin he asked and suddenly meg was outside again listening with three babies kerrie asked as if sleepins were unheard of their dad he did a runner kerrie said with feigned indifference milking for megs the only thing between me and bankruptcy and william glanced over at meg caught her urgent unspoken message and knew it was true so youre milking morning and night all over christmas i like it kerrie said so if i said id do it for you both women drew in their breath megs face went still she obviously hadnt expected this if its okay with meg that is he said and swooshed a mess of stuff from the ramp swooshing felt excellent meg smiled he liked it when she smiled how come he hadnt noticed that smile way before now its fine by me meg said but but i cant afford it kerrie said suddenly breathless i meanits a lovely offer but but nothing meg said suddenly rock solid smiling at william as if he was santa in person williams offering to do it for free im sure of it ive budgeted for your pay so this is his gift to you let the man be magnanimous magnanimous kerrie ventured manly meg said grinning this is a very manly gesture if youre sure kerrie whispered sounding awed of course hes sure meg said smiling and smiling theres so much womens work to be done over christmas and what do the men do they buy a bottle of perfume at the last minute if were lucky even scotty hes left his christmas shopping to the last minute and i have to take him to curalo this morning ill stand outside the shop while he buys me the perfume ive told him i like and then ill drive him home and thats his manly duty done so heres one offering to be truly useful wow kerrie said yep get and go before i change my mind william said or before i turn my hose on your boss happy christmas kerrie he moved his hose so the water arced in a wide semicircle how long since hed done something this handson there was a pile of dried dung beside the fence he aimed his hose and the dung flew eighteen inches in the air before heading for the drain deeply satisfying oh wow kerrie breathed again and she abandoned the kids and hugged meg then she eyed williamwith cautionanyone would regard him with caution right nowbut finally emotion got the better of sense and she darted over the yard and hugged him as well then she flew back to her kids and bustled them into the car and away before anyone had a chance to change their mind hey that felt good meg said heading back into the vat room and replacing the dipstick sort of thing she was holding into the slot at the side of the vat did it feel good to you he sent another cowpat into the air absolutely if you knew how much that means to kerrie then she hesitated um sir what are you doing with that hose sir shed called him sir of course that was what he was wasnt it but she was looking bemused so he turned his attention back to the hose it had made a left turn and was now aimed straight into the drain behind the cows drinking trough forcing the contents of the drain up and in uhoh i guess the drinking trough now needs to be cleaned meg said well need to empty it scrub it rinse it three times and then fill it up again we dont want contamination do we umno he said and thought maybe there were a few skills he needed to concentrate on the milk tanker arrived just as he finished the driver climbed from the cab and greeted meg with delight hey meggie meggie william said softly just try itwillie she said with a glower that made him grin and went to meet the driver william listened in while they caught up their talk was all about milk yields and fat content and bacterial levels meg sounded as he was accustomed to hearing her smoothly competent in charge of her world but it was such a different world they gossiped on while he cleaned the trough and cleaned the yard surely cleaner than it had ever been cleaned before then the driver started emptying the vats and meg strode over and turned his hose off he felt bereft i was just getting good he said sadly you can do it again tonight she said and he started winding the hose around the reel by hand she leaned over and grabbed the wheel and started turning she was showing him up here but there was something else happening the angel her little christmas angel was still hanging around her neck and it was sliding down her breasts he noticed she was wearing grungy old overalls sort of mudbrown she was wearingwhat had she called them gumboots her hair was pulled back with an elastic band and she had mud smeared down the side of her face the top three buttons of her overalls were undone her angel was nestling on the soft swell of her breasts lucky angel why had it taken him until now to realise how beautiful she was earth to william she said and he blinked and grabbed the wheel and started turning it himself so fast the hose slipped off and he had to stop and start again maybe this wasnt a good idea maybe he had to get away a thought you need perfume he asked no she said bemused he didnt think so perfume would hardly fit with what she was doing right now but but scott wants to buy you perfume he wants to go christmas shopping i promised id take him to curalo thats our closest major shopping centretwenty miles from here but you have things to do here right right she said cautiously so could i take him you she said stunned and he thought about whether he should take personal affront at the thought that she obviously thought himand the rest of the male speciesuseless and then he caught another glimpse of that angel and thought maybe not would he mind if i took him he asked i could find an internet place in town and do my contactingkill two birds with one stone thatd be fantastic she breathed craig here says we should have signed the contract for our milk quota before christmas the managers still at work so craig says i can get a lift back in with him he can bring me back when he does the next farm but then i promised letty id help do the pudding i need to check on millicent i need to see to the water troughs im having trouble making everything fit so its a good idea its a fabulous idea she said admiringly her eyes were twinkling maybe she was manipulating him and it was such an odd experience people didnt manipulate him had she just manipulated him who knew this was one clever woman would you be confident driving lettys car she said i know you can drive on our side of the road more admiration yes but scotty would love to go with you christmas shopping with his sister or go christmas shopping with a guy someone who wont make him wait outside lingerie shops what a choice you dont hes always scared i might she hesitated and the laughter died i hes had a tough time hed enjoy going shopping with you rather than with me his leg she glanced across at craig but craig was bending down to pat killer and was obviously not in too great a rush she turned back to william and he realised he was being assessed she held his gaze for a long moment and then gave a decisive little nod whatever test thered been it seemed hed passed manipulation was past it was time for honesty scotts been through hell and back she said bluntly his leg was so badly smashed they had to put in a rod instead of bone it healed but then they had to insert another rod because he grew that got infected she swallowed he almost died again the leg still hasnt completely healed but it will and hes okay to get around hes really good on crutches if you couldjust do what he wants and if you can think of anything hed like id appreciate that too ive bought him so many computer games he surely must be over them but im hopeless at thinking of what a teenage boy wants hes so restrictedbut he needs a manly present her frankness was working as manipulation never could but he could do this he even puffed his chest a little so youd like me to take your kid brother christmas shopping for manly presents i can do that ooh youre not my boss youre my hero she said and before he could begin to guess what she intended she stood on tiptoe and kissed him it was a feather kiss almost a mockery but not quite it was a kiss of laughter and of sudden friendship and why it had the capacity to make him feel how did it make him feel he didnt know and it was too late to find out craig was replacing his hoses and yelling are you coming or not im coming she called ill just go lose my overalls and check with scott but this is a great idea my milkings sorted my brother will be happy and i have a superhero in the dairy what more could a girl want it took meg an hour to get to the factory and back by which time william and scott had been gone for an hour as well which left meg back at home with no way of knowing when theyd get back she was worrying about her brother she was also worrying about why shed kissed her boss it had been an impulsive gesture the sort shed make to anyone whod done her a big favour but somehowit seemed more she couldnt think of kissing her boss that made her feel weird she went back to worrying about scott youre worrying hes taken him back to new york letty demanded as she caught meg looking out of the window for maybe the twentieth time he cant there are no planes youve worked for the man for three years dont you trust him of course i do then why worry two hours is hardly time to christmas shop but then she hesitated oh but wait these are guys half an hour there half an hour back five minutes at the perfume counteryep they should be back by now she grinned but maybe theyre doing some bonding he misses his father does scotty pass the raisins you want me to mix the ingredients i handed you the bowl five minutes agoso you could look at it whoops sorry she applied herself to her creaming why didnt you do this before she asked arent puddings supposed to have been made a month ago you didnt get any time off and i was milking im not getting any younger but back to your young man my boss he doesnt seem to mind hard work you say that like its a compliment hes addicted to work plus hes really cute letty said and eyed meg sideways hes my boss i hadnt noticed right letty said dryly right so okay she had noticed what normal warmblooded woman wouldnt notice w s mcmaster but what use was there in noticing for the three years shed worked for him their relationship had been totally businesslike her boss worked far too hard for it to be anything else he never noticed her she thought she was just one of his four pas but sometimes sometimes when theyd been on a trip together when theyd been working late when shed suddenly been a little too close maybe even a little too familiar as tiredness crept in at the edges shed thought he made a conscious decision not to notice her as if there were some barrier he couldnt cross as of course there was he was her employer he was a billionaire she mixed the ingredients with her hands letting the warmth of her hands meld the mixture she was still staring out of the kitchen window but she was no longer looking for the absent scott and william she was thinking of william as hed been this morning mucking round with his hose enjoying himself shed kissed him it had been nothing but a silly gesture she told herself it meant nothing only that wasnt quite true meg jardine had kissed william mcmaster the lines between boss and secretary had blurred leading where you think that might be creamed enough letty demanded and she looked down into the bowl and thought yep it was getting so warm it was starting to melt there was an analogy somewhere here melting you want me to chop some nuts she managed and letty grinned some more and handed them over go right ahead a girls gotta vent her spleen on something youre wondering how much perfume those boys are intending to buy or are you wondering something else entirely chapter five they didnt appear for lunch and an hour later meg was really starting to worry ill take the tractor over to jennys and phone him from there she muttered they should be back youll do no such thing letty told her theyll have found a football game or gone to the movies or chanced on something really interesting that only boys can understand you didnt tell them a gethomeby time for which im grateful because its time we stopped mollycoddling our scotty our scott then she spoiled it by glancing at the clock but i hope wills fed him and he didnt take any painkillers if his legs hurting see meg retorted and they both smiled shamefaced shortbread next letty declared so they made a batch and then another and they were almost desperate enough to start a third when finally the car turned into the drive meg just happened to be looking out of the window when it did what on earth have they got on behind she demanded heading for the door the dogs were flying down from the veranda meg managed to stroll out with what she hoped was a little more dignity dont say we were worried letty hissed beside her and she agreed entirely they hadnt been worried at all what did they have behind the car a trailer a really large trailer and on the trailer theyve bought a car she muttered in amazement ortwo cars so much for perfume letty muttered this is never going to fit into a stocking come and see come and see scott was out of the car shouting his excitement and the dogs were barking hysterically in response william emerged from the drivers side leaned back on the car door and crossed his armsa genie whod produced magic and was now expecting appreciation he was wearing jeans and a shortsleeved opentopped shirt he lookedgreat he must have stopped at a clothes shop meg thought and then she thought i kissed himand then scotts excitement tugged her attention back to what was on the trailer at the front of the trailer was a mini minor the kind that had been almost the coolest car on the planet back in the seventies though maybe it hadnt been quite as cool as the volkswagen combi umwhat was she thinking she hadnt even been born in the seventies this mini however looked as if it had been it was truly derelict the little red and rustred car had no wheels no glass in its front windscreen and its hood was missing what looked like grass was sprouting from where the engine should be and tied on behind was part of another mini in even worse repair instead of suffering from neglect this one looked as if it had been smashed from behind the back had been squashed almost to the front there was also a pile of assorted bits tied on top meaning the trailer looked like a mini wreckers yard its williams christmas present to us all scott shouted and her boss beamed and she thought againhe looks great denim made him look soooo sexybut somehow she managed to give her hormones a mental slap and ventured off the veranda to see williams christmas present to us all we saw a sign just out of town despite his bad leg scott was practically jigging his excitement it was in a paddock and it said for sale and parts as well the guy restores minis but his wifes put her foot down he has three finished minis in his garage and two more to restore and his wife says the rest have to go so he sold us this two carsll make one he says theres enough here to make a complete one he reckons if i start now by the time i get my licence ill have it on the road if i get it going before then i can practice in the paddocks i can phone him any time i want and if im really stuck hes even offered to come out here to help he really will william said still smiling this wont be any work for either of you i promise his lovely lazy smile lit his face and meg thought frantically shed have to give those hormones another slap i have faith he went on thisll mean eventually the farm has two cars by the way we also went to the motor place in curalo and bought bits for your wagon letty your exhaust pipe has to be replaced and the silencer and so does the carburettor if its okay with you i might make a start this afternoon you meg said dazed i can fix cars he said neutrally and scott would like to learn you want to fix my car letty said while meg simply stood with her mouth open if its okay with you marry me letty said and scott and william laughedonly for some reason meg had trouble laughing the sight of her boss in jeans was disconcerting enough but she was looking at scotts flushed face and his shining happiness and she thought why hadnt she thought of this scott was practically stranded here on the farm his bad leg left him isolated there were so many days when he simply gazed at his computer in misery and in loneliness he now had a car to make and it was an original mini mickey would come she thought and more this project would be a magnet scotts mates would come as they had before the accident she was blinking back tears whats wrong william demanded watching her face and clearly confounded she sniffed and tried desperately to think of something to say something to do rather than kiss him again which seemed an entirely logical thing to do but some germ of common sense was holding her back ii wanted perfume she managed and her little brother stared at her as if she was out of her mind perfumewhen you could have these theyre not verygirlie she said and somehow she managed to sound doleful and scott realised she was joking and grinned and hugged her which was amazing all by itself how long since her seriously selfconscious brother had hugged ill let you drive my car he offered magnanimity at its finest second drive after me the minute i get it going what an offer she said and sniffed again and hugged him back and then smiled across at william through unshed tears thank you santa she said think nothing of it he said in a voice she didnt recognise and then she thought no she did know what she was hearing her normally businesslike boss was just a wee bit emotional himself it was time for milking letty and meg milked because im not interfering with this even if i have to milk the whole herd letty declared in wonder meg could only agree for kids were arriving from everywhere it seemed william had detoured past mickeys with their loadjust to show him scott had told them and mickey had sent out word and before they knew it a team of adolescents was unloading the heap of mini jumble into the unused shed behind the dairy when milking was done meg checked on millicentthe little heifer was thankfully showing no signs of calvingthen went to investigate the teenagers were surrounded by mini parts william was under lettys car sorry i know i said id milk but letty assured me she could and someone had to supervise some supervision all she could see of william was his legs he was in his borrowed overalls again and his gumboots on the other side of the shed teenagers were happily dismantling the wreck labelling pieces with lettys preserving stickers she had a bunch of gloriously happy teenagers and the guy whod caused it all to happen was apologising meg stared down at her bosss legs and thought she could totally understand where lettys proposal had come from and shed never realised until now how sexy a pair of greasecovered legs could be so so where did you learn mechanics she managed i told you powering up my fathers golf cart his voice was muffled but she was aware of an undercurrent of contentment and the rest my parents were away a lot they had enough cars to warrant hiring a mechanic he taught me nice guy meg said deflected from thinking about legsor almost she thought instead of gossip shed read about this man about how appalling his parents sounded how lonely his childhood must have been did this mechanic have a name mr himmel mr himmel she grimaced at the formality he called you mr mcmaster of course can you pass me under the tension wrench tension wrench on the left with the blue handle thats a tension wrench and you a dairy farmer and all dairy farmers arent necessarily mechanics plus im a commerce graduate and a pa right i forgot he said but absently and she knew his attention was on whatever he needed the tension wrench for she watched his legs for a little his attention was totally on the car she watched the boys for a little their attention was totally on the car guys doing guy stuff befuddled she headed back to the dairy where letty was sluicing they cleaned almost in silence but she was aware that letty kept glancing at her what meg said at last exasperated hes lovely so why are you looking at me she sighed anyway hes not lovely hes covered in grease you know what i mean okay i do she admitted but you know who he is so you can stop looking at me like you think i should do something about it hes william mcmaster one of the wealthiest men on the planet hes my boss and i have one of the best jobs in the world if you think im messing with it by thinking hes lovely i suppose it would mess with it letty said falling for the boss itd be a disaster i dont know how you havent before because ive never seen him in overalls before they do make a man look sexy letty said thoughtfully that and carrying a grease gun my jack was always attached to a grease gun mind once i had to get the grease off his clothes the novelty pretty soon wore off she sighed but then she brightened but times have changed domestic equality and all that he could get his own grease off youre seriously suggesting william mcmaster could do his own laundry meg even managed a chuckle the idea merited a chuckle as was thinking of those legs sticking out from under lettys car as was thinking that william mcmaster was sexy legs or not even if the man carries a grease gun hes still my boss she told herself a good servant knows her place just plaster that message across your box of hormones and leave it there they ate dinner on the run the boys were in no hurry to go home at dusk they took off packlike whooping away on their bicycles and meg knew theyd be back first thing in the morning this was priceless scott was almost asleep on his feet but lit up almost as much as the christmas tree in the sitting room he fell into bed happier than shed seen him for years letty commandeered william to take him over to the shed to show her what he was doing with her car meg headed out behind the hay shed millicent was still doing little of interest the small fawn and white cow chewing her cud and gazing placidly out at the fading sunset mind if i share your sunset she asked and millicent turned her huge bovine eyes on her and seemed to ask a question hes only here until monday then its back to normal meg said as if millicent really was asking the question only what was the question and what was normal she hitched herself up on the fence and started sunsetgazing but she wasnt seeing sunset this is just a hiccup in our lives she said out loud but its a great hiccup she was under no illusion as to how big a deal this was ever since the accident scottys mates had been drifting away they were nice kids they included him when they could but increasingly he was off their radar today theyd returned and theyd hated leaving here was a project designed to keep kids happy for months if not years a project with a working car at the end of it a mini theyd be back and back and back and it was all down to william william of the sexy legs william of the sexyeverything and suddenly inexplicably she was tearing up she sniffed and millicent pushed her great wet nose under her arm as if in sympathy yeah youd know about men she retorted of all the dumb blondes whos a dumb blonde she hadnt heard him approach he moved like a panther she thought startled he was long and lithe and silent as the night he leaned against her fence and she had to hitch along a bit so he could climb up and sit beside her dumb blonde he said again meet millicent she said dumb adolescent blonde that not a kind thing to say about an obviously sweet cow shes oversexed meg said darkly struggling not to react to the way his body brushed against hers there was plenty of room why did he need to sit so close really it was williams turn to sound startled really so how do you tell if a cow is oversexed she got out of her paddock she explained not only did she get out she got in again we finally found her in our next door neighbours bull paddock now shes pregnant and shes too young to have babies but thats what shes having any day now lettys worried sick whats to worry about we dont know which bull it was you dont know which bull it could have been one of three youre telling me shesloose he demanded and she giggled and swayed on her perch and he put a hand out to steady her he shifted closer and held on around the waist making sure she was secure she waited for him to let her gobut he didnt so tell me all he demanded and she thought do you know what the feel of your arm around my waist is doing to me obviously not or itd be gone in a flash maybe she should tell him or not she had to do something she was getting close to melting here i think youd better let me gomr mcmaster she managed and he did he shifted away a little without comment as if it meant nothing as if holding her hadnt caused him any sort of reaction nothing like the sizzle that had just jolted through her so are we waiting for the baby to be born so we can take dna samples and enforce a paternity suit he asked and they were talking about millicent of course they were maybe not she was totally discombobulated it wasnt just the feel of his arm it was so much more i one of the bulls is a murray grey thats bad if youre a friesian crossed with a jersey its very bad have you ever met a murray grey i cant say i have theyre about half millicents size again shes still underdeveloped if wed found her straight away we could have done something but she got out and we lost her and didnt find her for ages what must have happened was that she got out onto the road wandered along happily we suspect looking for bulls because shes that sort of girl whoever found her must have shooed her through the nearest gate to get her off the roadwhich of course happened to be rod palmers bull paddock there was plenty of feed in the paddock its hilly and mostly out of sight of the road and rod lets his bulls be until he needs them so millicent might have been enjoying herself for quite a while she certainly seemed content when rod finally found her and called us uhoh he said so now so now shes in the house paddock while we wait for the birth signs are any day now i hope to heaven she doesnt drop over christmas because theres no way well get a vet then a thought occurred and she eyed him with hope as well as cars you didnt have a houseful of pets you practised on when you were a kid as well she enquired maybe a cow or two and a resident vet nary a goldfish not even a dog she demanded startled my family dont do pets but you like them just because i patted killer no but you do when were out on site every time we meet a dog you talk to it you should have one and leave him in my manhattan apartment alone for months at a time you have staff is mr himmel still around long gone that was said bleakly and she thoughtdont go there she was pushing past anywhere that was her business move on but move on where move onto where she wanted to go why not soso do you need to go over to jennys again later she managed jennys mickeys to make more phone calls i rang elinor while i was in curalo elinor first name the word hung between them loaded with unknowns leave it she thought but then she thought if she was letty shed ask she swung her legs against the fence rails and tried to look nonchalant as if this was a lightweight question so the gossip rags havent caught up with elinor i hope they never do it was said with such vehemence that she blinked umits serious then he seemed disconcerted but then he shrugged you could say that im sorry youll miss christmas with her then im sorry too he swung himself down from the fence and she knew the question had messed with whatever calm hed been feeling i believe i need to get that carburettor back in without it were dependent on the tractor as emergency transport so im not going to bed before its in working order its okay twenty minutes work tops im not being a martyr he glanced down at his overalls and he smiled with unmistakable allboy satisfaction i havent looked this greasy since i was scotts age it feels great you are great she said as he reached up and took her by the waist and lifted her down to join him he should let her go he didnt so are you uhoh keep it light she told herself keep it light if our office staff could see us now theyd have kittens she managed or a cameraman the paparazzi that was an appalling thought she could see the headlines now mcmaster trapped with secretary in rural hideway what would the unknown elinor say if she saw such a headline does elinor know youre stuck with me he was still holding her she should step awaybut she didnt yes he said she doesnt mind shes upset for me she knows i want to be home for some reason that hurt but she made herself respond thats generous of elinor shes a generous woman what to say to that and he was still holding her ii need to go to bed she managed and she tugged a little but still he didnt release her bed in case you hadnt noticed its nine which is the witching hour when milking starts at five so you dont look forward to your morning milk he teased he was so close she was having trouble making her voice work but she had to try getting up at five ugh she said but while im here its normal for lots of people its normal you get up at five to check on your trade indices all the time you dont mind so what do you want to do at five sleep he smiled then put his head on one side considering so why stay on here youre putting your life on hold for your little brother i havent noticed much lifeholding wheres the social life when you work with me i demand twentyfour seven commitment then you come here and it seems the same milking from five to nine and milking from three to seven wheres time for meg in that he sounded concerned and that disconcerted her hed never sounded concerned their relationship was businesslike it had to stay that way i have wild lunches she told him right he was watching her in a way that disturbed her as if he was trying to figure her out soboyfriend he asked and she winced ouch thatd do as far as personal questions went he set his boundaries shed set hers thats not your territory mr mcmaster she tugged back and this time he did let her go she made to turn away but his next question stopped her do you like working for me that was an easy one i love it why she hesitated he was watching her in the fading light and she knew her answer meant something to him its smart work she said slowly i never know what my days going to hold i need to use my brain and i love it that you treat me like i can like you can what rise to any challenge she managed a smile at that except get you home for christmas he didnt smile back silence the sun had sunk well over the horizon and the light was disappearing fast the night was warm and still millicent was right beside them by the fence oozing the contentment of a soontobe mum who had everything she wanted in life except she didnt have her bull meg thought and then thought what was she thinking her bull bed she said sounds good he said and she blushed and stepped away so fast she tripped on her own feet he put out a hand to catch her but she staggered and grabbed the fence and maintained her distance is there anything else you need she asked stammering i dont believe so he was laughing she thoughtnot obviously but there was laughter behind his eyes so do we have a date with a hundred cows at five in the morning i cant believe you offered to milk it will be my pleasure in lieu of the worlds trade indices in lieu of trade indices he hesitated i really dont mind getting up early he told her if you need to sleep i wish i could milk them for you he was serious yeah well i do have some affection for the cows she managed though its a wonderful offer she took a deep breath as was buying scott the car id like to pay get off your high horse jardine its not my high horse its my dignity she said with as much dignity as she could muster by which i take it that you wont let me in which case im very very grateful so thank you mr mcmaster and goodnight william he said and it was a snap william then she said and met his gaze for as long as she daredwhich wasnt very long at all sleep well he said and before she knew what he was about he reached out and touched her face it was a feather touch a fleeting brush of his finger against her cheek but he might as well have kissed her she raised her hand to her cheek as if hed applied heat maybe he had sleepsleep well yourself she whispered ill see what i can do he said and meg yes thank you for rising to my challenges i appreciate it he was still so close she desperately wanted him to touch her again she stood and stared up at him but there was nothing to say she desperately wanted him to kiss her and where would businesslike be after that goodgoodnight she managed and then she turned and left him standing in the darkness leaning against a pregnant cow she knew that he watched her all the way back to the house he should move he still had to get the carburettor in and he did have to get up at the same time as she did instead he watched megs retreating figure and when she disappeared he stood and stared at the darkened house lit only by its ridiculous decorations santas legs were lurching at an even more alarming rate that was the mornings job he decided hed do it after milking then hed replace lettys exhaust pipe then hed help scott with the mini he was looking forward to each of them so much for feeling trapped this was a weird sensation the mcmaster family business a vast mining conglomerate had been founded by his grandfather williams father hadnt wanted to go near the business his grandfather however had found his retiring grandson to be intelligent and biddable and hed thrown william in at the deep end that had been okay by william he enjoyed the cut and thrust of the business world and in a way it made up for the lack of affection in his family his grandfather had approved of him when he was doing well for the company and on his grandfathers death hed simply kept on with what he was good at that was what the world expected it was what he expected of himself but here hed forgotten how much he loved pulling a car apart hed loved his time with scott as hed love returning to manhattan he reminded himself when he finally arrived at elinors apartment his reception would be just as crazy as megs had been or maybe not quite he conceded ned was six years old and his little sister was four they could bounce but they didnt quite equate to a fivedog pack a grandma and a brother and elinor her smile would be as warm as it was possible for a smile to be but elinor was a sixtytwoyearold foster mother and she welcomed the world like letty like meg too no dont think about meg he told himself its making you crazy meg was his pa he was leaving in two days and he did not want to mess with their employeremployee relationship the problem was though that he was no longer able to think of her purely as his employee hed called her meg dont think about her he told himself again sharply as he headed for the shed think about people he could justifiably be attached to like elinor elinor expected nothing which was just the way he liked it hed been introduced to elinor two years back at the launch of new yorks fosterfriends programme the programme was designed to give support to those who put their lives on hold for kids in need hed been approached to be a sponsor hed met elinor at the launch and hed been sucked right in by her commitment elinor was everything he wasntwarm devoted and passionate about pip and ned the two kids in her care tentatively hed suggested helping a little himself parttime commitment walking away when he needed to it soundedfeasible im not often available hed said and elinor had beamed as if he were promising the world anythings better than what these two have been getting up to now shed said simply it breaks my heart their mama wont put them up for adoption and they so need a papa you come when you can and you leave the rest to me the thought of letting them down at christmas had made him feel ill but elinors bighearted wisdom had come straight back at him i have a turkey we have candy and paper lanterns and a tree were going out today to see the fancy shop windows and then the kids are visiting santa you get home when you can and well love to see you but dont you worry about us mr mcmaster well do fine the relationship suited him fine elinor didnt depend on him she gave her heart to the kids as meg had given her heart to her half brother and to a woman who wasnt really her grandmother meg was a giver his cool clinical pa was just like elinor and for some reason the thought had the capacity to scare him why he didnt want to think about why he reached the shed but he paused before flicking on the lights and going inside he glanced back at the housewhere meg was dont think about meg those santa legs were getting on his nerves maybe he should try and fix them now and fall off the roof in the dark theyd find him tomorrow tangled in flashing christmas lights a cloud of selfpity hanging round his head so maybe youd better go to bed and stop thinking about fixing things he told himself things plural what else needed to be fixed lettys car the mini and santas legs he said out loud what else is there why would i want anything in my world to change what indeed the santa legs were seriously disconcerting he turned his gaze upward where a million stars hung in the sky brighter than hed ever seen them there are too many stars out here he told himself they make a man disoriented the worlds the wrong way up ive had enough he flicked on the lights and went inside but outside he knew the stars stayed hanging still the wrong way up theyd be the wrong way up until he could get out of here which should be soon which had to be soon because he was having trouble remembering what the right way up looked like she lay in her bed and she thoughti am in so much trouble her boss wore jeans he looked great with greasy hands he smiled at her do not fall in love with your boss how not to its simply a crush she told herself desperately hes been touted as one of the most eligible bachelors in the world when he finally smiles at you like youre a womanlike youre a friendof course youre going to fall for him any woman would so any woman must not make a fool of herself any woman had to remember that he moved in a different world to hers that he was in australia for three months of the year at the most and the rest he was with a woman called elinor in manhattan she so badly wanted the internet she wanted to check out any rumours w s mcmaster and a woman called elinor you have it bad she told the ceiling and when the door wobbled a little bit on its hinges and slowly opened she almost stopped breathing was it killer her dog had obviously decided his duty was with her rather than as one of scottys pack he nosed her hand and then climbed laboriously up onto her bed making hard work out of what was for killer hardly a step your mistress is in trouble she told him and he whumped down on top of her and she had to shove him away a bit so she could breathe he promptly turned and tried to lick her okay youre the only man in my life and if i was to think about admitting another one another lick this time longer yeah no room youre right forget it we have to go to sleep theres milking in the morning and tomorrow its christmas eve she hadnt written her santa list the thought came from nowhere as a little girl that was the major job before christmas in truth as a child shed usually started her santa list in november well its no use asking for what i want now she told killer and then she heard what shed said and she winced but it was true she did want it me and every single woman in the known universe she muttered especially someone called elinor killer get off me and let me go to sleep she thought elinor was his woman he lay and stared up at the attic ceiling and thought through the events of the dayand that was the fact that stood out he hadnt lied to her but he had let her think defence he told the darkness and thoughthow conceited was that as if she was going to jump him hed had women trying to jump him before he knew how to defend himself he wasnt the least worried about meg overstepping the line the line meg see there was the problem he told himself hed let himself call her meg hed let himself think about her as meg she was his employee his wonderful efficient pa all he had to do was go back to thinking of her as miss jardine and all would be well but shed felt and there was another problem he could give his head all the orders he liked but his body was another matter entirely when hed tugged her down from the fence shed fallen against him her body had felt soft pliable curving into him even if only for a fraction of a second before shed tugged away and she smelled of something he couldnt identify not perfume he thought and he knew most but something else citrusy clean shed spent most of the day surrounded by cows how could she smell clean she did and this wasnt getting him anywhere he needed to sleep he had a big day tomorrow milking cows fixing things trying not to think about meg miss jardine why not think of her it was a tiny voice insidious starting from nowhere because you dont the thought of hannah was suddenly with him hannah holding him loving him and suddenlynot there the pain had been unbelievable his world was hard he had no illusions as to what wealth could do to people marriages relationships wealth had destroyed his parents turned them into something ugly surrounded by sycophants in their old age it took enormous selfcontrol to stop himself from being sucked down the same path and he had no idea how to cope with an emotional connection it didnt matter his work was satisfying his life was satisfying and if there were spaceselinor and the kids were enough they took what he had to give maybe meg dont even go there he said savagely into the night youre not as selfish as that she deserves so much more chapter six it took meg a while to wake up on milking mornings she liked working in silence for the first half hour or so and that suited the cows they usually seemed to be half asleep too ridding themselves of their load of milk before getting on with their daily task of grazing snoozing and making more but eventually meg woke up whether she was working with letty or kerrie by the time milking ended she usually had the radio on she was chatting to whoever was around singing along with the radio even the cows seemed more cheerful but not this morning her boss seemed to have left his bed on the wrong side he worked methodically swabbing attaching cups releasing cows from the bales but answering any ventured conversation with monosyllables yes no and nothing more was forthcoming it was probably for the best meg decided as they worked on yesterday had threatened to get out of hand she wasnt quite sure what it was that was getting out of hand but whatever it was scared her she knew enough to retreat now into her own world and let w s mcmaster get on with his it was disconcerting though with milking finished william handled the hose with none of yesterdays enjoyment she found herself getting irritated and when craig arrived to pick up the milk and gestured towards william and said so whos the boyfriend she was able to shake her head without even raising colour whod want someone like this for a boyfriend hes someone i work with hes stuck here because of the airline strike and he bought the kid the minis it seemed the whole district knew about the minis craigs son had been under the car pile last night and would be back here this morning yeah good move he said approvingly he glanced across at william obviously aching to talk cars but william was concentrating on getting the yard hosed and nothing was distracting him seemed happier yesterday he noted hes homesick wife kids no then whats he whinging about craig demanded he yelled over to william hey will merry christmas theres no dairy pickup tomorrow so have a good one william raised a hand in a slight salute and went on hosing craig departed and meg surveyed her boss carefully weve offended you he shrugged oh enough its christmas eve she said lighten up ill finish here you go do something else dont you have to stuff a turkey or something right she said and stalked out of the yard really irritated now she was hungry shed intended to wait for william before she ate breakfast but he could eat his toast alone she detoured via millicent and that made her pause millicent was standing in the middle of the home paddock her back arched a little and her tail held high uhoh when meg slipped through the rails and crossed to check the cow relaxed and let meg rub her nose but meg thought the calf would be here soon today or tomorrow here was another factor to complicate her christmas letty would worry all day every now and then a cow came along you got fond of millicent was one of those born after a difficult labour shed been a weakling calf a hardheaded dairy farmer would have sold her straight away letty however had argued the pros and cons with herself for a week while tending to her like a human baby and after a week shed decided she had potential shed named her before shed decided to name the rest of the herd and shed been gutted when shed been lost finding her had been a joy so lets do this right for letty meg told her and went and fetched her a bucket of chaff and shooed her closer to the trough no complications for christmas there was nothing more she could do now though labour in cows didnt require a support person at least in the early stages breakfast hunger and dont think about william she told herself he was yet another complication she didnt need and then a scream split the morning a scream so high and terrified megs heart seemed to stop she forgot all about william forgot about millicents complications and she started to run the concrete was as clean as he could make it no speck of dirt was escaping his eagle eye this morning and he finally turned off the tap with regret move on to the next thing fast he thought he had today and tomorrow to get through while keeping things businesslike meg would be in the kitchen having breakfast yesterday hed watched her eat toast before yesterday hed never watched her eat toast yes he travelled with her often but when he did he ordered breakfast in his room he wasted less time that way but yesterday hed decided he liked watching her eat breakfast dumb or not it wasnt a bad way to waste time a man could waste a lot of time watching meg and that was exactly what he was trying not to think he wound the hose back onto the reel with more force than was necessary and thought hed see if scott was in the shed yet it was after eight he could talk to scott for a while and then maybe meg would be finished in the kitchen what sort of coward was he what was to be afraid of watching meg eat toast meg miss jardine meg he sighed and ran his hand through his hair two days he could do this he turned towards the house irritated with himself all this needed was a bit of discipline containment and thena scream forget containment he ran it was letty where where as meg neared the house letty screamed again dear god she was high up on the roof right by the santa chimney had she been trying to fix him but now wasnt the time for questions letty was dangling from the ridge tiny and frail and in deadly peril the roof had two inclines the main one steep enough but the attic gable rising even more steeply the roof was old the iron was rusting and the capping on the high ridge had given way or was giving way it hadnt given completely it was all that was holding letty up scotty burst out of the house as meg arrived grandma shes on the roof the capping tore again just a little iron scraping on iron letty lurched downward but somehow still held grandma scott screamed his voice breaking in terror hang on meg was too busy to scream how had she climbed the ladder where by the gate but then william was beside her reaching the ladder before she did hold it he snapped scott hold the other side the capping tore more and letty lurched again letty hold on william ordered her in a voice that brooked no argument fingernails if you must but do not let go im coming hhurry he was already climbing keep still how could you defy that voice why would you nobody moved meg and scott held to the ladder as if their lives depended on it their lives didnt lettys did and so did williams the roof was high pitched curved dangerous and the ladder only reached part way to the top ridge william clambered over the main eaves as if they werent there it was impossible to climb further meg thought numbly from underneath the second gable was far too steepbut somehow william was doing it youll fall she faltered not me he said finding footholds she knew couldnt exist mountaineering basic skills for your modern businessman watch and wonder she watched and yes she wondered but it wasnt admiration she was feeling it was blind terror please please and then somehow unbelievably william was on the upper ridge edging himself toward letty santas sleigh was between them he shoved it tumbled back behind the house and no one noticed its going he edged closercloserwhile below him meg and scott forgot to breathe hed reached her he was steadying stabilising himself over the ridge grasping lettys wrists and holding he had her dont move just lie limp and let me pull you up scotty choked on a sob meg gripped his hand and held taking comfort as well as giving it letty wasnt safe yet william was still balanced on a ridge with an already broken capping the ladder only reached to the eaves of the main roof so what now william might be able to climb up like a cat burglar it was impossible that he climb down holding letty meg yyes i cant get us down he told her not the way i came up if i overbalance well both go she knew it they needed the fire brigade she thought they needed help they had no phone the nearest neighbour was a mile away but william already knew that im buying you a satellite phone for christmas he muttered if it costs a million bucks youre still having one he had letty solidly under the arms now and was hauling her upward like a limp doll so letty are you going to argue nno good woman one last heave and he had her on the ridge into his arms she was safe meg thought orsafeish with the capping gone the whole attic roof looked unstable but at least letty was no longer dangling but her wrist looked hurt she could see a crimson stain from here she was losing blood william was inching backward along the ridge heading for the chimney he could lean on the bricks safeish was turning to safe sort of until he came to get her down this cuts not looking good he said almost conversationally and meg thought he was trying not to scare letty but she knew this voice it meant he wanted action fast he tugged letty hard against him leaned back against the chimney to make them both stable then ripped the sleeve from his overalls as if it was gauze instead of industrialstrength cotton he wound the fabric round her arm and held her close so how did you get up here he asked letty didnt answer not a good sign he stared downward seemingly as mystified as meg that letty could have scrambled up the way he had seemed incredible theretheres another ladder scott ventured he was shaking and megs hand firmed over his another ladder when i put the sleigh up i used two you used two it fell letty muttered her voice barely above a whisper as i reached the top i grabbed but it went and then i grabbed the capping meg was no longer listening she was searching the undergrowth and here it was another ladder buried behind the banksias scott and letty had both climbed up on this ancient roof using two ladders alone were they out of their minds she shouldnt have left them she shouldve been here she should just get a grip she told herself blame needed to wait ill get the ladder back up she called to william hold on there was no time for hesitation she moved the main ladder along the wall so it was wedged against the yard gate so scott could hold it steady by himself then she headed up tugging the smaller ladder with her meg william sounded appalled what do you think youre doing scotts done it lettys done it if all of my stupid family is intent on self destruction i might as well join them theres no alternative there wasnt he knew there wasnt you fall and youre fired he snapped thats right resort to threats under pressure you fall and i quit she snapped back and caught the flash of a rueful smile but how had letty and scotty done this she thought as she struggled upward theyd climbed the first ladder dragging the next each doing it alone shed looked at santas legs last night and shed thought the same as letty obviously hadthat shed have a go at fixing him but letty was in her seventies and that scott could have tried with his leg in a brace she shuddered and she paused half way up the ladder you can do it william said strongly and she looked up and met his gaze and took a deep breath during the years shed worked for william shed been given the most extraordinary orders shed done the most extraordinary things you can do it she loved working for william you fall and youre fired what did he think she was a wuss she climbed on she reached the first eave she balanced herself took a deep breath and swung the second ladder up to the next eave no william said no it wont hold he sounded calm now back in control hed obviously been using the time while she struggled to think the scenario through i can see where it fell the gutterings broken and theres no guarantee it wont break again youll need to lie a plank along its length so the ladders weights on half a dozen fastenings instead of one ill get a plank scott said scott williams voice would have stopped an army what let that ladder go before your sisters down and youre fired too meg leave the ladder where it is and go find the plank with scott you do this together my way or not at all meg looked at her boss he looked straight back lets do what the man says she told her little brother hes the boss they found a beam ten foot long scott heaved from below and she tugged she laid it along the length of guttering she shifted the second ladder so it was balanced on the midpoint and it was as safe as they could make it done all william had to do was edge letty back along the ridgeand let meg take her down you cant williams voice was agonised as they faced this final step but he knew the facts meg was five foot five he was six feet two he weighed at least forty pounds more than she did everything depended on the guttering holding letty couldnt climb herself it was meg whod support letty on the way down slowly william edged back along the ridge lifting letty a little at each move she was so limp meg thought she couldnt get her down if she lost consciousness but im saving my strength letty whispered youre a woman with intelligence as well as courage william said and he met megs gaze and she thought she thought yeah well there wasnt a lot of use going down that path of all the inappropriate things to think right now he looked lean and mean and dangerous he had torn overalls bloodstained chest one arm bared his expression was grim and focussed he was totally intent on what he was doing he looked he looked she knew how he looked she also knew how he was making her feel and somehow it made things scarier that shed decided she loved a man who was balanced on a crumbling ridge with her injured grandmother in his arms and her little brother underneath and if they fell umget a grip she gripped william was moving so slowly there was no risk of him overbalancing he was shifting letty a few inches at a time the wait was interminable i have you steady it was scott from underneath them hed climbed the first ladder and was holding the second this was saferexcept it meant scotty was right beneath her scott she started and she knew her voice quavered scotts fine no ones going to fall william said it was his no ones going home until this is sorted voice meg blinked okay she couldnt defy him on this one letty you need to trust us all william said meg will catch your legs while you find a footing on the ladder shell be right under you pressing you into the rungs youll hold as best you can with one hand thats all youll need meg will be guiding your feet holding you firm dont release the first rung until you feel totally stable stable enough to reach under for the next if you cant do it then stop until you feel you can theres no rush we have all the time in the world all the time in the world except letty looked dreadful if she fainted if she fainted then meg would catch her and hold her and somehow get her down no ones going to fall the guy in the bloodstained overalls had said so as soon as you have her ill slide down the ridge the way i came up william said ill be beneath you what slide and jump meg retorted you want a broken leg scottys underneath and hell do any catching i will scott said and meg looked up and met williams gaze and saw agony william mcmaster depended on no one for him to depend on a kid like scott no choice no ones going to fall and somehow no one did somehow william got a limp and trembling letty onto megs ladder somehow meg held her guiding her every step of the way somehow they climbed down rung after rung women are awesome letty muttered as they reached the lower guttering and manoeuvred across to the next ladder meg even managed a smile you bet you ready for the next bit grandma bring it on lettys voice might be a thready whisper but her spirit was indomitable and then it was done as they reached the ground letty sagged but scott was there it was scott who lifted his grandmother from the ladder he had his grandma in his arms and then meg was there too hugging them both and william was down as well he stood back and meg saw him over lettys head and she reached out and tugged him in as well her big bloodstained hero her boss william they hugged together sandwich squeeze shed called this when she was little when the family was celebrating or something dreadful had happened or sometimes simply because they could because they were family and this felt the same it felt family except william wasnt she knew he wasnt so it shouldnt hurt when he was the first to pull away it did even though he must lets have a look at that arm william said in a voice that was none too steady and she knew he was feeling the whole gamut of emotions she was feeling only maybe not the family one there was a woman called elinor lettys knees had given completely scott brought cushions and blankets while meg and william assessed the damage as best they could lettys arm was bound tightly with williams sleeve but the crimson bloom was spreading i dont think we should disturb it william said wheres the nearest hospital im not going to hospital letty quavered and for an answer william simply scooped her up blankets and all car keys he snapped at meg you sit in the back seat with your grandmother scott are you coming someone had turned into the drive mickey and his dad meg thought recognising the car come to play with the minis maybemaybe i should stay scott managed and then tried to get his voice down a quaver or two imickey can help me clean up that letty hadnt squeaked a second protest was scary but william had her in his arms heading for the car and meg could spare a moment to think things through scott loathed hospitals for good reason she could see he was torn she needed to give him a reason to stay and she had one one pregnant cow i need you to keep an eye on millicent she said why shes showing the first signs of calving my millicent letty squeaked over williams shoulder your millicent meg retorted whos staying in the care of your grandson and mickey and mickeys dad theres two for you and three for millicent so whos arguing grandma no ones arguing william said lets go chapter seven the gash on her arm was deep and jagged the doctors wanted to keep letty in overnight an option she wouldnt consider just pull it together and let me go i have a turkey to stuff finally they conceded that she could go home but only after they were sure she was okay shes lost a lot of blood shes elderly and shes shocked the doctor on duty told them as they wheeled her off to theatre well tie her down for a couple of hours to make sure there arent complications can you wait we can wait william said and he and meg went to sit in the waiting room meg picked up a glossy magazine and stared sightlessly at its pages he shouldnt go near her william decided her hands were still shaking how could he not go to her he moved to the seat next to hers and touched her hand she put her magazine down and blinked back tears so much for not going near her he put his arm round her and tugged her close her whole body was shaking its okay baby its okay im not she gulped and tried to pull away im not bbaby miss jardine its okay he said and pulled her closer still that brought a chuckle but a watery one she sniffed and reached for a tissue in her overalls pocket she blew her nose hard and he thought how could he go back to calling her miss jardine this wasnt his superefficient pa this was someone he no longer knew or maybe maybe it was just that he hadnt known his superefficient pa because it was starting to feel as if he did know this woman and he wanted to know more ifif the paparazzi could see us now she muttered and he winced what a thing to think theyd come straight from the cow yard theyd been filthy to begin with and lettys blood had added a layer that was truly appalling i think the chances of me being recognised are about zip he said were safe we are she whispered thanks to you how did you ever get up on that roof i have skills you cant even begin to imagine he said trying to make her smile can you fix santa when we get home what he looked at her and discovered she was smilingshe was joking she was still shaking but there was no way she was sinking into selfpity i have a better idea he said unsteadily lets toss a grenade into the fireplace and blast him right out of there all ive seen so far have been legs a life without a head cant be all that satisfying lets put him out of his misery she choked on something that could be a bubble of laughter or it could be tears he couldnt decide which and he hugged her closer and he simply held eventually the tremors stopped he didnt let her go though it felt okay to sit here and hold heras if he had the right did he want the right what sort of dumb thing was that to think the shock of the morning must be getting to him she felt right he thought holding her felt right but then a nurse came through the door and said miss jardine and he was no longer holding her his side felt cold without her there yes meg was still frightened he thought shed risen to face the nurse as if she was bracing for the worst shed seen the worst he thought shed have been here when her mother and stepfather were killed when scotty had been so appallingly injured she knew what happened when you let people get close he rose and stood beside her and held her as the nurse approached but it was okay your brothers on the phone the nurse said he watched as she took a deep steadying breath and nodded and moved away from the support of his arm and walked across to the nurses station to take the call he watched her as she spoke she seemed totally unconscious of how she looked how many women did he know who could be so unaware of what they were wearing his comment about her clothes had made her smile but she certainly wasnt thinking about them he watched her talk he watched her as she replaced the receiver he watched the quiet dignity as she thanked the nurse he watched her walk back to him and he thought shes a woman in a million a woman to change your life plans for how crazy a thought was that our phones back on she told him it came back on just after we left the line must be mended mickeys mum and dad are both there now and jennys stuffing our turkey and making brandy sauce millicents calving hasnt progressed any furtherian thinks the calfs a while off the boys are playing with the cars jennys called in the neighbours and three men are up on the roof putting tarpaulins over the capping in case theres rain before we can get a builder in oh and theyve fixed santa claus theyve fixed but his sleighs broken beyond repair theres nothing they can do about that so santas escape routes gone were stuck with him she was smiling now though her smile was a bit watery hooray he said faintly and he couldnt keep his gaze from her face why hadnt he realised just how beautiful she was hed been blind hooray at last she repeated and her voice softened its all okay again i have help scott says theres no rush to get home christmas is back on track andand its thanks to you she said and choked a bit again you saved letty you saved us theres no need for hyperbole he said embarrassed you did some saving as well theres no way i would have got up on that roof in time to stop her falling you dont know what you can do until you must indeed you dont she said and her eyes were shining and she was close enough to touch close enough to she backed away as if suddenly something had touched her reminded her i thats all i wanted to say she faltered was it all he wanted to say he wanted more he wanted to kiss her in the middle of the emergency waiting room with patients medics relatives everywhere he definitely wanted to kiss her no she said and he met her gaze with a jolt of shock of course this woman was seriously good she anticipated his needs that was what he paid her for shed anticipated this one and she was refusing i i dont think we need to stay here she managed she glanced at her watch and that tiny movement put more distance between them it made what he wanted to do even more impossible we should do something while we wait go down and look at the sea how about shopping he suggested i checked yesterdayevery shop in the city will be open today youre joking she said startled walk through the christmas crowds looking like this we look like something out of chainsaw massacre hence my shopping plan are you hungry her eyes widened at that as if remembering something important yes she said yes i am whatever happened to breakfast he grinned i guess its still waiting beside the toaster at home home the word seemed to jar and he corrected himself back at the farm we could grab a sandwich at the hospital cafeteria i guess there is a hospital cafeteria i refuse to have hospital sandwiches on christmas eve what i suggest here we go what what you suggest whats wrong with that its just what i suggest is mcmaster for whats going to happen im open to discussion he said wounded and she was smiling again more she was laughing at him it was such a weird sensation that he felt winded no one laughed at him he kind ofliked it he grinned and she grinned back and suddenly there was such a frisson of tension between them that if a nurse hadnt approached he would have thrown reserve caution sense to the wind and taken her in his arms and kissed her right on the spot he still mightbut the nurse was walking right up to them speaking to meg but glancing at him as if he was included in this too almost as if he was family the stitchings done she said the doctors used a very light general anaestheticthey thought it was more appropriate given how shocked she isand were popping in a little plasma to get her blood pressure up faster i suspect shell sleep for two hours at least can you give us that time before you take her home yes william said before meg could answer yes we can he glanced at his cellphone and smiled hey i have reception ill give you my number can you ring us when she wakes meanwhile i suggest miss jardine and i find something decent to wear and then eat and if i want hospital sandwiches meg muttered but she was smiling too im your boss he said that has to count for something it counted for a lot and so did money meg was simply led by williams suggestions first he took her to what the nurse had told him when hed enquired was the classiest clothes shop in town she needs a frock william said to the bemused assistant or more i suggest she buys three and everything that goes with them shoes whatever he laid his credit card on the counter whatever it takes this feels like pretty woman meg muttered im not for sale im not buying she met his gaze something passed between them changed im not buying of course he wasnt meg thought he had elinor and women of her ilk he escorted women from the pages of glamour magazines and again he knew what she was thinking youre my pa he said his tone softening nothing more dont get any ideas jardine its just that i dont like my pa in bloodspattered overalls he sounded suddenly formal and she shivered the warmth that had been growing inside the comfort shed felt as hed held her the bud of an idea shrivelled the idea had been stupidbut she had to move on and i dont like my boss in bloodspattered overalls she managed and tilted her chin which is why im heading to the place scott showed me yesterday to buy even more jeans he said so ill leave you to it no shaking while im gone everythings fine and before she could guess what he intended he took her hands tugged her towards him and kissed her lightly on the lips only it wasnt how she wanted to be kissed it was back to where shed started it was a pretty woman kind of kiss take my plastic and buy what you need ill comfort you and care for you because youre part of my entourage dont look like that miss jardine he said softly im not buying your soul im only returning you to respectability meg she said and if she sounded forlorn she couldnt help it i believe it should be miss jardine willie she snapped and before he could guess what she intended back she grabbed his hands tugged him toward her and kissed him as well harder defiant willie she said again and glowered his lips twitched there was laughter behind his eyes and admiration and something more something quickly quelled something he didnt want to admit no matter it was gone he was gone and she was left with his plastic wow the sales assistant breathed as he disappeared into the crowd of last minute christmas shoppers i wish my boyfriend would do something like this hes not my boyfriend oh but hes gorgeous in bloodstained overalls hed be gorgeous in anything the girl breathed oh miss oh lets find you the prettiest dress in the shop with a guy like that letting you use his credit card you want to be gorgeous with a guy like that i should wear a faded bag over my head meg muttered but the sales assistant was already hauling out offerings she should not accept his money but i suggest this was w s mcmaster talking her boss giving orders if she put things back on their rightful footing shed accept miss jardine would accept it was only meg who was having stupid quibbles show me what you have she said resigned two more days of autocracy and hed be gone or sooner she should check the news on the air strike why didnt she want to what about this the sales assistant asked and held up a dress that made her gasp it was pretty in the real sense of the word it was a nineteenfifties halter neck cinchwaisted frock with a full circled skirt it was white with red dots it was young frivolous and so far away from what meg always wore that she shook her head before she thought about it she wore sensible black skirts and white shirts or she wore overalls or she wore jeans and somewhere at home she had a pale grey skirt for church and funerals she did not wear polka dots something sensible she said its christmas the girl said and then she looked at megs overalls andexcuse me for asking but that looks bad it nearly was bad so it could have been bad the girl said and meg realised she was in the hands of a master saleswoman and if it had been youd never have got the chance to wear polka dots and he she looked meaningfully in the direction william had gone would never have seen you in polka dots perish the thought meg said trying to sound sarcastic but it didnt come off so will you try it no meg thought but she couldnt say it she looked at the dress and then she also glanced in the direction william had gone she could no longer see him hed be back tomorrow or the next day hed be gone what the heck it was his plastic i suggest she was merely following her bosss orders only he no longer felt like her boss he felt like something else completely so did she she stared into the mirror and saw the woman shed been two days ago behind the woman she was now and she thought of the impossibility of going back to what she had been ill be one of those elderly secretaries she thought totally devoted to the boss taking whatever hell give good morning mr mcmaster of course ill take dictation certainly ill send flowers to sarah i suggest tiger lilies because theyre what the gossip columnists say is her favourite flower meanwhile meanwhile scotty had climbed on the roof to put santa up himself and letty had tried to fix it if shed had a regular job where she could go home every night shed told herself this was better working twentyfour seven for short bursts and then staying home shed loved twentyfour seven she loved working for w s mcmaster but now now shed seen william clinging to the roof holding her grandma now william had held her at the hospital and shed needed him to hold her two days ago shed been able to draw a linethat life this life the lines had blurred and it frightened her decisiveness had always been her strong point she didnt have to like it but she knew when a decision had to be made she made one now oh but it hurt she took a deep breath she glanced once more in the direction william had gone before he came back she had to find some resolution she took the polka dots and disappeared into the changing roomto change she was wearing polka dots hed left her wearing bloodied overalls and truly disgusting boots she was now wearing what could only be described as a happy dress a christmas dress her boots had been replaced with white strappy stilettos and her hair caught back with an elastic band while shed done the milking was now a riot of bouncing curls caught on the side with a tiny red rosette she looked about ten years younger she looked breathtakingly lovely meg was gazing into the mirror as if she too hardly recognised herself she met his reflected gaze and turned slowly to face him and he thought if he hadnt caught her in this she might have fled and taken it off itsits silly she said its lovely the shop assistant said definitely weve found two more that are just as pretty only she wont buy three shes reluctant to buy even this one but i persuaded her to try it on again with shoes well done he said walking closer i can see it needs shoes its silly meg said again its not william said somehow managing to smile at the shop assistant without taking his eyes off meg you look lovely she flushed i feel like something out of hollywood great things come out of hollywood well take it he still hadnt taken his eyes from her and the other two wrap the others shell leave this one on william say yes mr mcmaster no youre intending to go to a classy restaurant wearing overalls im not going to any classy restaurant her new resolution hadnt included socialising shed have a sandwich on the run and then go back to the hospital then shed get through christmas shed tell him her decision as she put him on the flight back to new york a withered spinster gazing adoringly after her boss she hauled the conjured vision back into her head and held on to it her decision was right no matter how much it hurt she had to move forward but he was still thinking restaurants of course we need to go to a restaurant he said sounding wounded ive bought new clothes too so were both dressed up you like my chinos he was smiling at her oh that smile theyre fine but hey i said youre lovely okay youre lovely too she muttered but we dont need to match better that we dont i think he said softly but well buy the dresses anyway chapter eight meg walked out of the shop feeling as if she were in a freezeframe from a fifties movie william put his hand in the small of her back to guide her through the crush of shoppers and the feeling of unreality deepened dont think about it he said obviously sensing how selfconscious she felt the crowds were looking when you were covered in blood theyre still looking but now theyre smiling lets concentrate on the important things like breakfast shed given up fighting a sandwich on the run felt good but anything would do she was so hungry she was likely to keel over if he had to take her to a restaurant then so be it yes please she said expecting him to take her into one of the small local restaurants but instead he ushered her back into the carhow did this man manage to get a park when the whole world was looking for a park todayand she almost groaned she wanted to eat now but shed worked for too long for this man to complain when meals took too long coming so she stifled her groan and folded her hands in her lap and thought she looked ridiculous she should be smiling and waving but then they should be driving an expensive sports car instead of lettys farm wagon at least the silencer was fixed she thought and then she saw where they were going and she forgot about anything else he was driving up to the cliff above the town he was taking her to the most expensive restaurant in the district shed never been here this place is oh its where you go to celebrate wedding anniversaries when youre rich they dont do breakfast she breathed they do today i rang them i spoke to the chef personally bacon and eggs and fried bread and strawberries and fresh juice and sourdough toast and homemade butter we had a long discussion anything we want we can have if we pay if i pay he said gently and he was out of the car striding round to her side and handing her out as if she was one of his dates instead of miss jardine his pa he never handed her out of his car he opened doors for her the natural courtesy of a polite man but to walk around and help her out of the car no she was his employee and the extra cosseting was reserved forhis women she no longer fitted either category she thought as she brushed past him and his touch made her feel even more as if this was not real it was something out of a movie the lines were blurring but if the lines were blurring the question was huge and for some reason it was drumming in her headinsistent urgent there was never going to be a good time to askso why not now whos elinor she asked and he looked at her for a long moment and then smiled and shrugged and led her inside maybe the lines were blurring for him too she thought and then she thought all the more reason why her decision was the only possible one ill tell you over breakfast he said simply and she knew she was right the restaurant was almost empty this place started lunch at what it deemed a respectable hour and this didnt quite qualify maybe they wouldnt have taken his booking if he hadntthrown his credit card around thrown his name around youll have the paparazzi in your face before you know it she said darkly and he shook his head you think the paparazzi has nothing better to do on christmas eve than take photos of me im lowkey in the celebrity world he was she thought but only because he created little stir he didnt do the society thing even though his name was known worldwide for the most part he deliberately kept away from cameras he was seen in the celebrity magazines stepping back into the shadows as his woman of the moment smiled and posed if the women he escorted started to like the limelight too much he moved on was this why she hadnt heard of elinor until now did the woman have sense enough to stay low profile she shouldnt have asked she had no business asking she really wanted to know the head waiter was leading them to what must surely be the best table in the house in an alcove which gave a semblance of privacy but where the view stretched away across the ocean as far as the eye could see there were windsurfers on the waves below them meg thought suddenly how long had it been since shed swum their farm was almost an hours drive from the sea there was never any time to indulge in anything so frivolous maybe when she changed jobs the thought was inexorably bleak eggs and bacon and toast and fruit and juice and coffee william said to the waiter any way you want to serve them as long as it starts coming fast is that okay with you miss jardine miss jardine it sounded wrong maybe it sounded wrong to william too because he was frowning yes wonderful she managed the waiter sailed off as if hed just been given an order which was a triumph of creation all on its ownhow much had william paid to get this table to get a breakfast menu to simply be here to take his woman somewhere beautiful she was not his woman neither was she miss jardine deep breath just do it mr mcmaster this might not be the time to tell you but i think i should she said and she faltered was she mad yes she was she knew it but she still knew that she had no choice i need to resign william had glanced out to sea as a windsurfer wiped out in spectacular fashion he turned back to face her and his expression had stilled resign ill train my replacement she said hurriedly i wont leave you without anyone but youre going back to the states anyway if youre gone for a couple for months ill have someone sorted before you return ill work side by side with her then for a couple of weeks until im sure youre happy but i hire my own pas he snapped so you do then please you need to find my replacement can i ask why there was the question a thousand answers crowded in but he was watching her faceand this was william no this was w s mcmasterand she knew him and he knew her and only honesty would do the work we dowe need to travel side by side we need to be totally dependent on each other but we need to stay detached today up on the roof i got undetached meaning meaning i dont think of you as mr mcmaster any more i think of you as the man who saved my grandma his gaze didnt leave her face so take a pay cut he said at last i dont see how abandoning me is showing your gratitude you know what i mean he did she saw a flicker behind his eyes that might almost be read as pain if she didnt know how aloof this man was how he stood apart theres no need to leave i think there is youre under contract he snapped no she met his gaze calmly hoping he couldnt guess the tumult behind her words my contracts up for renewal it expires next month youre responsible for keeping contracts up to date so i am so i have my contract expires its not to be renewed so we move on so you tell me now he snapped and you expect us to calmly go on sharing christmas when you no longer work for me she flinched but there was no avoiding what needed to be said she knew him well enough now to accept the only way forward was honesty its the only way i can go on sharing christmas she said simply feeling the way i do feeling like youre not my boss any more this is nonsense its not nonsense she said stubbornly im sorry but there it is ive quit if you want me to keep working until you get a replacement that means youll still be working over christmas im returning my christmas bonus she glanced down at her dress ill take these in the form of severance pay you wont be out of pocket what nonsense is this you cant afford the grand gesture its not a grand gesture she said stiffly its what i need to do i cant afford not to whats that supposed to mean it means not everythings about money she hesitated whos elinor she asked again and his brows snapped down in a sharp dark line of anger is that what this is about you mean am i your pa jealous of a woman called elinor she managed a smile at that one of course im not all im saying is that the lines between personal and professional have been blurred last week i wouldnt have dared ask that questioni wouldnt want to however suddenly i want to know why you never had a dog when you were a kid i want to know how you learned to climb when you were a boy and yes i do want to know about elinor she hesitated maybe this cant make sense to you but a week ago i didnt mindthat you seemed aloof and a bitunhappy im not unhappy he said startled and she thought about it okay not unhappy she conceded wrong word but i dont know what the word is justholding yourself tight against the world when letting the world in could make you happy and he got it just like that like caring about scott and letty like caring about scott and letty and if anything happens to them then my world falls apart then thats dumb you cant afford to think like that why not thats all there is emotional nonsense so whos elinor its none of your business its not she agreed and as my boss you can tell me to mind my own as a casual acquaintance you can tell me that as well but now im your hostess for christmas and you saved my grandmas life so i owe you and you owe me and i really want to know that theres someone in your life who can take that horrid reserved look away from your face he stared at her nonplussed she managed to meet his gaze and hold this wasnt just about her she thought there was something she had to reachsomething it was important to reach hed saved letty she owed it to him to try but then breakfast arrived the smell reached her before the meal wafting across the room as a delicious tantalising siren call a couple of early lunch diners were being ushered to their tables she saw their noses wrinkle with appreciation and she thoughtmine hands off she turned back to william and the same thought flickered mine only it was a stupid stupid thought it was why she had to get out maybe she didnt want to know who elinor was personal or not boss orfriendshe didnt have the right but she wasnt retracting and her question hung and it seemed hed decided to tell her the meal was set before them and he started to talk even before he started to eat there was anger beneath his words an edge of darkness but the words were coming out all the same elinors a foster mother in manhattan he said shes a lovely warm afroamerican lady with a heart bigger than texas shes old enough to retire but there are always children who need her right now shes fostering ned and pip two years ago she took them in while their mother supposedly undertook a courtordered rehab but instead she robbed a drug store with violence shes been in prison ever since and she doesnt contact them she treats them with complete indifference elinors trying to persuade her to give them up for adoption but she wont so elinors the only mother they know andyou she asked stunned i met elinor when i agreed to sponsor the manhattan fosterfriends programme its an organisation designed to give foster carers support for people whod love to help but who only have limited time to give so elinor and the children have become my fosterfriends id promised to take them out for christmas i see she whispered and she did see sort of so the image of a sleek sterile manhattan apartment wasnt right or maybe it was right it was just that he moved out from it in a way she hadnt expected so what will they do now she asked feeling dreadfulfor elinor for pip and ned and for william himself elinor has said not to worry shell give them christmas they dont depend on me oh she said in a small voice eat your breakfast meg he said gently and she turned her attention to her plate though the enjoyment wasnt in it now or not so much it did indeed look wonderful pleasure laced with guilt im sorry i didnt get you home she said its not your fault eat eat shed almost forgotten she was hungry or maybe not she was fickle she thought piercing an egg and watching the yolk ooze across the richly buttered toast mmm she glanced up and william was watching her and she thought with a tiny frisson of something she was far too sensible to feelelinors a retirement age foster mother and william cares about kids but william only cared about these kids parttime in the bits he had available she knew he was out of the country eight months out of twelve the coldness settled backthe bleak certainty that this man walked alone and would walk alone for ever there was nothing she could do about it shed resigned she didnt have to watch him selfdestruct but maybe he was right maybe he wasnt selfdestructingmaybe it was she who was putting herself out there to be shot down with emotional pain the whole scenario was too hard there was only one thing to do here she looked back down at her eggfirmlyand concentratedfirmlyon her truly excellent breakfast there wasnt a lot of conversation after that after their third coffee william rang the hospital while meg stared into the dregs of her cup he put it onto speaker so meg could hear the nurses response shes still asleep yes shes fine i promise well ring you the moment she wakes so lets walk he decreed and meg could only agree she didnt want to go back to the hospital and wait and think think of what she was walking away from so they walked down to the beach and meg slipped off her sandals and headed for the shallows william watched her from further up on the sand he kept his shoes on hed swapped his boots for a pair of casual loafers but he wasnt taking the next step w s mcmaster with bare feet walking in the shallows unthinkable she walked along letting the last run of the waves lick over her toes kicking sprays of water up in front of her william walked parallel to her but fifteen feet up the beach she was in the shallows he was on solid sand solid sand there was no such thing she thought nothing was solid everything was shifting why wasnt he taking his shoes off why wasnt he coming close she knew why she even agreed it was sensible that he shouldnt the wind was warm on her face the sand and salt between her toes felt fabulous all it needed was for william to take fifteen steps and take her hand and life would be a fairy tale so get real she told herself and kicked up a spray of water so high she soaked the front of her dress this guy is a billionaire from manhattanmy exboss im unemployed with a hundred dairy cows a little brother and a grandma who needs me and will need me for years she kicked the water again and glanced sideways at william he wasnt looking at her he was striding along the beach as if he was there to walk off his toobig breakfast and that was that and why shouldnt it be that the man hadnt been to the gym for two days hed be suffering from withdrawal you go on by yourself she called to him burn some energy im happy to stay here and kick water he glanced at her and nodded brisk serious she turned to watch the windsurfers and he headed off along the beach alone he was being a bore he didnt know what else to be there were a thousand emotions crowding into his head right now and he didnt know what to do with any of them she was beautiful there was a really big part of him that wanted to head into the shallowswith or without shoesand tug her to him and hold how selfish would that be she wasnt like any woman hed dated hed selected her with care as his australian pa and that was what she was qualified to be she was smart efficient unflappable loyal honest discreet sassy funny emotional trusting and beautiful he didnt have a clue what to do with all these things he moved in circles where women knew boundaries indeed they wanted them he was an accessory a guy with looks and money who was good for their image no one had ever clung meg wasnt clinging the oppositeshe was walking away that was good she knew the boundaries she knew theyd overstepped them so she was protecting herself she had the right and if he stepped over the boundaries after her like walking into the water now and taking her hand pretending they could just be a normal couple boy and girl he didnt do boy and girl he had to leave he knew no other way of living do not depend on anyone he could depend on meg no shed resigned the thought hurt he tried to drum up anger but it wasnt there all that was left was a sense of emptiness as if hed missed out on something other people had how to change if he tried if he hurt her he walked faster striding along the hard sand trying to drive away demons he stopped and looked back and meg was a red and white splash of colour in the shallows far behind in a day or two shed be further away shed get some sort of hick job and be stuck here milking her cows taking care of letty and scott it was her choice he picked up a heap of seaweed and hurled it out into the shallows as if itd personally done him injury that was what this felt like but he couldnt fault meg she was protecting herself as he protected his own barriers she had the right hed choose another pa and move on but firsthe had to get christmas over bring on santa claus he thought grimly followed by a plane out of here and then theyd all live happily ever after chapter nine it was a subdued trio who returned home letty was stretched out on the back seat dozing the doctors had been inclined to keep her shed woken enough to be stubborn but she was sleeping now meg sat in the passenger seat staring straight ahead as if she was enduring something that had to be endured hed made a few desultory attempts at conversation but had given up so much for his smart sassy pa now she was justmeg someone he once knew just concentrate on driving he told himself when he got back to the farm hed move onto evening milking the phone line was working again so after milking he could use the internet keep himself busy by the way ive organised your satellite connection he said and meg cast him a glance that was almost scared you what while you were dress shopping it only took me minutes to buy what i needed and the internet place was open for business it seems satellite dishes make great christmas gifts even i couldnt get them to erect it today but first working day after christmas itll be here i cant afford its paid for three years in advance no thank you she said in a tight clipped voice three dresses are enough but are you out of your mind letty was suddenly awake piping up from the back seat in indignation meg what sort of gift horse are you looking in the mouth here scotty will love it you know therell be times still when hes stuck at home in pain you cant say no to that letty im no longer working for mr mcmaster meg said so i cant take expensive gifts youre not working for him shes resigned tell her shes daft william said no letty said surprisingly strongly my megs not daft if shes quit theres a good and sensible reason but a satellite connectionthatd be a gift to scotty and me not to meg wouldnt it mr mcmaster william he said and he almost snapped william letty said scotts friend my friend meg dear william has more money than he knows what to do with and hes just given us a very fine christmas gift in return for a bed for christmas and she hesitated but she was a wise old bird was letty and you dont want anything in return do you mr mcmaster william william letty said obediently but youre not buying meg with this she doesnt owe you anything right right he said and glanced across at meg her face was drawn almost as if she was in pain he hated that look he didnt know what to do about it then i accept on scottys behalf letty said across his thoughts and your bed for christmas is assured when theyd left the farm it had been almost deserted when they turned back into the driveway there were more than a dozen vehicles parked under the row of gums out front uhoh letty said peering dubiously out of the window this looks like a funeral if it hadnt been for william it would have been meg said and once again william thought she sounded strained to breaking point if scotts done something else stupid but it seemed he hadnt when they pulled up women emerged from the house men appeared from the yard kids appeared from everywhere they called a working bee scott said limping across to the car on his crutches and tugging open the back door to make sure for himself that his grandmother was in one piece they said you had enough on your plate meg and they knew youd left the hay till after christmas so they brought slashers and theyve done three whole paddocks theyre bringing in the last of it now youre kidding meg whispered but she was staring across to a hay shed which had stood almost empty this morning and now looked threequarters full in whatfour hours we can work when we want to it was jenny coming forward to give her friend a hug we were thinking wed help after christmas but when this happened i said to ian why not now she cast a curious glance at william she needs looking after our meg i do not meg said revolted she doesnt scott said and jenny grinned and hugged him as well until he turned scarlet in embarrassment okay she doesnt as long as you and letty stop doing darn fool things when shes not around jenny retorted im going to be around meg said ill try and find a job locally i i dont want to be away any more but for nowthank you all so so much im incredibly grateful but i need to get letty inside she needs to sleep ill carry her william said but one of the neighbours stepped forward and lifted letty from the car before he could were local he said to william quite kindly but firmly for all that we look after our own cows are on their way up now meg you want some help with tonights milking youve done enough meg said this guyll help it seemed everyone was looking at william hes promised to is he any good at milking he has untapped potential meg said and people laughed and gathered their kids and said their goodbyes and left meg tucked letty into bed and fussed over her scott limped over to the cow yard and william followed we should start scott said william looked at the brace on scotts leg and said gently is that okay that you help with milking it has to be im tired of waiting for it to heal so its not okay meg and grandma fuss that if my leg gets kicked we have to start over again but ill be careful or not how about you supervise while i do the hands on william eyed the mass of cows pressing against the yard gate he eyed the waiting bales nothing to this exceptmaybe you had to do stuff to the vat for pasteurisation oror something he didnt want to waste a whole milking do you know how this works course then you give me instructions and leave me to it i can help scott squared his shoulders i know i was dumb trying to put that santa up i never dreamed grandmad try and fix it but im not completely helpless this legll soon be better i can look after them william looked into his drawn face he saw reflected horror from this mornings accident he saw the unmistakable traces of years of pain and he saw tension worry the pain of being a kid without a dad an adolescent trying desperately to be an adult i know you can he said softly if you must but im at a loose end right now and it seems everything else is taken care of so you sit on the fence and tell me your plans for your car restoration and in between plans you can tell me how to turn this milking machine on and let these girls get rid of their load scotty must be exhausted meg arrived at the dairy back in her milking gear and one glance at her little brother told her he was close to the edge physically he was still frail this morning would have terrified him and with all the neighbours here helping his pride wouldnt have let him stop she wanted to grab him down from the fence hug him and haul him off to bed but he was talking to william who appeared to be underneath a cow and she knew that pride still played a part here so you two reckon you can run this place without me she enquired and william emerged from behind the cow and grinned nothing to this milking game im about to add milker to my cv how is he scotty she asked and then corrected herself sorry scott you can still call me scotty if you like her brother conceded in private in front of williams not private no but hes okay that was a huge concession meg thought thered been a few guys in her pastof course there hadbut scott had bristled at all of them hes okay huge just because he bought you bits of cars she managed feeling choked up no he really is okay is grandma asleep almost she said and here was a way to let him off the hook without injuring any more of that fragile manly ego she wants to say goodnight to you do you reckon you could stay with her while we milk im still a bit worried about her sure scott said and slid off the fence and again she had to haul herself back from rushing forward to help watch william with those cups though four teats four cups its taking him a bit of time to figure it out hey william said sounding wounded and meg laughed and watched her little brother retreat and thought this was as good as it got but it was so fleeting tomorrow or the next day william would be gone it was okay this was the right thing to do she had no choice but to resign a pa hopelessly devoted to her boss that was pathetic and she knew it she glanced at him and thought dumb or not she was hopelessly devoted she had no choice but to get as far from william as possible hes a great kid william said and she flushed and started milking and didnt answer you dont agree he asked after shed cupped her first cow of course i agree but youre not talking its been a big day but its normal again now he said gently though its a shame you felt the need to change i liked your dress ill wear it again tomorrow she gathered her emotions and told them firmly to behave two days max and hed be gone tell me about pip and ned do you have christmas gifts for them i do what bubble guns he said battery powered ten bubbles a second and theyre seriously big you sound like you tried them out why wouldnt i whoa the thought of w s mcmaster with a bubble gun whereabouts did you try them out on my balcony i sent bubbles over central park she giggled then she remembered he was going home and she stopped giggling meg he said softly from behind a cow yes reconsider quitting yes no why not not negotiable she said being your assistant means being aloof you were never aloof i was aloof in my head and youre not now no she said shortly can we keep on milking of course we can as long as you keep on thinking about reconsidering i cant dont think cant think of all the reasons why you just might can thats a crazy thing to say resignings a crazy thing to think only of course she was right and it was nonnegotiable they both knew it they finished milking they cleaned the yard they worked in tandem and mostly they worked in silence then they headed inside and ate the last of the trifle and bread and ham in that order because letty and scott were both deeply asleep and it didnt seem to matter what order they ate in william thought back to christmas eve meals hed had as a child christmas had been an excuse for socializing which meant huge parties of very drunk people because it was christmas his parents had insisted he be part of it at christmas they had to pretend to be a family herefor the past two days theyd lived on lettys vast trifle and chunks of the huge christmas ham and fresh bread and butter eating as they felt like it and it had felt okay sensible delicious even but notright the world seemed out of kilter somehow william thought as he washed the dinner dishes and meg wiped beside him it felt so domestic and domestic was something hed never felt doing the washingup with his pa was weird all of today had been weird hed lost his pa hed lost meg we have the internet back on meg said as she put away the last plate theres a phone connection in the attici use the attic as an office when its not a spare bedroomso you can catch up on the outside world before you go to sleep and you im checking on millicent and then im going to bed christmas or not its still a five am start goodnight william do you want help with millicent shes not looking much different to this morning i doubt if anythings happening tonight goodnight she said again and she took the torch and headed out through the back door the day was ended hed check the internet hed see what was happening with air traffic he hadnt even checked today maybe it was resolved maybe he could leave meg had already left maybe things were happening tonight shed started again millicent was back to being uncomfortable or more than uncomfortable meg thought her tail was constantly high her back was arched and her eyes told meg that she was in pain hey its okay meg told her fondling her behind the ears scratching her letting her rub her big head against her chest this cow had been raised as a pet she was a big sook and letty loved her a normal dairy farmer would go to bed now set the alarm and check her in a couple of hours but when she stepped back millicents eyes widened in fear meg sighed and went back to the house and fetched a folding chair a lantern a book and a rug happy christmas she told millicent as she settled down to wait you and me and hopefully a baby for christmas we should do this in a manger or at the very least at the bottom of the haystack but millicent wasnt going anywhere trying to move her now would only add to her distress and the night was warm enough who needs a manger anyway meg muttered and glanced upward to where a thousand stars glittered in the clear night sky this is where babies should be born so get on with it millicent rolled her eyes i know sweetheart its hard meg said or i dont actually know ive heard its hard you should have its daddy holding your hoof she was being ridiculous she was thinking of william the book shed brought out to read was a romance she and william having a baby william coaching her through well pigs might fly she muttered and tossed her romance aside and snuggled under her blanket were two single ladies millicent and we need to get on with it together you do your bit and ill do mine thered been a last minute offer to the air traffic controllers the union officials had deemed it worth considering and had sent out urgent contact to its members because this was christmas theyd vote online if enough members voted by midnight planes could start flying as soon as tomorrow morning great he might get home almost by christmas he thought hed gain a day flying from australia to the states if he left on christmas day then hed arrive on christmas day he could give ned and pip their gifts he could see them again take them out to dinner maybe leaving meg she was his employee his exemployee so what was the problem leaving her no problem at all he intended to help with milking at five he needed to go to sleep he lay in bed and stared at the ceiling and thought of meg he thought of meg for a long time he tried to think of anything but meg but she was superimposed like a veil through which he saw everything else or maybemaybe everything in his life was a veil and meg was behind the only substantial thing what sort of crazy thinking was this where was the logic furious with himself he threw off his covers and paced over to the attic window two oclock the stars were amazing there was a light in the paddock beside the dairy a faint light from a lantern someone was beside it millicent was she calving meg would be down there making sure things were okay what business was it of his he didnt know the first thing about birthing calves hed be no help at all but now he knew she was there doing nothing was impossible hed help if he could he thought grimly and then hed leave he tugged on his overalls and headed downstairs what sort of life was this meg had been awake since five this morning shed be asleep on her feet he thought as he made his way across the yard towards the lantern but then he thought of all the times hed demanded she stay up late that she be awake for an early flight that she continue until the work was done that was different she was miss jardine then he paid her to work when he worked he had three pas he thought of them now and thought how hard did he work them they never complained he paid them not to complain but for the first time he felt a niggle of guilt he treated his employees fairly he made it clear at the outset what he expected and he paid well he had a loyal and longserving staff because of it but his demand that they stay impersonal his pas told him what he needed to know about his staff but his pas themselves miss darling mrs abraham miss oconnell hed have to look up their staff profiles to find out what their family background was what was happening to him his staff were turning into people and you got attached to people do not get attached to people you pay meg was messing with his head that was what it was the sooner he was out of here the better only she was in trouble as he neared he could see millicent was down flat on her side her body arched and her neck stretched up as if straining to the limit megyes it was megwas lying behind her a dark shadow behind the light he could see a mat laid out to the side a couple of buckets rags ropes problem he asked as he came up beside her and she didnt react he looked more closelyand discovered why she didnt react she was hardly in a position to concentrate on anything but the cow what was she doing whats happening he asked squatting beside her dystocia she said gasping i cant she was lying flat hard against millicents rear her arm dystocia birth problems she sounded as if shed been running first calf bull was too big and now this i knew it i cant what cant you do he said feeling helpless hed never seen a birth he never wanted to see a birth obviously he was going to see this one or more than see maybe you can help she gasped and he thought maybe he should head back to his nice safe attic right now only a coward would run he surely felt like a coward youre stronger than i am she gasped and he thought uh oh can we call the vet hes away until after christmas he warned us surely theres more than one vet he was taking in the whole scene now and as he did millicent strained her whole body heaved and meg moaned and moaned again what are you doing i cant she gasped not able to continue until the contractions subsided then yes we need a vet but we only have one locally and the calfs legs tucked backward instead of forward meaning theres a ridge of shoulder stopping the birth so i need to get the head back in the birth canal so theres room to turn it but i cant i dont have the strength she pushed and pushed againand then seemed to make a decision her arm was suddenly free she dunked it in the nearest bucket and looked up to him can you can i what push the head back far enough so you can get the leg forward he felt as if someone had punched him milking was one thing but this you want me to im not strong enough she said simply please you think i she wasnt listening rip your shirt offitll be ruined shove your arm into the disinfectant and ill lubricate it hurry before the next contraction you want me to just do it she snapped and he was hauling his shirt off thinkingthinkingnothing he dunked his arm in disinfectant meg wiped it and then started lathering him with some sort of jelly he felt too winded to object lie flat she told him if a contraction hits dont try to do anything except stop the head coming further forward but the foreleg on the right is lying back instead of hoofforward you need to push the head back far enough so you have space to feel the foreleg and tug it forward theres no way she can get the calf out with it back i have no idea how to do that simple she snapped cows have two forelegs to calf they both need to be forward with the head between so you pull a leg forward how do i know what everything is she wasnt listening to his panic she was intent only on instructions its not brain surgery a hoofs easy to feel think about it think what youre looking for and then find it gentle as you cando no damagebut you have to move fast before the next contraction go so he lay full length on the grass and he did the unthinkable to his astonishment he could feel what he could feel the head he could feel one small hoof on the left he needed the matching one another contraction rippled through and he discovered why meg had moaned he almost moaned himself dont try and do anything during the contraction just hold it she snapped from above him and he held with all the strength he had and he knew that if he hadnt been holding the head would be emerging with one hoof and not the other so he held and finally blessedly the contraction eased now push meg said urgently all the force you can you need to get it back he didnt need to be told he pushed gently at first and then as his grip tightened as he became more sure of what he was holding he pushed with more force then he pushed with all his strength the head movedand then more now meg would have seen by his arm that the head had shifted before the next contraction find the leg he had to loosen his grip on the head slide his fingers to the side it was so tight but there it was a bony joint surely the leg he felt along it conscious of the need for speed he had it hooked by two fingers and he was tugging it forward careful not to rip anything meg said urgently take care another contraction he felt it coming released the leg held the head just held then as the contraction eased he moved again only this time he knew what he was looking for he had it he pulled hard hoping he wasnt doing more harm than good but the limb was slithering round shifting and there seemed to be room he had it its round he muttered and megs hand was on his shoulder pressing him in a move of exultation she was lying against him full length on the dirt aligned he knew what she meant and he could feel it he had two neat hooves with the head between yes heres another let it come she said itll come now and it did the next contraction shoving everything forward two hooves were out and meg was fastening them before the head appeared tying them carefully with some sort of soft rope what just in case we need to help her she said shes been straining for too long already and this calf is big ill loop this above and below the fetlock so we can pull without doing damage where did you learn to do this he demanded dazed and he felt her smile rather than saw it you mean why wasnt it on my cv i cant think why i didnt include it here we go another contraction meg let it pass but the head didnt emerge okay lets give her a hand she said can you take the rope tug with the contraction not too hard not enough to hurt the calf im happy with an inch or two at a time he nodded megs hands were lubricated again she was feeling now she said and he tugged a little further man this heads big meg said with the size of this brain you must be having the smartest baby on the planet millicent hell take a lot of knitting for a baby bonnet her voice was low and even and with a sense of shock william realised that even though most of megs attention was on the calf there was solid affection and worry for the cow as well shed given her heart to a cow how nuts was that where was his clinically efficient unemotional pa now gone and the sense of loss was gutwrenching now she said again and then moaned because her hand was cupping the head shoehorning it and william was tugging on the hooves and there was only so much room keep going she managed as the contraction lengthened and he tugged some more slowly insistently and suddenly the head was there the rope was no longer needed the calf was half out millicent gave a long bovine moan and meg cleared membrane from the tiny nose and then laid her hand on millicents flank nearly there girl one more push you can do it one more contraction and the thing was done the calf slithered out into the lantern light a long wet bundle of spindly legs and black nose and raglike tail meg cried out in delight and checked its nose was still clear and then lifted it around a little so millicent could reach her baby with ease and she did she turned and nosed her baby and she started to lick it clean and william looked at meg and saw her eyes were filled with tears and a man would have to be inhuman not to be moved not to take her into his arms millicent had taken over licking her calf with solid maternal ownership meg shifted away and her body collided with williamsand she didnt move any further hed slipped the loop from the calfs hooves hed done all he could meg had done all she could their calf was alive and welland meg was hard against him hed helped birth a calf he and meg the feeling was awesome they were still half lying on the ground and meg was warm and beautiful stained filthy her face tracked with tears she was trembling her body reacting to the combined terrors of this day how could he bear her trembling how could he bear not to put his arms round her and tug her closer so he did and as he felt her yield he tugged her closer still her hair brushed his face and he kissed the top of her head just lightly no pressure nothing the awe from the birth was all around themthe stars the warmth of the night the feeling that a miracle had happened new life did she feel this every time she delivered a calf he wondered but then he forgot to think more because she was turning in his arms and she was looking straight at him her eyes huge and shadowed vaguely troubled but neverthelesssure sure that hed kiss her sure that she wanted him to kiss her he knew it and it was one more thing to add to the glory of this nightor maybe the whole night had been building to this kiss maybe his whole life had been building to this kiss that was a crazy thing to thinkbut how could he think it was crazy when his hands were cupping her face and he was drawing her in to meet him how could he think he was crazy when his mouth was lowering to hers and she was so sweet so beautiful so right she melted in to him her mouth seeking his her hands taking his shoulders so she could centre herself be centred her need was as great as his he could feel it in the urgency of her hold in the fire he felt the moment he found her mouth she wanted him he felt her need and his whole body responded their kiss was suddenly urgent hard demanding it was as if a magnetic field had been created locking them to each other two force fields meeting as they must with fire at the centre he wanted her he wanted her fiercely with a passion that rocked him he feltout of control maybe he was out of control it was christmas eve he was in the centre of a paddock somewhere in australiahe didnt truly know wherewith a woman hed thought he knew but he now realised he hadnt known at all his meg no just meg her own beautiful self he deepened the kiss and she responded with heat and need her lips opening her tongue searching oh but he wanted her his hands were on her breasts but she was wearing overalls how did you get through overalls she was buttoned to the throat no not buttons studs they unfastened with satisfactory pops underneath the overalls was a lacy bra and underneath the bra his breath drew in with awe and wonder his hands were cupping her and hed never felt such beauty hed never wanted a woman so much as he wanted meg right now no woman before had been meg he rolled back with her and she came smiling down into his eyes they were lying full length wanting each other with a desperate heat they could read in each others eyes she was above him smiling in the moonlight meg his beauty her skin was pale and luminous she almost seemed to shine they were on a horse rug or somesuch something shed spread in the middle of a cow paddock no pillowed bed could feel better no bed could feel more right youre not taking your overalls off she whispered and he realised with a shock that she was laughing not fair his overalls were all in one hed pulled them on in a rush underneath well there wouldnt be a lot of finesse in his undressing youre wearing a bra he managed i dont believe im wearing anything her chuckle was so sexy it took his breath away i think thats good you dont want me out of my overalls he said but he couldnt say it with any degree of certainty this nightanything was possible this night and if i do there was a statement to take his breath away but a man had to have sense even if finding it almost tore him in two im not hell it was so hard to get his voice to work im not carrying condoms she paused at that she stilled he kissed her again a gentle wondrous exploration that left him wanting more much more why hadnt he thought of condoms of all the stupidhe didnt even have them in his bag back at the house hed hardly packed thinking he was about to seduce his pa and meg was tugging away propping herself up on her arms considering him in the dim light how bigs your head she asked and he blinked pardon millicent operated with no condoms she said her voice husky and shaken look what happened to her he laughed but it was a shaken laugh he pulled away a little sense returning a little we cant he managed unless santa arrives right now i didnt put condoms on my santa list she whispered her voice laced with a thousand regrets thats not efficient of you im not feeling efficient you dont look efficient he said and he tugged her to him again and held he just held my obstetrician extraordinaire hey you turned the leg maybe youve found your new calling im not ready for a new career if its all the same to you i think ill stick to the old one he said but the moment he said it he knew it was a mistake or maybe it wasnt a mistake maybe it was simply the truth which had to be put out there it had killed the moment meg moved back squatted back on her heels and looked at him for a long moment as if searching his face and whatever she was looking for she didnt find it she smiled again a wry little smile with all the regret in the world and she tugged her overalls up to decency well that was fun she said and suddenly he had miss jardine backclinical cool ready to move on birth does crazy things to your head imagine how id feel if ever i was around a human birth lucky im not but enough its three hours till milking i need some sleep meg no she said no no she met his gaze calm and cool in the moonlight and if there was bleakness behind it there wasnt anything he could do about it this was moon madness we both know it and it bears out my decision that i need to quit what if thered been a condom round tonight wed have been lost lost the word hung between them loaded with too many meanings will you help me pack up she said millicent will be fine for whats left of the night its lovely and warm she has a fine heifer calf to clean and shell do it better without us heifer a little girl i think well call her milly millicent mother of milly it has a fine ring to it dont you think she was talking for the sake of talking he realised she was putting emotion aside i dont want to leave you he said simply and she looked at him for a long moment considering and then she shook her head you cant take me with you i dont fit i did when my role was pa no more somehow weve messed this and all there is now is for us to get on with our lives youve got ned and pip and elinor waiting for you back in new york and you have your life there i have a grandma and a little brother and dairy cows and dogs and one brand new calf thats enough to keep any girl happy is it yes she said rising and dumping ropes into buckets yes it is yes it must be chapter ten william woke to an operatic soprano belting out silent night right underneath his attic letty was singing along almost louder than the soprano a couple of dogs were joining right in fivethirty hed been in bed for whattwo and a half hoursand hed lain awake for at least one of them he groaned and put his pillow over his head and then scotty started singing too and more dogs joined in full howl christmas hooray feeling more like scrooge every minute he hauled his jeans on and staggered downstairs the kitchen table was groaning with food in various states of preparation letty was wearing a truly astonishing crimson robe and a santa hat scotty was sitting in his pyjamas shelling peas the difference between now and yesterday was astonishing happy christmas letty said beaming great pecs then as he tried to figure whether to blush she motioned to the sound system in the corner where mercifully silent night had just come to an end my favourite carol you want us to play it again shell make you sing scotty warned and william looked at the pair of them and saw exactly why meg loved them to bits a blushing adolescent and an old lady with her arm bandaged to her elbow a lady who had almost died yesterday who was now stirring something vaguely alcoholic or possibly more than vaguely eggnog letty said following his gaze just on finished you want first glass at fivethirty in the morning yeah its late letty said megs already milking without her eggnog you want to take some over to her no he said revolted whats wrong with my eggnog if im going to help her milk i need to be able to count teats he has trouble getting to four grandma scotty said kindly wed better let him off eggnog till the girls are milked he hesitated you will help milk wont you meg said you helped so much last night that she wouldnt wake you but shell be ages alone i could help letty said darkly only she wont let me with your arm youre as dodgy as i am scott retorted and once again william was hit with the sensation that he was on the outside looking in family okay toast and coffee and no eggnog until afterwards but theres homemade raspberry jam letty told him moving right on and real butter none of that cholesterolreducing muck this morning grandma scott said and letty grimaced and held up her hands in surrender i know back to being good tomorrow you neednt worry young man i intend to be around to boss you for a long time to come so no more santa rescues ill be good she said and william saw a flash of remembered terror from yesterday and he thought she wasnt as tough as she was making out she was brave though and he saw scott worrying about her and he thought that courage came in all guises they were all brave and meg what shed been trying to do for all of them since her parents death so you know about millicents calf he ventured feeling really off centre and they both grinned happiness returning of course we do scott said shes gorgeous and meg said you got a backward hoof out i wish shed called me i couldve have helped therell be lots of calves for you to help in the future letty said roundly well get your leg right first were just lucky william was able to help were very pleased to have you here she said to william now meg checked the news before she milked and she says the planes are running again she and scott checked flights and there are some available she said to tell you when you woke up but you dont want to leave yet do you i did he want to leave they were looking at him expectantly over in the dairy meg was milking alone his world was twisting as if it was trying to turn him in a direction he hadnt a clue about i do need to go he said at last and it was as if the words were dragged out of him if i help with the milking now scott would you mind making me a list of flights and times today yes please you really want to leave scott demanded incredulously and william thought about last night thought about holding meg thought about holding meg again if he got any closer if letty had fallen yesterday if scotty had been killed in that accident if anything happened to meg do not get close do not open yourself to that sort of pain i dont want to go he said striving not to let his voice sound heavy how could i want to leave lettys eggnog but i do need to get back to manhattan as soon as possible so please let me know which flight might be available okay scotty said and even if the kid did sound disappointed william couldnt let that stand in the way of a decision that must be made he headed back upstairs to dress and as he did letty adjusted the sound system next on the playlist was deck the halls and she turned the sound up even louder this place was crazy of course he had to get out of here meg was milking head down behind a cow when he reached the yard she didnt emerge just kept on doing what she was doing killer and the rest of the dog pack greeted him with pleasure but there wasnt a lot of pleasure emanating from meg that had to be okay by him maybe it was even sensible he ushered the next cow into a bale and started doing what had to be done he was getting good at this where could he use this new skill when he left would he ever milk a cow again happy christmas meg said at last from behind her cow and he thought she sounded exhausted had she slept at all he wanted to tell her to go back to bed that hed take over he couldnt yes hed learned new skills but he couldnt milk by himself yet if he left today would she be milking the cows alone happy christmas he replied at last cautiously the airlines are back im sorry but i didnt have time to check flights before milking not good enough he growled trying for a smile but she stiffened and said nothing i was joking i know im sorry he said bad joke im sorry too she said straightening and heading out to fetch another cow in last nightit should never have happened it was like id been so worried it was reaction nothing more it felt like more well it wasnt she snapped fortunately the airlines are operating well see if we can get you a flight out tonight what about milking what about milking whos going to do it i will she said ive done it alone plenty of times before it just takes longer youre exhausted already kerries back tomorrowshes coming for lunch today so maybe she can even help tonightand i can sleep in the middle of the day and then you need to job hunt i believe im still employed by you until my contract expires so you are so ill keep the office operating here as my contract specifies thatll give me time to find something else they were being absurdly formal he thought but maybe formal was the only thing to be what sort of job do you want he asked im a qualified accountant youll do accountancy in a provincial city whats wrong with that what a waste she didnt bother responding she just kept right on milking you dont need to keep the office operating he said at last you cant dismiss me without notice im not dismissing you ill pay you till the end of your contract then ill work till the end of my contract ive taken enough from you i cant take any more id like to give more like what she said from behind her cow and he thought about it what would he like to give her money security the knowledge that she wouldnt have to get up to milk a cow unless she wanted to the ability to drop everything and be with scott when and if he needed further operations the ability to care for letty as she needed to be cared for financial freedom to call the vet whenever she needed the vet freedom to have a bit of fun but this was nothing he could do hed given scott his old cars hed given meg dresses and hed given them all the satellite dish he knew without asking that shed accept nothing else so there was nothing more he could do there was nothing more he should do as soon as his flight was confirmed he could walk away and not look back that was what he wanted wasnt it anything else was way too complicated dogs cows family wed best get a move on she said across his thoughts we dont do santa until the cows are done and then theres church and then theres eggnog you dont do eggnog until after santa and church not very much she said and managed a smile grandma doesnt tip up the brandy bottle until were all safe home milking finished william swished the dairy while meg went to check on millicent and the brand new milly they were standing contentedly in the home paddock milly at her mothers teat no sign of the trauma associated with her birth if she was a hardheaded businesswoman shed remove the calf now meg thought ruefully as she looked down at the pretty little calf after the first few hours when the calf had taken the all important colostrum efficient dairy practice was to remove the calf and get the cow straight into mass production only neither letty nor meg were hardheaded the calves stayed with their mothers until letty decreed they were ready to be independent which lost them milk production but probably made them a healthier herd or possibly made them a healthier herd or not it was a decision of the heart not of the head like me stopping working for william she told millicent and sat on the edge of the trough while she watched the cow and her new little calf killer nosed up beside her and shoved his head against her ribs she hugged him tight and suddenly she felt like crying and thats also dumb she told killer why cry for that matter why quit working for the mcmaster empires the best job ive ever had why cant i keep on doing it why cant i ignore how i feel about him and get on with it she knew she couldnt he was watching her he was sluicing the yard but she could feel his gaze she hugged her dog hard then straightened her shoulders and rose and tried to look professional as if she was examining cow and calf as a proper dairy farmer should in terms of what she could make from them millicents eyes were huge and contented and maybe a little bit wondrous while meg watched she started to lick her calf and the little calf kept right on feeding drat those tears kept right on welling happy christmas you great sook she told herself angrily and swiped at her cheeks with venom get a grip and stop crying right now she had to stop crying william was finished in the yard she should wait for him and walk him back to the house he was helping her itd be only civil to walk back but the feeling of that kiss of the night before was too huge too raw too real it was threatening to overwhelm her if i head back now i get first shower she told killer thats what a hardheaded professional dairy farmer should do and thats what i am right go fast before he catches up even more right or not hed never seen a christmas tree like it theyd been so busy william had hardly been in the sitting room until now but after a second breakfast and a little eggnogyes the serious stuff would come after churchletty bossed them into the sitting room for present opening the tree was real but it wasnt pine there are no pines here and theres no way im spending money importing one letty growled following his gaze this might not be what youre used to but its okay with us it was a small gum tree in a vast pot on wheels we pull it in and pull it out every year letty said while meg said nothing this years the last for this tree shes getting too big well plant her out but theres already a new one coming on to take her place and that made him feel weird as well the thought of such continuity a long line of trees each taking its turn as a christmas tree before growing to be one of the huge gums that surrounded the farm fantastic and sort ofgrounded good the decorations were great as well all homemade some wonderful some distinctly corny they date from the time meg arrived here letty said proudly she made paper chains her mum made the balls and lanterns then scotty came along and heres his kindergarten things grandma scott said revolted and letty chuckled and tossed him a gift it was a sweater home knitted scott made a truly manful effort to look pleased and the hug he gave his grandma was genuine he put it on red and green stripes just the thing for winter he said and letty beamed with pleasure meg said but take it off before you faint in the heat scott threw his sister a look of such gratitude that william had trouble not to laugh out loud as he did with so many of the gifts they were opening small jokes trivia fun and then there was a gift in his hands he stared down at the boxsmall flat red and tied with gold ribbon youve done enough for us meg said softly we cant possibly repay you but this is the least we can do he opened the box feeling disoriented as if hed been transported to another world inside was a certificate folded neatly he read through trying to make it out hed been givena parttime dog scott and i found it on the internet meg said as he looked up astounded its an animal shelter in manhattan and its not far from where you live this gives you visiting rights more what you do is adopt a dog whenever youre in town if youre based in new york for three months then you take a dog for three months you can take her back to the shelter at night if you want or you can keep her at home or you can simply take her out for a run each day whatever you want you give your time and the shelter takes over what you cant provide the only stipulation is that shes still available for permanent adoption this plan means the shelter can take far more dogs than they could otherwise care for and they dont have to put them down but if someone wants to adopt one permanently then you need to choose another a parttime dog he thought like ned and pip and elinor his parttime family good excellent so why did it make him feel empty luckily scott was filling his silence the dog youve semiadopted is sheeba he told william her photographs in the bottom of the box shes part greyhound part dalmatian i reckon she should be your first because every man needs a dog letty said solidly william glanced out towards the kitchen the dogs werent permitted in the sitting room there were five dogs squashed in the doorway each nose managing to claim an inch of sitting room carpet every man should have a dog a parttime dog he watched as meg opened yet another extraordinary knitted object and hugged letty and giggled and then watched as scott and letty were both ordered to open their gifts from meg together so they did and they were bazookalike machine guns loaded with foam balls christmas immediately became a running battle between grandmother and grandson whod have thought letty had been close to death yesterday and whod have ever thought of giving a grandmother a foam ballshooter he looked at meg and meg was giggling like a kidand he thought he was never going to see her again he started gathering wrapping paper and then letty remembered the turkey and scott remembered flights oh whoops sorry he said firing a foam ball at killer who caught it neatly in his mouth bit it in two and then looked expectantly for more killer sorry what your flights he looked to meg as if to confirm he was doing the right thing i checked while you were milking if you really want to go what have you found meg asked theres a flight at nine tonight you could catch the four oclock train back to melbourne and take the skybus to the airport it all fits is that okay meg hes used to private cars meg said not looking at william but it sounds okay she rose and headed out to the kitchen after letty tossing her words over her shoulder still carefully not looking at him is that okay with you william you can have christmas dinner and well drive you to the train hell need extra weight allowance after grandmas pudding scott joked and letty hooted from the kitchen but william didnt laugh he couldnt see meg any more she was behind the kitchen door but he was willing to bet she didnt laugh either you dont need to come to church meg said but sitting back at the farmhouse without them seemed unthinkable so he went and meg orchestrated things so she sat with letty and scott between them she was wearing another of her new dresseslilac simpler than yesterdays but just as pretty or more pretty or maybe it was that he was looking at her more often the service was lovely a tiny community coming together in happiness belting out beloved christmas hymns with enthusiasm and as much tunefulness as they could muster william could only stand for the first two hymns because some time between the second and the third letty leaned against his shoulder and went to sleep meg saw why he wasnt standing and she smiled at him the smile hed worked with for three years and hadnt noticed and he thought it was worth holding letty to receive that smile though if hed had a choice he still would hold letty he thought memories of yesterdays terror flooding back she was an indomitable old lady and he could see why meg loved her so he sat while the rest of the congregation sang and there were approving looks from many and curious looks from more and he thought meg was going to get the full inquisition after he left after he left maybe he could stay a few days more make sure letty was okay give kerrie a few more days off milking get closer to meg she was sharing a song sheet with scott and her voice was true and pure he could hear her through the rest of the congregationhe knew her voice he wouldnt hear it again he shouldnt be here this wasnt his place if he got closer hed hurt her he didnt know the first thing about family hed go home to his parttime dog his parttime fosterfriends role his fulltime career what was he doing surely he wasnt thinking he could stay here and milk cows for ever maybe he could take meg with him she wouldnt go collection scott hissed and he looked at him in incomprehension money scott said and grinned and william realised he was being handed the collection plate everyone in the pew was looking at him they must have thought he was as sleepy as letty before he could react meg dropped a note into the plate and handed it back to the server hes a bit tight she said in a makebelieve whisper which carried through the church he hasnt had any work since before christmas you know he stared at her in openmouthed astonishment and she grinned and then chuckled and letty stirred against him and opened her eyes have we sung o little town of bethlehem yet no he said confounded then why dont we she demanded dont they know our turkeys waiting dinner came next kerrie arrived with her three children and it was hard to know who whooped louder the children or letty far too much food was consumed the pudding flamed magnificently crackers were pulled silly jokes were read meg checked her watch for about the hundredth time and finally said its time to go it is william said youll drive me to the station ill drive you letty said with alacrity and grinned meg can do the washingup let meg take him grandma scott said with rare insight shell want to say goodbye i want to say goodbye letty retorted scott said grandma in a meaningful voice and letty gave a theatrical sigh and started clearing the table but she wasnt exactly martyred kerrie and scott were helping clear kerrie would stay on for milkingtheyd organised that at some time over pudding itd only take meg twenty minutes to take william to the station ten minutes there ten minutes back and life would go on without him as it should hed already packed his bag he rose from the still laden table and felt empty thank you he said simply and letty looked at him as if he was a sandwich short of a picnic thank us after what youve done for us ill send you pictures of my car scott said shyly as it takes shape id like that there was nothing else to say meg was already at the door keys in her hand ready to move on chapter eleven why didnt he speak the tension seemed unbearable thankfully the station was only ten minutes drive otherwise shed explode or something she flicked on the radio and there were the inevitable christmas carols william flicked them straight off whats wrong with my carols she demanded trying to sound offended im crossing the time line tonight im facing another twentyfour hours of christmas enough is enough two christmases in a row how appalling so much for offended she knew she sounded miserable my christmas isnt like your christmas he told her two of my normal christmases would be appalling will you see your parents no you should even the media says theyre lonely call them youre telling me how to run my life i forgot she said suddenly contrite im still employed i shouldnt tell you anything but when youre not employed when im not employed i wont be anywhere near you she whispered there was more silence and then thankfully they arrived she pulled up beside the platformit really was in the middle of nowhere but this was where she had to leave him here you are she managed feeling ill the train will be here in six minutes he looked around him in doubt how do i know youre right with your timetable trust me trust you to leave me standing on a platform in the middle of nowhere waiting for a train when i only have your word for it that itll come she sighed okay ill wait sir do you want me to carry your bag onto the station no he said meg we need to be on the station if the driver cant see us from a way ahead he wont stop she headed onto the platform leaving him to follow he followed more silence they stood side by side in the middle of nowhere and he tried to think of something to say so many things but none of them suitable none of them possible reconsider your job he said at last and she shook her head i cant because i kissed you i believe i resigned before that because i wanted to kiss you then and because when i did kiss you it was wonderful william i cant cope with an affair she said simply and i cant cope with loving my boss loving the word made him feel as if hed been punched i dont of course she said hastily its just that i might given time and enoughheat there was a faint speck on the horizon a distant rumble and they both knew the train was on its way soso its been fabulous ive had the best time working for you and i cant begin to thank you for what youve done for my family this christmas theres no need to thank me did he take her hands or did she take his he didnt know all he did know was that suddenly they were linked the train was growing closer and she was justhere he was holding meg not miss jardine he was definitely holding meg and he knew what he most wanted to say come with me he said urgently and her eyes widened what to new york you could have a second christmas too ive had christmas the train was closer now the driver had seen them and was starting to slow i want you to come and leave letty and scott ring them up and say sorry i wont be home for tea can you get someone to cover the milking she sounded a little hysterical panicked her hands tugged back but he didnt let her go what are you saying christmas in new york thats crazy he knew it was crazy or not i mean it she met his gaze square on and the flare of panic settled no she said sounding sure my place is here as yours is in manhattan or hong kong or london wherever your business takes you and heres your train say hello to sheeba for me sheeba your parttime dog she chided and he stared down at her and thoughtparttime dog parttime life he so didnt want to leave this woman but the alternative she couldnt go with him there wasnt an alternative goodbye william she said gently and pushed his hands a little pushing him to let her go only the train hadnt quite stopped yet and his hold on her tightened goodbye meg there was a blast from the trains horn as if the driver was saying get on fast the train surely didnt want to waste time sitting at this windswept sunburned country railway siding no one would want to waste time here least of all him he had to leave but how could he leave when he was holding meg he must he looked down into her eyes for one last time and then because there was no way he couldnt he pulled her tight against him he cupped her chin he tilted her faceand then he kissed her it was a fast kiss fast by necessity as the train had now stopped but still the kiss was strong and searching and it ached to be more for one precious moment she yielded against him her mouth opened under his and she melted her body moulded against his and she was crushed against him meg but the doors of the train were sliding open and the conductor was stepping onto the platform all aboard he snapped straight at them and there was no avoiding the inevitable for one last moment meg clung and he held and then she was standing back and there was nothing he could do but lift his bag and board the train she drove home feeling sick life as she knew it was over well that was a stupid thing to think she had cows to look forward to and finding a local job plus there was a rather nice young farmer whod been interested before shed left to take the mcmaster job letty told her every time she came home that he was still single maybe she could drum up some enthusiasm only shed taken the job with william for a reason and the reason still stood she loved the farm but it wasnt enough shed adored working for william for mr mcmaster for william he could never be mr mcmaster again she knew that he was too cute too warmhearted toohot and too needy see there was the problem what really hurtor if she was honest what hurt almost as much as missing himwas the thought of him going back to his sterile life in manhattan sure he had his parttime kids and now he had his parttime dog sure he thought he was happy he was rich and confident and a powerful figure in the worlds economy but he wouldnt call his parents and she guessed they wouldnt call him hed probably call one of his cooltobeseenwith women to fill in the gaps in his life and that made her think dark thoughts about life in general and cooltobeseenwith women in particular she dredged up an image of the erstwhile sarah and imagined the picture as a dartboard how childish was that she was being childish but there was more behind what she was feeling than childishness and she knew what it was for shed fallen in love some time over the last two days shed fallen hard maybe it had been latent waiting in the wings to strike when the time was right maybe shed been in love with w s mcmaster for years she just hadnt known it and he was going home alone and she felt sickand sad for him as well as for her hed go back to the life he knew and she didnt envy him one bit he might be rich and powerful but she had scotty and letty and the dogs she didnt have william hed asked her to go with him how crazy was that oh but shed wanted to to board the train and leave flying to manhattan with william stepping into his life his parttime life for she was under no illusions as to what an affair with william would be shed made arrangements for too many such affairs in the past glorious indulgence and then mutual parting no hard feelings she pulled the car off the road and got out she walked round the car then round again it was no use going back to the farm until she had her head in order william was gone and she had to move on she had to walk into the kitchen at home and be cheerful right one more round of the car or maybe two and she could do it she must he heaved his bag up onto the luggage rack and he thought for the first timehe had been preoccupied until nowthat his bag was heavier than usual and almost as he thought it the zip burst open his luggage was quality zips did not burst nor did plastic bags and plastic containers spill out onto the floor of the train but over christmas w s mcmaster had become william and someone had packed leftovers in williams bag the transparent containers held turkey plum pudding grapes cherries chocolates and more there was also a plastic bottle labelled brandy sauce meg would never do this it must have been letty meg was far too sensible to pack him leftovers or was she hed get rid of it at the airport he thought gathering the containers while bemused passengers watched he travelled first class leftovers compared to the airlines best haute cuisine but then he thought this was lettys cooking and jennys cooking maybe there was even megs cooking in there somewhere shed definitely stirred the pudding maybe he wouldnt get rid of it he started shoving the containers back into his bag and realised there was something deeper he delved and founda bazooka complete with foam bullets it was the same as the ones letty and scott had found in their stockings orange purple and gold a note was attached to william i had huge trouble finding you one of these at short notice but i knew youd be jealous of letty and scott so with mickeys help heres your very own i thought it might cheer you up when you reach home you and pip and ned can play with it in central park just dont take it on board your plane as hand luggage you could get into very serious trouble love meg ridiculous but he had been jealous this morning as letty and scott had shot each other as if he was on the outside looking in pip and ned would think this was cool he thought it was cool he wanted to try it out now or not mature businessmen did not shoot foam bazookas on trains he read the note again love meg dont go there he stowed the bazooka he managed to get his bag refastened and finally sank into his seat the train was almost empty of course it was christmas night whod be travelling tonight except people going from one family to another there was a young mother in the seat opposite hugging her baby maybe she wasnt going from one family to another she looked wan and tearstained the w s mcmaster of friday would hardly have noticed but now are you okay he asked iyes thank you she managed a watery smile she clearly wanted to talk my husbands working on an offshore oil rig so we can save a deposit for a house we only have one week together a month its only for a year but i hate being a parttime family and i have to go back to my parents tonight nights my favourite time when the days over snuggling down and talking about it oh i miss him i love him so much she sniffed and blew her nose and there was nothing he could say to make her feel better he retrieved some of his leftover chocolates they shared their chocolate and their silence and neither of them was happy i love him so much there was a lot in that statement to avoid thinking about he decided hed think about the rest nights my favourite time he hated christmas night christmas day was usually bearablethere were always social functions and last year hed had pip and ned only at the end when the days over snuggling down and talking about it that was what was missing hed never figured it out how could he miss what hed never known christmas night alone he always did christmas night alone maybe hed be home in time to see pip and ned he checked his phone and then remembered no reception you can ring when we go through towns the girl told him only you need to talk fast when the days over snuggling down and talking about it the last twentyfour hours had been huge who could he talk about it with they were approaching a town sure enough reception bars appeared on his cellphone he rang manhattan elinor she answered on the first ring whats wrong she sounded breathless and he realised it was one in the morning back home nighttime when the days over snuggling down and talking about it im sorry he said ive woken you oh mr mcmaster its you she said no i was just stuffing stockings so you didnt wake me im glad you rang i have such good news you do the children their mothers finally agreed to their adoption the agency contacted me this morning theres a couple they lost their children in a car accident five years ago and they so want a family they sound lovely and theres grandmas and grandpas everything these children most need so tomorrow after christmas lunch theyre coming to visit its only first contact but oh they sound nice these children so need a family they do he said and somehow he managed to keep his voice from sounding bereft bereft of all the stupid sensations and elinor heard ithe knew she did theres so many needy children out there she said her voice growing sombre you know that theres always more to be looked after and he heard her pain as well shed be giving up these children and moving on oh elinor she loved with all her heart you didnt love without hurting where had he learned that was he just starting yeah it hurts she said across his thoughts and he could almost see her steeling herself but if you dont love then you might as well stop living this family live right nearby so well see each other in the park so how about you will we see you tomorrow i mean today my flight wont get in until late oh the children will be disappointed she said but in a tone that said not too disappointed they were about to meet their new mommy and daddy what more did children need for christmas so youll be flying all christmas she said im so sorry theres no need to be sorry he said startled well there is she said and she sounded truly concerned its time you stayed put i know youre important and i know youre busy but you have a good heart mr mcmaster and its time you found somewhere to park it ive done my share of parking in my time but have you you need to find somewhere you can leave it for good the train had streamed through the town and out the other side reception was starting to break up he could barely hear maybe it was just as well william thought what sort of advice was this he wished her merry christmas but he didnt hear a response he clicked off his phone and stared out of the window trying not to replay her words bad news the young mother asked ino good news really you dont look like it was good news its okay he wanted to tell her about it onlyif he told herhow could he make it sound like good news shed guess how he felt he thought as elinor had guessed as meg would guess he wanted to tell meg when the days over snuggling down and talking about it such a thing wasnt for him for a mcmaster tosnuggleunthinkable he stared out at the sparse australian landscape so unlike manhattan and he thought of his familythe mcmaster dynasty damaged people all deeply unhappy poisoned by wealth and by social expectations unhappy unions had created unhappy children and on it went for generation after generation spreading outward how could he ask someone to join such a family he couldnt hed sworn he never would but if not the thought came from nowhere and it started as a jumble a christmas tree with decorations from childhood lettys mango trifle cows and dogs gumboots parked at the back door megs laughter crazy santa legs scott amid a jumble of mini parts the feel of meg against him in the emergency room this was a family so unlike his own it was unbelievable and the jumbled thought unravelled settled and finally left a clear thought that was amazing if his family was unworkable maybe he could join another the conductor was coming through now checking tickets and before he could take the thought any further he found himself asking is there another train tonight to where to where i got on to tandaroit you have to be joking once a day to tandaroit next train leaves tomorrow night from melbourne do you want to go back the woman across the way asked as the conductor moved on maybe william said feeling dazed to the girl you were kissing on the station and there it was front and centre the girl hed been kissing on the station who is she the woman asked and he managed a smile she was miss jardine he said softly but nowher name is meg chapter twelve meg liked christmas night or she always had christmas was huge busy noisy fun and it left her happy even the first appalling christmas after the accident she and letty had managed to make it fun and shed slept that night feeling just a little bit optimistic about the future so why wasnt she feeling optimistic now kerrie stayed and helped with the milking while letty and scott cleaned up inside and minded the children after tea they loaded the sleeping children into kerries car and bade them goodnight kerrie drove off and meg found herself feeling jealous kerrie would be snuggling the children into bed um kerrie was a struggling single mother who worked herself raw was she jealous because she had babies was she jealous of what they represented scott and letty went to bed tired and happy after what they decreed had been an awesome christmas we should invite william every year scott said sleepily and meg felt even more bereft the dogs had eaten too many leftovers they were asleep useless as company she went across to the home paddock to talk to millicent but millicent was snoozing as well she walked back to the house kicking stones disconsolate santa was still waving back and forth in his chimney i wonder if i can shoot him down with one of the bazookas she asked herself but she couldnt dredge up a smile she didnt want to smile she wanted to wallow she climbed into her pyjamas and went to bed she thumped her pillows for a while then gave up and headed back into the kitchen to pour herself the last of the eggnog she stared into its depths and then carefully tipped it down the sink lets not drown our sorrows here she told herself we need to be nice and sober to read the job vacancy ads tomorrow she sniffed ooh whos maudlin and i havent even drunk my eggnog william would be back in melbourne now she looked at her watch no william would be in the sky she glanced out of the window at the stars beyond nothing and nothing and nothing andsomething a tiny light growing brighter it was a small plane she thought low in the east some private charter going places now the restrictions were lifted good for them the light was getting brighter brighter still and the sound not a plane then a helicopter closer still low and fast who and then she thought no yes this was stupid she was imagining things maybe thered been an accident somewhere close and this was an air transfer thatd be it but it was over their land now hovering lights were beaming down itd panic the cows but even as she thought it she realised it wasnt hovering over the cow pastures the paddock underneath was at the eastern extremity of the property where the hay had been slashed only yesterday whoever was in the chopper knew the paddock was bare knew the paddock was safe itd be itd be she darent think who itd be it wouldnt be william but the chopper was on her land the dogs had heard killer was at the kitchen door his head to one side listening ill take you with me she told him and then as the rest of the pack appeared she nodded okay maybe i do need protection lets all go and investigate he stood in the paddock and he thought whoa its a long way to the house he knew he couldnt scare the cows he knew this paddock would be a safe place to land but still wheres a limousine when you need it the pilot was enjoying himself yes hed been pulled away from his family christmas but hed had his christmas dinner and the bonus hed been promised made him very happy indeed maybe i could take you over the house and lower you on a rope he told him grinning and william thought wheres the respect hed made the mistake of chatting to steve about his family and look where it got him and then he saw lettys wagon bumping across the paddocks and he stopped thinking about stevehe stopped thinking of anything but meg was it meg the car came to a halt the drivers door opened but before he could see who it was five dogs tumbled out enveloping him in a sea of canine ecstasy hed been at the farm for three days by the dogs reaction they were his lifelong friends and hed been gone for years he kind of liked it but still hopefully meg was behind them he managed to shove the dogs aside the pack descended on steve who backed into his cockpit the dogs jumped right up after him hopefully the machine was hard to start otherwise they risked flight by dog whatever william was too busy looking at meg to do anything about it for she was here she was wearingpyjamas pink silk with tiny stars and moons all over silver stars his sense of unreality deepened her hair was messed as if shed been asleep she looked rumpled and sexy and so fabulous he wanted to scoop her into his arms right then and there think of something to say stupid he told himself but he was having trouble tonight had made sense to him at the planning stage now he was having trouble getting started you had to bring the dogs he managed as a muffled grunt emerged from the cockpit anyone could be landing in our hay paddock on the chance that you could be enemy alien cow poachers you came wearing pyjamas i have a loaded bazooka under these pyjamas he eyed the pyjamas they were silky and clinging and no dont think of what might or might not be under those pyjamas definitely not a bazooka what to say he gazed at meg at her adorably confused face at her wonderful stars and moons at her dishevelled hair this was meg the woman he loved with all his heart and he knew he had to go forward the woman he loved with all his heart when had he figured this out just then he thought hed known he had to come hed planned to come but now looking at her he knew for sure all those corny movies hed watched as a lonely childthey were right throw your hat into the ring jump i had to come back for you he said simply his gaze not leaving her face i said i couldnt come with you she whispered sounding awed you dont need to come i didnt come back to fetch you i came back to be with you ppardon i came back because i love you he said strongly now more sure i came back because when it came down to it i couldnt leave you love me she said it wonderingly and he knew the alien thing was still in her mind she said it as if his words were some sort of fantasy that had no connection to reality it was up to him to make her see this was real that this was true i do love you it was as serious as any wedding vow he took a step towards her but she held up her hands as if to ward him off as if she was afraid behind him steve was still surrounded by dogs he couldnt be holding five collars yet the dogs were all still it was as if they sensed how important this was was this important to a chopper pilot to dogs why not it was the whole world to him meg i need to know he said roughly because he couldnt bear to wait a moment longer when you talked about loving did you mean it that you could love me i might she whispered and his world settled things were falling into place that hed never realised were out of kilter until now that hed known this woman for three long years and not loved her how could he have been so blind how could he waste another moment it was killing him not to take her into his arms but he knew he shouldnt do not rush this as if falling in love in three days hiring a helicopter in the middle of the night telling her he wanted her right now wasnt rushing things okay do not rush this even more so say it lay the whole plan on the line i can move here he said and megs face froze here its not impossible i think i need to sit can i hold you up not until i figure what youre talking about my plans i like plans she said faintly okay talk so he talked ill explain fast he said and it had to be fast because if he didnt hold her soon hed go up in smoke i propose to base myself here no wrong i propose we base ourselves here because i need you meg in business in every facet of my life youre smart and intuitive and funny and i want you with me every step of the way so what id really like is to build here set up headquarters here keep the farm but add to it wed need a helicopter pad i fancy a swimming pool and i bet a gymnasium would really help scott scott hes part of it hes part of your life family william i know he said hurriedly afraid to stop afraid of how shed respond its just it was a really long train ride back to melbourne and making plans is what im principally good at i thought we could restore the old cottage on the other side of the dairy and ask kerrie if shed consider living here letty told me it was a dream of yours and it sounds good to me that means wed always have a milker on hand thenmaybe we could employ a nanny a nanny she said astonished for kerries kids he said hurriedly and forfor whoever else might come along that means you and i can travel whenever we wish theres so much itll take us years to sort it out but we will we can if we want to if you want to whatwhat do you think there was a long long pause the enemy alien cow poacher was still in the back of her mind he thought but slowly slowly he watched her expression change she was searching his face and what she saw seemed to change things i think she whispered but then her voice firmed i think id never leave our kids with a nanny she said and suddenly the woman in the pink silk pyjamas was smiling his heart gave a leap id never leave our kids there were all sorts of assumptions in that statement and he liked them all how many kids would you like he asked tenderly william maybe he had to throw in a few more inducements maybe he still didnt have it right how to talk of love it seemed so fragileand all he had was words not now you know letty and scotty could travel with us too if they like he said hurriedly they could see manhattan and london and hong kong i think theyd like it but im serious about only travelling when i must he hesitated you know i didnt get this right my parents taught me personal stuff was a disaster so i buried myself in work but youyou enjoy what you do for me yes i love it she said simply yet you love the farm yes as i like pulling silencers off cars do you i do he said and it was a vow she was looking at him very strangely but hed startedhe had to explain and he was struggling to explain it to himself words find the right words he told himself get it right say the love word ive been thinkingif i could mix grease guns with business then maybe i could mix loving in there somewhere as well he tried but it didnt sound right in the spare bits no he said sure of himself on this one in all my bits in my business in my spare time in my hobbies in my dreams i want loving in all of it meg i want you she looked stunned she looked starstruck youre truly serious and there was only one answer to that ive never been more serious about anything in my life he said simply no matter what happens at the end of every day of my life i want to lie in bed with you andtalk she managed and there was the beginning of laughter in her lovely eyes or anything else that might occur to us he told her smiling loving her with all his heart and suddenly she chuckled a lovely deep ripple of wonder and he thought he might just have got this right so will you marry me he asked for what else was there to say she gasped you want to marry me yes then but i do have a problem he was forced to admit try as i might christmas night is not a time to buy a ring not she said and she laced her voice with such a depth of disappointment that he wasnt sure where the chuckle ended and sincerity began aargh he had everything right except this but then killer took a leap from the chopper and lumbered over dangling from his collar was his dog tag it was a ringof sorts excuse me killer he said and flicked off the collar and removed the tag can i borrow this until the shops reopen i dont believe this meg said faintly we need to organise new tags anyway william said refastening the collar im shipping sheeba out here as soon as i possibly can youre shipping sheeba i figure you have one dog letty has two and scott has two when i decided to stay i took out my christmas card and stared at the picture of sheeba and thoughthow could i turn my back on such a fine gift but im not doing parttime anything any more so she gets to be fulltime im hoping she likes being a farm dog but how could she not and then because this seemed as good a time as any he dropped on one knee and held out the dog tag so miss jardine meg she said sharply meg he said suitably chastened my love thats much better she was smiling mistily down at him my love is way better than meg hey it was a piercing shout and he turned groaning but the shout and the associated rumble couldnt be ignored for it was letty and scott bouncing over the paddocks towards them on the ancient farm tractor dont you dare propose until we get there letty yelled in a voice that was truly scary am i so obvious he demanded of his love and his love chuckled and behind them steve laughed and killer started barking my love he started urgently but meg put her finger on his lips and hushed him she tugged him up and she smiled i wouldnt have it any other way she whispered in front of witnesses you have to be joking youve been a loner all your life william mcmaster no more so he waited with a promise like that a man could wait he waited until letty and scott were in full earshot and theyd introduced themselves to steve and they were holding the dogs back and then letty said okay get on with it and william who was feeling absurdly selfconscious suddenly thought no no he said no meg said steve how many does that chopper hold six steve said three people and five dogs at a push then there are free chopper flights on offer he said starting now you guys can watch but from above take it or leave it witnesses from above but not right here oh cool scotty said high with excitement come on grandma who wants to listen to a soppy proposal when we can ride in a chopper and it is he added conscientiously their business anyway so before letty knew what she was about her grandson had bundled her into the chopper the dogs were tossed up after the doors were clanged shut and the chopper rose into the night sky but not very far william might have intended that steve take them far away steve had other ideas the chopper simply hovered its downlight nailed them you were saying meg yelled at the top of her lungs laughing and william thought he was never ever going to be able to do this better than he could right now he was standing in the middle of a hay paddock a helicopter was practically blasting him to bits with its downdraught the moon was high in the night sky and over at the house santas legs moved steadily back and forth back and forth back and forth happy christmas he shouted and he tried again for the third time third time lucky will you marry me what the sound of the chopper was deafening with this ring i thee wed he shouted back and he placed the tag on her finger and he scooped her up and lifted her high into his arms holding her hard against his heart and finally he kissed her as he needed to kiss her as she needed to be kissed as he intended to kiss her for the rest of her life ill give you diamonds he yelled when they could finally bear to pull apart who needs diamonds meg said lovingly he could barely hear her words but he knew what her lips were saying it was what his heart was saying merry christmas my love she told him diamonds
