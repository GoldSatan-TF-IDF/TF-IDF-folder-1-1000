krispos rising by harry turtledove this one is for rebecca who arrived during chapter v and for her grandmothers gertrude and nancy authors note krispos rising and the second book in the tale of krispos krispos of videssos are set in the same universe as the four books of the videssos cycle the misplaced legion an emperor for the legion the legion of videssos and swords of the legion the events described in the tale of krispos take place about five hundred years before those chronicled in the videssos cycle thus the map that precedes the text is different from the one in front of the books of the videssos cycle so too are some of the customs that appear here nations even imaginary ones do not stand still over five hundred years i the thunder of hoofbeats shouts in a harsh tongue krispos opened one eye it was still dark it felt like the middle of the night he shook his head he did not like noise that woke him up when he should have been asleep he closed the eye and snuggled down between his mother and father on the straw paillasse he and they and his little sister used for a bed his parents woke too just when he was trying to go back to sleep krispos felt their bodies stiffen on either side of him his sister evdokia slept on some people have all the luck he thought though hed never thought of evdokia as particularly lucky before not only was she threehalf his ageshe was a girl the shouts turned to screams one of the screams had words the kubratoi the kubratoi are in the village his mother gasped phos save us she said her voice almost as shrill as the cries of terror in the darkness outside the good god saves through what people do his father said the farmer sprang to his feet that woke evdokia where nothing else had she started to cry keep her quiet tatze krispos father growled his mother cuddled evdokia softly crooned to her krispos wondered whether hed get cuddled if he started crying he thought hed be more likely to get his fathers hand on his backside or across his face like every farm boy from anywhere near the town of imbros he knew who the kubratoi were wild men from north of the mountains will we fight them father he asked just the other day with a stick for a sword hed slain a dozen makebelieve robbers but his father shook his head real fighting is for soldiers the kubratoi curse em are soldiers we arent theyd kill us and we couldnt do much in the way of fighting back this isnt play boy what will we do phostis his mother asked above evdokias sniffles she sounded almost ready to cry herself that frightened krispos more than all the racket outside what could be worse than something bad enough to frighten his mother the answer came in a moment something bad enough to frighten his father we run phostis said grimly unless youd sooner be dragged north by the twolegged wolves out there thats why i built close to the forest thats why i built the door facing away from most of the houses to give us a chance to run if the kubratoi ever came down again his mother bent rose again i have the baby in her arms evdokia said indignantly not a baby then she started to cry again no one paid any attention to her krispos father took him by the shoulder so hard that his flimsy nightshirt might as well not have stood between mans flesh and boys can you run to the trees son fast as you can and hide yourself till the bad men go away yes father put that way it sounded like a game krispos had played more games in the forest than he could count then run his father threw open the door out he darted his mother followed still holding evdokia last came his father krispos knew his father could run faster than he could but his father didnt try not tonight he stayed between his family and the village bare feet skimming across the ground krispos looked back over his shoulder hed never seen so many horses or so many torches in his life before all the horses had strangers on themthe fearsome kubratoi he supposed he could see a lot of villagers too the horsemen rounded up more of them every second dont look boy run his father said krispos ran the blessed trees drew nearer and nearer but a new shout was up too and horses drummed their way the sound of pursuit grew with horrid quickness breath sobbing in his throat krispos thought how unfair it was that horses could run so fast you stop or we shoot you a voice called from behind krispos could hardly understand it he had never heard videssian spoken with any accent but the country twang of his own village keep running his father said but riders flashed by krispos on either side so close he could feel the wind from their horses so close he could smell the beasts they wheeled blocking him and his family from the safety of the woods still with the feeling it was all a game krispos wheeled to dash off in some new direction then he saw the other horsemen the pair who had gone after his father one carried a torch to give them both light to see by it also let krispos clearly see them see their fur caps the matted beards that seemed to complement those caps their boiledleather armor the curved swords on their hips the way they sat their mounts as if part of them frozen in time the moment stayed with krispos as long as he lived the second rider the one without a torch held a bow it had an arrow in it an arrow drawn and pointed at krispos father that was when it stopped being play for the boy he knew about bows and how people were supposed to be careful with them if these wild men didnt know that time someone taught them he marched straight up to the kubratoi you turn the aim of that arrow aside this instant he told them you might hurt someone with it both kubratoi stared at him the one with the bow threw back his head and howled laughter the wild man did sound like a wolf krispos thought shivering he wished his voice had been big and deep like his fathers not a boys squeak the rider wouldnt have laughed then the rider probably would have shot him but he did not think of that until years later as it was the kubrati still laughing set down his bow made an extravagant salute from the saddle anything you say little khagan anything you say he chuckled wiping his face with the back of his hand then he raised his eyes to meet those of krispos father who had hurried up to do what he could for the boy not need to shoot now eh farmerman no krispos father agreed bitterly youve caught us all right along with his parents and evdokia krispos walked slowly back to the village a couple of horsemen stayed with them the other two rode ahead so they could get back to doing whatever kubratoi did that krispos already suspected was nothing good he remembered the strange word the rider with the bow had used father what does khagan mean its what the kubratoi call their chieftain if hed been a videssian he would have called you avtokrator instead emperor thats silly even with his world coming apart krispos found he could still laugh so it is boy his father said grimly he paused then went on in a different tone as if beginning to enjoy the joke himself although theres said to be vaspurakaner blood on my side of the family and the vaspurs all style themselves prince bet you didnt know your father was a prince eh son stop it phostis krispos mother said the priest says that nonsense about princes is heresy and nothing else but dont pass it on to the boy heresy is what the priest is supposed to know about his father agreed but i wont argue about the nonsense part who ever heard of a prince going hungry his mother sniffed but made no further answer they were inside the village by then back where other people could hear themnot good not if they wanted to talk of heresy what will they do with us was a safer question to ask though not one necessarily with a surer answer the villagers stood around under the bows of the kubratoi waiting then more riders came up these leading not people but the villages herds and flocks are the animals coming with us father krispos asked he had not expected the kubratoi to be so considerate with us aye but not for us was all his father said the kubratoi started shouting both those who spoke videssian and those who did not the villagers looked at one another trying to figure out what the wild men meant then they saw the direction in which the cattle and sheep were going they followed the beasts northward for krispos the trek to kubrat was the best adventure hed ever had tramping along all day was no harder than the chores he would have been doing had the raiders not descended on his village and he always had something new to see hed never imagined before how big the world was that the march was forced hardly entered his mind he ate better on it than he had at home the kubrati hed defied that first night decided to make a pet of him and brought him chunks of roast lamb and beef soon other riders took up the game so the little khagan sometimes found himself with more than he could eat at his fathers urging he never let on whenever the kubratoi did not insist on having him eat in front of them he passed their tidbits on to the rest of the family the way he made the food disappear earned him a reputation as a bottomless pit which only brought more his way by the end of the third day on the road north the raiders who had descended on his village met with other bands bringing captives and booty back to kubrat that took krispos by surprise he had never given any thought to the world beyond the fields he knew now he saw he and his family were caught up in something larger than a local upheaval where are those people from father he asked as yet another group of bewildered bedraggled peasants came stumbling into the larger stream his father shrugged which made evdokia giggleshe was riding on his shoulders who can say phostis answered just another village of farmers that happened to be unlucky like ours unlucky krispos tasted the word found it odd he was enjoying himself sleeping under the stars was no great handicap not to a sixyearold in summer but his father he could tell did not like the kubratoi and would have hit back at them if he could that made krispos ask another question one he had not thought of till now why are they taking farmers back to kubrat here comes one his father waited till the wild man rode by then pointed at his back tell me what you see a man on a horse with a big bushy beard horses dont have beards evdokia said thats dumb krispos hush their father told her thats right sona man on a horse kubratoi hardly ever come down from their horses they travel on them go to war on them and follow their flocks on them too but you cant be a farmer if you stay on your horse all the time they dont want to be farmers though krispos said no they dont his father agreed but they need farmers whether they want to farm themselves or not everybody needs farmers flocks cant give you all the food you need and flocks wont feed your horses at all so they come down into videssos and steal folk likewell folk like us maybe it wont be so bad phostis krispos mother said they cant take more from us than the imperial tax collectors do who says they cant his father answered phos the lord of the great and good mind knows i have no love for the tax collectors but year in year out they leave us enough to get by on they shear usthey dont flay us if the kubratoi were so fine as all that tatze they wouldnt need to raid every few years to get more peasants theyd be able to keep the ones they had there was a commotion among the captives that night evidently a good many of them agreed with krispos father and tried to escape from the kubratoi the screams were far worse than the ones in the village the night the wild men came fools phostis said now theyll come down harder on all of us he was right the men from the north started traveling before dawn and did not stop to feed the peasants till well after noon they pushed the pace after the meager meal too halting only when it got too dark for them to see where they were going by then the paristrian mountains loomed tall against the northern skyline a small stream ran through the campsite the kubratoi had picked shuck out of your shirt and wash yourself krispos mother told him he took off his shirtthe only one he hadbut did not get into the water it looked chilly why dont you take a bath too mama he said youre dirtier than i am under the dirt he knew she was one of the bestlooking ladies in his village his mothers eyes flicked to the kubratoi im all right the way i am for now she ran a grimy hand across her grimy face but the swat of his fathers hand on his bare behind sent him skittering into the stream it was as cold as it looked but his bottom still felt aflame when he came out his father nodded to him in a strange new way almost as if they were both grown men are you going to argue with your mother the next time she tells you to do something he asked no father krispos said his father laughed not until your backside cools off anyway well good enough heres your shirt he got out of his own and walked down to the stream to come back a few minutes later wet and dripping and running his hands through his hair krispos watched him dress then said carefully father is it arguing if i ask why you and i should take baths but mama shouldnt for a bad moment he thought it was and braced himself for another smack but then his father said hmmmaybe it isnt put it like thisno matter how clean we are no kubrati will find you or me pretty you follow that yes krispos said although he thought his fatherwith his wide shoulders neat black beard and dark eyes set so deep beneath shaggy brows that sometimes the laughter lurking there was almost hiddena fine and splendid man but he had to admit that wasnt the same as pretty all right then now youve already seen how the kubratoi are thieves phos boy theyve stolen all of us and our animals too and if one of them saw your mother looking especially pretty the way she can listening she smiled at krispos father but did not speak he might want to take her away for his very own we dont want that to happen do we no krispos eyes got wide as he saw how clever his mother and father were i see i understand its a trick like when the wizard made gemistos hair turn green at the show he gave a little like that anyhow his father agreed but that was real magic gemistos hair really was green till the wizard changed it back to brown again this is more a game like when men and women switch clothes sometimes on the midwinters day festival do i turn into your mama because im wearing a dress of course not krispos giggled but that wasnt supposed to fool anyone as his father said it was only a game here now his mothers prettiness remained though she was trying to hide it so no one noticed and if hiding something in plain sight wasnt magic krispos didnt know what was he had that thought again the next day when the wild men took their captives into kubrat a couple of passes opened invitingly but the kubratoi headed for neither of them instead they led the videssian farmers down a forest track that seemed destined only to run straight into the side of the mountains strung out along the bottom of that steep twisting gorge people and animals could move but slowly true evening came when they were only part of the way through the mountains its a good trick krispos father said grudgingly as they settled down to camp even if imperial soldiers do come after us a handful of men could hold them out of this pass forever soldiers krispos said amazed that videssian troopers might be riding after the kubratoi had never crossed his mind you mean the empire cares enough about us to fight to get us back his fathers chuckle had little real amusement in it i know the only time you ever saw soldiers was that time a couple of years ago when the harvest was so bad they didnt trust us to sit still for the tax collector unless he had archers at his back but aye they might fight to get us back videssos needs farmers on the ground as much as kubrat does everybody needs farmers boy itd be a hungry world without em most of that went over krispos head soldiers he said again softly so hefor that was how he thought of itwas so important the avtokrator would send soldiers to return him to his proper place then it was as ifwell almost as ifhe had caused those soldiers to be sent and surely that was as ifwell perhaps as ifhe were avtokrator himself it was a good enough dream to fall asleep on anyhow when he woke up the next morning he was certain something was wrong he kept peering around trying to figure out what it was at last his eyes went up to the strip of rock far overhead that the rising sun was painting with light thats the wrong direction he blurted look the suns coming up in the west phos have mercy i think the lads right tzykalas the cobbler said close by he drew a circle on his breast itself the sign of the good gods sun other people started babbling krispos heard the fear in their voices then his father yelled stop it so loudly that they actually did into that sudden silence phostis went on whats more likely that the world has turned upside down or that this canyons wound around so we couldnt guess east from west krispos felt foolish from the expressions on the folk nearby so did they in a surly voice tzykalas said your boy was the one who started us hopping phostis well so he was what about it whos the bigger fool a silly boy or the grown man who takes him seriously someone laughed at that tzykalas flushed his hands curled into fists krispos father stood still and quiet waiting shaking his head and muttering to himself tzykalas turned away two or three more people laughed then krispos father took no notice of them quietly he said the next time things arent the way you expect son think before you talk eh krispos nodded he felt foolish now himself one more thing to remember he thought the bigger he got the more such things he found he wondered how grown people managed to keep everything straight late that afternoon the canyon opened up green land lay ahead land not much different from the fields and forests around krispos home village is that kubrat he asked pointing one of the wild men overheard him is kubrat is good to be back is home he said in halting videssian till then krispos hadnt thought about the raiders having homesto him they had seemed a phenomenon of nature like a blizzard or a flood now though a happy smile was on the kubratis face he looked like a man heading home after some hard work maybe he had little boys at that home or little girls krispos hadnt thought about the raiders having children either he hadnt thought about a lot of things he realized when he said that out loud his father laughed thats because youre still a child as you grow youll work through the ones that matter to you but i want to be able to know about all those things now krispos said it isnt fair maybe not no longer laughing his father put a hand on his shoulder but ill tell you thisa chicken comes out of its egg knowing everything it needs to know to be a chicken theres more to being a man it takes a while to learn so which would you rather be son a chicken or a man krispos folded his hands into his armpits and flapped imaginary wings he let out a couple of loud clucks then squealed when his father tickled his ribs the next morning krispos saw in the distance severalwell what were they neither tents nor houses but something in between they had wheels and looked as if animals could pull them his father did not know what to call them either may i ask one of the kubratoi krispos said his mother started to shake her head but his father said let him tatze we may as well get used to them and theyve liked the boy ever since he stood up to them that first night so he asked one of the wild men trotting by on his pony the kubrati stared at him and started to laugh so the little khagan does not know of yurts eh those are yurts you see the perfect homes for following the flocks will you put us in yurts too krispos liked the idea of being able to live now one place now another but the horseman shook his head you are fanner folk good only for raising plants and as plants are rooted to the ground your houses will be rooted too he spat to show his contempt for people who had to stay in one spot then touched the heels of his boots to his horses flanks and rode off krispos looked after him a little hurt ill travel too one day he said loudly the kubrati paid no attention to him he sighed and went back to his parents i will travel he told his father i will youll travel in a few minutes his father answered theyre getting ready to move us along again thats not what i meant krispos said i meant travel when i want to and go where i want to maybe you will son his father sighed rose and stretched but not today just as captives from many videssian villages had joined together to make one large band on the way to kubrat so now they were taken away from the main groupfive ten twenty families at a time to go off to the lands they would work for their new masters most of the people the kubratoi told to go off with the group that included krispos father were from his village but some were not and some of the villagers had to go someplace else when they protested being broken up the wild men ignored their pleas not as if you were a clan the gods formed a raider said the same scorn in his voice that krispos had heard from the kubrati who explained what yurts were and like that rider he rode away without listening to any reply what does he mean gods krispos asked isnt there just phos and skotos he added after a moment naming the good gods wicked foe in a smaller voice the kubratoi dont know of phos his father told him they worship demons and spirits and who knows what after they die theyll spend forever in skotos ice for their wickedness too i hope there are priests here tatze said nervously well get along whether or not phostis said we know what the good is and well follow it krispos nodded that made sense to him he always tried to be goodunless being bad looked like a lot more fun he hoped phos would forgive him his father usually did and in his mind the good god was a larger version of his father one who watched the whole world instead of just a farm later that day one of the kubratoi pointed ahead and said there your new village its big krispos said look at all the houses his father had a better idea of what to look for aye lots of houses where are the people though hardly any in the fields hardly any in the village he sighed i expect the reason i dont see em is that theyre not there to see as the party of kubratoi and captives drew near a few men and women did emerge from their thatchroofed cottages to stare at the newcomers krispos had never had much these thin poorly clad wretches though showed him other folk could have even less the wild men waved the villages new inhabitants forward to meet the old then they wheeled their horses and rode away rode krispos supposed back to their yurts as he came into the village he saw that many of the houses stood empty some were only half thatched others had rafters felling down still others had chunks of clay gone from the wall to reveal the woven branches within his father sighed again i suppose i should be glad well have roofs over our heads he turned to the families uprooted from videssos we might as well pick out the places well want to live in me i have my eye on that house right there he pointed to an abandoned dwelling as dilapidated as any of the others set near the edge of the village as he and tatze followed by krispos and evdokia headed toward the home they had chosen one of the men who belonged to this village came up to confront him who do you think you are to take a house without so much as a byyourleave the fellow asked even to a farm boy like krispos his accent sounded rustic my names phostis krispos father said who are you to tell me i cant when this place is falling to pieces around you the other newcomers added their voices to his the man looked from them to his own followers who were fewer and less sure of themselves he lost his bluster as a punctured bladder loses air im roukhas he said headman here at least until all you folk came we dont want whats yours roukhas krispos father assured him he smiled a sour smile truth is id be just as glad never to have met you because thatd mean i was still back in videssos even roukhas nodded at that managing a wry chuckle phostis went on were here though and i dont see much point in having to build from scratch when therere all these places ready to hand aye well put that way i suppose you have a point roukhas stepped backward and waved phostis toward the house he had chosen as if his concession were some sort of signal the rest of the longtime inhabitants of the village hurried up to mingle with the new arrivals indeed they fell on them like longlost cousinsas krispos thought a little surprised at himself they were they didnt even know what the avtokrators name was krispos mother marveled as the family settled down to sleep on the ground inside their new house aye well they need to worry about the khagan more his father answered phostis yawned an enormous yawn a lot of em too were born right here not back home i shouldnt be surprised if they didnt even remember there was an avtokrator but still krispos mother said they talked with us as we would with someone from the capital from videssos the citysomeone besides the tax man i mean and were from the back of beyond no tatze we just got there his father answered if you doubt it wait till you see how busy were going to be he yawned again tomorrow life on a farm is never easy over the next weeks and months krispos found out just how hard it could be if he was not gathering straw for his father to bind into yealms and put up on the roof to repair the thatch then he was fetching clay from the streambank to mix with roots and more straw and goat hair and dung to make daub to patch the walls making and slapping on the daub was at least fun he had the chance to get filthy while doing just what his parents told him he carried more clay for his mother to shape into a baking oven like the one back at his old village it looked like a beehive he spent a lot of time with his mother and little sister working in the vegetable plots close by the houses except for the few still kept up by the handful of people here before the newcomers arrived those had been allowed to run down he and evdokia weeded until their hands blistered then kept right on they plucked bugs and snails from the beans and cabbages the onions and vetch the beets and turnips krispos yelled and screamed and jumped up and down to scare away marauding crows and sparrows and starlings that was fun too he also kept the village chickens and ducks away from the vegetables soon his father got a couple of laying hens by doing some timber cutting for one of the established villagers krispos took care of them too and spread their manure over the vegetables he did more scarecrow duty out in the fields of wheat and oats and barley along with the rest of the children with more new arrivals than boys and girls born in the village that time in the fields was also a time of testing to see who was strong and who was clever krispos held his own and then some even boys who had two more summers than he did soon learned to give him a wide berth he managed to find time for mischief roukhas never figured out who put the rotten egg under the straw right where he liked to lay his head the farmer and his family did sleep outdoors for the next two days until their house aired out enough to be livable again and evdokia ran calling for her mother one day when she came back from washing herself in the stream and found her clothes moving by themselves unlike roukhas tatze had no trouble deducing how the toad had got into evdokias shift krispos slept on his stomach that night helping one of the slower newcomers get his roof into shape for the approaching fall rains earned krispos father a pigletand krispos the job of looking after it its a sow too his father said with some satisfaction next year well breed it and have plenty of pigs of our own krispos looked forward to pork stew and ham and baconbut not to more pigtending sheep the village also had a small flock owned in common more for wool than for meat with so many people arriving with only the clothes on their backs the sheep were sheared a second time that year and the lambs too krispos mother spent a while each evening spinning thread and she began to teach evdokia the art she set up a loom between two forked posts outside the house so she could turn the spun yarn into cloth there were no cattle the kubratoi kept them all cattle in kubrat were wealth almost like gold a pair of donkeys plowed for the villagers instead of oxen krispos father fretted over that saying oxen have horns to attach the yoke to but with donkeys you have to fasten it round their necks so they choke if they pull hard against it but roukhas showed him the special donkeycollars they had modeled after the ones the kubratoi used for the horses that pulled their yurts he came away from the demonstration impressed who would have thought the barbarians could come up with something so useful what they had not come up with was any way to make grapes grow north of the mountains everyone ate apples and pears instead and drank beer the newcomers never stopped grumbling about that though some of the beer had honey added to it so it was almost as sweet as wine not having grapes made life different in small ways as well as large one day krispos father brought home a couple of rabbits he had killed in the field his mother chopped the meat fine spiced it with garlicand then stopped short how can i stuff it into grape leaves if there arent any grape leaves she sounded more upset at not being able to cook what she wanted than she had over being uprooted and forced to trek to kubrat it made the uprooting hit home phostis patted her on the shoulder turned to his son run over to roukhas house and find out what ivera uses in place of grape leaves quick now krispos soon came scampering back cabbage he announced importantly it wont be the same his mother said it wasnt but krispos thought it was good harvest came sooner than it would have in the warmer south the grown men cut first the barley then the oats and wheat going through the fields with sickles krispos and the rest of the children followed to pick up the grains that fell to the ground most went into the sacks they carried a few they ate and after the grain was gathered the men went through the fields again cutting down the golden straw and tying it into sheaves then the children two to a sheaf dragged it back to the village finally the men and women hauled buckets of dung from the middens to manure the ground for the next planting once the grain was harvested it was time to pick the beans and to chop down the plants so they could be fed to the pigs and then with the grain and beans in deep storage pitsexcept for some of the barley which was set aside for brewingthe whole village seemed to take a deep breath i was worried when we came here whether wed be able to grow enough to get all of us through the winter krispos father said one evening taking a long pull on a mug of beer now though phos the lord of the great and good mind be praised i think we have enough and to spare his mother said dont speak too soon come on tatze what could go wrong his father answered smiling its in the ground and safe two days later the kubratoi came they came in greater numbers and with more weapons than theyd had escorting the new villagers away from the mass of videssian captives at their shouted orders the villagers opened one storage pit in three and loaded the precious grain onto packhorses the wild men had brought with them when they were done the kubratoi trotted off to plunder the next village krispos father stood a long time staring down into the empty yarddeep holes in the sandy soil back of the village finally with great deliberation he spat into one of them locusts he said bitterly they ate us out just like locusts we would have had plenty but well all be hungry before spring comes we ought to fight them next time phostis said one of the younger men who had come from the same village as krispos and his family make them pay for what they steal but krispos father sadly shook his head i wish we could stankos when i see what theyve done to us theyd massacre us though i fear theyre soldiers and its the nature of soldiers to take farmers endure roukhas was still phostis rival for influence in the village but now he agreed with him four or five years ago the village of gomatou over a couple of days west of here tried rising up against the kubratoi he said well what happened to it stankos asked its not there any more roukhas said bleakly we watched the smoke go up into the sky no one spoke of rebellion again to krispos charging out against the kubratoi with sword and lance and bow and driving them all back north over the astris river to the plains from which theyd come would have been the most glorious thing in the world it was one of his playmates favorite games in truth though the wild men were the ones with the arms and armor and horses and more important still both the skill and will to use them farmers endure krispos thought he didnt like just enduring he wondered if that meant he shouldnt be a farmer what else could he be though he had no idea the village got through the winter which was fiercer than any krispos remembered even the feast and celebrations of midwinters day the day when the sun finally turned north in the sky had to be forgotten because of the blizzard raging outside krispos grew to hate being cooped up and idle in the house for weeks on end south of the mountains even midwinter gave days when he could go out to play in the snow those were few and far between here even a freezing trip out to empty the chamber pot on the dung heap or help his father haul back firewood made him glad to return to the warmif stuffy and smokyair inside spring came at last and brought with it mud almost as oppressive as the snow had been plowing harrowing sowing and weeding followed plunging krispos back into the endless round of farm work and making him long for the lazy days of winter once more that fall the kubratoi came to take their unfair share of the harvest once more the year after that they came a couple of other times riding through the fields and trampling down long swathes of growing grain as they rode they whooped and yelled and grinned at the helpless farmers whose labor they were wrecking drunk the lot of em krispos father said the night after it happened the first time his mouth tight with disgust pity they didnt fall off their horses and break their fool necksthatd send em down to skotos where they belong better to thank phos that they didnt come into the village and hurt people instead of plants krispos mother said phostis only scowled and shook his head listening krispos found himself agreeing with his father what the kubratoi had done was wrong and theyd done it on purpose if he deliberately did something wrong he got walloped for it the villagers were not strong enough to wallop the kubratoi so let them spend eternity with the dark god and see how they liked that when fall came of course the kubratoi took as much grain as they had before if thanks to them less was left for the village that was the villages hard luck the wild men played those same games the next year that year too a woman who had gone down to the stream to bathe never came back when the villagers went looking for her they found hoofprints from several horses in the clay by the streambank krispos father held his mother very close when the news swept through the village now i will thank phos tatze he said it could have been you one dawn late in the third spring after krispos came to kubrat barking dogs woke the villagers even before they would have risen on their own rubbing their eyes they stumbled from their houses to find themselves staring at a couple of dozen armed and mounted kubratoi the riders carried torches they scowled down from horseback at the confused and frightened farmers krispos hair tried to rise at the back of his neck he hadnt thought lately about the night the kubratoi had kidnapped him and everyone else in his village now the memoriesand the terrorof that night flooded back but where else could the wild men take them from here why would they want to one of the riders drew his sword the villagers drew back a pace someone moaned but the kubrati did not attack with the curved blade he pointed instead westward you come with us he said in gutturally accented videssian now krispos father asked the questions the boy was thinking where why where i say man bound to the earth because i say this time the horsemans gesture with the sword was threatening at nine krispos knew more of the world and its harsh ways than he had at six still he did not hesitate he sprang toward the kubrati his father grabbed at him to haul him back too late you leave him alone krispos shouted up at the rider the man snarled at him teeth gleaming white in the torchlights flicker the sword swung up krispos mother screamed then the wild man hesitated he thrust his torch down almost into krispos face suddenly astonishingly the snarl became a grin the kubrati said something in his own language his comrades exclaimed then roared laughter he dropped back into videssian ha little khagan you forget me good thing i remember you or you die this morning you defy me once before in videssos how does farmer boy come to have manskubrati mansspirit in him krispos hadnt recognized the rider whod captured him and his family if the man recognized him though he would turn it to his advantage why are you here what do you want with us now to take you away the scowl came back to the kubratis face videssos has paid ransom for you we have to let you go he sounded anything but delighted at the prospect ransom the word spread through the villagers at first slowly and in hushed disbelieving tones then louder and louder till they all shouted it nearly delirious with joy ransom they danced round the kubratoi past hatred and fear dissolved in the powerful water of freedom it was krispos thought like a midwinters day celebration somehow magically dropped into springtime soon riders and villagers were hoisting wooden mugs of beer together barrel after barrel was broken open little would be left for later but what did that matter they would not be here later a new cry took the place of ransom were going home evdokia was puzzled what does everyone mean krispos were going home isnt this home no silly the place mother and father talk about all the time is our real home oh his sister barely remembered videssos how is it different its krispos wasnt too clear on that himself not after almost three years its better he finished at last that seemed to satisfy her he wondered if it was true his own memories of life south of the mountains had grown hazy the kubratoi seemed in as big a hurry to get rid of their videssian captives as they had been to get them into kubrat in the first place evdokia had trouble keeping up sometimes krispos father had to carry her for a stretch even if it shamed her krispos made the three days of hard marching on his own but they left his feet blistered and him sleeping like a dead man each night at last the villagers and hundreds more like them reached a broad shallow valley with an eye rapidly growing wiser to the ways of farming krispos saw that it was better land than what his village tilled he also saw several large and splendid yurts and in the distance the flocks by which the kubratoi lived that explained why the valley was not farmed the wild men herded the videssians into pens much like those in which the peasants kept goats they posted guards around them so no one would even think of clambering over the branches and sneaking off fear began to replace the farmers jubilation are we truly to be ransomed someone shouted or sold like so many beasts you keep still big ceremony coming tomorrow yelled a kubrati who spoke videssian he climbed up onto the fencing of the pen and pointed see over there there tents of videssos men and empires banner too no tricks now krispos looked in the direction the mans arm had given he was too short to see out of the pen pick me up father his father did then with a grunt of effort set the boy on his shoulders krispos saw the tops of several square tents not far from the yurts hed noticed before sure enough a skyblue flag with a gold sunburst on it snapped in front of one of them is that videssos banner he asked try as he would he could not recall it aye its ours his father said the tax collector always used to show it when he came im gladder to see it now than i was then ill tell you that he put krispos down let me see my turn let me see evdokia squealed phostis sighed then smiled he picked up his daughter the next morning the peasants got far better fare than theyd had on the trek to the valley roasted mutton and beef with plenty of the flat wheatcakes the kubratoi baked in place of leavened bread krispos ate till his belly felt like bursting from joy and he washed down the meat with a long swig from a leather bucket of mares milk i wonder what the ceremony the wild man talked about will be like his mother said i wish we could see more of it his father added werent for us after all it wouldnt be happening not right to leave us penned up while its going on a little later the kubratoi let the farmers out of the pens this way this way the nomads who spoke videssian shouted urging the crowd along toward the yurts and tents krispos spotted the wild men he had yelled at on the day he was captured and on the day he started back to freedom the kubrati was peering into the mass of peasants as they walked by him his eye caught krispos he grinned ho little khagan i look for you you come with meyou part of ceremony what me why as he spoke though krispos cut across the flow of people toward the kubrati the nowdismounted rider took him by the shoulder as his father did sometimes khagan omurtag he want some videssian to talk to envoy from empire stand for all you people in magic while envoy paying gold to get you back i tell him about you how bold you are he say all right oh oh my excitement ousted fear khagan omurtag in krispos imagination was nine feet high with teeth like a wolfs and an envoy from the avtokrator should be even more magnificenttall handsome heroic clad in gilded chain mail and carrying an enormous sword reality was less dramatic as reality has a way of being the kubratoi had built a little platform of hides stretched across timbers none of the four men who stood on it was nine feet tall none wore gilded chain mail then the wild man lifted krispos and he was on the platform too pretty boy murmured a short sourfaced man in a robe of green silk shot through with silver threads he turned to the kubrati standing across from him all right omurtag hes here get on with your miserable heathen rite if you think you must krispos waited for the sky to fall no matter that the khagan of kubrat was neither especially tall nor especially lupinewas in fact quite an ordinarylooking kubrati save that his furs were of marten and sable not fox and rabbit he was the khagan talking that way to him had to cost a man his head but omurtag only threw back his head and laughed sweet as always iakovitzes he said his videssian was as smooth and polished as the envoys and a good deal more so than krispos the magic seals the bargain as well you know phos watches over all bargains from above the sun iakovitzes nodded to the man in a blue robe behind him dim memories stirred in krispos hed seen such men with shaved heads before though not in kubrat the fellow was a priest so you say omurtag answered my enaree here knows the spirits of ground and wind they are closer than any lofty god above the sun and i trust them further the enaree was the first grown man krispos had ever seen who cut off his beard it made him look like an enormous little boytill one looked into his eyes they saw farther than boys farther than mens had any business seeing too krispos thought nervously the khagan turned to him come here lad for a split second krispos hung back then he thought that he had been chosen for his boldness he straightened his back put his chin up and walked over to omurtag the tightstretched hides vibrated under his feet as if they were an enormous drumhead we have your people omurtag intoned taking hold of krispos arm with his left hand his grip was firm and hard his right hand plucked a dagger from his belt set it at the boys throat krispos stood very still the khagan went on they are ours to do with as we will the empire has gold and will pay for their safe return iakovitzes sounded of all things bored krispos was suddenly sure hed performed this ceremony many times before let us see that gold the khagan said his voice was still formal but anything but bored he stared avidly at the pouch iakovitzes withdrew from within a fold of his robe the videssian envoy drew out a single bright coin gave it to omurtag let this goldpiece stand for all as the boy does iakovitzes said omurtag passed the coin to the enaree he muttered over it the hand that was not holding it moved in tiny passes krispos saw the videssian priest scowl but the man held his peace the enaree spoke in the kubrati tongue he declares it is good gold omurtag said to iakovitzes of course its good gold iakovitzes snapped breaking the ritual the empire hasnt coined anything else for hundreds of years should we start now it would be for something more important than ransoming ragged peasants the khagan laughed out loud i think your tongue was stung by a wasp one day iakovitzes he said then returned to the pattern of the ceremony he declares it is good gold thus the people are yours he gently pushed krispos toward iakovitzes the envoys touch was warm alive he moved his hand on krispos back in a way that was strange and familiar at the same time hello pretty boy iakovitzes murmured krispos recognized the tone and realized why the caress had that familiarity to it his father and mother acted like this with each other when they felt like making love having lived all his life in a oneroom house with his parents having slept in the same bed with them he knew what sex was about that variations could exist variations that might include him and iakovitzes had not occurred to him before though now that it did he found he did not much care for it he moved half a step away from the avtokrators envoy iakovitzes jerked back his hand as if surprised to discover what it had been up to glancing at him krispos doubted he was his face was a mask that must have taken years to perfect seeing krispos eye upon him he gave a tiny shrug if you dont want it too bad for you he seemed to say aloud the words he spoke were quite different it is accomplished he said loudly then he turned to the crowd of peasants gathered in front of the platform people of videssos you are redeemed he cried the phosguarded avtokrator rhaptes redeems you from your long and horrid captivity in this dark and barbarous land from your toil under the degrading domination of brutal and terrible masters masters no rather let me call them robbers for they robbed you of the liberty rightfully yours the speech went on for some time krispos was at first impressed and then overwhelmed with the buckets of big words iakovitzes poured over the heads of the fanners over our heads is right the boy thought he was missing one word in three and doubted anyone else in the crowd was doing much better he yawned seeing that omurtag grinned and winked iakovitzes caught up now in the full flow of his rhetoric never noticed the khagan waggled a finger krispos walked back over to him again iakovitzes paid no attention though krispos felt the eyes of both priest and enaree upon him here lad omurtag saidsoftly so as not to disrupt iakovitzes speech you take this as a reminder of the day he handed krispos the goldpiece iakovitzes had given him to symbolize the videssians ransoming behind iakovitzes the bluerobed priest of phos jerked violently as if a bee had stung him he made the circular sunsign over the left side of his breast and omurtags own enaree grabbed the khagan and whispered harshly and urgently into his ear omurtag shoved the seer aside so hard that the enaree almost tumbled off the edge of the platform the khagan snarled something at him in the kubrati tongue then returned to videssian to tell krispos the fool says that since this coin was used in our ceremony here with it i have given you the videssian people whatever will you do with them little farmer boy he laughed uproariously at his own wit loud enough to make iakovitzes pause and glare at him before resuming his harangue krispos laughed too past tunic and sandalsand now this coinhad never owned anything and the idea of having a whole people was absurd anyhow go on back to your mother and father omurtag said when he had control of himself again krispos hopped down from the platform he kept tight hold of the goldpiece omurtag had given him the sooner were out of kubrat and the faster were back in civilization the better iakovitzes declared to whoever would listen he pressed the pace back to videssos harder than the kubratoi had when they were taking the peasants away the redeemed videssians did not leave by the same winding narrow pass through which they had entered kubrat they used a wider easier route some miles farther west an old graveled highway ran down it one that became broad and well maintained on the videssian side of the mountains youd think the kubrati road used to be part of this one here krispos remarked neither of his parents answered they were too worn with walking and with keeping evdokia on her feet to have energy left over for speculation but the priest who had gone to kubrat with iakovitzes heard his name krispos had learned was pyrrhos ever since omurtag gave the boy that goldpiece pyrrhos had been around a good deal as if keeping an eye on him now from muleback the priest said you speak the truth lad once the road was one for once the land was one once the whole world near enough was one krispos frowned one world well of course it is sir priest what else could it be trudging along beside him phostis smiled in that moment son sounded very much like father one world ruled by videssos i mean pyrrhos said but then three hundred years ago on account of the sins of the videssian people phos suffered the wild khamorth tribes to roll off the pardrayan plain and rape away the great tracts of land that are now the khaganates of thatagush khatrishand kubrat those lands remain rightfully ours one day when phos the lord of the great and good mind judges us worthy we shall reclaim them he sketched the sunsymbol over his heart krispos walked a while in silence thinking about what the priest had said three hundred years meant nothing to him pyrrhos might as well have said a long time ago or even once upon a time but sin nowthat was interesting what sort of sins the boy asked pyrrhos long narrow face grew even longer and narrower as his thinlipped mouth pursed in disapproval the same sins skotos he spat in the roadway to show his hatred of the dark god always sets forth as snares for mankind the sin of division from which sprang civil war the sin of arrogance which led the fools of that time to scorn the barbarians till too late the sin of luxury which made them cling to the great riches they had and not exert themselves to preserve those riches for future generations at that krispos father lifted his head reckon the sin of luxurys one we dont have to worry about here he said seeing as i dont think theres above three people in this whole crowd with a second shirt to call their own you are better for it the priest exclaimed yet the sin of luxury lives on doubt it not in videssos the city scores of nobles have robes for each day of the year sir yet bend all their energy not to helping their neighbors who have less but rather only to acquiring more more and ever more their robes will not warm them against the chill of skotos ice his sermon did not have the effect hed hoped a robe for each day of the year krispos father said in wonder scowling angrily pyrrhos rode off phostis turned to krispos howd you like to have that many robes son that sounds like too many to me krispos said but i would like a second shirt so would i boy his father said laughing so would i a day or so later a company of videssian troopers joined the returning peasants their chainmail shirts jingled as they came up an accompaniment to the heavy drumroll of their horses hooves iakovitzes handed their leader a scroll the captain read it glanced at the farmers and nodded he gave iakovitzes a formal salute with clenched right fist over his heart iakovitzes returned the salute then rode south at a trot so fast it was almost a gallop pyrrhos left the peasants at the same time but iakovitzes horse quickly outdistanced his mule my lord be so good as to wait for your servant pyrrhos called after him iakovitzes was so far ahead by then that krispos who was near the front of the band of peasants could barely hear his reply if you think ill crawl to the city at the pace of a shambling mule priest you can bloody well think again the noble soon disappeared round a bend in the road more sedately pyrrhos followed later that day a dirt track from the east ran into the highway the videssian captain halted the farmers while he checked the scroll iakovitzes had given him fifteen here he told his soldiers they counted off the fifteen men they saw and in a moment fifteen families escorted by three or four horsemen headed down that track the rest started south again another stop came before long this time twenty families were detached from the main group theyre treating us just like the kubratoi did krispos mother said in some dismay did you expect wed get to go back to our old village tatze his father said she nodded i didnt he told her weve been gone a good while now someone else will be working our fields i suppose well go to fill some holes thatve opened up since so it proved the next morning phostis was one of a group of thirty peasant men told off by the videssian soldiers along with the others and their kinsfolk he tatze krispos and evdokia left the main road for a winding path that led west they reached their new village late that afternoon at the sight of it even phostis resignation wore thin he glared up at one of the troopers who had come with the farmers the kubratoi gave us more to work with than this he said bitterly krispos watched his fathers shoulders slump having to start over from nothing twice in three years could make any man lose heart but the videssian soldier said take another look at the fellows waiting there for you farmer might be youll change your mind phostis looked so did krispos all hed noticed before was that there werent very many men in the village he remembered arriving at the one in kubrat his father was right more people had been waiting there than here and he saw no one out in the fields so what good could this handful of men be something about the way they stood as they waited for the newcomers to reach them made krispos scratch his head it was different from the way the villagers in kubrat had stood but he could not put his finger on how his father could i dont believe those are farmers at all he said slowly right the first time the trooper grinned at him theyre pensionedoff veterans the avtokrator phos bless him has established five or six like them in every village were resettling with you people but what good will they be to us save maybe as strong backs phostis said if theyre not farmers well have to show them how to do everything maybe you will at first the soldier said but you wont have to show em the same thing twice very often ill warrant and could be theyll have a thing or two to teach you folk as well krispos father snorted what could they teach us hed meant that for a scornful rhetorical question but the horseman answered it bow and sword spear and shield maybe even a bit of horsework the next time the kubratoi come to haul you people away could be youll give em a bit of a surprise tell me now wouldnt you like that before his father could answer krispos threw back his head and howled like a wolf phostis started to laugh then stopped abruptly his hands curled into fists and he bayed too a deep solid underpinning to his sons high yips more and more farmers began to howl and finally even some of the soldiers they entered the new village like a pack at full cry if the kubratoi could only hear us krispos thought proudly theyd never dare come south of the mountains again he was after all still a boy ii for some years the kubratoi did not raid into videssos sometimes in absent moments krispos wondered if phos had heard his thought and struck fear into the wild mens hearts once when he was about twelve he said as much to one of the retired veterans a tough graybeard called varades varades laughed till tears came ah lad i wish it were that easy id sooner spend my time thinking bad thoughts at my foes than fighting any day but more likely i reckon is that old omurtag still hasnt gone through all the gold rhaptes sent him to buy you back when he does when he does well drive the kubratoi away krispos made cutandthrust motions with the wooden sword he was holding grown men these days practiced with real weapons the veterans had been issued enough for everyone a spear and a hunting bow hung on the wall of krispos house maybe varades said just maybe if its a small band bent on robbery instead of a fullsized invasion the kubratoi know how to fight not much else maybe but that for certain you farmers wont ever be anything but amateur soldiers so i wouldnt even try taking em on without a good advantage in numbers what then krispos said if theres too many do we let them herd us off to kubrat again better that than getting killed to no purpose and having them herd off your mother and sisters even so krispos second sister kosta had just turned two he thought of her being forced to trek north and of his mother trying to care for her and evdokia both after a moment he thought of his mother trying to do all that while mourning his father and him he did not like any of those thoughts maybe the kubratoi just wont come he said at last varades laughed again as boisterously as before oh aye and maybe one of the village jackassesd win all the hippodrome races down in videssos the city but youd better not count on it he grew serious i dont want you to mistake my meaning boy sooner or later theyll come the whoresons always do by the time krispos was fourteen he was close to being as tall as his father the down on his face began to turn dark his voice cracked and broke generally at moments when he least wanted it to he was already doing a mans work in the fields now though varades and the other veterans let him start using real arms the wirewound hilt of a steel sword felt nothing like the wooden toy hed swung before with it in his hand he felt like a soldiermore like a hero he felt like a hero that is until idalkosthe veteran who had given him the bladeproceeded to disarm him half a dozen times in the next ten minutes the last time instead of letting him pick up the sword and go on with the lesson idalkos chased him halfway across the village youd better run he roared pounding after krispos if i catch you ill carve hams off you only one thing saved krispos from being even more humiliated than he was the veteran had terrorized a good many people the same waysome of them phostis age finally puffing idalkos stopped here come back krispos he called youve had your first lesson now which is that its not as easy as it looks it sure isnt krispos said as he walked slowly back toward idalkos he heard someone giggle his head whipped around there in her doorway stood zoranne the daughter of tzykalas the cobbler a pretty girl about krispos age his ears felt on fire if shed watched his whole ignominious flight pay the chit no mind idalkos said as if reading his thoughts you did what you had to do i had a sword and you didnt but suppose you didnt have room to run suppose you were in the middle of a whole knot of men when you lost your blade what would you do then die krispos thought he wished he could die so he wouldnt have to remember zorannes giggle but that wasnt the answer idalkos was looking for wrestle i suppose he said after a moment would you krispos put down the sword he set himself leaning forward slightly from the waist feet wide apart here im an old man see if you can throw me krispos sprang at him hed always done well in the scuffles among boys he was bigger and stronger than the ones his own age and quicker too if he could pay back idalkos for some of his embarrassment the next thing he knew his face was in the dirt the veteran riding his back he heard zoranne laugh again and had to fight back tears of fury you fight dirty he snarled you bet i do idalkos said cheerfully want to learn how maybe youll toss me right through a dung heap one fine day impress your girl there shes not my girl krispos said as the veteran let him up still the picture was attractiveand so was the idea of throwing idalkos through a dung heap all right show me what you did a hand on the arm a push on the back and then you twistsoand take the fellow youre fighting down over your leg here ill run you through it slow a couple of times i see krispos said after a while by then they were both filthy from spilling each other in the dirt now how do i block it when someone tries to do it to me idalkos scarseamed face lit up you know lad ive taught my little trick to half a dozen men here maybe more youre the first one with the wit to ask that question what you do is this that was the start of it for the rest of that summer and into fall until it got too cold to spend much time outside krispos learned wrestling from idalkos in every spare moment he had those moments were never enough to suit him not squeezed as they were into the work of the harvest care for the villages livestock and occasional work with weapons other than krispos increasingly wellhoned body thing is youre pretty good and youll get better idalkos said one chilly day in early autumn he flexed his wrist winced flexed it again no thats not broken after all but i wont be sorry when the snow comes no indeed i wontgive me a chance to stay indoors and heal up till spring all the veterans talked like that and all of them were in better shape than any farmer their ageor ten years younger too just when someone started to believe them theyd do something like what idalkos had done the first time they wrestled so krispos only snorted i suppose that means youll be too battered to come out with the rest of us on midwinters day he said voice full of syrupy regret think youre smart dont you idalkos made as if to grab krispos he sprang backone of the things hed learned was to take nothing for granted the veteran went on the first year i dont celebrate midwinters day sonny you go out to my grave and make the sunsign over it cause thats where ill be snow started falling six weeks before midwinters day the day of the winter solstice most of the veterans had served in the far west against makuran they complained about what a hard winter it was going to be no one who had spent time in kubrat paid any attention to them the farmers went about their business mending fences repairing plows and other tools doing woodwork and getting ready for the chief festival of their year midwinters day dawned freezing but clear low in the south the sun hurried across the sky the villagers prayers went with it to keep skotos from snatching it out of the heavens altogether and plunging the world into eternal darkness as if to add to the light bonfires burned in the village square krispos ran at one his hide boots kicking up snow he leaped over the blaze burn illluck he shouted when he was right above it a moment later more snow flew as he thudded down evdokia came right behind him her wish against bad luck came out more as a screamthis was the first year she was big enough to leap fires krispos steadied her when she landed clumsily she grinned up at him her cheeks glowed with cold and excitement whos that she said peering back through the shimmering air above the flames to see who came next oh its zoranne come on lets get out of her way pushed by his sister krispos walked away from the fire his eyes were not the only ones in the village that followed zoranne as she flew through the air over it she landed almost as heavily as evdokia had if evdokia hadnt made him move he thought he could have been the one to help zoranne back up younger sisters really are a nuisance he declared loftily evdokia showed him he was right she scooped up a handful of snow and pressed it against the side of his neck then ran away while he was still writhing bellowing mingled outrage and laughter he chased her pausing a couple of times to make a snowball and fling it at her one snowball missed evdokia but caught varades in the shoulder so you want to play that way do you the veteran roared he threw one back at krispos krispos ducked the snowball hit someone behind him soon everyone was throwing themat friends foes and whoever happened to be in the wrong place at the right time peoples hats and sheepskin coats were so splashed with white that the village began to look as if it had been taken over by snowmen out came several men phostis among them wearing dresses they must have borrowed from a couple of the biggest heaviest women in the village they put on a wicked burlesque of what they imagined their wives and daughters did while they were out working in the fields it consisted of gossiping pointing fingers while they gossiped eating and drinking wine lots of wine krispos father did a fine turn as a tipsy lady who was talking so furiously she never noticed falling off her stool but lay on the ground still chattering away the male spectators chortled the women pelted the actors with more snowballs krispos ducked back into his house for a cup of wine for himself he wished it was hot but no one wanted to stay indoors and tend a pot of mulled wine not today the sun set as he came back to the square the villages women and girls were having their revenge dressed in mens short tunics and doing their best not to shiver several of them pretended to be hunters bragging about the immense size of their killtill one of them fastidiously holding it by the tail displayed a mouse this time the watching women cheered and most of the men jeered and threw snow krispos did neither one of the female hunters was zoranne the tunic she wore came down only to midthigh her nipples stiff from the cold pressed against its thin fabric as he looked and looked he felt a heat grow in him that had nothing to do with the wine hed drunk at last the women skipped away to thunderous applause more skits came in quick succession these mocking the foibles of particular villagers tzykalas efforts to grow hair on his bald headin the skit he raised a fine crop of hayvarades habit of breaking wind and more then krispos watched in dismay as a couple of fanners plainly intended to be idalkos and him practiced wrestling the embrace in which they ended was more obscene than athletic the villagers whooped and cheered them on krispos stamped away head down he was at an age when he could laugh at others but could not bear to have them laugh at him all he wanted to do was get away from the hateful noise because he was not watching where he was going he almost ran into someone coming back toward the center of the village sorry he muttered and kept walking whats wrong krispos he looked up startled it was zorannes voice shed changed back into her own long skirt and a coat and looked a good deal warmer for it whats wrong she said again those stupid jokers back there thats what he burst out making as if when idalkos and i wrestle we dont just wrestle half his rage evaporated as soon as he said out loud what was bothering him he began to feel foolish instead zoranne did not help by starting to laugh its midwinters day krispos she said its all in fun he knew that which only made matters worse she went on anything can happen on midwinters day and no one will pay any mind to it the day after am i right i suppose so he sounded surly even to himself besides she said its not as if what they made out was true is it of course not he said so indignantly that his changing voice left the last word a highpitched squeak as if from nowhere the memory of iakovitzes hand on his back stirred in his mind maybe that was part of why the skit had got under his skin so she did not seem to notice well then she said back by the bonfires most of the villagers erupted in laughter at some new skit krispos realized how quiet it was out here near the edge of the village how alone he and zoranne were the memory of how shed looked capering in that brief tunic rose again without his conscious mind willing it he took a step toward her at the same moment she was taking a step toward him they almost bumped into each other she laughed again anything can happen on midwinters day she said softly when krispos fled that embarrassing skit he hadnt worried about picking a direction perhaps not surprisingly hed ended up not far from his own house as usual his father had preferred one on the outskirts of the village suddenly that seemed like a blessing from phos krispos gathered his courage reached out and took zorannes arm she pressed herself to his side his heart hammering he led her to his doorway they went inside together he quickly shut the door behind them to keep the heat from the firepit in the middle of the floor from getting out wed better hurry he said anxiously just then more laughter came from the center of the village zoranne smiled we have some time i think she shrugged off her coat got out of her skirt krispos tried to undress and watch her at the same time and almost fell over finally after what seemed much too long they sank to the straw bedding krispos soon learned what everyone must that knowing how man and woman join is not enough to keep that first joining from being one surprise after another nothing he thought he knew made him ready for the taste of zorannes soft skin against his lips the feel of her breast in his hand the way the whole world seemed to disappear but for her body and his as it does it returned all too quickly youre squashing me zoranne said brisk and practical she sat up and picked bits of straw from her hair then from his given a little more time and a little less nervousness he might have enjoyed that as it was her touch made him spring up and scramble into his clothes she dressed toonot with that frantic haste but not taking her time either something else he did not know was whether hed pleased her or even how to find out will we he began the rest of the question seemed stuck in his mouth zoranne did not help much i dont know will we i hope so krispos blurted men always hope sothats what women always say anyhow she unbent a bit then well maybe we willbut not now now we ought to get back to where everyone else is he opened the door the freezing air outside hit him like a blow zoranne said we should go back separately the grandmothers have enough to gossip about already oh krispos had wanted to shout it from the housetops if zoranne didnt all right he could not keep the disappointment out of his voice though come on she said impatiently i told you this wouldnt be the last time as a matter of fact she hadnt quite said that before thus encouraged krispos willingly shut the door again and watched zoranne slip off into the night she kept her word if not as often as krispos would have liked every taste he had of her every time the two of them managed not to be busy and to be able to find privacy only made him want her more not knowing a better name he thought of that as love then for a while his own afternoons were occupied varades taught him and a couple of younger boys their letters he learned them without too much trouble being able to read and write his own name was almost as exciting in its own way as sporting with zoranne he would have liked it even more had the village had anything much to read why did you show us our letters if we cant use them he complained to varades to give myself something to do as much as any other reason the veteran answered frankly he thought for a moment tell you what we might beg a copy of phos scripture the next time a bluerobe comes around ill go through it with you best i can when varades asked him a couple of weeks later the priest nodded ill have one copied out for you straightaway he promised krispos who was standing behind varades felt like cheering until the man went on you understand it will take a few months the monasteries scriptoria are always behind im sorry to say months krispos said in dismay he was sure he would forget everything before the book arrived but he did not his father made him scratch letters in the dirt every day high time we had somebody in the family who can read phostis said youll be able to keep the tax man from cheating us any worse than tax men always do krispos got another chance to use his skill that spring before either the scripture or the tax collector arrived zorannes father tzykalas had spent the winter months making half a dozen pairs of fancy boots when the roads dried out enough to be passable he took them to imbros to sell he came back with several goldpiecesand portentous news the old avtokrator phos guard his soul has died he declared to the men he met in the village square everyone made the sunsign the passing of an emperor was never to be taken lightly phostis put into words what they were all thinking his sons but a boy not so tzykalas nodded aye about the age of krispos here id say judging by his coin the cobbler dug it out of his pouch to show the other villagers the new portrait his name is let me read it krispos exclaimed please he held out his hand for the goldpiece reluctantly tzykalas passed it to him it was only a little wider than his thumbnail all he could make out from the image was that the new avtokrator was as tzykalas had said too young to have a beard he put the coin close to his face so he could make out the tiny letters of its inscription his name is anthimos so it is tzykalas said grumpily he snatched the goldpiece out of krispos hand too late it occurred to the youth that he had just stolen a big part of tzykalas news too bad he thought no matter how he felt about zoranne hed never been fond of her father that was one reason he hadnt proposed to her the idea of having the cobbler as a fatherinlaw was anything but appealing what he wanted to do was go home and dig up the goldpiece hed got from omurtag so he could read it hed buried it beside the house for luck when his family came to this new village and theyd never been desperate enough to make him dig it up and spend it but no he decided not now if he did leave tzykalas would only think him ruder yet a boy for avtokrator someone said that wont be goodwholl keep the plows furrow straight till he learns how to guide it that i can tell you tzykalas said sounding important again the talk in imbros is that rhaptes brother petronas will be regent for his nephew until anthimos comes of age petronas eh things wont be too bad then drawn by the sight of several men standing around talking varades had come up in time to hear tzykalas last bit of news the veteran went on i fought under him against makuran hes an able soldier and no ones fool either what if he seizes the throne for himself then krispos father said what if he does phostis varades said why would it matter to the likes of us one way or the other krispos father thought about it for a moment he spread his hands there you have me varades why indeed zoranne stood in the doorway of tzykalas house she shook her head no why not surprised and irritated krispos waved his hand to show how empty the village was everyones in the farther fields for the rest of the day and probably tomorrow too even your fathers gone off to buy some new awls you said weve never had a better chance no she repeated eat why not he put a hand on her arm she didnt pull away not physically but she might as well have he let his hand fall i just dont want to she said why he persisted do you really want to know she waited till she saw him nod all right ill tell you why yphantes asked me to marry him the other day and i told him yes the last time krispos had felt so stunned and breathless was when idalkos kicked him in the pit of the stomach one day while they were wrestling hed never paid any particular attention to yphantes before along with everyone else in the village hed been sad when the mans wife died in childbirth a couple of years before but hes old krispos blurted hes years away from thirty zoranne said and hes already well set up if i had to wait for you id be past twenty myself by the time you were even close to where yphantes is now and thats too long a time butbut then you but then you and he krispos found he could not make his mouth work the way it was supposed to zoranne understood anyway what if we were she said defiantly you never gave me any promise krispos or asked for one from me i never thought i needed to he mumbled too bad for you then no woman wants to be taken for granted maybe youll remember that next time with someone else and end up happier for it her face softened krispos well probably live here together in this village the rest of our lives no point in us hating each other is there please for want of anything better to say he said all right then he turned and quickly walked away if he had any tears zoranne was not going to see them he owned too much pride for that that evening he was so quiet that his sister teased him about it and then he was quiet through the teasing too are you feeling well krispos evdokia asked real worry in her voice when she could not get a rise out of him something had to be wrong im all right he said i just want you to leave me alone thats all i know what it is she said suddenly its something to do with zoranne isnt it he very carefully put down the bowl of barley and turnip soup from which he had been eating had he not been so deliberately careful with his hands he might have thrown it at her he got up and stamped out of the house off into the woods he took longer than he should have to realize that sitting by himself among the trees wasnt accomplishing anything but after a while he did figure it out it was quite dark when he finally came home then he almost turned around and went back his father was waiting for him a few steps outside the door he kept on he would have to deal with his father sooner or later better sooner he thought im sorry he said his father nodded the motion barely visible in the gloom you should be phostis hesitated a moment before he said evdokia was right i gatheryouve had some trouble with your girl shes not my girl krispos said sullenly shes going to marry yphantes good his father said i hoped she would i told yphantes as much earlier this year in the long run itll save you trouble son believe me when you what krispos stared at him appalled that moment of shock also let him notice something hed missed before both his father and his sister knew about zoranne how did you find out about us we were so careful maybe you think so phostis said but id bet the only person in the village who doesnt know is tzykalas and he would if he werent a fool whod sooner talk than see id be just as well pleased not to have a marriage connection with him i can tell you krispos had been angry at his father often enough till now hed never imagined wanting to hate him in a voice like ice he asked is that why you egged yphantes on thats part of the reason aye phostis answered calmly before krispos rage could overflow he went on but its not the biggest part yphantes needs to marry he needs a wife to help him now and he needs to get an heir to carry on and zoranne needs to marry at fourteen a girls a woman near enough but you son you dont need to marry at fourteen a mans still a boy im not a boy krispos snarled no does a man pitch a tantrum when hes teased you were acting the way kosta does when i tell her i wont carry her piggyback any more am i wrong or am i right think before you answer me that last sentence kept krispos from blowing up in fury he did think in coldor at least coolerblood what hed done seemed foolish right i suppose father but but me no buts finding a girl wholl say yes to you is wonderful phos knows i dont deny it why i remember his father stopped laughed a small selfconscious laugh but never mind me just because she says yes doesnt mean you want to live with her the rest of your life that should take more looking than just one girl dont you think krispos remembered his own misgivings about tzykalas the day before without much wanting to he found himself nodding i guess so good his father put a hand on his shoulder the way hed been doing since krispos was a little boy what you have to remember is bad as you feel today todays not forever thingsll feel better inside you after a while you just have to learn the patience to wait till they do krispos thought about that it made sense even so though it sounds like something thats easier to tell someone else than to do he said doesnt it just phostis laughed that small laugh again and dont i know it greatly daring krispos asked father what was she like she the one you talked aboutsort of talked abouta few minutes ago oh phostis walked farther away from the house he glanced back toward it before going on more quietly her name was sabellia your mother knows of her truly i dont think tatzed mind my speaking about her save only that no woman ever really takes kindly to her man going on about times before he was with her cant say i blame her im as glad she doesnt chatter on about her old flames too but sabellia well i must have been right around your age when i met her krispos rubbed his chin whiskers rasped under his fingers not the fuzz hed had since his voice started changing but the beginnings of a real mans crop about time he thought a couple of fifteenyearolds grew beards as good as his though hed had two more summers in which to raise his he rubbed again a beard even a thin one was a useful thing to be thoughtful with last time out in the woods somewhere not far from here hed spotted an elm branch that had exactly the right curve for a plow handle he would have paid more attention to it had he not been with a girl that oak looked familiar or so he thought till he got close to it he walked on he didnt remember the hazel tree beyond the oak sighing he kept walking by now he was sure he had come too far but he didnt want to go back either it would have been too much like an admission of failure faint in the distance he heard noise ahead he frowned few villagers came this far east of home hed brought likinia out here precisely because he had felt sure theyd get to be alone he supposed men from the next village over could be doing some lumbering but theyd have to drag the wood a long way back if they were the noise didnt sound like lumbering anyhow he heard no axes no sounds of falling branches or toppling trees as he moved closer a horse neighed softly that confused him worse than ever a horse would have been handy for hauling timber but there was no timber what did that leave his frown deepenedthe most obvious answer was bandits he hadnt thought the nearby road had enough traffic to support a robber band but he could have been wrong he kept moving toward the noise but now with all the caution he could muster he just wanted to see if these really were bandits and then if they were to get back to the village and bring as many armed men here as he could he was flat on his belly by the time he wriggled up to the last brush that screened him from the noisemakers whoever they were slowly slowly he raised his head until he could peer between two leafy branches whose shadows helped hide his face phos his lips shaped the word but no sound came from between them the men relaxing by the side of the road were not bandits they were kubratoi his lips moved silently againtwelve thirteen fourteen kubratoi the village had not had any word of invasion but that meant nothing the first word of trouble theyd had when he was a boy was the wild men howling out of darkness he shivered suddenly reliving the terror of that night he felt like a boy again the remembered fear also told him what he had wondered beforewhy the kubratoi were sitting around taking their ease instead of storming straight for the village they would hit at night just as that other band had with the advantage of surprise with darkness making them seem three times as many as they really were they would be irresistible krispos gauged the shadows around him as he slithered backward even more carefully than he had approached the sun was not far past noon he could deal with the kubratoi as hed intended to treat the bandits the villagers had learned weapons from the veterans settled with them to be ready for just this sort of moment soon krispos was far enough away from the wild men to get back to his feet fast and quiet as he could he headed toward the village he thought about cutting back to the road and running down it that would be quickestif the kubratoi didnt have a sentry posted somewhere along there to make sure no one gave the alarm he decided he could not take the chance through the woods it would have to be he burst out of the forest an hour and a half later his tunic torn his arms and face scratched his first try at a cry of alarm yielded only a rusty croak he rushed over to the well drew up the bucket and drank deep the kubratoi he shouted loud as he could the men and women who heard him spun and stared one of them was idalkos how many boy he barked where i saw fourteen krispos told him down at the edge of the road he gasped out the story only fourteen you say a fierce light kindled in idalkos eyes if thats all there really are we can take em i thought so too krispos said you get the people here armed ill go out to the fields and bring in the rest of the men right you are idalkos had been an underofficer for many years when he heard orders that made sense he started carrying them out without worrying about where they came from krispos never noticed hed given an order he was already running toward the largest group of men that he saw shouting as he ran the kubratoi someone said fearfully how can we fight the kubratoi how can we not krispos shot back do you want to go back to the other side of the mountains again theres only a dozen or so of them and they wont be expecting us to hit first with three times as many men as they have how can we lose idalkos thinks we can win too that brought around some of the farmers who stood there indecisively soon they all went pounding back toward the village idalkos and a couple of other men were already passing out weapons when they got there krispos found himself clutching a shield and a stout spear we go through the woods idalkos made it sound like a question but krispos did not think he was really asking aye he said if they have someone watching the road he could ride back and warn the rest right you are idalkos said again he went on and speaking of warningstankos you saddle up one of those mules and ride for imbros fast as you can crosscountry if you see the whole landscape crawling with kubratoi come back im not sending you out to get yourself killed but if you think you can make it through well i wouldnt mind seeing a few garrison soldiers up this way how about the rest of you lads nods and nervous grins showed him his guess was good the villagers had nerved themselves to fight but they were not eager or most of them the older more settled farmers were not they kept looking back at the fields their homes their wives and daughters who crowded round the knot of wouldbe warriors some just standing silently others wringing their hands and trying not to weep krispos though was almost wild with excitement come on he shouted some of the other young men also raised a cry they pelted after krispos into the woods the rest of the villagers followed more slowly come on come on if we all fight we can do it idalkos said he and varades and the rest of the veterans kept their amateur companions moving before long idalkos had pushed his way up beside krispos youre going to have to lead us at least till we get to the buggers he said youre the one who knows where they are itd be good if we tried to get as quiet as we could before were close enough that theyre likely to hear us that makes sense krispos said wondering why he hadnt thought of it himself ill remember good idalkos grinned at him glad youre not too proud to use a notion just on account of somebody else thought of it of course not krispos said surprised that would be stupid so it would but youd be amazed how many captains are idiots well but then im no cap krispos paused he seemed to be leading the villagers if anyone was he shrugged it was only because hed been the one to find the kubratoi he thought he was still a mile away from the wild men when he walked past the elm with the curving branch hed been looking for he tried to note just where the tree was next time he told himself hed find it on the first try a few minutes later he stopped and waited for everyone to catch up only then did he think to wonder if there would be a next time after the fight ahead he sternly suppressed that thought turning to the farmers he saidit isnt far from here on out pretend youre hunting deerquiet as you go not deer varades said wolves the kubratoi have teeth and when we hit em we all yell phos that way nobody has any doubts about whos who nothing to make you want to piss your breeches fastern almost getting killed by your own side the villagers stole forward soon krispos heard men chattering heard a horse snort his comrades heard too and looked at one another the kubratoi were making no secret of where they were quiet as we can now krispos whispered pass it along the whisper traveled through the group try as they would the farmers could not keep their presence secret as long as they wanted they were still more than a hundred yards from the kubratoi when the buzz of talk from the wild men suddenly changed idalkos bared his teeth as if he were a fox realizing a rabbit had taken its scent come on lads he said they know were here phos the last word was a bellowed war cry phos the villagers shouted too they crashed through the brash toward the kubratoi phos krispos yelled as loud as anyone the idea of rushing into battle was enormously exciting soon he thought he would be a hero then the brush was gone before krispos could do more than catch sight of the kubratoi an arrow hissed past his face and another grazed his arm he heard a meaty thunk as a shaft pierced a man beside him the farmer fell shrieking and writhing and clawing at it fear and pain suddenly seemed realer than glory whether for glory or not the fight was still before him peering over the top of his shield he rushed at the nearest wild man the kubrati snatched for an arrow perhaps realizing he could not shoot before krispos was upon him he threw down the arrow and grabbed his sword krispos thrust with his spear he missed the kubrati closed with him as much by luck as by skill he turned the fellows first slash with his shield the kubrati cut at him again he backpedaled trying to get room to use the spearhead against the wild man the kubrati pursued feinting with the sword he stuck out a foot and tripped krispos he managed to keep his shield above him as he went down two villagers drove the wild man away before he could finish krispos krispos scrambled to his feet a couple of kubratoi were down for good and two or three villagers he saw a man from north of the mountains trading sword strokes with varades fighting a veteran the wild man was fully occupied he never noticed krispos until the youths spear tore into his side the wild man granted then stared in absurd surprise at the reddripping spearpoint that burst out through his belly then varades sword bit his neck more blood sprayed some splashed krispos in the face the kubrati folded in on himself and fell pull your spear out boy varades yelled in krispos ear you think theyre going to wait for you gulping krispos set a foot on the wild mans hip and yanked the spear free the soft resistance the kubratis flesh gave reminded him of nothing so much as butchering time no no glory here he thought again all across the small field the villagers were swarming over the kubratoi two against one here three against one there individually each kubrati was a better warrior than his foes the wild men seldom got the chance to prove it soon only four or five of them were left on their feet krispos saw one look around heard him yell something to his comrades though hed never learned the kubrati tongue he was sure he knew what the wild man had said he shouted dont let them make it back to their horses they still might get away as he spoke the kubratoi broke off combat and ran toward the tethered animals along with the rest of the villagers krispos dashed after them he wondered why they hadnt mounted and fled when they first heard the villagers coming probably he supposed because theyd imagined formers would be easy meat that had been true a decade ago it wasnt true any more krispos speared one of the kubratoi in the back the man flung his arms wide three villagers piled onto him his scream cut off in a moment the rest of the kubratoi were dragged down and slain a couple of villagers took cuts in the last frantic seconds of the fight but none seemed serious krispos could hardly believe the little battle had ended so abruptly he stared this way and that for more wild men to kill all he saw was farmers doing the same thing we won he said then he started to laugh surprised at how surprised he sounded we won by phos we won we beat em the villagers took up the cry they embraced slapped one another on the back showed off cuts and braises krispos found himself clasping hands with yphantes the older farmer wore an enormous grin i saw you get two of the bastards krispos he said by the good god you made me jealous i think i wounded one but im not even sure of that aye he fought well idalkos said praise from the veteran made krispos glow he also found he did not mind praise from yphantes whether or not the man who had married zoranne was jealous of krispos krispos was no longer jealous of him zoranne remained special in his memory but only because she had been his first what hed felt for her at fourteen seemed very far away after three years of growth and change such thoughts fled as krispos saw his father coming up with right hand clutched to left shoulder blood trickled between phostis fingers and splashed his tunic father krispos exclaimed are you phostis cut him off ill live boy ive done worse to myself with a sickle more than once ive said often enough that im not cut out for this soldiering business youre alive thats what counts idalkos said and while you may not want to soldier phostis your boy here has the knack for it id say he sees what needs doing and he does itand if its giving an order men listen to him thats phos own gift nothing elseive seen officers without it if ever he wanted to head to videssos the city the armyd be glad to have him the city me krispos had never even imagined traveling to the great imperial capital now he tasted the idea after a moment he shook his head id sooner farm its what i know besides i dont fancy killing any more than my father does neither do i idalkos said that doesnt mean it isnt needful sometimes and like i told you i think youd make a good soldier no thanks all i really want to make is a good crop of beans this year so we dont go hungry when winter comes krispos spoke as firmly as he could both to let idalkos know he meant what he said and to reinforce that certainty in his own mind the veteran shrugged have it your way if you want to go on being a farmer though wed best make sure these were the only kubratoi operating around here the first thing well do is strip the bodies some of the villagers had already started taking care of that idalkos went on the cuirasses and the bows are better than what we already have the swords are more for fighting from horseback like the kubratoi do than afoot but well still be able to use em aye but what about the wild men now krispos demanded we were both worried theyd have a scout close to the village if he got away and warned another bigger band then the swords and arrows were gathering wont matter because we dont have enough men to hold off a big determined band so if there is a scout hed best not get away idalkos cocked his head well brave captain krispos how would you go about making sure he doesnt in a tone of voice only slightly different the veterans question would have been mockery as it was though he seemed rather to be setting krispos a problem the way varades sometimes had when he gave the youth a long hard word to spell out krispos thought hard if most of us march down the road toward the village he said at last anybody would be sure to notice us a rider could get away easy enough by going wide around us but hed come back to the road after he did to find out what had happened to his friends so maybe we ought to set some archers in ambush just up ahead there before the bugger could round that bend and see what weve done to the rest of the wild men maybe we should grinning idalkos gave krispos a videssian military salute clenched fist over heart he turned to phostis skotos take you man why couldnt you have raised a son who was discontented with following in his fathers footsteps because i raised one with sense instead krispos father said better to be turning up the ground than to have it tossed on top of you on account of youve been killed too young krispos nodded vigorously idalkos sighed all right all right its a good scheme anyhow i think itll work he started yelling to the villagers a couple of them cut branches and vines to make travois on which to drag back their dead and the three or four men hurt too badly to walk they left the horses of the kubratoi for the ambush party to fetch back and the wild mens corpses for ravens meat when krispos watched his plan unfold he felt the same awe that seeing the seeds he had planted grow to maturity always gave him just as hed guessed a lone kubrati was sitting on his horse a couple of miles closer to the village than his comrades had rested the rider started violently at the sight of spearwaving videssians bearing down on him he kicked his horse to a trot then to a gallop the villagers gave chase but could not catch him as krispos had expected the kubrati rode back to the road the youth and idalkos grinned at each other as they watched the column of dust the wild mans horse kicked up fade in the distance that should do for him krispos said happily now we can head for home they arrived not long after sunseta little before the raiders would have hit the village if they still lived in the fading light krispos saw women and children waiting anxiously outside their homes wondering whether husbands fathers sons and lovers would come back again as one the returning men shouted phos not only was it a cry no kubratoi would make their loved ones recognized their voices shouting themselves they rushed toward the victorious farmers some of their glad cries turned to wails as they saw not all the men had come home safe for most of them though it was a time of joy embracing his mother krispos noticed how far he had to stoop to kiss her stranger still was the kiss he got from evdokia in the passage from one day to the next hed paid scant heed to the way his sister had grown but suddenly she felt like a woman in his arms he needed a moment to realize she was as old now as zoranne had been on that midwinters day as if the thought of zoranne were enough to conjure her up he found himself kissing her next their embrace was awkward he had to lean over her belly now big with child to reach her lips close by the two of them a woman shouted wheres my hermon its all right ormisda krispos told her hes one of the archers we left behind to trap the wild man we couldnt catch anyone you dont see here is waiting in that ambush oh phos be praised ormisda said she kissed krispos too though she was close to three times his age more people kissed himand one anotherover the next hour than hed seen during half a dozen midwinters days rolled into one then in the middle of the celebration the archers returned to the village though everyone fell on them with happy shoutsormisda almost smothered hermon against her ample bosomthey hung back from fully joining the rest of the villagers krispos knew what that had to mean he got away he said he knew it sounded like an accusation so did the archers they hung their heads we must have shot twenty arrows at him and his horse one of them said defensively some hit toothe yells he let out had to be curses he got away krispos repeated it was the worst thing he could think of to say no not so a moment later he found something worse yet hell bring the rest of the kubratoi down on us the celebration died very quickly after that the next five days passed in a blur of apprehension for krispos that was true of most of the villagers but krispos dread had two causes like everyone else he was sure the kubratoi would exact a terrible revenge for the slaughter of their raiding party but that for him was only secondary for his fathers wounded shoulder had gone bad phostis as was his way tried to make light of the injury but he could barely use his left arm and quickly came down with a fever none of the poultices the village women applied to the wound did any good phostis had always been burly but now with shocking suddenness the flesh seemed to melt from his bones thus krispos was almost relieved when late that fifth afternoon a lookout posted in a tall tree shouted horsemen like the rest of the men he dashed for his weaponsagainst kubratoi at least he could hit back and in the heat of fighting he would have no time to worry about his father the lookout shouted again hundreds of horsemen his voice wobbled with fear women and children were already streaming into the forest to hide as best they could hundreds and hundreds the lookout cried some of the farmers threw down spears and bows and bolted with the women krispos grabbed at one who ran in front of him but idalkos shook his head whats the use the veteran said if they outnumber us that bad a few more on our side wont matter much we cant win all we can do is hurt the bastards as bad as were able krispos clutched his spear shaft so tight his knuckles whitened on it now he did not need the lookout to know the wild men were coming he could hear the hooves of their horses quiet now but growing louder with dreadful speed he set himself take one out with the spear he thought then drag another one off his horse and stab him after thatif he still lived after thathed see what other damage he could do wont be long now lads idalkos said calm as if the villagers were drawn up for parade well yell phos again just like we did the first time and pray for the good god to watch over us phos that was not one of the farmers standing in ragged line in front of their houses it was the lookout he sounded so wild and shrill that krispos wondered if he had lost his mind then the man said theyre not kubratoi theyre videssian troopers for a moment the villagers stared at one another as if the lookout had shouted in a foreign tongue then they cheered louder than they had after they first beat the kubratoi idalkos voice rose above the rest stankos he said stankos brought us our soldiers back stankos everyone shouted hurrah for stankos good old stankos stankos krispos thought was getting more praise jammed into a few minutes than hed had in the past five years krispos shouted the farmers name too over and over till his throat turned raw he had stared death in the face since the lookout called nothing could ever frighten him worse now he also knew what reprieve felt like before long the videssian cavalrymen pounded into the village stankos was with them riding a borrowed horse half a dozen farmers pulled him off the beast as if he were a kubrati the pounding he got was almost as hard as if he had been krispos quickly counted the troopers as best he could tell there were seventyone of them so much for the lookouts frightened hundreds and hundreds he thought the horsemens captain bemusedly watched the villagers caper about you dont seem to have much need for us he remarked no sir idalkos stiffened to attention we thought we did when we didnt know for sure how many kubratoi were about you gave us a bad turn thereour lookout mistook you for a band of the wild men by the bodies i saw youd dealt with the ones you found the captain said far as we know thats the lot of mem id say they were just out for a little thievery theres no general invasion or anything like that a small band operating on its own krispos thought the day he first picked up a sword that was what varades had told him the peasants might be able to handle the veteran had known what he was talking about the videssian captain turned to a priest beside him looks like we wont need you today gelasios except maybe for a prayer of thanksgiving nor am i sorry gelasios answered i can heal wounded men aye but i also think on the suffering they endure before i come to them so i am just as well pleased not to ply my trade sir krispos said he had to repeat himself before the priest looked his way youre a healer holy sir what of it young man gelasios said phos be praised you seem hale enough not me krispos said impatiently my father this way without looking to see whether gelasios followed he hurried toward his house when he threw open the door a new smell came out with the usual odors of stale smoke and food a sweetish sickly smell that made his stomach want to turn over yes i see gelasios murmured at krispos elbow the priests nostrils flared wide as if to gauge from the scent of corruption how great a challenge he faced he went inside stooping a little to get through the doorway now it was krispos turn to follow him gelasios stooped beside phostis who lay near the edge of the straw bedding bright with fever phostis eyes stared through the priest krispos bit his lip in those sunken eyes in the way his fathers skin clung tight to bones beneath it he saw the outline of coming death if gelasios saw it too he gave no sign he pulled phostis tunic aside peeled off the latest worthless poultice to examine the wound with the poultice came a thick wave of that rotting smell krispos took an involuntary step backward then checked hating himselfwhat was he doing retreating from his father its all right lad gelasios said absently the first sign since hed come into the house that he remembered krispos was with him he forgot him again an instant later and seemed to forget phostis too his eyes went upward as if to see the sun through the thatched roof of the cottage we bless thee phos lord with the great and good mind he intoned by thy grace our protector watchful beforehand that the great test of life may be decided in our favor krispos echoed his prayer it was the only one he knew all the way through everyone in the whole empire he supposed had phos creed by heart gelasios said the prayer again and again and again the priests breathing grew slow and deep and steady his eyes slid shut but krispos was somehow sure he remained very much aware of self and surroundings then without warning gelasios reached out and seized phostis wounded shoulder the priests hands were not gentle krispos expected his father to shriek at that rough treatment but phostis lay still locked in his fever dream though gelasios no longer prayed aloud his breathing kept the same rhythm he had established krispos looked from the priests set face to his hands and to the wound beneath them the hair on his arms and at the nape of his neck suddenly prickled with aweas he watched that gaping pusfilled gash began to close when only a thin pale scar remained gelasios lifted his hands away from phostis shoulder the flow of healing that had passed from him to krispos father stopped with almost audible abruptness gelasios tried to rise he staggered as if he felt the force of that separation wine he muttered hoarsely i am fordone only then did krispos realize how much energy the healing had drained from gelasios he knew he should rush to fulfill the priests request but he could not not at once he was looking at his father phostis eyes met his and there was reason in them get him his wine son phostis said and while youre at it you might bring some for me yes father of course and i pray your pardon holy sir krispos was glad for an excuse to rummage for clean cups and the best skin of wine in the house it meant no one would have to see the tears on his face phos blessings on you lad gelasios said though the wine put some color back in his face he still moved stiffly as if he had aged twenty years in the few minutes hed needed to heal phostis seeing the concern on krispos face he managed a wry chuckle im not quite so feeble as i appeara meal and good nights sleep and ill be well enough even without at need i could heal another man now likely two and take no lasting harm too abashed to speak krispos only nodded his father said i just praise phos you were here to heal me holy sir i do thank you for it he twisted his head so he could peer down at his shoulder and at the wound there that by the look of it could have been five years old isnt that fine he said to no one in particular he stood more smoothly than gelasios had they walked out into the sunlight together the men of the village raised a cheer to see phostis returned to health somebody called and tatze would have been such a tempting widow too they all laughed phostis louder than anyone krispos came out behind the two older men while most of the villagers were still making much of his father idalkos beckoned to him the veteran had been talking with the commander of the videssian cavalry force ive told this gentlemanhis name is manganessomething about you he said to krispos he says let me put it to him myself manganes said crisply from what your fellow villager here says krisposdo i have your name rightyou sound like a soldier the imperial army could use id even offer you hmm a five goldpiece enlistment bonus if you rode back to imbros with us now without hesitating krispos shook his head here i stay sir all the more so since by your kindness and gelasios healing magic my father has been restored to me as you wish young man manganes said he and idalkos both sighed iii krispos came back from the fields one hot sticky summer afternoon to find his mother his sisters and most of the other village women gathered round a peddler who was showing off a fine collection of copper pots aye thesell last you a lifetime ladies may the ice take me if i lie the fellow said he whacked one with his walking stick several women jumped at the clatter the peddler held up the pot see not a dent in it made to last like i said none of this cheap tinkers work you see too often these days and theyre not too dear either i ask only three in silver the eighth part of a goldpiece krispos waved to evdokia but she did not notice him she was as caught up as any of the others by the peddlers mesmerizing pitch krispos walked on a trifle miffed he still wasnt used to her being out of the house though shed married domokos nearly a year ago she was eighteen now but unless he made a conscious effort not to he still thought of her as a little girl of course he was twentyone himself and the older men in the village still called him lad a lot of the time no one paid any attention to change until it hit him in the head he thought chuckling wryly dear ladies these pots the peddler broke off with a squeak that was no part of his regular sales pitch beneath his tan blood mounted to his cheeks do excuse me ladies i pray his walk toward the woods quickly turned into an undignified dash the women clucked sympathetically krispos had all he could do not to guffaw the peddler emerged a few minutes later he paused at the well to draw up the bucket and take a long drink your pardon he said as he came back to his pots i seem to have picked up a touch of the flux where was i now he went back to his spiel with almost as much verve as hed shown before krispos stood around and listened he didnt intend to sell pots but he had some piglets he was fattening up to take to market at imbros soon and the peddlers technique was worth studying not much later though the man had to interrupt himself again this time he went for the woods at a dead run he did not look happy when he returned his face was nearer gray than red ladies much as i enjoy telling you about my wares i think the time has come to get down to selling before i embarrass myself further he said he looked unhappy again through the bargaining that followed the breaks in his talk had weakened his hold on the village women and they dickered harder than he would have liked he was shaking his head as he loaded pots back onto his mule here stay for supper with us one of the women called you shouldnt set out on the road so downcast the peddler managed a smile and a low bow youre too kind to a traveling man thank you before he got his bowl of stew though he needed to rush off to relieve himself twice more i do hope hes well tatze said that evening to phostis and krispos a scream jerked the village awake the next morning krispos came running out of his house spear in hand wondering whod set upon whom the woman who had invited the trader to stay over stood by his bedroll horror on her face along with several other men krispos ran toward her had the wretch repaid her kindness by trying to rape her she screamed again krispos noticed she was fully clothed then as she had he looked down at the bedroll phos he whispered his stomach churned he was glad it was empty had he had breakfast he would have lost it the peddler was dead he looked shrunken in on himself and bruised great violet blotches discolored his skin from the way the blankets of the bedroll were drenched and stinking he seemed to have voided all the moisture from his body in a dreadful fit of diarrhea magic tzykalas the cobbler said evil magic his hand made the sunsign on his breast krispos nodded and he was not the only one he could imagine nothing natural that would result in such gruesome dissolution of a man no not magic varades said the veterans beard had been white for years but krispos had never thought of him as old till this moment now he not only looked his years he sounded them as well his voice quivered as he went on this is worse than magic what could be worse than magic three men asked at once cholera to krispos it was only a word by the way other villagers shook their heads it meant little more to them varades filled them in i only saw it once the good god be thanked when we were campaigning against the makurani in the west maybe thirty years ago but that once was enough to last me a lifetime it went through our army harder than any three battlesthrough the enemy the same way i suppose or they wouldve just walked over us krispos looked from the veteran to the peddlers twisted ruined corpse he did not want to ask the next question its catching then aye varades seemed to pull himself together we burned the bodies of those that died of it that slowed the spread or we thought it did i suppose we ought to do it for this poor bugger here something else we ought to do too whats that krispos said fast as we can ride to imbros and fetch back a priest who knows healing i think were going to need one smoke from the peddlers pyre rose to the sky the villagers prayers to phos rose with it as he had four years earlier when the kubratoi came stankos set off for imbros this time instead of a mule he rode one of the horses captured from the wild men but for his being gone and for the black burned place on the village green life went on as before if other people worried every time they felt a call of nature as krispos did they did not talk about it five days krispos thought maybe a little less because stankos was on a horse now and could get to imbros faster maybe a little more because a priest might not ride back with the same grim urgency the videssian troopers had shownbut phos knew that urgency was real the healerpriest arrived on the morning of the sixth day after stankos rode out of the village he was three days behind the cholera by the time he got there the villagers had burned three more bodies one the unfortunate woman who had asked the peddler to stay more people were sick diarrhea pouring out of them their lips blue their skin dry and cold some suffered from pain and cramps in their arms and legs others did not out of all of them though flowed that endless stream of watery stool when he saw the victims who still lived the priest made the suncircle over his heart i had prayed your man here was wrong he said but i see my prayer was not answered in truth this is cholera can you heal it zoranne cried fear and desperation in her voiceyphantes lay in his own muck outside their cottage oh phos can you heal it for as long as the lord with the great and good mind gives me strength the priest declared without stopping even to give his name he hurried after her the healthy villagers followed hes called mokios stankos said as he trooped along with the rest of them aii my arse is sore he added rubbing the afflicted portion of his anatomy mokios knelt beside yphantes who feebly tried to make the sunsign when he recognized a priest never mind that now the priest said gently he pushed aside the villagers befouled tunic set hands on his belly then as gelasios had when healing krispos father he recited phos creed over and over focusing all his will and energy on the suffering man under his fingers yphantes showed no external wound as phostis had thus the marvel of watching him grow well again was not there this time whether or not it was visible though krispos could feel the current of healing pass from mokios to the villager at last the priest took away his hands he slumped back weariness etching lines deep into his face yphantes sat up his eyes were sunken but clear water he said hoarsely by the good god ive never been so dry in my life aye water mokios gasped he sounded more worn than the man he had just healed half a dozen villagers raced to be first to the well zoranne did not win the race but the others gave way when she said let me serve them it is my right with the pride of a queen she drew up the dripping bucket untied it and carried it to her husband and mokios between them they all but drank it dry the priest was still wiping water from his mustache and beard with the sleeve of his blue robe when another woman tried to tug him to his feet please holy sir come to my daughter she got out through tears she barely breathes mokios heaved himself upright grunting at the effort it took he followed the woman again the rest of the villagers followed him phostis touched krispos on the shoulder now we pray he can heal faster than we fall sick he said softly mokios succeeded again though the second healing took longer than the first when he was done he lay full length on the ground panting look at the poor fellow krispos whispered to his father he needs someone to heal him now aye but we need him worse phostis answered he knelt and shook mokios please come holy sir we have others who will not see tomorrow without you you are right the priest said even so he stayed down several more minutes and when he did rise he walked with the shambling gait of a man either drunk or in the last stages of exhaustion krispos thought mokios next healing of a small boy would fail how much he wondered could a man take out of himself before he had nothing left yet in the end mokios somehow summoned up the strength to vanquish the childs disease while the boy with the resilience of the very young got up and began to play the healerpriest looked as if he had died in his place but others in the village were still sick well carry him if we have to phostis said and carry him they did on to varades again mokios recited phos creed though now in a voice as dry as the skins of the cholera victims he treated the villagers prayed with him both to lend him strength and to try to ease their own fears he sank into the healing trance placed his hands on the veterans belly they were filthy now from the stools of the folk he had already cured once more krispos felt healing flow out of mokios this time however the priest slumped over in a faint before his task was done he breathed but the villagers could not bring him back to himself varades moaned and muttered and befouled himself yet again when they saw they could not rouse mokios the villagers put a blanket over him and let him rest in the morning the good god willing hell be able to heal again phostis said by morning though varades was dead mokios finally roused when the sun was halfway up the sky videssian priests were enjoined to be frugal of food and drink but he broke his fast with enough for three men healers have dispensation he mumbled round a chunk of honeycomb holy sir so long as it gives you back the power to use your gift no one would say a word if you ate five times as much krispos told him everyone who heard agreed loudly the priest healed two more a man and a woman that day toward sunset he gamely tried again as he had with varades though he swooned away before the cure was complete this time krispos wondered if hed killed himself until idalkos found his pulse just what my father worried about krispos said so many of us are deathly ill that were dragging mokios down with us hed hoped idalkos might contradict him but the veteran only nodded saying why dont you go on home and get away from the sickness for a while youre lucky none of your family seems to have come down with it krispos made the sunsign over his heart a few minutes later after seeing that mokios was as comfortable on the ground as he could be he took idalkos advice he frowned as he came up to his house being near the edge of the village it was always fairly quiet but he should have heard his father and mother talking inside or perhaps tatze teaching kosta some trick of baking now he heard nothing nor was cooksmoke rising from the hole in the center of the roof all at once his belly felt as if it had been pitched into a snowdrift he ran for the door as he jerked it open out came the latrine stench with which he and the whole village had grown too horribly familiar over the last few days his father his mother his sisterthey all lay on the floor phostis was most nearly conscious he tried to wave his son away krispos paid him no heed he dragged his father to the grass outside then tatze and kosta as he did he wondered why he alone had been spared his legs ached fiercely when he bent to lift his mother and when he went back for kosta he found his arms so clenched with cramps that he could hardly hold her but he thought nothing of it until suddenly without willing it he felt an overpowering urge to empty his bowels he started for the bushes not far away but fouled himself before he got to them then he realized he had not been spared after all he began to shout for help stopped with the cry unuttered only the healerpriest could help him now and hed just left mokios somewhere between sleep and death if any of the villagers who were still healthy came they would only further risk the disease a moment later he vomited then suffered another fit of diarrhea with his guts knotted from end to end he crawled back to his family perhaps their cases would be mild perhaps his fever was already climbing so thought soon became impossible he felt a raging thirst and managed to find a jar of wine in the house it did nothing to ease him before long he threw it up he crawled outside again shivering and stinking the full moon shone down on him as serene and beautiful as if no such thing as cholera existed it was the last thing krispos remembered seeing that night oh phos be praised someone said as if from very far away krispos opened his eyes he saw mokios anxious face peering down at him and behind the priest the rising sun no he said its still dark then the memory came crashing back he tried to sit mokios hands still on him held him down my family he gasped my father my mother the healerpriests haggard face was somber phos has called your mother to himself he said your father and sister live yet may the good god grant them strength to endure until i recover enough to be of aid to them then he did let krispos sit krispos tried to weep for tatze but found the cholera had so drained his body that he could make no tears yphantes now up and about handed him a cup of water he drank it while the priest drained another he had to force himself to look at phostis and kosta their eyes and cheeks were sunken the skin on their hands and feet and faces tight and withered only their harsh breathing and the muck that kept flowing from them said they were not dead hurry holy sir i beg you krispos said to mokios i shall try young man truly i shall but first i pray he looked round for yphantes some food never have i drained myself so yphantes fetched him bread and salt pork he gobbled them down asked for more he had eaten like that since hed entered the village but was thinner now than when hed come his cheeks krispos thought dully were almost as hollow as phostis mokios wiped at his brow warm today he said to krispos the morning still felt cool he only shrugged by way of answer as not long before he had been in fevers arms he did not trust his judgment he looked from his father to his sister how long could they keep life in them please holy sir will it be soon he asked his nails digging into his palms as soon as i may the healerpriest replied would i were younger and recovered more quickly gladly would i mokios paused to belch considering how much he had eaten and how quickly krispos saw nothing out of the ordinary in that then the healerpriest broke wind loudlyas poor varades never would again krispos thought mourning the veteran with the small part of him not in anguish for his family and then utter horror filled mokios thin tired face for a moment krispos did not understand the stench of incontinence by his houseindeed throughout the villagewas so thick a new addition did not easily make itself known but when the healerpriests eyes went fearfully to the wet stain spreading on his robe krispos followed no mokios whispered no krispos agreed as if their denial were stronger than truth but the priest had tended many victims of the cholera had smeared himself with their muck had worked himself almost to death healing them so what was more likely than a yes or than that almost being no almost at all krispos saw one tiny chance he seized mokios by both shoulders weak as he was he was stronger than the healerpriest holy sir he said urgently holy sir can you heal yourself rarely rarely does phos grant such a gift mokios said and in any case i have not yet the strength you must try krispos said if you sicken and die the village dies with you i will make the attempt but mokios voice held no hope and krispos knew only his own fierce will pushed the priest on mokios shut his eyes the better to muster the concentration he needed to heal his lips moved soundlessly krispos recited phos creed with him his heart leaped when even through fever even through sickness mokios features relaxed toward the healing trance the priests hands moved toward his own traitorous belly just as he was about to begin his head twisted pain replaced calm confidence on his face and he puked up everything yphantes had brought him the spasms of vomiting went on and on into the dry heaves he also fouled himself again when at last he could speak mokios said pray for me young man and for your family also it may well be that phos will accomplish what i cannot not all who take cholera perish of it he made the sunsign over his heart krispos prayed as he had never prayed before his sister died that afternoon his father toward evening by then mokios was unconscious some time that night he died too after what seemed forever but was less than a month cholera at last left the village alone counting poor brave mokios thirtynine people died close to one inhabitant in six many of those who lived were too feeble to work for weeks thereafter but the work did not go away because fewer hands were there to do it harvest was coming krispos worked in the fields in the gardens with the animals every moment he could making his body stay busy helped keep his mind from his losses he was not alone in his sudden devotion to toil either few families had not seen at least one death and everyone had lost people counted dear but for krispos going home each night was a special torment too many memories lived in that empty house with him he kept thinking he heard phostis voice or tatzes or kostas whenever he looked up ready to answer he found himself alone that was very bad he took to eating most of his meals with evdokia and her husband domokos evdokia had stayed well domokos though hed taken cholera had suffered only a relatively mild casehis survival proved it when soon after the end of the epidemic evdokia found she was pregnant krispos was doubly glad of that some villagers chose wine as their anodyne instead of work krispos could not remember a time so full of drunken fights i cant really blame em he said to yphantes one day as they both swung hoes against the weeds that had flourished when the cholera made people neglect the fields but i do get tired of breaking up brawls we should all be grateful youre here to break them up yphantes said with your size and the way you wrestle nobody wants to argue with you when you tell em to stop im just glad youre not one of the ones who like to throw their weight around to show how tough they are youve got your fathers head on your shoulders krispos and thats good in a man so young krispos stared down as he hacked at a stinging nettle he did not want yphantes to see the tears that came to him whenever he thought of his family the tears hed been too weak and too dry inside to shed the day they died when he could speak again he changed the subject i wonder how good a crop well end up bringing in no former could take that question less than seriously yphantes rubbed his chin then straightened to look out across the fields that were now beginning to go from green to gold not very good he said reluctantly we didnt do all the cultivating we should have and we wont have as many people to help in the harvest of course we wont have as many people eating this winter either krispos said with the harvest i fear well have that may be just as well yphantes answered not since he was a boy in kubrat had krispos faced the prospect of hunger so far in advance what with the rapacity of the kubratoi every winter then had been hungry now he thought he would face starvation cheerfully if only he could starve along with his family he sighed he did not have that choice he lifted his hoe and attacked another weed uhoh domokos whispered as the tax collector and his retinue came down the road toward the village hes a new one aye krispos whispered back and along with his clerks and his packhorses he has soldiers with him too he could not imagine two worse signs the usual tax collector one zabdas had been coming to the village for years he could sometimes be reasoned with which made him a prince among tax men and soldiers generally meant the imperial government was going to ask for something more than the ordinary this year the village had less than the ordinary to give the closer the new tax collector got the less krispos liked his looks he was thin and pinchfeatured and wore a great many heavy rings the way he studied the village and its fields reminded krispos of a fence lizard studying a fly lizards however did not commonly bring archers to help them hunt there was no help for it the tax collector set up shop in the middle of the village square he sat in a folding chair beneath a canopy of scarlet cloth behind him his soldiers set up the imperial icons a portrait of the avtokrator anthimos and to its left a smaller image of his uncle petronas it was a new picture of anthimos this year too krispos saw showing the emperor with a full mans beard and wearing the scarlet boots reserved for his high rank even so his image looked no match for that of petronas the older mans face was hard tough able with something about his eyes that seemed to say he could see behind him without turning his head petronas was no longer regentanthimos had come into his majority on his eighteenth birthdaybut the continued presence of his image said he still ruled videssos in all but name along with the other villagers krispos bowed first to the icon of anthimos then to that of petronas and last to the fleshly representative of imperial might the tax collector dipped his head a couple of inches in return he drew a scroll from the small wooden case he had set beside his left foot unrolled it and began to read whereas declares the phosguarded avtokrator anthimos from the beginning of our reign we have taken a great deal of care and concern for the common good of affairs we have been equally concerned to protect well the state which phos the lord of the great and good mind has granted us we have discovered that the public treasury suffers under many debts which weaken our might and make difficult the successful prosecution of our affairs even matters military have been damaged by our being at a loss for supplies with the result that the state has been harmed by the boundless onslaughts of barbarians according to our ability we deem the situation worthy of needed correction he went on in that vein for some time looking around krispos watched his neighbors eyes glaze the last time hed heard rhetoric so turgid was when iakovitzes ransomed the captive peasants from kubrat that speech at least had presaged a happy outcome he doubted the same would be true of this one from the way the soldiers shifted their weight as if to ready themselves for action he knew when the tax man was about to come to the unpalatable meat of the business it arrived a moment later accordingly all assessments for the present year and until the conclusion of the aforementioned emergency are hereby increased by one part in three payment to be collected in gold or in kind at the times and locations sanctioned by longestablished custom so decrees the phosguarded avtokrator anthimos the tax collector tied a scarlet ribbon round his proclamation and stowed it away in its case one part in three krispos thought no wonder he has soldiers with him he waited for the rest of the villagers to join him in protest but nobody spoke perhaps he was the only one whod managed to follow the speech all the way through excellent sir he said and waited till the tax mans eyes swung his way excellent he waited again my name is malalas the tax collector said grudgingly excellent malalas we can pay no extra tax this year krispos said once he found the boldness to speak others nodded with him he went on we would have trouble paying the usual tax this has been a hard year for us excellent sir oh whats your excuse malalas asked we had sickness in the village excellent sircholera many died and others were left too weak to work for a long time our crop is small this year at the mention of the dread word cholera some clerks and a few soldiers stirred nervously malalas however amazed krispos by bursting into laughter nice try bumpkin name a disease to excuse your own laziness make it a nasty one so well be sure not to linger youd fool some with that maybe but not me ive heard it before but its the truth krispos said appalled excellent sir youve not seen us till now our old tax collector zabdas would recognize how many faces he knew arent here today truly he would malalas yawned a likely tale but its the truth krispos repeated the villagers backed him up aye sir it is by phos we had many dead a healerpriest among em my wife my father my son i could hardly walk for a month let alone farm the tax collector raised a hand this matters not at all krispos grew angry what do you mean it doesnt matter he ducked under malalas canopy stabbed a finger down at the register on the tax mans knees varades is dead phostisthats my fatheris dead and so are my mother and sister tzykalas son of the same name is dead he went through the whole melancholy list none of it moved malalas a hairsbreadth as you say young man i am new here for all i knowin fact i think it likelythe people you name may be hiding in the woods laughing up their sleeves ive seen that happen before believe you me krispos did believe him had he not ferreted out such cheats he would not have been so arrogantly certain of what was happening here krispos wished those cheats down to skotos ice for theyd made the tax man blind to any real problems a village might have the full proportion named is due and shall be collected malalas went on even if every word you say is true taxes are assessed by village not by individual the fisc has need of what you produce and what the fisc needs it takes he nodded back toward the waiting soldiers pay peaceably or it will be the worse for you pay peaceably and it will be the worse for us krispos said bitterly taxes were assessed collectively he knew to make sure villagers tolerated no shirkers among them and so they would have to make good the labor of anyone who left to use the law to force them to make up for disaster was savagely unjust that did not stop malalas he announced the amount due from the village so many goldpieces or their equivalent in the crops just harvested all of which were carefully and accurately listed in the register the villagers brought what they had set aside for the annual assessment with much sweat and scraping they had amassed an amount just short of what theyd paid the year before zabdas surely would have been satisfied malalas was not well have the rest of it now he said guarded by his soldiers the clerks hed brought along swarmed over the village like ants raiding a pot of lard they opened storage pit after storage pit and shoveled the grain and beans and peas into leather sacks krispos watched the systematic plundering youre worse thieves than the kubratoi he shouted to malalas the tax man spoiled it by taking it for a compliment my dear fellow i should hope so the barbarians have rapacity aye but no system do please note however that we are not arbitrary we take no more than the avtokrator anthimos law ordains you please note excellent sir krispos made the title into a curse that what the avtokrators law ordains will leave some of us to starve malalas only shrugged for a moment red fury so filled krispos that he almost shouted for the villagers to seize weapons and fall on the tax collector and his party even if they massacred them though what good would it do it would only bring more imperial soldiers down on their heads and those troops would be ready to kill not merely to steal enough there malalas called at length after one of his clerks came up to whisper in his ear no we dont need that barleyfill in the pit again now let us be off we have another of these miserable little hamlets to visit tomorrow he remounted so did his clerks and the cavalrymen who had protected them their harness jingled as they rode out of the village the inhabitants stared after them then to the emptied storage pits for a long time no one spoke then domokos tried to put the best light he could on things maybe if were all very watchful we can his voice trailed away not even he believed what he was saying krispos trudged back to his house he picked up a trowel went around to the side of the house away from the square bent down and started digging finding what he was looking for took longer than hed expected after a dozen years hed forgotten exactly where hed buried that lucky goldpiece at last though it lay gleaming on his muddy palm he almost threw the coin away at that moment anything with an avtokrators face on it was hateful to him common sense however soon prevailed might be a good while before i see another one of these he muttered he struck the goldpiece in the pouch he wore on his belt he went into his house again from their places on the wall he took down spear and sword the sword he belted on next to his pouch the spear would also do for a staff he went outside clouds were building in the north the fall rains had not yet started but they would soon when the roads turned to mud a staff would be handy he looked around anything else i need he asked out loud he ducked inside one last time came out with half a loaf of bread then he walked back to the village square domokos and evdokia were still standing there along with several other people they were talking about malalas visit in the soft stunned tones they would have used after a flood or other natural disaster domokos raised an eyebrow when he saw the gear krispos carried going hunting he asked his brotherinlaw you might say so krispos answered hunting something better than this anyhow if the empire can rob us worse than the wild men ever did whats the use of farming a long time ago i wondered what else i could do im off for videssos the city to try to find out evdokia took his arm dont go sister i think i have to you and domokos have each other me he bit his lip i tear myself up inside every time i go home you know why he waited until evdokia nodded her face was twisted too he went on besides ill be one less mouth to feed here thats bound to helpa little anyhow will you soldier then domokos asked maybe krispos still did not like the idea if i cant find anything else i guess i will evdokia embraced him phos guard you on the road and in the city krispos saw by how quickly she stopped arguing that she realized he was doing what he needed to do he hugged her too felt the swell of her growing belly against him he clasped domokos hand then he walked away from them away from everything hed ever known west toward the highway that led south to the city from the village to the imperial capital was a journey of about ten days for a man in good condition and serious about his walking krispos was both but took three weeks to get there he stopped to help gather beans for a day here to cut timber for an afternoon there for whatever other odd jobs he could find he got to videssos the city with food in his belly and some money in his pouch besides his goldpiece he had already seen marvels on his way south for as the road neared the city it came down by the sea hed stopped and stared for long minutes at the sight of water that went on and on forever but that was a natural wonder and now he was come to one worked by man the walls of videssos hed seen city walls before at imbros and at several towns hed passed on his journey theyd seemed splendid things then huge and strong next to the walls he approached now they were as toys and toddlers toys at that before videssos outer wall was a broad deep ditch that outwall loomed five or six times as tall as a man every fifty to a hundred yards stood square or hexagonal towers that were taller still krispos would have thought those works could hold out skotos himself let alone any mortal foe the city might face but behind that outer wall stood another mightier yet its towers were sited between those of the outwall so some tower bore directly on every inch of ground in front of the wall dont stand there gawking you miserable bumpkin someone called from behind krispos he turned and saw a gentleman with a fine hooded cloak to keep him dry the rain had started the night before long since soaked krispos had stopped caring about it his cheeks hot he hurried toward the gate that proved a marvel in itself with valves of iron and bronze and wood thick as a mans body peering up as he walked under the outwall he saw troopers looking down at him through iron gates what are they doing up there he asked a guardsman who was keeping traffic moving smoothly through the gate the guard smiled suppose you were an enemy and somehow youd managed to batter down the outer door how would you like to have boiling water or redhot sand poured down on your head not very much thanks krispos shuddered the gate guard laughed neither would i he pointed to krispos spear have you come to join up youll get better gear than that i promise you i might depending on what kind of other luck i find here krispos said by the way the gate guard nodded krispos was sure hed heard those words or ones much like them many times the fellow said they use the meadow south of here down by the sea for a practice field if you do need to look for an officer you can find one there thanks ill remember krispos said everyone seemed to want to push him toward a soldiers life he shook his head he still did not want to be a soldier surely in a city as great as videssos was said to be a city as great as her walls proclaimed her to be he would be able to find something anything else to do with his life he walked on the valves of the inner walls gates were even stouter than those of the outwall as krispos passed under the inner wall he looked up and saw another set of murderholes feeling quite the city sophisticate he gave the soldiers over his head a friendly nod and kept going a few more steps and he was truly inside videssos the city just as he had in front of the walls he stopped in his tracks to stare the only thing with which he could think to compare the view was the sea now though he gazed on a sea of buildings he had never imagined houses and shops and goldendomed temples to phos stretching as far as the eye could reach again someone behind him shouted for him to get moving he took a few steps then a few more and soon found himself walking through the streets of the city he had no idea where he was going for the moment one place seemed as good as another it was all equally strange and all equally marvelous he flattened himself against the front of a shop to let a muledrawn cart squeeze past in his village the driver would have been someone he knew even in imbros the fellow probably would have raised a finger to his forehead in thanks here he paid krispos no mind at all though the squeaking wheels of his cart almost brushed the newcomers tunic by the set look on his face he had someplace important to go and not enough time to get there that seemed to be a characteristic of the people on the streets living in the most splendid city in the world they gave it even less notice than krispos had the familiar houses of his village they did not notice him either except when his slow walk exasperated them then they sidestepped and scooted past him with the adroitness almost of so many dancers their talk the snatches of it that he picked up over the squeal of axles the banging of coppersmiths hammers and the patter of the rain had the same quick elusive quality to it as their walk sometimes he had to think to understand it and some of what he heard eluded him altogether it was videssian aye but not the videssian he had learned from his parents he wandered for a couple of hours once he found himself in a large square that he thought was called the forum of the ox he did not see any oxen in it though everything else in the world seemed to be for sale there fried squid a vendor shouted a twist of breeze brought the savory scent of hot olive oil breading and seafood to krispos nose his stomach growled sightseeing he realized suddenly was hungry work he wasnt sure what a squid was but asked how much three coppers apiece the man answered krispos still had some small change in his pouch from the last job hed done before he got to the city give me two the vendor plucked them from his brazier with a pair of tongs mind your fingers now paltheyre hot he said as he exchanged them for krispos coins krispos almost dropped them but not because they were hot he shifted his spear to the crook of his elbow so he could point can i eat thesethese he did not even know the right word the tentacles surea lot of people say theyre the best part the local gave him a knowing smile not from around these parts are you er no krispos lost himself in the crowd he did not want the squidseller watching while he nerved himself to eat what hed bought the meat inside the breadcrumbs proved white and chewy without any pronounced flavor the tentacles werent much different so far as he could tell from the rest he licked his fingers flicked at his beard to dislodge stray crumbs and walked on darkness began to fall krispos knew just enough of cities to try to find an inn at last he did how much for a meal and a room he asked the tall thin man who stood behind a row of wine and beer barrels that served as a bar five pieces of silver the innkeeper said flatly krispos flinched not counting his goldpiece he did not have that much no matter how he haggled he could not bring the fellow down below three can i sleep in the stables if i tend your animals or stand guard for you he asked the innkeeper shook his head got a horseboy got a bouncer why are you so dear krispos said when i bought squid cheap this afternoon i figured everything elsed behow would you say itin proportion aye squid and fish and clams are cheap enough the innkeeper said if you just want a good fish stew ill give you a big bowl for five coppers we have lots of fish here how not videssos is the biggest port in the world but we have lots of people too so space now spacell cost you oh krispos scratched his head what the innkeeper said made a strange kind of sense even if he was not used to thinking in those terms ill take that bowl of stew and thank you but where am i supposed to sleep tonight even if it wasnt raining i wouldnt want to do it on the streets dont blame you the innkeeper nodded likely youd get robbed the first nightdoesnt matter how sharp your spear is if youre not awake to use it armed that way though you could try the barracks not till ive tried everything else krispos said stubbornly if i sleep in the barracks once ill end up sleeping there for years i just want a place to set my head till i find steady work i see what youre saying the innkeeper walked over to the fireplace stirred the pot that hung over it with a wooden spoon your best betd likely be a monastery if you help with the chores theyll house you for a while and feed you too not a nice stew like this he ladled out a large steaming bowlful but bread and cheese and beer plenty to keep you from starving now lets see those coppers if you please krispos paid him the stew was good the innkeeper gave him a heel of bread to sop up the last of it he wiped his mouth on his damp sleeve waited until the innkeeper was done serving another customer then he said a monastery sounds like a good idea where would i find one there must be a dozen of em in the city the innkeeper stopped to think the one dedicated to the holy pelagios is closest but its small and hasnt the room to take in many off the street better you should try the monastery of the holy skirios they always have space for travelers thanks ill do that how do i get there krispos made the innkeeper repeat the directions several times he wanted to be sure he had them straight once he was he stood in front of the fire to soak up as much warmth as he could then plunged into the night he soon regretted it the directions might have served well enough by daylight in the dark with half the firepots that should have lit the streets doused by rain he got hopelessly lost the innkeepers fire quickly became only a wistful memory few people were out and about so late some traveled in large bands and carried torches to light their way others walked alone in darkness one of those followed krispos for blocks and sank back into deeper shadow whenever krispos turned to look his way farm boy or not he could figure out what that meant he lowered his spear and took a couple of steps toward the skulker the next time he looked around the fellow was gone the longer krispos walked the more he marveled at how many streets and how many miles of streets videssos the city had from the way his feet felt he had tramped all of themand none twice for nothing looked familiar had he stumbled on another inn he would have spent his lucky goldpiece without a second thought instead far more by luck than design he came upon a large low structure with several gates all but one were barred and silent torches burned there though and a stout man in a blue robe stood in the gateway he was armed with an even stouter cudgel which he hefted when krispos walked into the flickering circle of light the torches cast what building is this he asked as he approached he trailed his spear to look as harmless as he could this is the monastery that serves the memory of the holy skirios may phos hallow his soul for all eternity the watchman replied may he indeed krispos said fervently and may i beg shelter of you for the night ive wandered the streets searching for this monastery forforwell it seems like forever the monk at the gate smiled not that long i hope though it is the sixth hour of the night aye come in stranger and be welcome so long as you come in peace he eyed krispos spear and sword by phos i do well enough the watchman said enter then and rest when morning comes you can present yourself to our holy abbot pyrrhos with the others who came in out of the rain this evening he or someone under him will assign you some task for tomorrowor perhaps for some time if you need a longer time of shelter with us agreed krispos said at once he started to walk past the monk then paused pyrrhos you say i knew a man by that name once he frowned trying to remember where or when but gave it up with a shrug after a moment the monk also shrugged ive known two or three myself its a fairly common name aye so it is krispos yawned the monk pointed the way to the common room the abbot pyrrhos was dreaming it was one of those dreams where he knew he was dreaming but did not particularly want to break the mood by exerting his will he was in a line of people coming before some judge whether imperial or divine he could not say he could not hear the judgments the enthroned figure was passing on those in front of him but he was not greatly concerned either he knew he had led a pious life and his worldly sins were also small surely no harsh sentence could fall on him the line moved forward with dreamlike quickness only one woman stood between him and the judge then she too was gone had she walked away disappeared pyrrhos had not noticed but that too was the way of dreams the abbot bowed to the manif it was a manon the throne eyes stern as those of phos transfixed pyrrhos he bowed again and stayed bent at the waist almost he went to hands and knees and then to his belly as if he stood before the avtokrator illustrious lord his dreamvoice quavered silence worm now he could hear the judges voice it reverberated like a thunderclap in his head do as i say and all will be well for videssos fail and all fails with you do you understand aye lord dreampyrrhos said speak and i obey go then to the monastery common room go at once do not wait for dawn call out the name krispos once twice three times give the man who answers every favor treat him as if he were your own son get hence now and do as i have ordained pyrrhos woke to find himself safe in his own bed a guttering lamp illuminated his chamber save for being larger and packed with books it was like the cells in which his monks sleptunlike many abbots he disdained personal comfort as a weakness what a strange dream he whispered all the same he did not get up he yawned instead within minutes he was asleep again he found himself before the enthroned judge once more this time he was at the head of the line if he had thought those eyes stern before they fairly blazed now insolent wretch the judge cried obey or all totters around you summon the man krispos from the common room once twice three times give him the favor you would your own son waste no time in sottish slumber this must be done now go pyrrhos woke with a violent start sweat beaded his forehead and his shaven crown he still seemed to hear the last word of the judges angry shout dinning in his ears he started to get out of bed then stopped anger of his own filled him what business did a dream have telling him what to do deliberately he lay back down and composed himself for sleep it came more slowly this time than before but his disciplined mind enforced rest on him as if it were a program of exercise his eyes sagged shut his breathing grew soft and regular he felt a cold caress of terrorthe judge was coming down from the throne straight for him he tried to run and could not the judge seized him lifting him as if he were light as a mouse summon the man krispos fool he roared and cast pyrrhos from him the abbot fell and fell and fell forever he woke up on the cold stone floor trembling pyrrhos got to his feet he was a bold man even now he started to return to his bed but when he thought of the enthroned judge and those terrible eyesand how they would look should he disobey yet againboldness failed he opened the door to his chamber and stepped out into the hallway two monks returning to their cells from a latenight prayer vigil glanced up in surprise to see someone approaching them as was his right pyrrhos stared through them as if they did not exist they bowed their heads and without a word stood aside to let the abbot pass the door to the common room was barred on the side away from the men the monastery took in pyrrhos had second thoughts as he lifted the barbut he had not fallen out of bed since he was a boy he could not make himself believe he had fallen out of bed tonight shaking his head he went into the common room as always the smell hit him first the smell of the poor the hungry the desperate and the derelict of videssos unwashed humanity stale wine from somewhere the sharp tang of vomit tonight the rain added damp straws mustiness and the oily lanolin reek of wet wool to the mix a man said something to himself as he turned over in his sleep others snored one fellow sat against a wall coughing the consumptives endless racking bark im to pick one of these men to treat as my son the abbot thought one of these it was either that or go back to bed pyrrhos got as far as putting his fingers on the door handle he found he did not dare to work it sighing he turned back krispos he called softly a couple of men stirred the consumptives eyes huge in his thin face met the abbots he could not read the expression in them no one answered him krispos he called again this time he spoke louder someone grumbled someone else sat up again no one replied pyrrhos felt the heat of embarrassment rise to the top of his tonsured head if nothing came of this nights folly he would have some explaining to do perhaps evenhe shuddered at the thoughtto the patriarch himself he hated the idea of making himself vulnerable to gnatios mockery the ecumenical patriarch of videssos was far too secular to suit him but gnatios was petronas cousin and so long as petronas was the most powerful man in the empire his cousin would remain at the head of the ecclesiastical hierarchy one more fruitless call the abbot thought and his ordeal would be over if gnatios wanted to mock him for it well he had endured worse things in his service to phos that reflection steadied him so his voice rang out loud and clear krispos several men sat up now a couple of them glared at pyrrhos for interrupting their rest he had already begun to turn to go back to his chamber when someone said aye holy sir im krispos what do you want of me it was a good question the abbot would have been happier with a good answer for it krispos sat in the monastery study while pyrrhos bustled about lighting lamps when that small homely task was done the abbot took a chair opposite him the lamplight failed to fill his eyesockets or the hollows of his cheeks leaving his face strange and not quite human as he studied krispos what am i to do with you young man he said at last krispos shook his head in bewilderment i couldnt begin to tell you holy sir you called so i answered thats all i know about it he fought down a yawn he would sooner have been back in the common room asleep is it is it indeed the abbot leaned forward voice tight with suppressed eagerness it was as if he were trying to find out something from krispos without letting on that he was trying to by that sign krispos knew him he had been just so a dozen years before asking questions about the goldpiece omurtag had given krisposthe same goldpiece he realized that he had in his pouch save for the passage of time which sat lightly on it pyrrhos gaunt intent face was also the same you were up on the platform with iakovitzes and me krispos said the abbot frowned i crave pardon what was that in kubrat when he ransomed us from the wild men krispos explained i was pyrrhos gaze suddenly sharpened krispos saw that he remembered too by the lord with the great and good mind i was the abbot said slowly he drew the circular sunsign on his breast you were but a boy then it sounded like an accusation as if to remind himself it was true no more krispos touched the hilt of his sword thus reassured he nodded but boy no more pyrrhos said agreeing with him yet here we are drawn back together once more he made the sunsign again then said something completely obscure to krispos no gnatios will not laugh holy sir never mind the abbots attention might have wandered for a moment now it focused on krispos again tell me how you came from whatever village you lived in to videssos the city krispos did speaking of his parents and sisters deaths brought back the pain nearly as strong as if he felt it for the first time he had to wait before he could go on and then with the village still all in disarray our taxes went up a third i suppose to pay for some war at the other end of the empire more likely to pay for anotheror another dozenof anthimos extravagant follies pyrrhos mouth set in a thin hard line of disapproval petronas lets him have his way in them the better to keep the true reins of ruling in his own hands neither of them cares how they gain the gold to pay for such sport so long as they do as may be krispos said its not why we were broken but that we were broken that put me on my way here farmers have hard enough times worrying about nature if the tax man wrecks us too weve got no hope at all thats what it looked like to me and thats why i left pyrrhos nodded ive heard like tales before now though the question arises of what to do with you did you come to the city planning to use the weapons you carry not if i can find anything else to do krispos said at once hmm the abbot stroked his bushy beard you lived all your life till now on a farm yes how are you with horses i can manage i expect krispos answered though im better with mules ive had more to do with them if you know what i mean mules im good with any other livestock too and im your man why do you want to know holy sir because i think that as the flows of your life and mine have come together after so many years it seems fitting for iakovitzes to be mingled with the stream once more as well and because i happen to know that iakovitzes is constantly looking for new grooms to serve in his stables would he take me on holy sir someone hes neverwell just about neverseen before if he would krispos eyes lit up if he would id leap at the chance he would on my urging pyrrhos said were cousins of sorts his greatgrandfather and my grandmother were brother and sister he also owes me a few more favors than i owe him at the moment if he would if you would i couldnt think of anything better krispos meant it if he was going to work with animals it would be almost as if he had the best of farm and city both he hesitated then asked a question he knew was dangerous but why do you want to do this for me holy sir pyrrhos sketched the sunsign after a moment krispos realized that was all the answer hed get when the abbot spoke it was of his cousin understand young man you are altogether free to refuse this if you wish many would without a second thought i dont know if you recall but iakovitzes is a man ofhow shall i say ituncertain temperament perhaps krispos smiled he did remember the abbot smiled too but thinly that is one reason of course why he constantly seeks new grooms truly i may be doing you no favor though i pray to phos that i am sounds to me like you are krispos said i hope so pyrrhos made the sunsign again which puzzled krispos pyrrhos hesitated then went on in justice there is one other thing of which i should warn you iakovitzes is said sometimes to seek ah services from his grooms other than caring for his beasts oh that made krispos hesitate too his memory of the way iakovitzes had touched him was inextricably joined to the mortification hed known on that midwinters day when the villagers poked fun at him and idalkos i dont have any leanings that way myself he said carefully but if he pushes too hard i suppose i can always quitid be no worse off then than if i hadnt met you what you say has a measure of truth in it pyrrhos said very well then if it is your wish i will take you to meet iakovitzes lets go krispos leaped to his feet the abbot stayed seated not quite at this instant he said his voice dry iakovitzes may occasionally go to bed in the ninth hour of the night but i assure you he is not in the habit of rising at this time if we went to his home now we would be turned away from his door most likely with dogs i forgot what time it was krispos said sheepishly go back to the common room sleep the rest of the night there when morning comes we will visit my cousin i promise you pyrrhos yawned i may even try for a little more sleep myself assuming i dont get thrown out of bed again holy sir krispos asked but the abbot did not explain iv iakovitzes house was large but from the outside not otherwise impressive only a few windows interrupted the long whitewashed front that faced the street they were too narrow to let in any thief no matter how young or skinny a second story stood above the first and overhung it by three or four feet in summer that would have created shade now with the rain coming down again it kept krispos and pyrrhos from getting any wetter as the abbot seized the horseshoe that served for a knocker and pounded it against iakovitzes stout front door a servant opened a little grillwork in the center of the door and peered through it abbot pyrrhos he said krispos heard him lift the bar the door opened outward a moment later come in holy sir and your friend as well just inside the doorway lay a mat of woven straw pyrrhos stopped to wipe his muddy sandals on it before he walked down the hall admiring the wit of whoever had come up with such a useful device krispos imitated the abbot have you breakfasted holy sir the servant asked on monastery fare pyrrhos said that suits me well enough but i daresay krispos here would be grateful for a bit more in any case it is on his behalf that i have come to visit your master i see krispos you say his name is very well wait here if you please ill have something sent him from the kitchen and will inform iakovitzes directly thank you pyrrhos said krispos said nothing he was too busy staring hereiakovitzes waiting roomwas the most magnificent place he had ever seen the floor was a mosaic a hunting scene with men spearing boars from horseback krispos had seen mosaic work once before in the dome of phos temple at imbros never in his wildest dreams had he imagined anyone save perhaps the avtokrator possessing a mosaic of his own the waiting room opened onto a courtyard that seemed about the size of the village square krispos had so recently left in the center stood a horse frozen in midrear krispos needed a moment to realize it was a statue around it were patterned rows of hedges and flowers though most of the blooms had already fallen because the season was so late a marble fountain plashed just outside the waiting room as happily as if rain had never been invented here you are sir the view so enthralled krispos that the young man at his elbow might have spoken two or three times before he noticed when he turned with a stammered apology the servant handed him a covered silver tray lobster tail in cream sauce with parsnips and squash i hope that suits you sir what oh yes of course thank you noticing he was babbling krispos shut up so far as he could remember no one had ever called him sir before now this fellow had done it twice in about as many sentences when he lifted the lid the delicious aroma that floated up from the tray drove such maunderings out of his mind the lobster tasted even better than it smelled which amazed him all over again it was sweeter than pork and more delicate than veal and he could only regret that it disappeared so fast iakovitzes cook knew more about what to do with squash and parsnips than any of the village women had too he had just set down the tray and was licking cream sauce off his mustache when iakovitzes came into the waiting room hello pyrrhos he held out his hand for the abbots clasp what brings you here so early and whos this stalwart young chap you have with you his eyes walked up and down krispos youve met him before cousin pyrrhos said have i then id best arrange a guardian to oversee my affairs for my memory is plainly not what it was iakovitzes clapped a hand to his forehead in melodramatic despair he waved pyrrhos and krispos to a couch and sat down himself in a chair close to krispos he pulled it closer yet explain to me then if you would my evident decline into senility pyrrhos was either long used to iakovitzes histrionics or perhaps more likely without enough sense of humor to react much to them krispos here was a great deal younger then the abbot explained he was the boy who stood on the platform with you to seal one of your ransoming bargains with omurtag the more i forget about those beastly trips to kubrat the happier ill be iakovitzes paused stroking his carefully trimmed beard while he studied krispos again by phos i do recall he said you were a pretty boy then and youre quite the handsome youth now by that proud nose of yours id almost guess you were a vaspurakaner though if youre from the northern border i dont suppose thats likely my father always said his side of the family had vaspurakaner blood krispos said iakovitzes nodded it could be so princes resettled there after some old waror some old treachery whether or not the look becomes you krispos did not know how to answer that so he kept quiet some of the village girls had praised his looks but never a man before to his relief iakovitzes turned back to pyrrhos you were about to tell me i expect how and why dear krispos here comes to be in the city instead of back at his rustic village and also how and why that pertains to me krispos saw how his sharp eyes bored into the abbots he also noted that iakovitzes was not going to say anything of consequence until he heard pyrrhos story he thought better of him for it whatever iakovitzes taste in pleasures the man was no fool the abbot told the tale as krispos had given it to him then carried it forward his explanation of how he had come to call for krispos in the monastery was vague krispos had thought so the night before iakovitzes however was in a position to call pyrrhos on it i dont follow you there he said back up and tell me just how that happened pyrrhos looked harassed only if i have your vow by the lord with the great and good mind to let the story go no furtherand yours as well krispos krispos swore the oath after a moment iakovitzes did too very well then the abbot said heavily he told of his three dreams of the night before and of ending up on the floor after the last one silence filled the waiting room when he was done iakovitzes broke it asking and you think this meanswhat i wish i knew pyrrhos burst out he sounded as exasperated as he looked that it is a sending i think no one could deny but whether it is for good or evil from phos or skotos or neither i would not begin to guess i can only say that in some way quite unapparent to me krispos here is more remarkable than he seems he seems remarkable enough though perhaps not in the way you mean iakovitzes said with a smile so you brought him to me eh cousin to fulfill your dreams commandment to treat him like a son i suppose i should be flatteredunless you think your dream does bode ill and are not letting on no no priest of phos could do such a thing without yielding his soul to the certainty of skotos ice pyrrhos said iakovitzes steepled his fingertips i suppose not he turned his smile charming and cynical at the same time on krispos so young man now that you are herefor good or illwhat would you i came to videssos the city for work krispos said slowly the abbot tells me youre hiring grooms ive lived on a farm all my life but for the last couple of weeks you wont find many cityraised folk better with beasts than i am there is probably a good deal of truth in that iakovitzes raised an eyebrow did my cousin the most holy abbot he spoke with such fulsome sincerity that the praise sounded like sarcasm also ah warn you that i sometimes seek more from my grooms than skill with animals alone yes krispos said flatly then kept still finally iakovitzes prompted him and so sir if thats what you want from me i expect youll be able to find it elsewhere with less trouble i do thank you for the breakfast and for your time thank you as well holy sir krispos added for pyrrhos benefit as he stood to go dont be hasty iakovitzes jumped to his feet too i do need grooms as a matter of fact suppose i take you on with no requirement past caring for the beasts with room and board andhmma goldpiece a week you pay the others two pyrrhos said dear cousin i thought you priests reckoned silence a virtue iakovitzes said it was the sweetest snarl krispos had heard iakovitzes turned back to him very well then two goldpieces a week though you lacked the wit to ask for them yourself just the beasts krispos said just the beastsiakovitzes sighedthough you must not hold it against me if from time to time i try to find out whether youve changed your mind will you hold it against me if i keep saying no iakovitzes sighed again i suppose not then weve got ourselves a bargain krispos stuck out his hand it almost swallowed iakovitzes though the smaller mans grip was surprisingly strong gomaris iakovitzes shouted the man who had let in krispos and pyrrhos appeared a moment later panting a little gomaris krispos will be one of the grooms from now on why dont you find him some clothes better than those rags he has on and then get him settled in with the rest of the lads of course come along krispos and welcome to the household gomaris waited till he was halfway down the hall then added softly whatever else it is around here its rarely dull that said krispos i believe here comes the farm boy krispos heard the whisper as he came into the stable by the way barses and meletios sniggered at each other he had been meant to hear he scowled they were both younger than he but they were also from the city and from families of more than a little wealth so were most of iakovitzes grooms they seemed to enjoy making krispos life miserable barses took a shovel off the wall and thrust it at krispos here you are farm boy since youve lived with manure all your life you can clean out the stalls today youre used to smelling like the hind end of a horse his handsome face split in a wide mocking grin its not my turn to shovel out today krispos said shortly oh but we think you should do it anyway barses said dont we meletios the other groom nodded he was even handsomer than barses almost pretty in fact no krispos said barses eyes went wide in feigned surprise the farm boy grows insolent i think well have to teach him a lesson so we will meletios said smiling in anticipation he stepped toward krispos i wonder how fast farm boys learn ive heard theyre not too bright krispos frown deepened hed known for a week that the hazing hed been sweating out would turn physical sooner or later hed thought he was readybut two against one wasnt how hed wanted it to happen he held up a hand wait he said in a high alarmed voice ill clean em give me the shovel barses held it out his face showed an interesting mix of amusement triumph and contempt youd best do a good job too farm boy or well make you lick up whatever you krispos snatched the shovel from his hands whirled and rammed the handle into the pit of meletios stomach the groom closed up on himself like a bellows gasping uselessly for air krispos threw the shovel aside come on he snarled at barses or arent you as good with your hands as you are with your mouth youll see farm boy barses sprang at him he was strong and fearless and knew something of what he was doing but hed never been through anything like the course in nasty fighting krispos had taken from idalkos in less than two minutes he was down in the straw beside meletios groaning and trying to hold his knee his groin his ribs and a couple of dislocated fingers all at the same time krispos stood over the other two grooms breathing hard one of his eyes was half closed and a collarbone had gotten a fearful whack but hed dished out a lot more than hed taken he picked up the shovel and tossed it between meletios and barses you can shovel out for yourselves meletios grabbed the shovel and started to swing it at krispos ankles krispos stamped on his hand meletios shrieked and let go krispos kicked him in the ribs with force nicely calculated to yield maximum hurt and minimum permanent damage come to think of it meletios you do the shoveling today you just earned it even through his pain meletios let out an indignant squawk and cast a look of appeal toward barses the other groom was just sitting up he shook his head then grimaced as he regretted the motion im not going to argue with him meletios and if you have any sense you wont either he managed a lopsided grin nobody with any sense is going to argue with krispos not after today the harassment did not disappear with a dozen grooms ranging from their midteens up to krispos age and all living in one anothers pockets that would hardly have been possible but after krispos dealt with barses and meletios he was accepted as one of the group and got to hand it out as well as take it not only that he got himself listened to where before the other grooms had paid no attention to what he thought thus when they were hashing over the best way to treat a horse with a mild but stubborn fever one of them turned to krispos and askedwhat would you have done about this in that backwoods place you came from the green forage is all very well he said after a little thought and the wet sloppy food and gruel but we always said there was nothing like beer to speed things along beer the grooms whopped barses asked for us or the animal krispos laughed too but said for the animal a bucket or three ought to do the job he means it meletios said in surprise he turned thoughtful he was all business where horses were concerned iakovitzes tolerated no groom who was not whatever other charms he might have in a musing tone meletios went on what say we try it i dont see how it could do any harm so a couple of buckets of beer went into the horses trough every morning and if the grooms bought a bit more than the sick animal really needed why only they knew about that and after a few days the horses condition did improve his breathing slowed his eyes brightened and his skin and mouth lost the dry look and feel theyd had while he was ill well done barses said when the horse was clearly on the mend next time i take a fever you know what to do with me though id sooner have wine i think krispos threw a clod of dirt at him iakovitzes had watched the treatment with as much interest as any of the grooms when it succeeded he handed krispos a goldpiece and come sup with me this evening if you care to he said his sharp voice as smooth as he could make it thank you very much sir krispos said meletios sulked for the rest of the day krispos finally asked him what was wrong he glared if i told you i was jealous youd probably beat on me again jealous krispos needed a few seconds to catch on oh dont worry about that i only fancy girls so you say meletios answered darkly but iakovitzes fancies you krispos snorted and went back to work around sunset he walked over to iakovitzes main house this was the first meal hed eaten there since his breakfast of lobster tail the grooms had their own dining hall like as not he thought meletios was fretting over nothing if some big banquet was planned krispos might not even be at the same table as his master as soon as gomaris led him to a chamber large enough only for two krispos knew meletios had been right and he himself wrong a small lamp on the table left most of the room in twilight hello krispos iakovitzes said rising to greet him here have some wine he poured with his own hand krispos was used to the rough vintages the villagers had made for themselves what iakovitzes gave him slid down his throat like a smooth whisper he would have thought it mere grape juice but for the warmth it left in his middle another cup iakovitzes asked solicitously id like the chance to toast you for your cleverness in dosing stormbreeze the beast seems in fine fettle again thanks to you iakovitzes raised his cup in salute krispos knew drinking too much with his master was not a good idea but had no polite way to do anything else the wine was so good he scarcely felt guilty about soaking it up gomaris fetched in supper a platter of halibut grilled with garlic and leeks the herbs sharp flavors reminded krispos of his home but the only fish hed had there was an occasional trout or carp taken from a stream hardly worth mentioning beside a delicacy like this delicious he mumbled in one of the few moments when his mouth was not full glad you enjoy it iakovitzes said we have a proverb hereabouts if you come to videssos the city eat fish at least this fish is to your liking after the fish came smoked partridges one little bird apiece and after the partridges plums and figs candied in honey the grooms ate well enough but not fare like this krispos knew he was stuffing himself he found he did not care after all iakovitzes had invited him here to eat his master rose to fill his cup again then sent him a reproachful look when he saw its contents hardly touched dear boy youre not drinking does the vintage fail to suit you no its very good krispos said its just that he groped for an excuse i dont want to get all sozzled and act the fool a commendable attitude but you neednt worry i recognize that part of the pleasure of wine is not worrying so much over what one does and pleasures krispos do not come to us so often in this life that they are to be lightly despised remembering the troubles that had made him leave his village krispos found some truth in iakovitzes words iakovitzes went on for instance i am sure though you do not complain of it that you must be worn from your toil with the horses let me soothe you if i can before krispos could reply iakovitzes hurried round behind his chair and began to massage his shoulders he knew what he was about krispos felt the tension flowing out of him he also felt though the quivering eagerness iakovitzes could not keep from his hands he knew what that meant he had known when he was nine years old not without some reluctance he twisted in his seat so he faced iakovitzes i said when you took me on that i didnt care for these games iakovitzes kept his aplomb and i told you that wouldnt stop me from being interested were you like some ive known i could offer you gold somehow though with you i dont think that would do much good or am i wrong he finished hopefully youre not wrong krispos said at once too bad too bad the dim lamplight caught a spark of malice in iakovitzes eye shall i turn you out on the street then for your obstinacy whatever you like of course krispos kept his voice as steady as he could he refused to give his master such a hold on him iakovitzes sighed that would be ungrateful of me wouldnt it after what you did for stormbreeze have it as you wish krispos but its not as if i were offering you anything vile many enjoy it im sure thats true sir krispos thought of meletios i just dont happen to be one of those folk too bad iakovitzes said here have some more wine anyhow we might as well finish the jar why not krispos drank another cup it was too good to decline then he yawned and said it must be late id best get back to my own chamber if im going to be worth anything in the morning i suppose so iakovitzes said indifferentlyone hour was as good as another to him when he tried to kiss krispos good night krispos thought he made his sidestep seem completely natural until he saw his master raise an ironic eyebrow after that krispos retreated in some haste to his surprise he found barses and a couple of the other grooms waiting up for him well barses said well what krispos set himself if barses wanted revenge for their fight he might get it three against one in fact just about guaranteed he would but that was not what barses had in mind well you and iakovitzes of course did you no shame to you if you didthe only reason i want to know is that i have a bet which way i wont tell you that if you say its none of my business the bet waits until iakovitzes makes things clear one way or the other he will you know krispos was sure of that the wine hed drunk weakened whatever urge he had to keep the evening a secret no we didnt he said i like girls too well to be interested in the sports he enjoys barses grinned and clapped him on the back then turned to one of the other grooms with his palm up pay me that goldpiece agrabast i told you he wouldnt agrabast gave him the coin next question barses said did he toss you out for turning him down no he thought about it but he didnt good thing i didnt let you double the bet for that barses agrabast said iakovitzes loves his beasts about as well as he loves his prick he wouldnt throw away anybody whod shown he knew something about horseleeching i figured that out barses said i was hoping you hadnt well to the ice with you agrabast retorted to the ice with all of you if you dont get out of my way and let me have some sleep krispos started to push past the other grooms then stopped and added meletios can stop worrying now everyone laughed when the chuckles died down though barses said you are from the country krispos maybe we look at things a little different from you i meant what i said beforethered be no shame in saying yes to iakovitzes and meletios isnt the only one of us who has i never said he was krispos answered but as far as i can see hes the only one whos put some worry into it so now he can stop thats fair enough i suppose barses said judiciously whether it is or whether its not out of my way before i fall asleep where im standing krispos made as if to advance on the other grooms laughing again they moved aside to let him by all winter long iakovitzes cast longing looks krispos way all winter long krispos pretended he did not see them he tended his masters horses iakovitzes usually took along a groom when he went to a feast krispos as often as anyone else and when he feasted other nobles in turn all the grooms attended so he could show them off at first krispos viewed the empires nobility with the same awe he had given videssos the city when he was just arrived his awe for the nobles soon wore off he found they were men like any others some clever some plain some downright stupid as barses said of one its a good thing for him he inherited his money because hed never figure out how to make any on his own by contrast the more krispos explored the city the more marvelous he found it every alleyway had something new an apothecarys stall perhaps or a temple to phos so small only a double handful of worshipers could use it even streets he knew well gave him new people to see swarthy makuraners in caftans and felt pillbox hats big blond halogai gaping at videssos just as he had stocky kubratoi in furs krispos kept his distance from them he could not help wondering if any had been among the riders whod kidnapped him and his family or plundered the village north of the mountains and there were the videssians themselves the people of the city brash bumptious loud cynical nothing like the farm folk among whom hed grown up to the ice with you you blithering bungling booby a shopkeeper shouted at an artisan one afternoon this pane of glass i ordered is half a foot too short up yours too friend the glassblower pulled out a scrap of parchment thats what i thought seventeen by twentytwo thats what you ordered thats what i made you cant measure dont blame me he was yelling too a crowd began to gather people poked their heads out of windows to see what was going on the shopkeeper snatched the parchment out of his hand i didnt write this it didnt write itself friend the glassblower tried to snatch it back the shopkeeper jerked it away they stood nose to nose screaming at each other and waving their fists shouldnt we get between them before they pull knives krispos said to the man beside him and wreck the show are you crazy by the fellows tone he thought krispos was after a moment he grudgingly went on they wont go at it theyll just yell till its out of their systems then go on about their business you wait and see the local proved right krispos would have admitted it but the man hadnt stayed to see the results of his prediction after things calmed down krispos left too shaking his head his home village hadnt been like this at all he was almost to iakovitzes house when he saw a pretty girl she smiled when he caught her eye strode up to him bold as brass his home village hadnt been like that either then she said a piece of silver and im yours for the afternoon three and im yours for the whole night too she ran her hand along his arm her nails and lips were painted the same shade of red sorry krispos answered i dont feel like paying for it she looked him up and down then gave a regretful shrug no i dont expect youd need to very often too bad i wouldve enjoyed it more with someone who didnt have to buy but when she saw he meant his no she walked on down the street swinging her hips like most people in the city she didnt waste time where she had no hope of profit krispos turned his head and watched her till she rounded a corner he decided not to go back to iakovitzes right away after all it was too late for lunch too early for supper or serious drinking that meant a certain pert little barmaid he knew ought to be able to slip away forfor just long enough he thought grinning snow gave way to sleet which in turn yielded to rain by the standards krispos used to judge videssos the city had a mild winter even so he was glad to see spring return iakovitzes horses were too they cropped the tender new grass till their dung came thin and green shoveling it made krispos less delighted with the season one fine morning when such shoveling was someone elses concern he started out on an errand of his ownnot the little barmaid with whom he had broken up but a more than reasonable substitute he opened iakovitzes front door then drew back in surprise what looked like a parade was coming up to the house the city folk loved parades so this one not surprisingly had a fairsize crowd around it krispos needed a moment to see that at its heart were bearers withhe counted quicklyeleven silk parasols the avtokrator of videssos rated only one more as krispos realized who iakovitzes visitor had to be a gorgeously robed servitor detached himself from the head of the procession he declared forth comes his illustrious highness the sevastokrator petronas to call upon your master iakovitzes be so good fellow as to announce him properly that was gomaris job krispos fled without worrying about such niceties if the emperors uncle wanted something done niceties did not matter by luck iakovitzes was up and about and had even finished breakfast he frowned when krispos burst into the waiting room where he was having a second cup of wine when krispos gasped out the news he frowned again in a very different way oh plague this place looks like a sty well it cant be helped not if petronas wants to show up before anyones awake iakovitzes gulped his wine and fixed krispos with a glare what are you doing just standing around go tell his illustrious highness im delighted to receive himand any other sweet lies you can think up on the way krispos dashed back to the door expecting to relay the polite message to the sevastokrators man instead he almost ran headon into petronas himself petronas robe of crimson shot with gold and silver thread made his servants shabby by comparison careful there dont hurt yourself the sevastokrator said chuckling as krispos almost fell over himself trying to stop bow and go to his right knee all at once hhighness krispos stammered my master is ddelighted to receive you not this early he isnt petronas voice was dry from his perch on one knee krispos glanced up at the most powerful man in the empire of videssos the images hed seen back in his village hadnt suggested that the sevastokrator owned a sense of humor they also made him out to be a few years younger than he was krispos guessed he was past fifty rather than nearing it but his true features conveyed the same sense of confident competence as had his portraits now he reached out to tap krispos on the shoulder come on young fellow take me to him whats your name anyhow krispos highness krispos said as he got to his feet this way if you please petronas fell into step with him krispos while im engaged with your master can you see to it that my retinue gets some wine and maybe cheese or bread as well just standing there and waiting for me to finish is boring duty for them ill take care of it krispos promised iakovitzes he saw as he led the sevastokrator into the waiting room had slipped into a new robe himself it was also crimson but not so deep and rich a shade as petronas moreover while iakovitzes still wore sandals petronas had on a pair of black boots with red trim only anthimos was entitled to boots scarlet from top to toe when krispos stuck his head into the kitchen with word of what petronas wanted the cook who had fixed iakovitzes breakfast yelped in dismay then he started slicing onion rolls and hard cheese like a man possessed he shouted for someone to give him a hand krispos filled wine cupscheap earthenware cups not the crystal and silver and gold from which iakovitzes fancy guests drankand set them on trays other servants whisked them away to petronas men having done his duty krispos slipped out a side door to go meet his girl youre late she said crossly im sorry sirikia he kissed her to show how sorry he was just as i was leaving to see you petronas the sevastokrator came to visit my master and they needed my help for a little while he hoped she would imagine more intimate help than standing in the kitchen pouring wine evidently she did for her annoyance vanished i met the sevastokrator once she told krispos she was just a seamstress though he would not have said so out loud he doubted her until she proudly explained on midwinters day a couple of years ago he pinched my bottom anything can happen on midwinters day he agreed soberly he smiled at her i thought petronas was a man of good taste she thought that over for a moment blinked and threw her arms around his neck oh krispos you say the sweetest things the rest of the morning passed most enjoyably gomaris spotted krispos on his way back to the grooms quarters that afternoon not so fast the steward said iakovitzes wants to see you why he knows this was my morning off he didnt tell me why he just told me to look out for you now ive found you hes in the small waiting roomyou know the one next to his bedchamber wondering what sort of trouble he was in and hoping his master did remember hed had the morning free krispos hurried to the waiting room iakovitzes was sitting behind a small table with several thick scrolls of parchment looking for all the world like a tax collector at the moment his scowl made him look like a tax collector visiting a village badly in arrears oh its you he said as krispos walked in about time go pack krispos gulped sir of all the things hed expected being so baldly ordered to hit the streets was the last what did i do sir can i make amends for it what are you talking about iakovitzes said peevishly after a few seconds his face cleared no you dont know what im talking about it seems theres some sort of squabble going on between our people and the khatrishers over who owns a stretch of land between two little streams north of the town of opsikion the local eparch cant make the khatrishers see sensebut then trying to dicker with khatrishersd drive skotos mad petronas doesnt want this mess blowing up into a border war hes sending me to opsikion to try to make sense of it the explanation left krispos as confused as before what does that have to do with me packing youre coming with me krispos opened his mouth then closed it again when he discovered he had nothing worthwhile to say this would be travel on far more comfortable terms than the slog from his village to videssos the city once he got to opsikion he could also hope to learn a good deal about what iakovitzes was doing and how he did it the more he learned he was discovering the more possibilities opened up in his life on the other hand iakovitzes would surely use the trip as one long chance to try to get him into bed he had trouble gauging just how big a nuisance that would be or how annoyed iakovitzes might get when he kept saying no an opportunity a likelihood of trouble as far as he could tell they balanced he certainly had no other good options so he said very well excellent sir ill pack at once the road dipped one last time suddenly instead of mountains and trees all around krispos saw ahead of him hills dipping swiftly toward the blue sea where land and water met stood opsikion its red tile roofs glowing in the sun he reined in his horse to admire the view iakovitzes came up beside him he also stopped well thats very pretty isnt it he said he let go of the reins with his right hand as if by accident it fell on krispos thigh yes it is krispos said sighing he dug his heels into his horses flanks it started forward almost at a trot also sighing iakovitzes followed you are the most stubborn man ive ever wanted he said his voice tight with irritation krispos did not answer if iakovitzes wanted to see stubbornness he thought all he needed to do was peer at his reflection in a stream in the month theyd taken to ride east from videssos the city to opsikion hed tried seducing krispos every night and most afternoons that hed got nowhere did not stop him neither did the several times hed bedded other more complacent partners iakovitzes pulled alongside again if i didnt find you so lovely curse it id break you for your obstinacy he snapped dont push me too far i might anyhow krispos had no doubt iakovitzes meant what he said as he had before he laughed i was a peasant taxed off my farm how could you break me any lower than that as long as iakovitzes knew he was not afraid of such threats krispos thought the peppery little man would hesitate before he acted on them so it proved now iakovitzes fumed but subsided they rode together toward opsikion as they were in nonetooclean travelers clothes the gate guards paid no more attention to them than to anyone else they waited while the guards poked swords into bales of wool a fuzzybearded khatrisher merchant was bringing to town making sure he wasnt smuggling anything inside them the merchants face was so perfectly innocent that krispos suspected him on general principles iakovitzes did not take kindly to waiting here you he called to one of the guards in peremptory tones stop messing about with that fellow and see to us the guard set hands on hips and looked iakovitzes over and why should i small stuff without waiting for a reply he started to turn back to what hed been doing because you insolent illsmelling pockfaced lout i am the direct representative of his illustrious highness the sevastokrator petronas and of his imperial majesty the avtokrator anthimos iii come to this miserable latrine trench of a town to settle matters your eparch has botched bungled and generally mishandled iakovitzes bit off each word with savage relish as he spoke he unrolled and displayed the large parchment that proved he was what he claimed it was daubed with seals in several colors of wax and bore the avtokrators signature in appallingly official scarlet ink the gate guard went from furious red to terrified white in the space of three heartbeats sorry brison he muttered to the wool merchant youve just got to hang on for a bit now theres a fine kettle of crabs brison said in a lisping accent maybe ill pass the time mixing my horses around so you wont be sure which ones youve checked he grinned to see how the gate guard liked that idea oh go to the ice the harassed guard said brison laughed out loud ignoring him the guard turned to iakovitzes ii crave pardon for my rough tongue excellent sir how may i help you better iakovitzes nodded i wont ask for your name after all tell me how to reach the eparchs residence then you can go back to your petty games with this chap here i suggest that while youre at it you sword his beard as well as his wool brison laughed again quite merrily the gate guard stuttered out directions iakovitzes rode past them he kept his eyes straight ahead not deigning to acknowledge either man any further krispos followed i put that arrogant bastard in chain mail in his place nicely enough iakovitzes said once he and krispos got into town but khatrishers are too lightminded to notice when theyve been insulted cheeky buggers the lot of them failing to get under someones skin always annoyed him he swore softly as he rode down opsikions main street krispos paid his master little attention he was resigned to his bad temper opsikion interested him more it was a little larger than imbros a year ago he thought it would have seemed enormous to him after videssos it reminded him of a toy city small but perfect even phos temple in the central square was modeled after the great high temple of the capital the eparchs hall was across the square from the temple iakovitzes took out his frustration over leaving brison in good spirits by baiting a clerk as mercilessly as he had the gate guard his tactics were cruel but also effective moments later the clerk ushered him and krispos into the eparchs office the local governor was a thin sourlooking man named sisinnios so youve come to dicker with the khatrishers have you he said when iakovitzes presented his impressive scroll may you get more joy from it than i have these days my belly starts paining me the day before i talk with em and doesnt let up for three days afterward whats the trouble exactly iakovitzes asked i presume we have documents to prove the land in question is ours by right though he phrased it as a question he spoke with the same certainty he would have used in reciting phos creed krispos sometimes thought nothing really existed in videssos without a document to show it was there when sisinnios rolled his eyes the dark bags under them made him look like a mournful hound oh we have documents he agreed morosely getting the khatrishers to pay em any mind is something else again ill fix that iakovitzes promised does this place boast a decent inn bolkanes is probably the best sisinnios said its not far he gave directions good krispos go set us up with rooms there now sir this he directed to sisinnios lets see these documents and set me up a meeting with this khatrisher who ignores them bolkanes inn proved good enough and by the standards of videssos the city absurdly cheap taking iakovitzes literally krispos rented separate rooms for his master and himself he knew iakovitzes would be irked but did not feel like guarding himself every minute of every night indeed iakovitzes did grumble when he came to the inn a couple of hours later and discovered the arrangements krispos had made the grumble though was an abstracted one most of his mind remained on the fat folder of documents he carried under one arm he took negotiations seriously youll have to amuse yourself as best you can for a while krispos he said as they sat down to a dinner of steamed prawns in mustard sauce phos alone knows how long im liable to be closeted with this lexo from khatrish if hes as bad as sisinnios makes him out to be maybe forever if you please sir krispos said hesitantly may i join you at your talks iakovitzes paused with a prawn in midair why on earth would you want to do that his eyes narrowed no videssian noble trusted what he did not understand to learn what i can krispos answered please remember sir im but a couple of seasons away from my village most of your other grooms know much more than i do just because theyve lived in videssos the city all their lives i ought to take whatever chances i have to pick up useful things to know hmm that watchful expression did not leave iakovitzes face youre apt to be bored if i am ill leave hmm iakovitzes said again and then well why not id thought you content with the horses but if you think youre fit for more no harm in your trying who can say it may turn out to my advantage as well as yours now iakovitzes looked calculating a look krispos knew well one of the nobles eyebrows quirked upward as he went on i didnt bring you here with that in mind however i know krispos was beginning to learn to keep his own maneuvers hidden now his thoughts were that if he made himself useful enough to iakovitzes in other ways the noble might give up on coaxing him into bed well see how it goes iakovitzes said sisinnios is setting up the meeting with the khatrisher for around the third hour of the day tomorrowhalfway between sunrise and noon he smiled a smile krispos had seen even more often than his calculating look reading by lamplight gives me a headache i can think of a better way to spend the night krispos sighed iakovitzes hadnt given up yet sisinnios said excellency i present to you lexo who represents gumush the khagan of khatrish lexo here is the most eminent iakovitzes from videssos the city and his spatharios krispos the title the eparch gave krispos was the vaguest one in the videssian hierarchy it literally meant sword bearer and by extension aide an avtokrators spatharios might be a very important man a nobles spatharios was not krispos was grateful to hear it all the same sisinnios could have introduced him as a groom and let it go at that and now noble sirs if you will excuse me i have other business to which i must attend the eparch said he left a little more quickly than was polite but with every sign of relief lexo the khatrisher was dressed in what would have been a stylish linen tunic but for the leaping stags and panthers embroidered over every inch of it ive heard of you eminent sir he told iakovitzes bowing in his seat his beard and mustaches were so full and bushy that krispos could hardly see his lips move among videssians such unkempt whiskers were only for priests you have the advantage of me sir iakovitzes would not let a foreigner outdo him in courtesy i am willing to assume however that any emissary of your khagan is sure to be a most able man you are too gracious to someone you do not know lexo purred his gaze swung to krispos so young fellow youre iakovitzes spatharios are you tell me just where do you bear that sword of his the khatrishers smile was bland even so krispos jerked as if stung for a moment all he could think of was wiping the floor with lexo who was more than twice his age and weighed more than he did though several inches shorter but months of living with iakovitzes had taught him the game was not always played with fists doing his best to pull his face straight he answered against his foes and the avtokrators he looked lexo in the eye your sentiments do you credit im sure lexo murmured he turned back to iakovitzes well eminent sir how do you propose to settle what his excellency the good sisinnios and i have been haggling over for months by looking at the facts instead of haggling iakovitzes leaned forward discarding formal ways like a castoff cloak he touched the folder the eparch had given him the facts are here you will agree i have here copies of all documents pertaining to the border between videssos and khatrish for as long as your state has been such rather than merely nomad bandits too ignorant to sign a treaty and too treacherous to honor one the latter trait i notice you still display krispos waited for lexo to explode but the envoys smile did not waver id heard you were charming he said evenly just as he was armored against insult so was iakovitzes against irony i dont care what youve heard sir ive heardthese documents say loud and clearthat the proper frontier between our lands is the akkilaion river not the mnizou as you have claimed how dare you contradict them because the memories of my people are long lexo said iakovitzes snorted lexo took no notice but went on memories are like leaves you know they pile up in the forests of our minds and we go scuffing through them iakovitzes snorted again louder very pretty i hadnt heard gumush was sending out poets to speak for him these days id have thought their disregard for the truth disqualified them you flatter me for my poor words lexo said should you desire true poetry i will give you the tribal lays of my folk he began to declaim partly in his lisping videssian more often in a speech that reminded krispos of the one the kubratoi used among themselves he nodded remembering that the ancestors of both khatrishers and kubratoi had come off the pardrayan steppe long ago i could go on for some while lexo said after going on for some while but i hope you get the gist that the great raid of balbad badbals son reached the mnizou and drove all videssians over it thus it is only just for khatrish to claim the mnizou as its southern boundary gumushs grandfather didnt nor his father either iakovitzes replied unmoved by his opponents oratory if you stack the treaties they signed against your tribal lays the treaties weigh heavier how can any man presume to know where the balance between them lies any more than a man can know the balance between phos and skotos in the world lexo said they both have weight that is what sisinnios would not see nor admit believe in the balance and go to the ice they teach us in videssos iakovitzes said so ill thank you not to drag your eastern heresy into a serious argument just as phos will vanquish skotos in the end so shall our border be restored to its proper place which is to say the akkilaion just as my doctrine is your heresy the reverse also applies where his faith was questioned lexo lost his air of detached amusement in a sharper voice than hed used before he went on i might also point out that the land between the mnizou and the akkilaion has quite as many khatrishers herding as it does videssians farming the concept of the balance seems relevant throw precedent into your cursed balance iakovitzes suggested it will weigh down on the side of truththe side of videssos the lay of balbad badbals son as i have suggested irony again this time laid on heavily enough to make iakovitzes scowl is precedent older than any in that stack of moldering parchments in which you set your stock that lay is a lie iakovitzes growled sir it is not lexo met iakovitzes glare with his own had they been wearing swords they might have used those too in their duel theyd so completely forgotten about krispos that they both stared at him when he asked is age the most important thing that goes into a precedent yes lexo said in the same breath iakovitzes used to say no if it is krispos went on shouldnt videssos claim all of khatrish the empire ruled it long before the khatrishers forefathers arrived there not the same thing at all lexo began while iakovitzes burst out by the good god so we he too stopped before his sentence was done sheepishness did not suit his sharpfeatured face but it was there i think weve just been whirled round on ourselves he said much more quietly than he had been speaking perhaps we have lexo admitted shall we thank your spatharios for the treatment he nodded to krispos i must also crave your pardon young sir i see you do have some use beyond the ornamental why so he does krispos would have been happier with iakovitzes agreement had his master sounded less surprised lexo sighed if you set aside your folder there eminent sir i will sing you no more lays oh very well iakovitzes seldom yielded anything with good grace now though i have to find some other way to make you see that those herders you spoke of will have to fare north of the akkilaion where they belong i like that lexos tone said he did not like it at all why shouldnt your farmers be the ones to move because nomads are nomads of course its much harder to pack up good farmland and ride away with it the bargaining began again in earnest this time now that each man had seen he could not presume too far on the other that first session yielded no agreement nor did the second nor the sixth well get our answer though iakovitzes said one evening back at bolkanes inn i can feel it i hope so krispos picked at the mutton in front of himhe was tired of fish iakovitzes eyed him shrewdly so now you are bored eh didnt i warn you would be maybe i am a little krispos said i didnt expect we would be here for weeks i thought the sevastokrator sent you here just because sisinnios wasnt making any progress with lexo petronas did sisinnios wasnt and i am iakovitzes said these disputes take years to develop they dont go away overnight what did you expect lexo all of a sudden to break down and concede everything on account of the brilliance of my rhetoric krispos had to smile put that way no hrmmp you might have said yes to salve my selfrespect but schedules for how the khatrishers withdraw how much we pay them to go and whether we pay the khagan or give the money direct to the herders who will be leavingall such things have plenty of room in them for horse trading thats what lexo and i are doing now seeing who ends up with a swaybacked old nag i guess so krispos said im afraid its not very interesting to listen to though go ahead and do something else for a while then iakovitzes said i expected you to give up long before this and youve even been useful in the dickering a couple of times too which i didnt expect at all youve earned some time off so krispos instead of closeting himself with the diplomats went wandering through opsikion after those of videssos the city its markets seemed small and for the most part dull the only real bargains krispos saw were fine furs from agder which lay in the far northeast near the haloga country he had more money now than ever before and less to spend it on but he could not come close to affording a snowleopard jacket he came back to the furriers stall several times to peer and to wish he bought a coral pendant to take back to his seamstress friend he almost paid for it with his lucky goldpiece since it had stopped being his only goldpiece hed kept it wrapped in a bit of cloth at the bottom of his pouch somehow it got loose he noticed just in time to substitute another coin the jeweler weighed that one to make sure it was good when he saw it was he shrugged gold is gold he said as he gave krispos his change sorry krispos said i just didnt want to part with that one ive had other customers tell me the same thing the jeweler said if you want to make sure you dont spend it by mistake why not wear it on a chain around your neck wouldnt take me long to bore through it and heres a very nice chain or if youd rather have this one krispos came out of the shop with the lucky goldpiece bumping against his chest under his tunic it felt odd there for the first few days after that he stopped noticing he was wearing it he even slept with it on by that time iakovitzes had lost some of his earlier optimism that poxbrained khatrisher is a serpent he complained just when i think i have something settled he throws a coil around it and drags it back into confusion do you want me to join you again krispos asked eh no thats all right good of you to ask though you show more loyalty than most your age youd probably be more help if you spent the time praying for me phos may listen to you that stubborn donkey of a lexo surely wont krispos knew his master was just grumbling he went to the temple across from sisinnios residence just the same phos was the lord of the good videssos case here he was convinced was good how then could his god fail to heed him the crowd round the temple was thicker than hed seen it before when he asked a man why the fellow chuckled and said guess youre not from these parts this is the festal day of the holy abdaas opsikions patron were all come to give thanks for his protection for another year oh along with everyone elseeveryone in the whole town he thought as three people stepped on his toes one after the otherkrispos filed into the temple he had worshiped at the high temple in the capital several times the sternly beautiful gaze of the mosaic image of phos in the dome there never failed to fill him with awe opsikion was only a provincial town as he was depicted here the lord with the great and good mind looked more cross than majestic krispos did not much care phos was phos no matter what his image looked like krispos feared though that he would have to pay homage to the good god standing up the benches had all but filled by the time he got to them the last few rows had some empty places but the press of people swept him past them before he could claim one he was still a villager at heart he thought wryly a born city man would have been quicker too lateby now he was most of the way down toward the altar with sinking hope he peered around for some place any place to sit the woman sitting by the aisle was also looking around perhaps for a friend who was late their eyes met excuse me my lady krispos looked away he knew a noblewoman when he saw one and knew better than to bother her by staring thus he did not see her pupils swell till like a cats each filled for a moment its whole iris did not see her features go slack and far away in that same instant took no notice of the word she whispered then she said something he could not ignore would you care to sit here eminent sir my lady he said foolishly theres room by me eminent sir i think the woman pushed at the youth next to her a lad five or six years younger than krispos a nephew maybe he thought for the boy resembled her the push went down the row by the time it reached the end there was indeed room krispos sat gratefully thank you very much ah he stopped she mightshe probably wouldthink him forward if he asked her name but she did not i am tanilis eminent sir she said and modestly cast down her eyes before she did though he saw how large and dark they were with them still lowered she went on this is my son mavros the youth and krispos exchanged nods tanilis was older than hed thought at first glance hed guessed her age to be within a few years of his he was still not used to being called sir eminent sir was for the likes of iakovitzes not him how could he become a noble why then had tanilis used it he started to tell her as politely as he could that shed made a mistake but the service began and robbed him of the chance phos creed of course he could have recited asleep or awake it was engrained in him the rest of the prayers and hymns were hardly less familiar he went through them rising and taking his seat at the proper times most of his mind elsewhere he barely remembered to ask phos to help iakovitzes in his talks with lexo which was why he had come to the temple in the first place out of the corner of his eye he kept watching tanilis her profile was sculptured elegant no loose flesh hung under her chin but though artfully applied powder almost hid them the beginnings of lines bracketed her mouth and met at the corners of her eyes here and there a white thread ran through her piledup curls of jet he supposed she might be old enough to have a son close to his age she was beautiful even so she seemed to take no notice of his inspection giving herself wholly to the celebration of phos liturgy eventually krispos had to do the same for the hymns of praise for the holy abdaas were opsikions own he had not met them before but even as he stumbled through them he was aware of her beside him the worshipers spoke phos creed one last time from his place at the altar the local prelate lifted up his hands in blessing go now in peace and goodness he declared the service was over krispos rose and stretched tanilis and her son also stood up thanks again for making room for me he told them as he turned to go the privilege was mine eminent sir tanilis said her ornate gold earrings tinkled softly as he looked down to the floor why do you keep calling me that he snapped irritation getting the better of his manners im just a groom and glad to be oneotherwise i expect id be starving somewhere come to think of it ive done that too once or twice it doesnt make you eminent believe me before he was halfway through he knew he ought to keep quiet if he offended a powerful local noblewoman like tanilis even iakovitzes connections at the capital might not save him the capital was too far away for them to do him much good here even as that thought ran through his mind though he kept on till he was done tanilis raised her head to look at him again he started to stutter out an apology then stopped the last time he had seen that almost blind stare of perfect concentration was on the face of the healerpriest mokios this time he watched her eyes go huge and black saw her expression turn fixed her lips parted this time ice ran through him as he heard the word she whispered majesty she slumped forward in a faint v krispos caught her before she hit her head on the bench in front of her oh phos her son mavros said he rushed up to help take her weight thanks for saving her there uh krispos come on lets get her out of the temple she should be better soon he sounded so matteroffact that krispos asked this has happened before yes mavros raised his voice to speak to the townsfolk who came hurrying up after tanilis fell my mother just got out of her seat too quickly let us by please so we can get her to fresh air let us by please he had to repeat himself several times before people moved aside even then several women and a couple of men stayed with him krispos wondered why he did not shoo them away too then realized they had to be part of tanilis retinue they helped clear a path so krispos and mavros could carry the noblewoman up the aisle tanilis muttered and stirred when the sun hit her face but did not wake at once krispos and mavros eased her to the ground the women stood over her exclaiming one of the servants said to mavros i wish wed come from the house in town today young master then she could go in the sedan chair that would make fetching her home again easier wouldnt it however mavros shrugged whimsically he turned to krispos my mother sometimes sees things and sees them so strong she cant withstand the force of the vision ive grown used to it watching it happen over the years but i do wish she wouldnt always pick such awkward times and places of course what i wish has very little to do with anything he gave that shrug again thats the way things often work krispos decided he thought well of mavros the youngster had not only kept his head coping with an awkward situation but was even able to make light of it from everything krispos had ever seen that was harder mavros said genzon naues fetch the horses here from round the corner the crowds thinning out you shouldnt have much trouble now ill go with them if you like krispos said that way each man wont have to lead so many thanks thats generous of you please a moment first though mavros took a couple of steps away from his retinue and motioned for krispos to follow in a low voice he asked what did my mother say to you there in the temple her back was to me i didnt hear oh that krispos scratched his head looking embarrassed do you know in all the hubbub since its gone clean out of my mind he hurried after genzon and naues he was unhappy about lying to mavros but hed lied without hesitation he needed to think much more about the unbelievably fascinating unbelievably dangerous word tanilis had spoken before he admitted to himselflet alone to anyone elsethat hed heard it most of the horses the servants loosed from the hitching rail were ponies for tanilis female attendants the four that were not were animals fine enough to have belonged in iakovitzes stables fourthat meant tanilis was no mean rider then krispos found himself unsurprised she was plainly a woman of many accomplishments she had managed to sit up by the time krispos genzon and naues brought the horses back to the temple but still did not seem fully aware of herself or her surroundings mavros clasped krispos hand thank you again im grateful for all your help my pleasure krispos heard the dismissal in mavros voice he dipped his head and went back to bolkanes inn iakovitzes was not there he was closeted with lexo again krispos hoped his absentminded prayer had done his master some good he went down to the taproom for some wine and for a chance to pick bolkanes brain both came slower than he wanted the inn was crowded with people celebrating the holy abdaas festal day less piously than those who had gone to the temple the tables were all filled working his way up to the bar took patience but patience krispos had red wine please he told bolkanes the innkeeper dipped out a measure and filled an earthenware mug only when he slid it across the counter did he look up to see whom he was serving oh hello krispos he said and then to the next man whod wormed his way forward whatll it be for you today rekilas having gained his spot at the bar krispos did not give it up he waited while bolkanes served two more men then said i saw a truly striking noblewoman at the temple today a man told me her name was he broke off someone had asked bolkanes for a cup of something finer than he kept in the barrels at the bar and the innkeeper had to hurry away to get what the fellow wanted when he returnedand after he dealt with another customerkrispos started to repeat himself but bolkanes had been listening even if he was too busy to talk he broke in thatd be tanilis i expect yes that was the name krispos said sounds like shes well known hereabouts i should say so bolkanes agreed she hashello zernes more of the white for you coming right up zernes not only wanted more white wine but needed change from a goldpiece and counted it three times once he got it half a dozen men were waiting by the time he got done eventually bolkanes resumed tanilis aye she has huge tracts of land hereabouts a good many said shed lose everything trying to run em herself after her husbandwhat was her husbands name apsyrtos vledas wasnt it apsyrtos answered let me have a cup of mead this time will you you headll hurt come morning mixing em that way bolkanes warned but he plied the dipper when he was done he turned back to krispos vledas that was it he died ten twelve years ago now it must be and shes prospered since done well in good years and bad they say though naturally i couldnt testify to that but her estates do keep growing its almost uncannyjust a woman you know mmhmm krispos said though he had the feeling tanilis was just a woman in the same way that videssos was just a city iakovitzes came in a little later his good nature always unreliable had vanished altogether by the time he worked his way to the bar through the press of holiday drinkers just because a holy man once cured a horse of fleas is no reason to turn a town on its ear he growled is that what the holy abdaas did krispos asked how should i know in a backwoods bastion like this i doubt one would need do much more to be reckoned a miracleworker iakovitzes gulped his wine then slammed the mug down on the bar for a refill krispos thought of tanilis again hed seen more than horsedoctoring he wondered how he could find out more about her if she was as grand a noblewoman as bolkanes made her out to beand nothing krispos had seen left him doubting ithe could not just go and seek a meeting with her shed slap him down for such presumption approaching through her son seemed a better bet mavros on brief acquaintance had the feel of being someone krispos could like bolkanes might know the amusements the youth favored when he came into town iakovitzes had said something that krispos missed in his musing i crave pardon his master frowned for all the attention you paid me there i thought for a moment i was back talking with lexo he started in on his stinking tribal lays again today the blackguard until i asked him if he was willing to listen while i read to him from the histories of the reign of stavrakios the great after that he came rather closer to reason though not close enough by phos ill poison the bastard if his delays make me spend the winter in this miserable place a day before krispos would have agreed after videssos the city opsikion was small and backward and not very interestingin a word provincial now with tanilis mystery before him he hoped iakovitzes would stay a while longer drive him wild lexo he whispered too low for his master to hear bolkanes was rolling a fresh barrel of wine from the top of the cellar stairs to the taproom when krispos walked into the inn a couple of afternoons later want some help with that krispos asked without waiting for an answer he hurried forward you would come in after ive done the hard part myself bolkanes wiped sweat from his forehead i can manage from here anyhow a fellows waiting for you at the bar been here an hour maybe a bit longer for me krispos hadnt thought anyone in opsikion knew him well enough to find him worth waiting for he walked into the taproom the tall lanky man standing at the bar turned at the sound of his footsteps naues krispos said then added with sudden doubt or are you genzon tanilis servitor smiled im genzon i dont blame you for having to ask things were hurried and confused at the temple the other day so they were krispos hesitated i hope your mistress is improved yes thank you genzons prominent larynx bobbed as he swallowed the last of the wine in his cup she thanks you also for the care and concern you showed to show her gratitude further she bids you dine with her this evening if you care to she does krispos blurted try as he would he was still new to the notion of keeping thoughts to himself he needed a moment to let urbanity return id be delighted can you give me a little while to change certainly what are a few more minutes save a chance for another cup of wine genzon nodded to bolkanes who along with his tapman was wrestling the new barrel into place under the bar krispos told the innkeeper please let iakovitzes know ive been asked away for the evening as soon as he was sure bolkanes had heard he walked over to the stairway he would not run not where genzon could see him but he bounded up the steps two at a time for once he wished he could borrow iakovitzes clothes he usually thought them gaudy but now he wanted to put on something that would impress tanilis since iakovitzes was more than half a foot shorter than he was and correspondingly narrower as well borrowing a tunic was impractical he threw on his own best one of a sober dark blue and a pair of breeches that matched it he went downstairs so fast he had to grab at the railing to keep from landing on his head let me saddle my horse and ill meet you out front he called to genzon tanilis man nodded krispos went out to the stables behind the inn he quickly put the saddle on his horse made sure the cinch was tighthed learned about that back at the village fortunately or iakovitzes grooms never would have let him live it downmounted and walked the horse up to the street genzon came out a couple of minutes later goodlooking animal he said as he swung himself aboard his own mount my master knows horses krispos said yes i can see that nice smooth gait too genzon started to say something more visibly decided not to krispos thought he could guess the question genzon swallowed why was the groom being invited to dine with his mistress and not the visiting noble from the capital as he had only hopes and wild speculations himself he did not want to try to answer that genzon led him out of opsikion by the south gate the road soon twisted away from the sea and ran up into the hills krispos horse did not falter at the steep stretches indeed the beast seemed to relish the challenge have to give him more exercise krispos thought some of the hillsides were terraced up on the slopes krispos saw peasants weeding crops and pruning vines they were too wrapped up in their tasks to look down at him watching them sent a remembered ache through his shoulders farming was the longest hardest work there was having lived the peasants life for so many years he knew how lucky he was to have escaped it he wondered how his sister and brotherinlaw were doing he supposed he was an uncle by now and hoped evdokia had come through childbirth safely all this is tanilis land genzon remarked is it krispos said politely he wondered what the scores what the hundreds of people who worked it thought of that did she protect her peasants from the states demands or impose her own alongside them he hoped she looked after the people under her control but as he could not have a year before he also wondered whether nobles who too effectively shielded their peasants from the state were good for videssos if nobles turned into petty kings on their own domains how could the central government hope to function he shook his head thankful the problem was anthimosor perhaps petronasand not his he and genzon rode on for some time the sun was falling toward the jagged western horizon when genzon pointed saying there is tanilis villa the building ahead was so large krispos had taken it for a fortress it was well sited for one on top of a rise that commanded the surrounding countryside but as krispos drew near he saw it was too lightly made with too many windows and too many doors to serve as a stronghold he wondered how many peasants had gone hungry because they were busy building it instead of working their fields then wondered again if such a thought had ever crossed one of the owners minds he doubted it no one who owned a home like thisit made iakovitzes house look like krispos old cottage by comparisonhad ever been a peasant someone came out of the villa as krispos got closer he saw it was mavros tanilis son recognized himor more likely genzona moment later he waved genzon and krispos waved back they urged their horses into a trot mavros came down to meet them about time you turned up he said grinning mothers starting to fret and the cooks getting nervous never mind youre here now and thats what counts boys hurried up to take the newcomers horses and lead them back to the stables krispos expected his mount would get better care here than at bolkanes not that he had anything against the innkeeper but tanilis did not have to worry about how every copper was spent you can have the rest of the day off genzon mavros said the retainer dipped his head in thanks mavros turned to krispos as genzon hurried off now you on the other hand sirrah you are in my mothers clutches oh why krispos hadand ruthlessly stifleda sudden hungry vision of tanilis clutching him and him clutching back the ice take me if i can tell you mavros shrugged in cheerful incomprehension krispos wished he could stay so jolly in the face of the unknown in the life hed led unknown and dangerous were the same word to mavros raised lacking for nothing the world seemed a sunnier place he went on shell explain in her own good time im sure me i expect it has to do with whatever she said at the temple the other day what was that anyhow hasnt she told you krispos asked surprised she doesnt remember not exactly hervisions are like that sometimes mavros shrugged again whatever it was it was something strong some of the old servants say the place hasnt been turned upside down like this since the avtokrator sermeios dined here in my grandfathers time since an avtokrator krispos echoed weakly he tried to laugh but only managed a ghastly chuckle im no avtokrator believe me i believe you mavros said at once but not so it sounded like an insult you seem a good fellow though i think so myself and my mother wouldnt have invited you here if shed seen anything wicked now would she no krispos said that he was going to eat where an avtokrator had dined was stirring enoughbut after all petronas had broken bread at iakovitzes house and he was emperor in all but name but that an imperialsize fuss was being made over himhe wanted another try at laughing over that he was sure he could do a proper job the second time around mavros said come in come in the longer i leave you standing around here the longer everyone inside stands around fussing the cookll stop palpitating every time anything gets near done which will be a great relief to everyone krispos made the sunsign over his heart as he walked beneath the image of phos that hung above the door the floor of the entrance hall was gleaming marble is that you son tanilis voice floated down it as mavros slammed the door where can krispos be with me as a matter of fact mavros said krispos heard tanilis exclaim mavros told him come on shes out in the garden krispos got a brief glimpse into each room that opened on the hallway as he hurried after mavros what he saw reminded him of iakovitzes splendid furnishings but showed better taste and more money that enormous round table inlaid with gold and ivory not even an avtokrator would have felt ashamed to eat a meal from a table like that the garden was also larger and finer than iakovitzes although to be just krispos had never seen his masters garden in full bloom tanilis extended a slim hand krispos bowed over it rings glinted on her fingers thank you my lady for inviting me here he said this ismarvelous it pleases me that you so say so eminent sir surely though you must have seen homes far finer in videssos the city he noted the title by which she addressed him she might not remember everything he thought but she hasnt forgotten everything either then his attention came back to what shed said in truth no he said slowly the wonder of videssos the city isnt any one home in it but that there are so many homes so many people all in the same place a thoughtful answer tanilis said ive never seen the city nor i mavros face lit id love to go there one day though its hard for me to imagine a city bigger than opsikion krispos smiled no matter how rich and easy mavros life was he knew some things tanilis son did not if videssos the city were a wolf it could swallow a mouse like opsikion without even chewing he said mavros whistled soft and low and shook his head hard to believe from everything your father said its true tanilis said vledas went to the city once when he was not much older than you are now and never stopped talking about it to the day he died i dont remember mavros said wistfully he would have been a small boy when vledas died krispos realized he was surprised to think himself luckier in any way than this rich youth but hed known his father until he was a man grown had phostis died while he was young say in kubrat who would have been there to keep him from doing all sorts of stupid things later most likely he would have ended up marrying zoranne and staying a farmer all his life a good part of a year away from the ceaseless labor that was farming he no longer thought it the only right and proper way to live you will see videssos one day too son tanilis voice was hollow her eyes did not quite focus on mavros krispos felt the hair on his arms trying to prickle upright the oracular tone faded as she went on but for now a shorter journey shall we go inside and eat the cook a nervous little man named evtykhes stopped fidgeting and sighed with relief as he saw his charges sit down around a small table topped with motherofpearlit shimmered and almost seemed to shift in the glow of the lamps other servants set out soup evtykhes asked at tanilis nod he dashed back to the kitchen a boy appeared with the steaming bowls so quickly that krispos suspected the cook was trying to make sure everyone kept sitting back in his village krispos would have lifted the soup bowl straight to his lips in taverns and eateries in the city he still did but he had learned to use a spoon at iakovitzes since tanilis and mavros ate with theirs he imitated them by the time he got to the bottom of the bowl the soup was cold maybe the nobles didnt mind that but he did his breath went out in a silent sigh he was more used to his fork and was reaching for it when he saw tanilis and mavros pick up asparagus with their fingers he imitated them again manners were confusing things the food kept coming broiled duck in a glaze of candied berries mushrooms stuffed with turtle meat pureed chestnuts a salad of oranges and apples and at last a roast kid with a sweetandsour sauce and chopped onions mavros and krispos ate ravenously the one because he was still growing the other because hed learned to do so whenever he got the chance as a hedge against the hunger that was sure to follow tanilis sampled a little of every course and sent warm praise back to the cook after each one by the good god she said watching her son and krispos devastate the plate of cheese and strawberries that appeared after the kid i could get fat just from being in the same room with the two of you youd have to blame krispos then mavros saidrather blurrily as his mouth was full if it came from being in the same room with me it wouldve happened long ago krispos eyed tanilis who was so perfectly and elegantly shaped that she might have been turned on a lathe the phrase fit in more ways than one he thought for she plainly maintained her figure with a craftsmans disciplined artifice he told her i dont think phosor youwould allow such a mishap she looked down at her wine cup a compliment and a truth togetherindeed the good god aids a man who helps himself then he aids me now mavros popped the last strawberry into his mouth son you are incorrigible tanilis said fondly it does seem that way mavros agreed krispos sipped his own wine something thick and sweet now to complement the sharp taste of the cheese he said phos is the only one who knows why he does as he does my lady i hope you will be kind enough to tell me why youve been so good to me i told you at the temple im only a groom and lucky to be that i feel im taking advantage of you and if one day you feel the same way he did not add you could cause me untold grief tanilis waited until a servant left with the last plates she got up and closed the door to the small dining chamber after the man departed only then did she answer her voice low tell me truly krispos have you never wondered if you might one day be more than what you are now truly despite that double admonition no was the first answer that rose to his lips but before he spoke it aloud he thought of pyrrhos calling his name that rainy night in the monastery a moment later he remembered how both pyrrhos and the kubrati enaree had looked at him during the ceremony when iakovitzes ransomed the stolen peasants the word tanilis had spoken in the temple also echoed in his head ive wondered he said at last and that you should wonder is plain to anyone who can see as i do tanilis used the same sort of hesitation he had mavros looked ready to burst from curiosity what did you say to him back in the temple he asked her i think you know again instead of answering she glanced toward krispos he hesitated then gave his head a tiny shake newcome from the farm though he might be he knew that word was dangerous tanilis nod of understanding was equally small i do and you will too son she said but not yet thank you so much mavros said the words were sarcastic the tone was not krispos decided mavros was too goodnatured ever to grow skilled at using the stinging wit iakovitzes relished since you did see what you saw what do you want from me krispos asked tanilis to profit from your rise of course she answered he blinked he had not expected her to be so direct she went on for me for my family what we have now is as much as we ever will have that too i have seenunless we tie ourselves to one with higher hopes that one i think is you krispos looked around the room he thought of the house of which that rich room was a part of the vast estates surrounding that house why he wondered would anyone want more than this he still wanted more than he had but he did not have much and that at the whim of his badtempered master if tanilis would help him get more hed play along if she thought him a handpuppet to move only at her bidding she might get a surprise one day he knew better than to say that aloud what do you want from me he repeated and how will you help in this rise you saw the first thing i want is that you not grow too confident in your rise she warned nothing seen ahead of time is definite if you think a thing will come to pass without your working toward it that is the surest way i know to make certain it will never be the night the kubratoi swept down on his village had taught krispos once and for all that nothing in life was definite he nodded what else that you take mavros back to videssos the city with you and reckon him your younger brother henceforth tanilis said the connections he makes there will serve him and you for the rest of his life me the city really mavros threw back his head and yowled with delight hes welcome to go to videssos by me krispos said but im not the one whod have to choose to take him along iakovitzes would he glanced over at tanilis son and tried to see him through iakovitzes eyes it might not be hard to get my master to ask him to go back with us but he stopped he would not speak ill of iakovitzes not before these people he hardly knew i know of his habits tanilis said to his credit he does not pretend to be other than what he is mavros i think will be able to take care of himself and hes as good with horsesyour masters other passion are they notas anyone his age near opsikion that will help krispos agreed he chuckledone more handsome youth for meletios and some of the other grooms to worry about growing serious again he went on besides mavros how will you aid me he felt he was horse trading with tanilis the only trouble being that she promised delivery of most of the horse some years from now he wanted to make as sure as possible of the part he could see now gold counsel loyalty until your death or mine tanilis said if you like i will take oath by the lord with the great and good mind krispos thought that over if your word is bad will your oath make it better tanilis lowered her eyes her hair hid her face even so krispos felt he had passed a test mavros said plaintively will the two of you please quit making deep plans without me if im suddenly to leave for videssos the city shouldnt i know why you might be safer if you didnt tanilis said but she must have seen the justice of her sons protest for she pointed at krispos and whispered the word she had spoken to him inside the temple mavros eyes widened him he squeaked krispos did not blame him for sounding amazed he did not believe the prediction either not down deep but tanilis answeredit may be so if all shed said tonight was true she would try to help it be so was she then simply following the path she had seen or trying to force it into existence krispos went round that dizzy loop of thought two or three times before he gave it up tanilis went on none of us should say that word again not until the proper time comes if it ever does youre right mavros shook his head in wonder and grinned at krispos i always figured id need a miracle to get me to videssos the city but i didnt know what one looked like till now krispos snorted im no miracle but he found himself grinning back mavros would make him a lively brother he turned to tanilis my lady may i beg an escort from you otherwise in the dark id need a miracle to get back to opsikion let alone the city stay the night she said i expected you would the servants have readied a chamber for you she rose and walked over to the dining rooms doors the small noise of their opening summoned two men she nodded to one xystos please lead the eminent sir to his bedchamber certainly xystos bowed first to tanilis then to krispos come with me eminent sir as krispos started to follow the servant away tanilis said since we are become partners in this enterprise krispos take a partners privilege and use my name thank you uh tanilis krispos said her encouraging smile seemed to stay with him after he turned a corner behind xystos the bedroom was larger than the one krispos had at bolkanes inn xystos bowed again and shut the door behind him krispos used the chamber pot he took off his clothes blew out the lamp xystos had left and lay down on the bed it was softer than any hed known beforeand this he thought was only a guest room even in darkness he did not fall asleep at once with his minds eye he kept seeing the smile tanilis had given him as he left the dining room maybe she would slip in here tonight to seal with her body the strange bargain they had made or maybe she would send in a serving girl just as a kindness to him or maybe maybe im a fool he told himself when he woke the next morning still very much alone in bed he used the chamber pot again dressed and ran fingers through his hair he was going to the door when someone tapped on it oh good youre awake mavros said when he opened it a moment later if you dont mind breakfasting on hard rolls and smoked mutton we can eat while we ride back to town good enough krispos thought of how often hed gone out to work in the fields after breakfasting on nothing he knew mavros had never missed a meal he kept quiet not just for politeness sake but also because hed long since decided hunger held no inherent virtuelife was better with a full belly they washed down the rolls and mutton with a skin of wine thats a very nice animal youre riding krispos said after a while isnt he mavros beamed im not small but my weight doesnt faze him a bit no even when im in mail shirt and helmet he took the reins in his left hand so he could draw a knife and make cutandthrust motions as if it were a sword maybe one of these days ill ride him to war against makuran or kubrator even khatrish if your masters mission fails take that vile barbarian he stabbed a bush by the side of the road krispos smiled at his enthusiasm real fightings not as neat as you make it out to be youve fought then at krispos nod mavros eyes went big and round tell me about it krispos tried to beg off but mavros kept urging him until he baldly recounted the villagers massacre of the kubrati raiders just our good luck there was only the one little band he finished if the riders a couple of days later had been wild men instead of videssian cavalry i wouldnt be here now to give you the tale ive heard true warriors dont speak much of glory mavros said in a rather subdued voice what they call glory i think is mostly the relief you feel after youve fought and lived through it without getting maimed if you have hmm mavros rode on in silence for some time after that before he and krispos got to opsikion though he was slaying bushes again krispos did not try to dissuade him he suspected mavros would make a better soldier than he did himselfthe young noble seemed inclined to plunge straight ahead without worrying about consequences a martial trait if ever there was one they got to opsikion a little before midmorning being with mavros got krispos through the south gate with respectful salutes from the guards when they came to bolkanes inn they found iakovitzes just sitting down to breakfastunlike most folk he did not customarily rise at dawn he fixed krispos with a glare nice of you to recall who your master is his eyes flicked to mavros krispos watched his expression change or have you been cavorting with this magnificent creature no krispos said resignedly excellent sir let me present mavros to you he is the son of the noblewoman tanilis and is interested in returning to videssos with us when your mission is done hed make a fine groom excellent sir he knows horses tanilis son eh iakovitzes rose to return mavros bow hed evidently learned who tanilis was but he went onwhen it comes to grooms for my stables i dont care if hes the avtokrators son not that anthimos has one he shot several searching questions at mavros who answered them without undue trouble then he went outside to look over the youths mount when he came back he was nodding youll do if youre the one whos been tending that animal i am mavros said good good youll definitely do we may even get to leave before fall comes lexo may see reason after all at least im beginning to hope so again iakovitzes looked almost cheerful for a moment as he sat down then he found something new to complain about oh a plague my sausage is cold bolkanes as the innkeeper hurried up mavros whispered to krispos is your master always like that now that you mention it yes krispos whispered back i wonder if i want to see videssos the city enough to work for him but mavros was joking he raised his voice to a normal level im going to ride home now but ill be in town a lot if im not just send a messenger for me and ill come ready to travel bowing again to iakovitzes he left the taproom around a mouthful of fresh steaming sausage iakovitzes said so now youre hobnobbing with young nobles are you krispos youre coming up a bit in your choice of friends if i hadnt spent these last months with you excellent sir i wouldnt have had any idea how to act around him krispos said flattery that was also true hed found worked best it worked now iakovitzes gaze lost the piercing quality it had when he was suspicious about something hrmp he said and went back to his breakfast three days later mavros brought krispos another dinner invitation krispos went out and bought a new tunic a saffronyellow one that went well with his olive skin after he paid for it he felt odd it was the first time hed got a shirt just for the sake of having something new tanilis admiring glance that evening made the purchase seem worthwhile she was worth admiring herself in a thin dress of white linen that emphasized how small her waist was more gold shone on her wrists and around her neck you are welcome as always she said holding out her hand krispos took it thank you my tanilis his tongue slipped by accident but he watched her eyes fall as she heard the last two words together maybe his hope of the previous visit had not been so foolish after all but if that was so she gave no hint of it during dinner indeed she said very little mavros did most of the talking he bubbled with excitement at the prospect of heading west for the city when will we leave he asked do you know how fare iakovitzes talks with the khatrisher better i think krispos said hes hardly swearing at all when he gets back from the eparchs residence these days with him thats a very good sign ill start packing then go ahead but dont pack anything you might want before you go he was like this once before weeks ago and then things fell apart again krispos took a last luscious bite of blackberry tart and turned to tanilis i wish your cook could come with me along with your son i dont think ive ever eaten so well ill tell evtykhes you said so she said smiling your praise will please him more than what he gets from usyoure not obliged to say kind things to him for politeness sake krispos had not thought about that the servants at iakovitzes home were the only ones hed known and he was one among them for that matter iakovitzes did not say kind things to anyone for politeness sake he used the rough edge of his tongue not the smooth to keep his people in line tanilis said though i must keep evtykhes krispos you will need more than you have if what we hope is to be accomplished when you and mavros do at last depart for the imperial city i will send gold with you my lady this time krispos deliberately used her title rather than her nameeven with mavros with me in videssos whats to keep me from spending the gold just on women and wine you are tanilis looked him full in the face those huge dark eyes held his he had the uneasy feeling she could peer deeper into him than he could himself now he was the first to lower his gaze mavros rose im off if im to be leaving soon i have some farewells to make tanilis watched him go what was it you said about wine and women she asked krispos most of his farewells will be of that sort i expect hes coming into a mans years and a mans pleasures krispos replied from the peak of maturity that was twentytwo so he is tanilis voice was musing her eyes met krispos again but she looked through him rather than into him back toward the past a man how strange i must have been about the age he is now when i bore him surely younger krispos said she laughed without mirth but also without bitterness you are gallant but i know the count of years they are part of me why should i deny them instead of answering krispos took a thoughtful sip from his wine cup hed made a mistake by breaking the rule of flattery hed used on iakovitzes with someone like tanilis it did not do to make mistakes before long krispos got up to go saying thank you again for inviting me here and for the aid you promise and for this second wonderful feast truly if it does not unduly anger your master you would be well advised to stay till morning tanilis said the ride back to opsikion will be twice as long in the darkness and there are brigands in the hills try as we will to keep them down iakovitzes is angry most of the time it seems unduly krispos shrugged i expect i can talk him round thank you once more tanilis called for xystos the servant took krispos to the same guest chamber he had used before that soft bed beckoned he stripped off his clothes slid under the single light blanket that was all he needed on a warm summer night and fell asleep at once he was a sound sleeper a legacy of the many years he had gone to bed every night too tired to wake to anything less than an earthquake the first he knew of anyone elses being in the room was the bed shifting as the weight of another body settled onto it he jerked upright wha he said muzzily even the small flickering flame of the lamp tanilis held was enough to dazzle his sleepdulled eyes a secret smile tugged at the corners of her mouth im sorry she said i didnt mean to startle you itsall right he answered after a moment when he had full control of himself still not altogether sure why she had comeand not daring to be wrong here where his head might answer for ithe pulled the blanket up to cover more of himself that secret smile came out in the open wise to be cautious but never mind then her expression changed what is that coin you wear round your neck she asked her voice suddenly sharp and interested this krispos hand closed over the goldpiece its just for luck for more than luck i think tanilis said please if you would tell me how you came by it he told her how omurtag had given him the coin at the ransoming ceremony back when he was a boy her eyes glittered in the lamplight as she followed his account when he thought he was done she questioned him about the incident as closely as iakovitzes had grilled mavros on horses prodded so he recalled more than hed imagined he could even to things like the expression on the kubrati enarees face the more he answered though the more glumly certain he became that shed forgotten why shed come to his bedroom in the first place too bad he thought the lamps warm light made her especially lovely but she certainly seemed indifferent to their both being on the same bed when she could pick no more memories from him she said no wonder i saw as i did the seeds of what you may be were sown long ago at last they have grown toward the light of day he shrugged at the moment he cared little for the nebulous future he was too busy thinking about what he wished he was doing in the very immediate present youre rather a young man still though and not much worried about such things tanilis said he gulped wondering if she could read his mind then he saw she was looking down at the thin blanket which revealed his thoughts clearly enough he felt himself flush but the smile was back on her face i suppose thats as it should be she said and blew out the lamp for a whole series of reasons the rest of the evening proved among the most educational of krispos life every woman hed been with before tanilis suddenly seemed a girl by comparison they were girls he realized his age or younger chosen for attractiveness kept for enthusiasm now for the first time he learned what polished art could add looking back the exhausted morning after he supposed tanilis had taken him through his paces like iakovitzes steering a jumper around a course had she taught him anything else that way he was sure he would have resented her he still did a little but resentment had to fight hard against languor hed wondered for some little while if art was all she brought to the game she moved she stroked she lay back to receive his caresses in silence a silence that persisted no matter what he did and though all her ploys were far more than just enjoyable he also thought they were rehearsed then at last some of his own urgency reached her kindled she was less perfectly skilled than she had been before feeling her quiver beneath him hearing her breath catch made him want to forget all that perfect skill had wrought he wondered if the quivers if the gasps were also products of her art he shrugged as he fastened the bone catches of his tunic art that fine was indistinguishable from reality it was as if an icon of petronas could move and speak with the sevastokrators voice later as he walked down the hall behind a servant toward the small dining chamber for breakfast he decided he was wrong if hed altogether failed to please her he doubted shed give herself to him again she waited for him in the dining room her selfpossession absolute as usual i trust you slept well she said in a tone any polite hostess might have used before he could answer she went on do try some of the honey on your bread its clover and orange together and very fine he dipped it from the pot and tried it it was good he triedas best he could with men and women of her household bustling in and outto learn how she felt about the night before she was impervious that seemed ominous then mavros came in looking rather the worse for wear and krispos had to give up tanilis showed more interest in her sons boasting than shed given to krispos discreet questions only as krispos was saying his farewells did she give him even the smallest reason for hope feel free to invite yourself here next time you need not wait upon a formal invitation thank you tanilis ill do that he said and watched her face closely had she shown any trace of disappointment he would never have gone back to the villa again she nodded and smiled instead he made himself wait four days before he rode back again evtykhes the cook hadnt had anything special planned but like iakovitzes chef he could make the ordinary interesting what happened later that night was even more interesting and not even slightly ordinary dont delay so long the next time tanilis said as she slid out of the guest room bed to return to her own chamber or did you think i was seeking to entrap you with my charms krispos shook his head tanilis slipped away without asking anything further of him he was not nearly sure he had truthfully answered her last question indeed he hadnt trusted his voice not to give him away even so he knew he would come to the villa again and in less than four days did that mean he was entrapped maybe it did he thought wryly he was sure hed never found such tempting bait iakovitzes looked up from his breakfast porridge as krispos walked toward his table in bolkanes taproom the nobles eyebrows rose good of you to join me he said such rare signs give me hope you do still remember you work for me krispos felt his ears grow hot he gruntedthe safest response he could think ofand sat down nothing was guaranteed safe with iakovitzes much as i hate to disrupt the lecherous tenor of your ways he went on i fear your little arrangement with that laundress or whatever she is at mavros place will have to end krispos had found no way to keep people from knowing how often he rode out to tanilis villa those visitsand the overnight stays that went with themhad to set tongues wagging to make sure they did not wag in the wrongor rather the rightdirection hed let on that he was having an affair with one of the servant girls now he said still cautiously oh why is that excellent sir because ive finally settled with that puffadder of a lexo thats why have you really krispos said in genuine surprise yes i have really and on more than decent terms if youd been around here as you were supposed to be instead of exercising your private parts this might not have come as such a startling development to you krispos hung his head at the rebuke the acid in iakovitzes voice made it sting more than it might have otherwise but he knew it was deserved he also knew a certain amount of relief if iakovitzes was heading back to videssos the city he would have to accompany the noble not even tanilis could think differently a more convenient end to their liaison was hard to imagine iakovitzes went on since you do get out to mavros villa however be so good as to let him know i shall be departing shortly why i dont leave you here and head back just with him i couldnt say let me tell you at first the scolding washed over krispos if iakovitzes meant to fire him he would have done it long since and even if the noble did give him the boot tanilis would still back himor would she krispos grew more sober as he pondered that if his fortunes changed her vision might too he decided he ought to stay in iakovitzes good graces after all or as many of them as he could keep without letting the noble seduce him what were the terms you finally agreed to with lexo excellent sir he asked as if you care iakovitzes jeered but he was too full of himself to resist bragging about what hed done the khatrishers will all pull back of the akkilaion by the end of next year and three parts in four of the indemnity we pay for their leaving will go straight to the herders who get displaced not to gumush the khagan i had to pay lexo a little extra on the side to get him to go along with that but its money well spent i see what youre saying krispos nodded if the indemnity stays with the local khatrishers theyll end up spending most of it here in opsikion so in the long run itll come back to the empire maybe thats why i keep you around in spite of the alltoonumerous faults you insist on flaunting iakovitzes said for your peasant shrewdness even lexo didnt pick up the full import of that clause and hes been in the business of cheating videssos a good many years now aye i snuck it past him i did i did nothing put iakovitzes in a better mood than gloating over how hed outsmarted an opponent when do you sign the pact krispos asked already did itsigned and sealed i have one copy up in my room and lexos got the other one wherever he keeps it iakovitzes knocked back a large cup of wine only when he swayed as he got to his feet did krispos realize it was not his first or even his third his speech was perfectly clear as the noble headed for the door he said over his shoulder come to think of it im going across the square to the eparchs residence and rub the khatrishers nose in the break he gave me want to tag along are you sure thats wise excellent sir krispos said in lieu of publicly asking his master whether hed lost his mind if iakovitzes angered lexo enoughand he could do it if anyone couldwhat was to keep the khatrisher from tearing up his signed and sealed copy and either starting the war petronas did not want or at least forcing negotiations open again but iakovitzes said let him wallow in his own stupidity he went out the door almost at a run krispos heard the rumble and jingle of an approaching heavy wagon without listening to it it was just one of the noises that went with staying in a city then he heard someone shout watch out you blood drunken twit look over this that was harder to ignore it came from right in front of the inn at the cry of agony that followed hard on its heels krispos and everyone else in the taproom dashed out to see what had happened the wagon was full of blocks of gray limestone from one of the quarries in the hills back of opsikion and drawn by a team of six draft horses iakovitzes lay thrashing on the ground between the near wheeler and the wagons right front wheel another yard forward and it would have rolled over his body krispos ran forward and dragged his master away from the wagon iakovitzes shrieked again as he was moved my leg he clutched at it my leg the whitefaced driver gabbled fool walked right in front of me right in front of me like i wasnt there and this maybe the biggest noisiest rig in town right in front of me one of the horses must have stepped on him or maybe more than one lucky i was fast on the brake or all you could do with him is clean him off the cobbles right in front of me a couple of passersby confirmed that iakovitzes had not noticed the wagon at all way he was going one said he wouldnt have noticed phos coming down from heaven for him a couple of more pious souls made the sunsign over their hearts at the mention of the good gods name krispos tugged up iakovitzes robe so he could see how badly the noble was hurt the unnatural bend between knee and ankle of his masters left leg and the enormous black bruise that spread over the leg as he watched told him everything he needed to know its broken he said of course its broken you widearsed imbecile iakovitzes screamed pain and fury making him even louder and shriller than usual you think i need you to tell me that the inventive curses that spewed from him in the next couple of minutes proved his wits were intact even if he did have cuts over both eyes and a bruise on one cheek he finally slowed down enough to snarl why are all you incestloving cretins just standing around gaping someone fetch me a healerpriest one of the locals trotted away iakovitzes kept swearing krispos did not think he repeated himself once in the quarter of an hour till the priest arrived some of the onlookers who might normally have gone about their business stayed to listen instead what happened here the healerpriest asked when he finally arrived several people in the crowd started to explain as they stood aside to let the priestsabellios his name waspass from the ground iakovitzes yelled i broke my miserable leg thats what why dont you stop gabbing there and start healing hes like that holy sir krispos whispered to sabellios as the healerpriest crouched beside him its not easy to be happy with a broken leg sabellios observed easy sir easy he went on to iakovitzes for the noble gasped and swore anew as the healerpriest set his hands on either side of the fracture like the other healers krispos had seen sabellios spoke phos creed again and again as he sank into his trance then the words trailed away leaving nothing between sabellios will and the injury he faced krispos muttered with awe as he watched the swelling around the broken bone recede and the purpleblack bruise fade the healerpriest released his hold he wiped sweat from his forehead with the sleeve of his blue robe i have done what i can he said in the worn voice every healer used just after his work was done krispos noted the effort he needed to raise his head to look up at the spectators who still ringed him and iakovitzes one of you should go and bring ordanes the physician here he has a gentler touch for setting bones than i do setting bones iakovitzes hissed from between clenched teeth arent you going to heal the break sebellios stared at him heala fracture why not iakovitzes said i had it done for me once in videssos the city after i took a fall when my cursed mount couldnt leap a stream during a hunt some bluerobe from the sorcerers collegium did it for meheraklonas i think his name was you were most fortunate to be treated by such a master of the art excellent sir the healerpriest said as with most of my brethren my power is over flesh not bone which i have neither the strength nor the knowledge to heal bone you see is partly dead so it lacks the vitality upon which the healing gift draws no one in opsikionperhaps no one in any city save videssoscan heal a broken bone i am sorry to have to be the one to tell you that then what am i supposed to do iakovitzes howled anger now overcoming pain fear not sir sebellios said ordanes is a skilled bonesetter and i can abate any fever you might contract during the healing process surely in two or three months you will be walking again and if you exercise your leg once the splints come off you may not even limp two or three months iakovitzes rolled his eyes like a trapped animal how long before i can ride sebellios pursed his lips somewhere near the same length of time i should say controlling ones horse puts considerable strain on the lower leg as you must know two or three months iakovitzes repeated it unbelievingly youre saying itll be winter by the time im up and about well yes probably sebellios said what of it no ships in wintertoo many storms no good going overland either or not muchsnowdrifts piled twice as high as a man iakovitzes had been speaking softly almost to himself now suddenly he screamed you mean to tell me im stuck in this backwoods phosforsaken shitpot pesthole of an excuse for a town until spring hello hello a fat bald man pushed through the crowd and grinned down at iakovitzes my you sound cheerful today nothing like breaking a leg to do that to a man is there id sooner break your neck iakovitzes snarled which icepit did skotos let you out of names ordanes the fat man answered calmlyhe was krispos saw one of the rare men iakovitzes could not infuriate with a few illchosen words ill set that leg for you if you likei expect youll need it whole so as you can get back to cramming both feet into your face as iakovitzes gaped and spluttered the physician went on ill need a couple of stout souls here to help hold him down hell like this even less than he likes anything else im one krispos said hes my master lucky you ordanes lowered his voice so iakovitzes would not hear hate to tell you this young fellow but you and your master are going to be stuck here a goodish while thats what i heard him yelling about before isnt it krispos nodded if youre his man youll have to wait on him like he was a baby for a while because for the first month or so he shouldnt even be out of bed not if he expects those bones to heal straight think youre up to it i dont envy you and thats a fact the idea of waiting on iakovitzes hand and foot for a solid month was more nearly appalling than appealing all the same krispos said im up to it he took me into his service from the streets of videssos the city when i had nothing to my name but what i was wearing i owe him more than a little for that wouldnt do to repay him by running off when he really needs me hmm ordanes eyes were tracked with red half hidden in folds of fat and very knowing seems to me hes better served by his man than you are by your master but thats none of my affair the physician looked up at the crowd of spectators come on people dont just stand there lend a hand will you wouldnt you want somebody to help if it were your leg you there and you there in the blue tunic as the men bent to hold iakovitzes krispos realized one of his questions had just been answered for him if he was not leaving opsikion any time soon he would see tanilis again and again and again he thought iakovitzes hissed and then groaned as ordanes set to work despite the nobles anguish krispos had all he could do to keep from giggling tanilis was a much more alluring prospect in bed than his master vi that month of constant attendance on iakovitzes proved even more wearing than ordanes had predicted the physician had compared it to tending a baby babies only cried iakovitzes used his searing tongue to inform krispos of all his whims and all krispos shortcomings by the nobles reckoning krispos had plenty of them iakovitzes blamed him when the water for sponge baths was too hot or too cold when bolkanes kitchen came up with a meal iakovitzes found inadequate when the bedpan was not perfectly placed and even when his healing leg itched which it seemed to do most of the time as for that bedpan sometimes krispos felt like braining iakovitzes with it it was however his masters one significant advantage over a baby iakovitzes at least did not foul the bed in a time that held few large advantages krispos cherished the small one one afternoon about three weeks after the noble got hurt someone knocked on the door of his room krispos jumped few people had come to see iakovitzes krispos opened the door with one hand on his knife a goodlooking youth stared at him with equal suspicion its all right krispos graptos iakovitzes called from his bed in fact krispos its better than all right you can take the rest of the day off ill see you in the morning excellent sir krispos said doubtfully bolkanes arranged this for me iakovitzes assured him after all if im bedridden i might as well be bedridden if you see what i mean and since youre so tiresomely obstinate on the subject krispos waited to hear no more he closed the door behind him and hurried down to the stables if iakovitzes was going to sport so would he the sun was still an hour away from setting when he got to tanilis villa he had to wait some little time before he saw her she was settling a dispute between two peasants who dwelt on her land neither seemed displeased as they walked past krispos he was unsurprised tanilis had more than enough sense to dispense justice she smiled as naues led krispos into her study i wondered if i would see you again after your masters accident she said in front of her steward her voice was perfectly controlled i wondered too krispos also kept his tone casual he was sure tanilis would be able to find all the double meanings he put into his words and perhaps some he left out he went on the excellent iakovitzes seems to be in better spirits these days he explained who was taking care of the noble and in what ways naues snorted the tiny curl of tanilis lip looked like less but spoke more aloud she said you are welcome here regardless of the circumstances mavros may be back for the evening meal but then again he may not now that he is sure he wont be leaving for the city till spring he gives all his time to one girl knowing i suppose that afterward time and distance will fade the attachment such cool calculated good sense sounded more like tanilis than young mavros for a moment krispos was reminded of listening to his own father back in the days when zoranne was all hed thought of he hoped mavros was clever enough to recognize that his mother was cleverer still naues are there any more out there who need me tanilis asked when her man shook his head she told him go and warn evtykhes then that krispos certainly will stay for supper and that i do have some hope my son will appear as well mavros did come back to the villa when he found krispos there he condescended to stay for dinner howd you get loose he asked i thought iakovitzes wanted you there every minute krispos explained again mavros burst out laughing good for the old bugger hes feeling better then aye but hes not up and about yet and with the fall rains due any day now its just as he feared he wont be riding back to the city till spring he cant even hobble yet let alone sit a horse too bad mavros said dolefully here ive been champing at the bit for weeks and now ill have to wait for months such a long time with a moody sigh he raised his wine cup to his lips tanilis said be thankful youre young enough that a few months seem a long time to you to me next spring feels like the day after tomorrow well not to me mavros said for the most part krispos agreed with mavros at twentytwo he thought the world passed too slowly to suit him still even slowness could have its advantages he said from what ive heard youve got a girl now so just think of it as having a longerseeming time to spend with her i wish it were that easy mavros said but somehow when im with her the time flies by so it never seems like enough no matter how long it is which reminds me he finished his wine rose and sketched bows to tanilis and krispos i promised id meet her before the moon came up not quite trotting he left the dining room my poor bereft son tanilis said dryly he hasnt set eyes on his beloved for oh several hours now in a way i suppose i should be jealous but he just makes me smile instead krispos thoughtfully ate one of evtykhes lemon tarts tanilis hadnt told him anything he didnt already know her practiced sensuality was worlds apart from mavros enthusiastic infatuation nevertheless krispos wished his lover had not made it so plain he was not her beloved but no matter what she did she came to him that night if she found what they did together distasteful she hid it marvelously well afterward krispos leaned up on one elbow why me he asked tanilis made a questioning noise why me krispos repeated who you are and what you are you could pick any man within a hundred miles of opsikion and hed come running so why did you pick me because of your looks your youth your vigor because having seen you i could not help picking you the words were all krispos could have hoped to hear but he also heard the faintest questioning tone in tanilis voice as if she were offering him an explanation to see whether hed accept it though he wanted to he found he could not he said you could find a dozen who outdo me on any of those at a glancea hundred or a thousand with a little looking i gather you havent which means you havent answered me either now she sat up in bed krispos thought it was the first time she took him seriously for his own sake rather than as a cog in what shed foreseen after a short pause she said slowly because you dont take the easy way but look to see what may lie behind it that is rare at any age doubly so at yours this time he felt shed touched truth but not given him the whole of it why else he persisted he wondered if his drive to know would anger her but soon saw it did not if anything it raised him in her estimation when she replied her voice had the nononsense tone of someone conducting serious business ill not deny that the power implied by this she reached out to touch the goldpiece on its chain has its own attraction in and around opsikion i have done everything become everything i could hope to do and become to set up my own son in videssos the city to have a connection to one who may be what he may be that could tempt me almost to anything but only almost reckon me hard if you like and calculating and cunning but you reckon me a whore at your peril she did not sound businesslike then she sounded dangerous krispos nodded soberly as with iakovitzes his chief shield against her was stubborn refusal to acknowledge that she could daunt him and so he asked the light from the single lamp in the bedchamber shifted shadows on her face to underscore her every change of expression with that aid krispos saw hed gained another point and so she said i have no interest in men who seek to bed not me but my estates nor in those who would reckon me only a prize possession as if i were a hound nor again in those who care just for my body and would not mind if skotos dwelt behind my eyes do you see yourself in any of those groups no krispos said but in a way dont you fall into the first one i mean with respect to me tanilis stared at him you dare he admired her for the speed with which she checked herself after a few seconds she even laughed you have me krispos by my own words i stand convicted but here i am on the other end of the bargain and i must say it looks different from how it seemed before to you maybe krispos thought tanilis went ona final reason i chose you krispos at least after the first time is that you learn quickly one of the things you still need to know though is that sometimes you can ask too many questions she reached up and drew his face down to hers but even as he responded to her teaching he remained sure there was no such thing as asking too many questions finding the right way and time to ask them might be something else again he admitted to himself and this he thought before all thought left him was probably not it he woke the next morning to rain drumming on the roof he knew that sound though he was more used to the softer plashing of raindrops against thatch than the racket they made on tile he hoped tanilis peasants were done with their harvest then laughed at himself they were done now whether they wanted to be or not tanilis as was her way had slipped off during the night sometimes he woke when she slid out of bed more often as last night he did not he wondered not for the first time if her servants knew they were lovers if so the cooks and stewards and serving maids gave no sign of it he had learned from iakovitzes establishment though that being discreet was part of being a welltrained servant and tanilis tolerated no servant who was not he also wondered if mavros knew that he doubted mavros was a good many things and would likely grow to become a good many more but krispos had trouble seeing him as discreet her hair as perfectly in place as if he had never run his hands through it tanilis sat waiting for him in the small dining room youll have a wet ride back to opsikion i fear she said waving him to the chair opposite her he shrugged ive been wet before a good plate of boiled bacon should help keep you warm on the journey if not dry my lady is generous in all things krispos said tanilis eyes lit as he dug in the road north had already begun to turn to glue krispos did not try to push his horse if iakovitzes could not figure out why he was late coming back to town too bad for iakovitzes krispos wrung out his cloak in bolkanes front hall then squelched up the stairs in wet boots to see how his master was doing what he found in iakovitzes room startled him the noble was on his feet trying to stump around with two sticks the only sign of graptos was a lingering trace of perfume in the air hello look what i can do iakovitzes said for once too pleased with himself to be snide ive looked krispos said shortly now will you please get back in bed where you belong if you were a horse excellent sir hed learned the art of turning title to reproach theyd have cut your throat for a broken leg and let it go at that if you go and break it again from falling because youre on it too soon do you think you deserve any better ordanes told you to stay flat at least another fortnight oh bugger ordanes iakovitzes said go ahead but make him get on top the noble snorted no thank you krispos went on more earnestly i cant give you orders excellent sir but i can ask if youd treat one of your animals the way youre treating yourself theres no point to it the more so since with the fall rains starting youre not going anyplace anyhow mrmm iakovitzes saida noise a long way from any sort of agreement but one that when the noble changed the subject showed krispos he had got through iakovitzes continued to mend eventually as ordanes had predicted he was able to move about with his sticks lifting and planting them and his splinted leg so heavily that once people in the taproom directly below his chamber complained to bolkanes about the racket he made since the innkeeper was getting if not rich then at least highly prosperous from his noble guests protracted stay he turned a deaf ear to the complaints by the time iakovitzes could stump about the inn the rains made sure he did not travel much farther outside large towns videssos had few paved roads dirt was kinder to horses hooves the price of that kindness was several weeks of impassable soup each fall and spring iakovitzes cursed every day that dawned gray and wet which meant he did a lot of cursing krispos tried to rebuke him the rains a blessing to farmers excellent sir and without farmers wed all starve the words were several seconds out of his mouth before he realized they were his fathers if you like farmers so bloody well why did you ever leave that pissant village you sprang from iakovitzes retorted krispos gave up on changing his masters attitude trying to get iakovitzes to stop cursing was like trying to fit the moon in a satchel the nobles bad temper seemed as constant as the evershifting phases of the moon and soon enough krispos came to curse the fall rains too as iakovitzes grew more able to care for himself krispos found himself with more free time he wanted to spend as much time as he could with tanilis both for the sake of his bodys pleasure and increasingly to explore the boundaries of their odd relationship riding even as far as her villa though was not to be undertaken lightly not in the fall thus he was overjoyed one cold blustery day when the rain threatened to turn to sleet to hear her say i think i will go into opsikion soon to spend the winter there i have a house you know not far from phos temple id forgotten krispos admitted that night in the privacy of the guest chamber he said i hope ill be able to see you more often if you come to town this miserable weather tanilis nodded i expect you will did you krispos paused then plunged did you decide to go into opsikion partly on account of me her laugh was warm enough that though he flushed he did not flinch dont flatter yourself too much mywell if i call you my dear you will flatter yourself wont you in any case i go into opsikion every year about this time should anything important happen i might not learn of it for weeks were i to stay here in the villa oh krispos thought for a moment couldnt you stay here and foresee what you need to know the gift comes as it will not as i will tanilis said besides i like to see new faces every so often if id prayed at the chapel here after all instead of coming into opsikion for the holy abdaas day id not have met you you might have stayed a groom forever reminded of iakovitzes jibe krispos said its an easier life than the one i had before i came to the city he also thought a little angrily that he would have risen further even if tanilis hadnt met him that he kept to himself instead he said if you come to opsikion you might want to bring that pretty little laundress of yoursphronias her name isnt italong with you oh and why is that tanilis voice held no expression whatever krispos answered quickly knowing he was on tricky ground because ive spread the word around that shes the reason i come here so often if shes in opsikion ill have a better excuse to visit you there hmm put that way yes tanilis measuring gaze reminded krispos of a hawk eyeing a rabbit from on high i would not advise you to use this story to deceive me while you carry on with phronia i would not advise that at all a chill ran down krispos spine though he had no interest in phronia past any young mans regard for a pretty girl since that was true the chill soon faded what remained was insight into how tanilis thought krispos imagination had not reached to concealing one falsehood within another but tanilis took the possibility for granted that had to mean shed seen it before which in turn meant other people used such complex ploys something else to look out for krispos thought with a silent sigh what was that for tanilis asked wishing she werent so alert he said only that youve taught me many things ive certainly intended to if you would be more than a groom you need to know more than a groom krispos nodded before the full import of what shed said sank in then he found himself wondering whether shed warned him about phronia just to show him how a double bluff worked he thought about asking her but decided not to she might not have meant that at all he smiled ruefully whatever else she was doing she was teaching him to distrust first impressions and second and third after a while he supposed reality might disappear altogether and no one would notice it was gone he thought of how iakovitzes and lexo had gone back and forth quarreling over what was thought to be true at least as much as over what was true to prosper in videssos the city he might need every bit of what tanilis taught since opsikion lay by the sailors sea krispos thought winter would be gentler there the winter wind though was not off the sea but from the north and west a breeze from his old home but hardly a welcome one eventually the sea froze thick enough for a man to walk on out to a distance of several miles from shore even the folk of opsikion called that a hard winter to krispos it was appalling hed seen frozen rivers and ponds aplenty but the notion that the sea could turn to ice made him wonder if the balancer heretics from khatrish might not have a point the broad frigid expanse seemed a chunk of skotos hell brought up to earth yet the locals took the weather in stride they told stories of the year an iceberg perhaps stormdriven from agder or the haloga country smashed half the docks before shattering against the towns seawall and the eparch sisinnios sent armed patrols onto the ice north of the city what are you looking for demons krispos asked when he saw the guardsmen set out one morning he laughed nervously if the frozen sea was as much skotos country as it appeared demons might indeed dwell there the patrol leader laughed too he thought krispos had been joking worse than demons he said and gave krispos a moment to stew before he finished khatrishers in this weather krispos wore a squirrelskin cap with earflaps it was pulled down low on his forehead a thick wool scarf covered his mouth and nose the few square inches of skin between the one and the other had long since turned numb the patrol leader was similarly muffled his breath made a steaming cloud around him grab a spear and come see for yourself he urged youre with the chap from the city right well you can tell him some of what we see around here why not a quick trip back to the armory gave krispos a spear and a whitepainted shield soon he was stumbling along the icy surface of the sea with the troopers it was rougher more irregular ice than hed expected almost as if the waves had frozen instead of breaking always keep two men in sight said the patrol leader whose name krispos learned was saborios you get lost out here by yourselfwell youre already on the ice so where will your soul end up krispos blew out a smoky sigh of relief to discover he was not the only one who had heretical thoughts the guardsmen paid attention to what they were doing but it was a routine attention making sure they did nothing they knew to be foolish it left plenty of room for banter and horseplay krispos trudged on grimly in the middle of the line with neither terrain nor risks familiar to him he had all he could do just to keep pace good thing its not snowing one of the troopers said if it was snowing the khatrishers could sneak an army past us and wed never know the difference we would when we got back another answered the first guard chuckled everything looked the same to krispos sky and frozen sea and distant land all were shades of white and gray anything colorful he thought should have been visible for miles what had not occurred to him was how uncolorful a smuggler could become had the trooper to krispos left not almost literally stumbled over the man they never would have spied him even then had he stayed still he might have escaped notice he wore white foxskins and when still was invisible past twenty paces but he lost his head and tried to run he was no better at it on the slippery ice than his pursuers who soon ran him down saborios held out a hand to the khatrisher who had gone so far as to daub white greasepaint on his beard and face you dont by any chance have your import license along do you the patrol leader asked pleasantly the khatrisher stood in glum silence no eh saborios said almost as if really surprised then lets have your goods the smuggler reached under his jacket drew out a leather pouch the patrol leader opened it amber is it very fine too did you give me all of it complete confiscation you know is the penalty for unlicensed import thats everything curse you the khatrisher said sullenly good saborios nodded his understanding then you wont mind domentzios and bonosos stripping you if they find youve told the truth theyll even give you back your clothes krispos was shivering in his furs he wondered how long a naked man would last on the ice not long enough to get off it again he was sure he watched the smuggler make the same unhappy calculation the fellow took a pouch from each boot the patrol leader pocketed them then motioned forward the two troopers he had named they were tugging off the khatrishers coat when he exclaimed wait the imperials looked to the patrol leader who nodded the smuggler shed his white fox cap i need my knife all right he said saborios nodded again the smuggler cut into the lining extracted yet another pouch he threw down the dagger now you can search me the troopers did they found nothing shivering and swearing the khatrisher dove back into his clothes you might have got that last one by us saborios remarked thats what i thought the smuggler said through chattering teeth then i thought i might not have too sensible saborios said well lets take you in weve earned our pay for today i think what will you do with him krispos asked as the patrol turned back toward opsikion hold him for ransom saborios answered nothing else we can do now that ive seen hes smuggling amber gumush will pay to have him back never fear krispos made a questioning noise saborios explained ambers a royal monopoly in khatrish the khagan likes to see if he can avoid paying our tariffs every so often thats all this time he didnt so we get some for free does he sneak in enough to make it worth his while thats a sharp questioni thought you were iakovitzes groom not his bookkeeper the only answer i know is he must think so or he wouldnt keep doing it but not this run though the patrol leaders eyes almost the only part of his face visible narrowed in satisfaction iakovitzes howled with glee when krispos told him the story that evening they were sitting much closer than usual to bolkanes big fire krispos had a mug of hot spiced wine close at hand he smiled gratefully when one of the barmaids refilled it iakovitzes said itll serve gumush right nothing i enjoy more than a thief having to pay for his own thievery wont he just raise the price later on to make up for it krispos asked the legitimate price i mean probably probably iakovitzes admitted but what do i care i dont much fancy amber and no matter how hard hesqueezes the world doesnt hold enough gold for him to buy his way out of embarrassment contemplating someone elses discomfiture would put iakovitzes in a good mood if anything would a couple of nights later tanilis proved coldly furious that the amber had been seized i made the arrangements for it myself with gumush she said four parts in ten off the going rate here which still allowed him a profit seeing as the tariff is five parts in ten he already has half the money too do you suppose hell send it back when he ransoms his courier her bitter laugh told how likely that was but krispos scratched his head the avtokrator needs the money from the tariffs to pay for soldiers and furs and roads and and courtesans and fine wines and fripperies tanilis finished for him she sounded as scornful of anthimos iii as pyrrhos had but even if it were only as you say i need money too for the good of my own estates why should i pay twice as much for amber as i need to for the sake of a handful of rich men in videssos the city who do nothing for me dont they krispos asked seems to me i wouldnt have come here with my master if the men in the city werent worried about the border with khatrish or are you such a queen here that your peasants would have fought off the nomad horsemen on their own he recalled the kubratoi descending on his vanished boyhood village as if it had happened only the day before tanilis frowned no i am no queen so what you say has some truth but the avtokrator and sevastokrator chose peace with khatrish for their own reasons not mine remembering petronas ambitions against makuran krispos knew she was right but he saidit works out the same for you either way doesnt it if it does you ought to be willing to pay for it he and his fellow villagers had been willing to pay anything within reason to prevent another invasion from kubrat only the empires demands reaching beyond reason had detached him from the land and the rest of the villagers were there still you speak well and to the point tanilis said i must confess my loyalty is to my lands first and to the empire of videssos only after that what i say is true of most nobles i think almost all those away from videssos the city to us the empire seems more often to check our strength than to protect it and so we evade demands from the capital as best we can the more krispos talked with tanilis the more complex his picture of the world grew back in his village hed thought of nobles as agents of the empire and thanked phos that the freeholders among whom hed lived owed service to no lord yet tanilis seemed no ally to the will of videssos the city but rather a rival but she was no great friend of the peasants either she simply wanted to control them herself in place of the central government krispos tried to imagine how things looked from petronas perspective maybe one day hed ask the sevastokratorafter all hed met him he laughed a little amused at his own presumption what do you find funny tanilis asked krispos cheeks grew warm sometimes when he was with tanilis he felt he was a scroll she could unroll and read as she wished annoyed at himself for being so open and sure he could not lie successfully he explained she took him seriously she always did he had to give her that though he was certain he often seemed very young and raw to her she went out of her way not to mock his enthusiasms even if she let him see she did not share many of them even more than the sweet lure of her body the respect she gave him made him want to spend time with her in bed and out of it he wondered if this was how love began the thought so startled him that he missed her reply she saw that too and repeated herself if petronas would tell you i daresay youd learn a great deal a regent who can keep the reins of power even after his ward comes of ageand in such a way that the ward does not hate himis a man to be reckoned with i suppose so krispos knew he sounded abstracted and hoped tanilis would not figure out why loving her could only complicate his life the more so as he knew she did not love him slow as the flow of syrup on ice news dripped into opsikion through the winter krispos heard of the death of khagan omurtag weeks after it happened a son named malomir ascended to the rule of kubrat in thatagush north and east of khatrish a band of haloga raiders under a chief called harvas blackrobe sacked a whole string of towns and smashed the army that tried to drive them away some nobles promptly joined forces with the halogai against their khagan the king of kings of makuran sent a peace embassy to videssos the city petronas sent it back by the lord with the great and good mind i gave petronas what he wanted here iakovitzes said when that report reached him now lets see what he does with it his chuckle had a gloating tone to it not as much as he wants ill wager no krispos helped his master out of a chair the noble could walk with a stick these days but he still limped badly his left calf was only half as big around as his right krispos went on carefully the sevastokrator strikes me as a man who generally gets what he wants oh aye he is here im all right now thanks iakovitzes hissed as he put weight on his healing leg ordanes had given him a set of exercises to strengthen it he swore through clenched teeth every time he began them but never missed a day now he took a couple of steps toward the stairway that led up to his room before he continued but what petronas wants is to overthrow makuran and that wont happen stavrakios the great couldnt do it not when the empire of videssos ran all the way up to the border of the haloga country i suppose the makurani kings of kings dream of worshiping their four prophets in the high temple in videssos the city and that wont happen either if petronas can bite off a chunk of vaspurakan hell have done something worthwhile at any rate we can use the metals there and the men even if they are heretics a guardsman coming off duty threw open the door to bolkanes taproom though he slammed it again right away krispos and iakovitzes both shivered at the icy blast he let in he stood in the front hall brushing snow off his clothes and out of his beard beastly weather iakovitzes said i could ride now but whats the point the odds are too good id end up a block of ice somewhere halfway between here and the city and that would be a piteous waste come to think of it youd freeze too thank you for thinking of me krispos said mildly iakovitzes cocked an eyebrow youre getting better at that innocentsounding comeback arent you do you practice in front of a mirror erno krispos knew his fencing with tanilis helped sharpen both his wits and his wit he hadnt realized anyone else would notice maybe its the time you spend knocking around with mavros iakovitzes said krispos blinked his masters guess was good enough to startle him iakovitzes went on he has a nobles air to him even if he is young i hadnt really noticed krispos said i suppose he gets it from his mother maybe as he did whenever a woman was mentioned iakovitzes sounded indifferent he reached the stairway give me your hand will you for the way up krispos complied chill or no iakovitzes was sweating by the time he got to the top of the stairs his leg still did not take kindly to such work krispos went through the usual small wrestling match he needed to get the noble to let go after a year with me excellent sir dont you believe im not interested he asked oh i believe it iakovitzes said i just dont take it seriously having had if not krispos then at least the last word he hobbled down the hall toward his room rain pattered on the shutters of the bedroom window the second storm in a row with no snow in it tanilis said no sleet in this one either or none to speak of winter is finally losing its grip so it is krispos kept his voice noncommittal the imminent return of good weather meant too many different things now for him to be sure how he felt about it tanilis sat up in bed and ran a hand through her hair the gesture artfully artless made her bare breasts rise for krispos admiration at the same time though she said when the rain finally stops i will be going back to my villa i dont think you would be wise to visit me there krispos had known she would tell him that sooner or later hed thought he was ready actually hearing the words though was like taking a blow in the bellyno matter how braced he was they still hurt so its over he said dully this part of it tanilis agreed again hed thought he could accept that thought he could depart with iakovitzes for videssos the city without a backward glance had his master not broken his leg that might well have been true but wintering in opsikion passing so much more time with tanilis made it harder than hed expected all his carefully cultivated sangfroid deserted him he clutched her to him i dont want to leave you he groaned she yielded to his embrace but her voice stayed detached logical what then would you turn aside from what i and others have seen for you would you abandon this she touched the goldpiece omurtag had given him to stay in opsikion and if you would would i look on you with anything but scorn because of it but i love you krispos said down deep hed always been sure telling her that would be a mistake his instinct proved sound she answered if you stayed here because of that i surely could never love you i am already fully myself while you are still discovering what you can be nor in the long run would you be happy in opsikion for what would you be here my plaything maybe granted a small respect reflected from the larger one i have earned but laughed at behind peoples hands is that the most you want for yourself krispos your plaything that made him angry enough not to listen to the rest of what she said he ran a rough hand along the supple curves of her body ending at the edge of the neatly trimmed hair that covered her secret place is that all this has meant is that all ive been to you you know better or you should tanilis said calmly how could i deny youve pleased me i would not want to deny it but it is not enough you deserve to be more than a bedwarmer however fine a bedwarmer you are and if you stayed with me you would not find it easy to be anything else not only do i have far more experience and vastly greater wealth than you i do not care to yield to anyone the power ive earned by my own efforts over the years so what would that leave you i dont care krispos said though he sounded full of fierce conviction even he knew that was not true so obviously did tanilis do you not very well then let us suppose you stay here and that you and i are wed perhaps on the next feast day of the holy abdaas come the morning after what do you propose to say to your new stepson mavros my krispos gulped he had no trouble imagining mavros his brother but his stepson he could not even make himself say the word he started to laugh instead and poked tanilis in the ribs she was not usually ticklish but he caught her by surprise she yipped and wiggled away mavros my he tried again but only ended up laughing harder oh a pestilence tanilis youve made your point good theres always hope for anyone who can see plain sense even if i did have to bludgeon you to open your eyes she turned her head what is it krispos asked i was just listening i dont think the rain will let up for a while yet now her hand wandered came to rest she smiled a catlike smile by the feel of things neither will you shall we make the most of the time we have left he did not answer not with words but he did not disagree let me give you a hand excellent sir krispos said as a pair of stable boys led out his masters horse his own and their pack animals nonsense iakovitzes told him if i cant mount for myself i surely wont be able to ride back to the city and if i cant do that im faced with two equally unpalatable alternatives take up residence here or throw myself off a promontory into the sea on the whole i believe id prefer throwing myself into the sea that way id never have to find out whats become of my house while ive been gone the noble gave a shudder of exquisite dread when you wrote youd been hurt the sevastokrator pledged to look after your affairs so he did iakovitzes said with a skeptical grunt the only affairs petronas cares anything about though are his own he scowled at the boy who held his horse back away there if i cant manage high time i found out the stable boy retreated iakovitzes set his left foot in the stirrup swung up and onto the horses back he winced as the newly healed leg took all his weight for a moment but then he was mounted and grinning in triumph hed boarded the horse before every day for the past week but each time seemed a new adventure both to him and to everyone watching now wheres that mavros he said im still not what youd call comfortable up here anyone who thinks ill waste time waiting that i could use riding will end up disappointed i promise you that krispos did not think iakovitzes was speaking to him in particular he sounded more as if he were warning the world at large krispos checked one last time to make sure all their gear was properly stowed on the packhorses backs then climbed onto his own beast bolkanes came to bid his longtime guests farewell he bowed to iakovitzes a pleasure to serve you eminent sir i should hope so ive made your fortune iakovitzes answered gracious to the end as the innkeeper beat a hasty retreat mavros rode up on a big bay gelding he looked very young and jaunty with two pheasant plumes sticking up from his broadbrimmed hat and his right hand on the hilt of his sword he waved to krispos and dipped his head in iakovitzes direction you look like you were all set to take off without me i was iakovitzes snapped if he thought to intimidate the youth he failed well no need for that now seeing as im here mavros said easily he turned to krispos my mother said to be sure to tell you goodbye from her now ive done it one more chore finished his attitude seemed to say ah thats kind of her krispos said although he hadnt seen or heard from tanilis in more than a month she was in his thoughts every day the memory of her as liable to sudden twinges as was iakovitzes leg a limp in the heart though did not show on the outside if you two are done nattering like washerwomen shall we be off iakovitzes said without waiting for an answer he used knees and reins to urge his horse forward krispos and mavros rode after him opsikions gate guards still had not learned to take any special notice of iakovitzes who after all had not come near the edge of the city since the summer before but the feisty noble had no cause for complaint about the treatment he was afforded being with mavros drew him such a flurry of salutes and guardsmen springing to attention that he said not altogether in jest anthimos should come here to see what respect is oh i expect he gets treated about as well in his hometown mavros said iakovitzes had to look at him sharply to catch the twinkle in his eye the noble allowed himself a wintry chuckle the most he usually gave wit not his own that chuckle krispos thought was the only thing wintry about the day it was mild and fair new bright green covered we ground to either side of the road bees buzzed among freshsprouted flowers the sweet moist air was full of the songs of birds just returned from their winter stay in warmer climes though the road climbed swiftly into the mountains this near opsikion it remained wide and easy to travel if not always straight krispos was startled when with the sun still nearer noon than its setting iakovitzes reined in and said thats enough well camp here till morning but when he watched his master dismount he hardly needed to hear the noble go on my thighs are as raw as a dockside whores the night after the imperial fleet rows into port no wonder excellent sir krispos said flat on your back as you were for so long youve lost your hardening i dont know about that mavros said ive had some lovely hardenings flat on my back again iakovitzes basilisk glare failed to wilt him the noble finally grunted and hobbled off into the bushes unbuttoning his fly as he went watching that slow spraddling gait krispos whistled softly he is saddlesore isnt he i guess he thought it couldnt happen to him aye looks like hell have to get used to it all over again he wont be back from watering the grass right away either mavros lowered his voice as he reached into a saddlebag which means now is as good a time as any to pass this on to you from my mother a parting gift you might say she told me not to give it to you when anyone else could see krispos reached out to take the small wooden box mavros held he wondered what sort of last present tanilis had for him and wondered even more briefly alarmed how much shed told mavros about what had passed between the two of them mavros as stepson indeed krispos thoughtshed known how to cool him down sure enough maybe though he said to himself its like one of the romances minstrels sing and she does love me but cant admit it except by giving me this token once im safely gone the second the box was in his hand its weight told him tanilis gift was the more pragmatic one shed promised gold he said a pound and a half mavros agreed if youre going to bewhat youre going to bethis will help money begets money my mother says and this will grow all the better since no one knows you have it a pound and a half of goldthe box fit easily in the palm of krispos hand for tanilis it was not enough money to be missed krispos knew that if he were to desert his master and mavros and make his way back to his village he would be far and away the richest man there he could go home as something close to a hero the lad whod made good in the big city but his village he realized after a moment was not home any more not really he could no more go back now than he could have stayed in opsikion for better or worse he was caught up in the faster life of videssos the city after a taste of it nothing less could satisfy him rustlings from the bushes announced iakovitzes return krispos hastily stowed away the box of coins with a hundred and eight goldpieces in his hands he thought he did not need to keep working for iakovitzes anymore either but if he stayed on he wouldnt have to start spending them he didnt need to decide anything about that right away not when he was only a short days journey out of opsikion i may live iakovitzes said he grimaced as he sat down on the ground and started pulling off his boots eventually i may even want to what have we for supper about what youd expect krispos answered twicebaked bread sausage hard cheese and onions we have a couple of wineskins but its a ways to the next town so we ought to go easy if we want to make it last i hear a stream off that waywell have plenty of water to wash things down water twicebaked bread the petulant set of iakovitzes mouth showed what he thought of that the next time petronas wants me to go traveling for him ill ask if i can bring a chef along he does when hes out on campaign there ought to be crawfish in the stream and trout too mavros said i have a couple of hooks shall i go see what i can come up with ill start a fire krispos said roast fish crawfish baked in clay he glanced over to see how iakovitzes liked the idea could be worse i suppose the noble said grudgingly see if you can find some early marjoram too why dont you mavros it would add to the flavor ill do my best mavros rummaged through his gear till he found the hooks and some light line a chunk of sausage should be bait enough for the fish but what do you suppose i should use to lure out the marjoram iakovitzes threw a boot at him one day when he was close to halfway back to the city krispos came across the little jet ornament hed brought for sirikia he stared at it the seamstress hadnt crossed his mind in months he hoped shed found someone new after tanilis going back to her would be like leaving videssos for his farming village possible but not worth thinking about he was no monk on the journey westward abstinence was not in his nature but he had finally learned not to imagine himself in love each time his lust needed slaking mavros still sighed whenever he left behind another barmaid or dyeshop girl the travelers lay over in a town called develtos to rest their horses iakovitzes surveyed the place with a jaundiced eye his onesentence verdict summed it up perfectly by the good god it makes opsikion look like a metropolis mavros spluttered at that but krispos knew what his master meant develtos boasted a stout wall and had little else about which to boast seeing how small and gloomy a town the works protected krispos wondered why anyone had bothered to build them in the first place the road does need strongpoints every so often iakovitzes told him when he said that aloud the noble took another long look sighed in despair but well have to make our own fun thats for certain speaking of which his gaze traveled back to krispos it was the grooms turn to sigh iakovitzes had not bothered him much since mavros joined them so far as krispos knew he hadnt made advances at mavros either had krispos not seen a goodlooking young stablehand a couple of towns back wearing one of the nobles rings the morning they set out he would have wondered if iakovitzes was fully healed hed enjoyed the peace while it lasted the inn iakovitzes picked proved livelier than the rest of develtos whose people seemed as dour as the grim gray stone from which their wall and buildings were made that was not the innkeepers fault he was as somber as any of his townsfolk but a group of close to a dozen motherofpearl merchants from the eastern island of kalavria made the place jolly in spite of its proprietor krispos had even met one or two of them back at opsikion theyd landed there before heading inland why didnt you just sail straight on to videssos the city he asked one of the traders over a mug of wine bring motherofpearl to the city exclaimed the kalavrian a hooknosed fellow named stasios i might as well fetch milk to a cow videssos has more than it needs already here away from the sea though the stuff is rare and wonderful and we get good prices you know your business best krispos said from the way the merchants were spending money theyd done well so far the taproom grew gloomy as evening came on the innkeeper waited longer than krispos liked before lighting candles likely hed hoped his guests would go to bed when it got dark and save him the expense but the kalavrians were in no mood for sleep they sang and drank and swapped stories with krispos and his companions after a while one of the traders took out a pair of dice the tiny rattle they gave as he rolled them on the table to test his luck made iakovitzes scramble to his feet im going upstairs he told krispos and mavros and if the two of you have any sense youll come with me you start gambling with kalavrians and youll still be at it when the sun comes up again the merchants laughed so they know our reputation even in the city stasios said id have bet they did i know you would iakovitzes said youd bloody well bet on anything thats why im heading off to bed to keep from having to stay up with you mavros hesitated then went upstairs with him krispos decided to stay and play the stakes he saw with some relief were pieces of silver not gold were all friends one of the traders said noticing his glance at the money theyd got out thered be no joy in breaking a man especially since hed have to stay with us till fall even so good enough krispos answered before long the man to his left threw double sixes and lost the dice they came to him he rattled them in his hand then sent them spinning across the tabletop twin ones stared up at the gamblers phos little suns krispos said happily he collected all the bets your first throw a kalavrian said with luck like that no wonder you wanted to stay down here you knew youd clean us out theyre your dice krispos retorted for all i knew youd loaded them no thatd be rhangavve stasios said hes not with us this yearsomebody back home on the island caught him at it and broke his arm for him hes richer than any of us though the cheating bastard krispos won a little lost a little won a little more eventually he found himself yawning and not being able to stop he got up from the table thats enough for me he said i want to be able to ride tomorrow without falling off my horse a couple of kalavrians waved as he headed for the stairs more had eyes only for the spinning bone cubes behind the bar the innkeeper sat dozing he jerked awake every so often arent you gents tired too he asked plaintively seeing krispos leave the traders laughed at him krispos had just got to the head of the stairs when he saw someone quietly emerging from iakovitzes room his hand dropped to the hilt of his sword then he relaxed though only a couple of tiny lamps lit the hall he recognized mavros the youth leaned back into the doorway for a moment murmured something krispos could not hear and went to his own room it was farther down the hall than iakovitzes so he turned his back on krispos and did not notice him krispos frowned as he opened his door then barred it behind him he tried to tell himself what hed seen didnt mean what he thought it did he could not make himself believe it he knew what a goodnight kiss looked like no matter who was giving it he asked himself what difference it made living in iakovitzes household had taught him that the grooms who let the noble take them to bed were not much different from the ones who declined save in their choice of pleasures if mavros enjoyed what iakovitzes offered it was his business and none of krispos it did not make him any less cheerful clever or enthusiastic that thought consoled krispos long enough to let him undress and get into bed then he realized it was his business after all tanilis had charged him to treat mavros as a younger brother no matter how his perspective had changed he knew it would not be easy if his younger brother acted as mavros had he sighed here was something new and unwelcome to worry about he had no idea what to say to mavros or what to do if as seemed likely mavros answered so what but he found he could not sleep until he promised himself he would say something even getting the chance did not prove easy some of the kalavrians were still gambling when he and mavros came down for breakfast the next morning and this was one conversation he did not want overheard for that matter some of the kalavrians were still gambling when iakovitzes came down for breakfast quite a bit later he rolled his eyes youd bet on whether phos or skotos will triumph at the end of time he said in disgust stasios and a couple of others looked up from the dice you know we just might he said soon the blearyeyed merchants started arguing theology as they played congratulations mavros told iakovitzes by the ice what for iakovitzes was listening to the kalavrians as if he could not believe his ears with a sly grin mavros answered how many people can boast theyve invented a new heresy before their morning porridge krispos swallowed wrong mavros pounded him on the back iakovitzes just scowled through the rest of the day he remained as sour toward mavros as he was with anyone else krispos began to wonder if hed made a mistake but no he knew what hed seen as the last of the allnight gamblers among the kalavrians went upstairs the traders who had gone to bed began drifting down once more the game never stopped krispos fretted having to wait only made him more nervous about what hed say to mavros after checking the horses the next morning iakovitzes decided to ride on another day wouldnt hurt the beasts i suppose but another day stuck in develtos with those gambling maniacs would do me in he said he was too good a horseman to push the pace with tired animals and rested them frequently when he went off to answer natures call at one of those stops krispos found himself with the opportunity hed dreaded mavros he said quietly what is it mavros turned toward him when he saw the expression on krispos face his own grew more serious what is it he repeated in a different tone of voice now that he was at the point krispos carefully crafted speeches deserted him did you end up in bed with iakovitzes the other night he blurted what if i did are you jealous mavros looked at krispos again no youre not what then why should you care because i was bid to be your brother remember i never had a brother before only sisters so i dont quite know how to do that but i do know i wouldnt want any kin of mine sleeping with someone just to get in his good graces if mavros knew about him and tanilis krispos realized as soon as the words were out of his mouth hed throw that right back at him no matter how unfairly but mavros must not have he said why do i need to get in iakovitzes good graces aye he lives at the capital but i could buy and sell him if he gives me too bad a time id do it too and he knows it krispos started to answer abruptly stopped hed judged mavros situation by his own and only now did he see the two were not the same unlike him mavros had a perfectly satisfactory life to return to if the city did not suit him with such independent means though why had he yielded to iakovitzes that was a question krispos could ask and did to find out what it was like why else mavros said ive had plenty of girls but id never tried it the other way round from the way iakovitzes talked it up i thought i was missing something special oh the straightforward hedonism in the reply reminded krispos of tanilis he needed a moment to get up the nerve to ask and what did you think mavros shrugged it was interesting to do once but i wouldnt want to make a habit of it as far as im concerned girls are more fun oh krispos said again he felt foolish i guess i should have kept my big mouth shut probably you should have but mavros seemed to reconsider no i take that back if we are to be brothers then you have the right to speak to me when something troubles youand the other way round too i suppose thats only fair krispos agreed this whole business takes some getting used to things my mother arranges usually do mavros said cheerfully but they have a way of working out right in the end and if this particular arrangement works out right in the end he broke off they were altogether alone except for iakovitzes off somewhere in the bushes but he was still wary of speaking about what tanilis had seen krispos thought the better of him for it he was a good deal more than wary himself what were you two gossiping about iakovitzes asked when he came back a couple of minutes later you of course krispos said in his best innocent voice a worthy topic indeed iakovitzes was noticeably smoother mounting than he had been back at opsikion he used his legs and the reins to get his horse moving once more krispos and mavros followed him toward the city vii hurry up krispos arent you ready yet iakovitzes said we dont want to be late not to this affair no excellent sir krispos said he had been ready for the best part of an hour his master was the one who kept taking off one robe and putting on another agonizing over how big a hoop to wear in his left ear and whether it should be gold or silver bedeviling his servants about which scent to douse himself with this once krispos did not blame iakovitzes for fussiness the sevastokrator petronas was giving the evenings feast come on then iakovitzes said now a moment later almost as an afterthought he added you look quite well tonight i dont think ive seen that robe before thank you excellent sir no i dont think youve seen it either i just bought it a couple of weeks ago the garment in question was dark blue and of fine soft wool its sober hue and plain cut were suited to a man older and of higher station than krispos hed used a few of tanilis goldpieces on clothes of that sort one of these days he might need to be taken seriously not looking like a groom could only help he rode half a pace behind iakovitzes and to his masters left iakovitzes swore whenever cross traffic made them slow and grew livid to see how crowded the plaza of palamas was out of the way there you blundering oaf he screamed when he got stuck behind a small man leading a large mule i have an appointment with the sevastokrator cheeky as most of the folk who called videssos the city home the fellow retorted i dont care if youve got an appointment with phos pal im in front of you and thats how i like it after more curses iakovitzes and krispos managed to swing around the muleteer by then they were near the western edge of the plaza of palamas past the great amphitheater past the red granite obelisk of the milestone from which all distances in the empire were reckoned here you see excellent sir were all right krispos said soothingly as traffic thinned out i suppose so iakovitzes did not sound convinced but krispos knew he was grumbling only because he always grumbled the western edge of the plaza bordered on the imperial palaces and no one entered the palace district without business there soon iakovitzes urged his horse up into a trot and then into a canter where are we going krispos asked keeping pace the hall of the nineteen couches the nineteen what krispos wasnt sure hed heard correctly couches iakovitzes repeated why do they call it that because up until maybe a hundred years ago people at fancy feasts ate while they reclined instead of sitting in chairs as we do now dont ask me why they did that because i couldnt tell youto make it easier for them to spill things on their robes i suppose anyway there havent been any couches in there for a long time but names have a way of sticking they swung round a decorative stand of willows krispos saw scores of torches blazing in front of a large square building and people bustling around and going inside is that it thats it iakovitzes gauged the number of horses and sedan chairs off to one side of the hall were all rightnot too early but not late either grooms in matched silken finery led away his mount and krispos krispos followed his master up the low broad stairs to the hall of the nineteen couches pretty stone krispos remarked as he got close enough to make out detail in the torchlight do you really think so iakovitzes said the green veining in the white marble always reminds me of one of those crumbly cheeses that smell bad i hadnt thought of that krispos said truthfully enough he had to admit the comparison was apt even so he would not have made it himself iakovitzes jaundiced outlook made him take some strange views of the world a servitor in raiment even more splendid than the grooms bowed low as iakovitzes came to the entrance then turned and loudly announced the excellent iakovitzes thus introduced iakovitzes swaggered into the reception hall as well as he could swagger with a limp that was still pronounced krispos who was not nearly important enough to be worth introducing followed his master inside iakovitzes petronas hurried up to clasp the nobles hand that was a fine piece of work you did for me in opsikion you have my gratitude the sevastokrator made no effort to keep his voice down heads turned to see whom he singled out for such public praise thank you your highness iakovitzes said visibly preening as i said youre the one who has earned my thanks well done petronas started to walk away stopped krispos isnt it yes your imperial highness krispos said surprised and impressed the sevastokrator remembered his name after one brief meeting almost a year before thought so petronas also seemed pleased with himself he turned back to iakovitzes didnt you bring another lad with you from opsikion too mavros was that the name tanilis son i mean iakovitzes nodded as a matter of fact i did thought so petronas repeated bring him along one of these times when were at a function together if you could id like to meet him besides which the sevastokrators smile was cynical his mothers rich enough that i dont want to get her annoyed with me and chatting him up can only help me with her petronas went off to greet other guests iakovitzes gaze followed him he doesnt miss much the noble mused more to himself than to krispos i wonder which of my people told him about mavros whoever it was krispos did not envy him if his master found him out still muttering to himself iakovitzes headed for the wine he plucked a silver goblet from the bed of hoarded snow in which it rested drained it and reached for another krispos took a goblet too he sipped from it as he walked over to a table piled high with appetizers a couple of slices of boiled eggplant and some pickled anchovies took the edge off his appetite he was careful not to eat too much he wanted to be able to do justice to the supper that lay ahead your moderation does you credit young man someone said from behind him when he left the hors doeuvres after only a brief stay your pardon krispos turned swiftly added holy sir most holy sir he amended the priestor rather prelatewhod spoken to him wore shimmering clothofgold with phos sun picked out in blue silk on his left breast nothing really the ecclesiastic said his sharp foxy features reminded krispos of petronas though they were less stern and heavy than the sevastokrators he went on its just that at an event like this where gluttony is the rule seeing anyone eschew it is a cause for wonderment and celebration hoping hed guessed right about what eschew meant krispos answered all i planned was to be a glutton a little later he explained why hed gone easy on the appetizers oh dear the prelate threw back his head and laughed well young sir i appreciate your candor that believe me is even rarer at these events than moderation i dont believe ive seen you before he paused expectantly my name is krispos most holy sir im one of iakovitzes grooms pleased to meet you krispos since i see my blue boots havent given me away let me introduce myself as well im called gnatios just as only the avtokrator wore allred boots only one priest had the privilege of wearing allblue ones krispos realized with a start that hed been making small talk with the ecumenical patriarch of the empire of videssos mmost holy sir he stammered bowing even as he bent his head though he felt a rush of prideif only the villagers could see him now no formality needed not when im here to enjoy the good food too gnatios said with an easy smile then those foxy features suddenly grew very sharp indeed krispos ive heard your name before after all i think something to do with the abbot pyrrhos wasnt it the abbot was kind enough to find me my place with iakovitzes yes most holy sir krispos said thats all gnatios persisted what else could there be krispos knew perfectly well what else if gnatios didnt he was not about to reveal it for him who knows what else the patriarchs chuckle was thin where pyrrhos is involved any sort of superstitious excess becomes not only possible but credible well never mind young man just because something is credible that doesnt necessarily make it true not necessarily a pleasant evening to you gnatios shaven skull gleamed in the torchlight like one of the gilded domes atop phos temple as he went on his way krispos took the rest of the wine in his cup at a gulp then went over to the great basin of snow for another one he was sweating in spite of the wines chill the patriarch by the nature of his office was the avtokrators man had he boasted to gnatios instead of sensibly keeping his mouth shut he wondered if he would even have got back to iakovitzes house safe and sound little by little the wine helped calm krispos gnatios didnt seem to have taken seriously whatever tales hed heard then a servant appeared at krispos elbow are you iakovitzes groom he asked krispos heart jumped into his mouth yes he answered readying himself to knock the man down and flee could you join your master please the fellow said well be seating folk for dinner soon and the two of you will be together oh of course krispos felt like giggling with relief as he scanned the hall of the nineteen couches for iakovitzes he wished the noble were taller he was hard to spot even though he had trouble seeing iakovitzes he soon heard him arguing with someone or other he made his way over to him servants carried away the tables of appetizers others brought out dining tables and chairs despite guests getting in their way they moved with practiced efficiency faster than krispos would have thought possible the hall was ready and the servants began guiding diners to their seats this way excellent sir if you please a servitor murmured to iakovitzes he had to repeat himself several times iakovitzes was driving home a rhetorical point by jabbing a forefinger into the chest of a man who had been rash enough to disagree with him the noble finally let himself listen he and krispos followed the servant who said you have the honor of sitting at the sevastokrators table to krispos that said how much petronas thought of the job iakovitzes had done at opsikion iakovitzes merely grunted ive had it before his eyebrows rose as he neared the head table and up till now ive never had to share it with barbarians either four kubratoi looking outlandish indeed in their shaggy furs were already at the table theyd quickly emptied one pitcher of wine and were shouting for another the servant said they are an embassy from the new khagan malomir and have ambassadors privileges bah was iakovitzes reply to that the one in the middle there the big bruiser you mean to tell me hes an ambassador he looks more like a hired killer krispos had already noticed the man iakovitzes meant with his scarred sullen face wide shoulders and enormous hands he certainly resembled no diplomat krispos had seen or imagined the servant answered as a properly accredited member of the party from kubrat he cannot be excluded from functions to which his comrades are invited he lowered his voice i will say however that his principal area of prowess does appear to be wrestling not reason iakovitzes expression was eloquent but a second glance at the enormous kubrati made him keep to himself whatever remarks he thought of making the servant seated him and krispos well away from the kubratoi only a couple of places from petronas krispos hoped the arrival of food would help quiet malomirs envoys it did help but not muchit made them talk with their mouths full trays came and went bearing soup prawns partridges and lamb after a while krispos lost track of the number of courses hed eaten he only knew he was replete when the last candied apricots were gone petronas rose and lifted his goblet to the health and long life of his imperial majesty the avtokrator of the videssians anthimos iii he declared everyone drank the toast petronas stayed on his feet and to the efforts of that clever and accomplished diplomat the excellent noble iakovitzes everyone drank again this time with a spattering of polite applause flushed with pleasure at being toasted next after the emperor iakovitzes stood up to his imperial highness the sevastokrator petronas petronas bowed as the toast was drunk he caught the eye of one of the kubrati envoys to the long and peaceful reign of the great khagan malomir and to your own continued success gleb gleb stood he raised his goblet i drink also to the health of your avtokrator he said his videssian slow but clear even polished didnt think he had manners enough for that iakovitzes said to krispos from the murmurs of pleasure that filled the hall a good many other people were similarly surprised gleb did not sit down since his imperial highness the sevastokrator petronas has only now deigned to notice my lord the khagan malomir and me suddenly the hall of the nineteen couches grew still krispos wondered whether iakovitzes joy was worth the slight the kubrati plainly felt i now propose a toast to remind him of the might of kubrat thus i drink to the strength of my comrade here the famous and ferocious beshev who has beaten every videssian he has faced gleb drank so did the other kubratoi most of the imperials in the hall kept their goblets in front of them he goes too far iakovitzes did not bother to speak softly i know kubratoi are conceited and boastful but this surpasses all due measure he krispos made hushing motions the famous and ferocious beshev was climbing to his feet as he rose krispos took his measure he was surely very strong but how much quickness did he have by the way he moved not a great deal indeed if he was as slow as he seemed krispos wondered how he had won all his matches beshev held his goblet high his videssian was much more strongly accented than glebs but still understandable i drink to the spirit of the brave stylianos whose neck i broke in our fight and to the spirits of the other videssians i will slay in wrestlings yet to come he drained the goblet with a satisfied smirk gleb drank too petronas stared at the men from kubrat stonyfaced angry shouts rang through the hall none of them though krispos noted came from anywhere close to beshev not even iakovitzes felt like affronting the kubrati to his face krispos turned to his master let me take him on eh what iakovitzes frowned as comprehension dawned he looked to beshev back to krispos and slowly shook his head no krispos bravely offered but no that barbarian may be a musclebound hulk but he knows what hes about i dont care to lose you for no good purpose he put his hand on krispos arm krispos shook it off you wouldnt lose me to no good purpose he said angry now at iakovitzes as well as the arrogant kubrati and i know what im about too if you doubt it remember how i handled barses and meletios a year and a half ago i learned wrestling back in my village from a veteran of the imperial army iakovitzes looked at beshev again that barbarian is as big as barses and meletios put together he said but now his tone was doubtful are you really sure you can beat him of course im not sure but i think i have a chance do you want this banquet remembered for your sake or just as the time when the kubratoi bragged and got away with it hmm iakovitzes plucked at the waxed ends of his mustache as he thought with abrupt decision he got to his feet all right youll get your chance come onlets talk to petronas the sevastokrator turned around in his chair as iakovitzes and krispos came up behind him what is it he growled gleb and beshev had taken the joy out of the evening for him i have here lord a man who if you call on him would wrestle with this famous iakovitzes loaded the word with scorn kubrati for his boasting is a great disgrace to us videssians it would grow even worse if he returned to kubrat unbeaten that is true enough the kubratoi are quite full of false pretensions as it is petronas said he studied krispos with an officers experienced eye maybe just maybe he said to himself and slowly rose he waited for silence then lifted his goblet above his head i drink to the courage of the bold krispos who will show beshev the folly of his insolence the silence held a moment longer then suddenly the hall of the nineteen couches was full of shouts krispos krispos hurrah for krispos kill the barbarian flatten him stomp him beat him to a pulp krispos the sound of his name loud in a hundred throats tingled through krispos veins like wine he felt strong enough to beat a dozen kubratoi at the same time let alone the one he was about to face he sent a challenging stare toward beshev the look the wrestler gave back was so cold and empty that it froze krispos excitement to beshev he was just another body to break without a word the kubrati got to his feet and began taking off his clothes krispos pulled his robe over his head and tossed it aside he took off his thin undertunic leaving himself in linen drawers and sandals he heard a woman sigh that made him smile as he unbuckled the sandals the smile faded when he glanced over at beshev he was taller than the kubrati but he saw his foe outweighed him and none of beshevs bulk was fat by the look of his huge hard muscles he might have been carved from stone petronas had been shouting orders while krispos and beshev stripped servants scurried to shove tables aside and clear an open space in the center of the hall of the nineteen couches the two wrestlers walked toward it krispos studied the way beshev moved he still did not seem quick hed better not be krispos thought or hell break my neck just like stylianos he went through his own private wrestling match to put that thought down fear could cost him the fight sure as his foes strength he took several deep breaths and concentrated on the feel of the cool slick marble under his feet slick he turned back to petronas highness could you have them strew some sand out there i wouldnt want this affair decided on a slip especially not if i make it he thought the sevastokrator looked a question at beshev who nodded at petronas command four servants hurried away both wrestlers stood around and waited until the men returned lugging two large tubs of sand they dumped it out and spread it about with brooms when they were done krispos and beshev took their places at opposite ends of the cleared space beshevs great hands opened and closed as he stared krispos folded his arms across his chest and stared back doing his best to look contemptuous are you both ready petronas asked loudly he swung down his arm wrestle the two men slid toward one another each crouched low with arms outstretched krispos feinted at beshevs leg the kubrati knocked his hand aside that first touch warned krispos beshev was as strong as he looked they circled eyes flicking to feet to hands and back to eyes again beshev sprang forward he knew what he was about nothing gave away the move before he made it all the same krispos ducked under his grasping hands and spun behind him he grabbed beshev by the waist and tried to throw him down beshev though was too squat and heavy to be thrown he seized krispos forearms then flung himself backward krispos twisted so they landed side by side instead of with beshev on top they grappled broke away from each other scrambled to their feet and grappled again beshev had an uncanny ability to slip holds every time krispos thought he was about to throw his foe the kubrati managed to break free it was almost as if his skin were oiled though it did not feel slick to krispos he shook his head baffled and frustrated beshev seemed to have tricks old idalkos had never heard of fortunately the hulking kubrati also found krispos difficult they stood panting and glaring at each other after a passage where beshev somehow escaped from a wristlock krispos knew hed set well and truly and where a moment later only a desperate jerk of his head kept beshev from gouging out an eye the brief rest let krispos notice the din that filled the hall of the nineteen couches while he fought the crowds yells had simply washed over him now he heard iakovitzes screaming for him to maim beshev heard petronas calls of encouragement heard dozens of people he did not know all crying out for him the shouts helped restore his spirits and made him eager once more no one shouted for beshev gleb and the other kubratoi stood at the edge of the cleared space and watched their man wrestle but they did not cheer him on glebs face was a mask of concentration his hands which he held in front of his chest twitched and wiggled as if with a life of their own somewhere long ago krispos had seen hands jerk like that he had no time to grope for the memorybeshev thundered down on him like an avalanche the kubrati needed no cheers to spur him on krispos dove to one side beshev snagged him by an ankle and hauled him back beshev was slow but once he got a grip that mattered less krispos kicked him in the ribs with his free leg beshev only grunted he did not let go and when krispos tried to lay hold of the kubratis arm his hands slid off it since krispos could not tear free he went with beshevs hold and let his foe pull him close he butted the kubrati under the chin beshevs head snapped back his grip slackened only for an instant but long enough to let krispos escape panting he scrambled to his feet beshev also rose he must have bitten his tongue blood ran into his beard from the corner of his mouth he scowled at krispos from just behind him so did gleb glebs hands were still twitching whose hands had writhed so krispos shifted his weight and remembered how it shifted at every step up on the hide platform during the ransom ceremony that had set him on the path to this moment on the platform with him had been iakovitzes pyrrhos omurtagand omurtags enaree when the shaman checked the quality of iakovitzes gold his hands had moved as glebs moved now so gleb was working some minor magic was he krispos lips skinned back from his teeth in a fierce grin he would have bet all the gold tanilis had given him that he knew just what kind no wonder he hadnt been able to get a decent hold on beshev all night long krispos stopped picking up a handful of the sand the servants had strewn about with a shout he rushed at beshev the kubrati sprang forward too but krispos was quicker he twisted past beshev and threw the sand full in glebs face gleb screeched and whirled away frantically knuckling his eyes sorry an accident krispos said grinning still he spun back toward beshev the brief look of surprise and dismay on his foes face told krispos his guess had been good then beshevs eyes grew cold once more even without sorcerous aid he remained large skilled and immensely strong the match still had a long way to go they grappled again krispos let out a whoop of glee now beshevs skin was just skinslick with sweat yes but not preternaturally so when krispos grabbed him he stayed grabbed and when he hooked his leg behind beshevs and pushed beshev went over it and down the kubrati was a wrestler though he tried to twist while falling as krispos had before krispos sprang onto his back beshev levered himself up on his great arms krispos jerked them out from under him beshev went down flat on the sandy floor he tried to get up again krispos seized a great hank of greasy hair and slammed beshevs face into the marble under the sand beshev groaned then made one more effort to rise krispos smashed him down again for stylianos he shouted beshev lay still krispos climbed wearily to his feet he felt the cheers of the crowd more than he heard them iakovitzes rushed up and kissed him half on the cheek half on the mouth he did not even mind something hit him in the heel he whirled in shockcould beshev want more he was sure hed battered the kubrati into unconsciousness but no beshev still had not moved instead a goldpiece lay by krispos foot a moment later another one kicked up sand close by pick em up fool iakovitzes hissed theyre throwing em for you krispos started to bend down then stopped was this how he wanted these nobles to remember him scrambling for their coins like a dog chasing a thrown stick he shook his head and straightened i fought for videssos not for gold he said the cheers got louder no one in the hall of the nineteen couches knew why krispos smiled so widely without the stake from tanilis he could never have afforded such a grand gesture he brushed at himself knocking off as much sand as he could im going to put my robe back on he said and walked out through the crowd men and women clasped his hands touched him on the arm and patted his back as he went by then they turned to jeer the kubrati envoys who came into the open space to drag away their fallen champion the world briefly disappeared as krispos pulled the robe on over his head when he could see again he found petronas standing in front of him he started to bow the sevastokrator raised a hand no formality needed not after so handsome a victory he said i hope you will not object if i choose to reward you krispos so long as he let amusement touch his eyes it is not in gold how could i refuse krispos said wouldnt that bewhat do they call itlese majesty no for i am not the avtokrator only his servant petronas said with a perfectly straight face but tell me how were you able to overthrow the savage kubrati who had beaten all our best he likely had some help from that gleb krispos explained how he knew or thought he knew what gleb had been up to he went on so i figured i would see how well beshev fought without him making those tiny little kubratistyle passes and the big fellow was a lot easier to handle after that petronas scowled gleb always fidgets that way when were dickering as well do you suppose hes trying to ensorcel me youd be able to guess that better than i could krispos said could it hurt though to have a wizard of your own there the next time you talk with him it could not hurt at all and i will do it petronas declared by the lord with the great and good mind i wondered why i said yes to some of those proposals the kubrati set before me now perhaps i know and now i have two reasons to reward you for you have done me two services this night i thank you krispos did bow this time and deeply as he straightened his face bore a sly grin and i thank you petronas started to answer then checked himself he gave krispos a long considering look so you have a working wit do you to go along with your strength thats worth knowing before krispos could reply the sevastokrator turned away from him and called to the servants wine wine for everyone and let no ones cup be empty the rest of the night we have a victory to celebrate and a victor to krispos the videssian lords and ladies rased goblets high to krispos krispos plied the currycomb with a rhythm that matched the dull pounding in his head the warm smelly stuffiness of the stables did nothing to help his hangover but for once he did not mind headache or sour stomach they reminded him that though he was back to the downtoearth routine of his job the night before had really happened not far away mavros whistled while he plied the shovel krispos laughed softly anything more downtoearth than shoveling horse manure was hard to image mavros he said the shovel paused what is it how come a fancy young noble like you doesnt mind mucking out the stables ive shoveled plenty here and back in my village with the goats and cows and sheep and pigs but i never enjoyed it to the ice with goats and cows and sheep and pigs these are horses mavros said as if that explained everything maybe it even did krispos thought iakovitzes didnt mind working up a sweat in the stables but krispos could not picture him having anything to do with a pigsty he shook his head to anyone farmbred like him livestock was livestock getting sentimental about it was a luxury he hadnt been able to afford such mostly pointless musing helped him get through the quarter of an hour he needed to finish bringing the coat of the mare he was working on to an even glow satisfied at last he patted her on the muzzle and went on to the next stall hed just started in when he head someone come into the stable krispos mavros gomaris called what krispos said curious iakovitzes steward hardly ever came back where the grooms labored the master wants the two of you right now gomaris said krispos looked at mavros they both shrugged beats working mavros said but i hope hell give me a few minutes to wash and change clothes he held his nose im not what you call presentable right now gomaris repeated well all right mavros said shrugging again on his floors be it as krispos followed gomaris up to the house he wondered what was going on something out of the ordinary obviously he didnt think he was in trouble not if iakovitzes wanted to see mavros too unlesshad iakovitzes learned more of his connection with tanilis or of what shed seen but how could he have here in the city when he hadnt in opsikion a grayhaired man krispos had not met was waiting with iakovitzes here they are eroulos in all their iakovitzes paused for an ostentatious sniff splendor he turned to his grooms eroulos is steward of the household of his imperial highness the sevastokrator petronas krispos bowed low excellent sir he murmured mavros bowed even lower how may we serve you eminent sir you will not serve me but rather the sevastokrator eroulos answered at once he was still straight and alert with the competent air krispos would have expected from one of petronas aides he went on his imperial highness promised you a reward for your courage last night krispos he has chosen to appoint you chief groom of his stables you mavros are bidden to come to the palaces as well out of the respect the sevastokrator bears for your mother while krispos and mavros gaped iakovitzes said gruffly you should both know i wouldnt permit such a raid on my staff from anyone less than petronas even from him i resent it thats a waste of time though what the sevastokrator wants he gets so go on and show him and his folk what kind of people come from this house that was iakovitzes to the core krispos thought as kind a farewell as the noble had in him mixed with bragging and selfpromotion then krispos stopped worrying about what suddenly seemed the past going to the household of the sevastokrator he felt like shouting he made himself stay calm could we have a little time to pack our belongings and bathe mavros added plaintively eroulos unbent enough to smile i expect so if i send a man for you tomorrow morning will that be all right yes eminent sir that would be fine excellent sir until tomorrow then eroulos rose bowed to iakovitzes always a pleasure to see you excellent sir he nodded to gomaris if you will be so kind as to show me out when eroulos had gone iakovitzes said i trust neither of you young gentlemen now having risen higher will forget whose house was his first in the city of course not krispos answered while mavros shook his head krispos heard something new in iakovitzes voice all at once his masteror rather he thought dizzily his former masterspoke to him as to a person of consequence instead of taking his obedience for granted iakovitzes never wasted respect where it was not needed that he gave it now was krispos surest sign of what eroulos visit meant the news of that visit had reached the grooms quarters by the time krispos and mavros got back there the other grooms waylaid them with a great jar of wine krispos did not start packing until late that night he finished quicklyhe did not have a lot to packand fell sideways across his bed you can throw that sack onto one of my horses if you like mavros said the next morning theyre loaded enough already thanks i can manage but for the spear hed brought to the city from his village everything krispos owned fit into a large knapsack he paced back and forth with the sack slung over his shoulder so where is this man of petronas probably in a tavern drinking his breakfast when youre the sevastokrators man who this side of the emperor is going to complain that youre late no one i suppose krispos kept pacing the promised servant did show up a little later may i carry that for you he asked pointing to krispos knapsack he seemed surprised when krispos turned him down with a shrug he said follow me then he led krispos and mavros through the plaza of palamas and into the palace quarter the palaces krispos discovered were a secret city unto themselves with rows of carefully planted trees screening buildings from one another he soon found himself in a part of the quarter he had never seen before whats that building over there the one by the cherry trees he asked nothing for the likes of you to worry aboutor me either come to that the fellow answered grinning thats the avtokrators private residence that is and his imperial majesty has his own imperial servants believe you me they think theyre bettern anyone else too of course he went on after a brief pause most of em are eunuchs so i suppose they have to have something to be proud of eunuchs krispos wet his lips hed seen eunuchs a few times here in the city plodding plumply about their errands they made him shiver more than once unbuttoning his fly or pulling up his robe to relieve himself hed thanked phos he was a whole man why eunuchs the sevastokrators man chuckled to hear such naivete for one thing they cant go plotting to make themselves avtokratorhaving no stones disbars em for another who better to trust to serve the emperors wife nobody i suppose what the servant said made sense all the same krispos fingered his thick dark curly beard gladder than glad he could grow it the servitor led mavros to a building not far from the emperors private chambers youll be quartered here with petronas other spatharioi find an empty suite and get yourself comfortable there so im to be a spatharios am i mavros said well there are spatharioi and then there are spatharioi if you know what i mean which sort does petronas have in mind for me to be useful or just decorative whichever sort you make yourself into i expect the servant answered ill tell you this though for whatever you think its worth petronas isnt ashamed to get his own hands dirty when he needs to good neither am i when mavros grinned he looked even younger than he really was and if you doubt me ask your eroulos how i smelled when he came to iakovitzes yesterday will i stay here too krispos asked eh no you come on with me petronas man said with a quick wave to mavros krispos obeyed the servant took him to one of the larger and more splendid buildings in the palace complex it made three sides of a square closely enclosing a yard full of closetrimmed shrubberies the grand courtroom the servant explained his imperial highness the sevastokrator lives here in the wing were going toward so he can be right at hand if anything comes up that he needs to deal with i see krispos said slowly anthimos residence on the other hand was well away from the courtroom petronas krispos decided missed very little then something else struck him he stopped wait are you saying the sevastokrator wants me to live here too thems the orders i have the servant gave an itsnotmyproblem shrug this is finer than i expected krispos said as petronas man led him to the grand courtroom he stopped the fellow again where are the stables if im going to be chief groom dont you think i should know how to get to my work maybe and then maybe not the servant looked him up and down hope you dont mind my saying it but you strike me as a trifle raw to be chief groom when some of the men in the stables have been there likely since before your father was born no doubt youre right but that doesnt mean i cant put my hand to it or would petronas want me to be a drone any more than he would mavros now the sevastokrators man stopped of his own accord he looked at krispos again this time thoughtfully mmm maybe not not if you dont care to be he told krispos how to get to the stables but first lets get you settled in here krispos could not argue with that the servant led him up a stairway a couple of armed guards in mail shirts leaned against the first doorway they passed this whole floor belongs to his imperial highness the servitor explained you want the next one up the story above the sevastokrators quarters was broken up into apartments by the spacing of the doors the one assigned to krispos was among the smallest all the same it had both a living room and a bedroom though he did not say so that enormously impressed krispos hed never had more than one room to himself before the apartment also boasted both a large bureau and a closet the storage space swallowed krispos knapsackworth of belongings he tossed his spear on the bed locked the door behind him and went down the stairs the bright sun outside made him blink he looked this way and that trying to get his bearings that long low brick building behind the stand of willows should have been the stables if hed understood petronas man he walked toward the building soon both sound and smell told him he was right the willows though had helped conceal the size of the stables they dwarfed iakovitzes and tanilis put together someone saw krispos coming and dashed into the building he nodded to himself he might have known that would happen by the time his feet crunched on the strawstrewn stable floor the grooms and farriers and boys were gathered and waiting for him he scanned their faces and saw resentment fear curiosity believe me he said my being here surprises me as much as it does you that won him a couple of smiles but most of the stable hands still stood quietly arms folded across their chests wanting to learn how he would go on he thought for a moment i didnt ask for this job it got handed to me so im going to do it the best way i can a good many of you know more about horses than i do i wouldnt think of saying you dont you all know more about the sevastokrators horses than i do i hope youll help me what if we dont care to growled one of the men a toughlooking fellow a few years older than krispos if you go on doing what youre supposed to do i dont mind krispos said that helps me too but if you try to make things hard for me on purpose i wont like itand neither will you he pointed to a bruise under one eye you must have heard why petronas took me into his service after beshev i think i can handle myself with just about anybody but i didnt come here to fight i will if i have to but i dont want to id sooner work now he waited to see how the stable hands would respond they muttered among themselves the toughlooking groom took a step toward him he set himself a smaller graybearded man put a hand on the grooms arm no hold on onorios he said he sounds fair enough lets find out if he means what he says onorios grunted all right stotzas since its you whos asking he scowled at krispos but what do you want to bet that inside a months time he doesnt bother setting foot in here hell collect the pay you deserve more and hell stay in the grand courtroom soaking up wine with the rest of that lot there ill take that bet onorios krispos said sharply at the end of a monthor two or three if youd ratherloser buys the winner all he can drink what do you say by the good god youre on onorios stuck out his hand krispos took it they squeezed until they both winced when they let go each of them opened and closed his fist several times to work the blood back in krispos said stotzas will you show me around please if the senior groom was willing not to despise him on sight he would do his best to stay on stotzas good side stotzas showed him the sevastokrators parade horse pretty isnt he too bad he couldnt catch a tortoise with a tenyard start then his war horse stay away from his hooveshes trained to lash out maybe you should start giving him apples so he gets to know you then the beasts petronas took hunting mares a couple of retired stallions and geldings upandcoming coltsso many animals in all that krispos knew he would not be able to remember every one by the time the tour was nearly done stotzas and krispos were at the far end of the stables well away from the other hands the graybeard gave krispos a sidelong look think you can handle it he asked his voice sly ill try what more can i say right now i only wish you could tell me about the people the same way you did about the horses stotzas shoulders shook after a moment krispos realized the groom was laughing ah so youre not just a young fool with more muscles than he needs i hoped you werent aye the peoplell drive you madder than the beasts any day but if you keep em happy and keep em tending to their jobs thingsll run smooth enough if you have that trick sonny youll do right well for yourself i hope i do krispos met stotzas eyes i hope youll help me too wont stand in your road anyhow stotzas said after a brief thoughtful pause any youngster who admits he dont know everything there is to know is worth taking a chance on you ask me and you handled onorios pretty well reckon hell be buying you wine a month from now instead of the other way round that he will krispos promised well lets head back stotzas said as they walked down the center aisle of the stable toward the knot of expectantly waiting hands the senior groom raised his voice a little to ask so what do you think we ought to do about that hunter with the sore shins youve been resting him you said and putting cold compresses on his legs krispos waited for stotzas nod then went on he doesnt look too bad if you keep up with what youre doing for a few more days then start exercising him on soft ground he should do all right neither of them let on that theyd quietly talked about the horses problem in front of its stall stotzas rubbed his chin nodded sagely good advice sir well take it i expect he turned to the crowd of stable hands hell do allies made life easier krispos thought for the next several weeks krispos spent most of his waking hours in the stables he learned more about horsemanship than hed ever known and more about the sometimes related art of guiding men as well when he collected his bet from onorios he made a point of also buying wine for the burly groom after they drank together onorios hurried to do whatever krispos needed and did it gladly stotzas said nothing but a glint of amusement showed in his eyes once in a while because he was working so hard krispos needed a while to notice how his life had changed since he moved to his apartment in the grand courtroom at iakovitzes hed been a servant here he had servants of his own his bed linen was always clean his clothes seemed to wash themselves as if by magic and reappear spotless in his closet he also learned that any small valuables he left out might disappear as if by magic he was glad hed hidden tanilis gift behind a piece of molding hed loosened every so often he would move the small cabinet hed put in front of the loose place and add more money to his store he lived frugally he was too busy to do anything else he was about to go to sleep one warm summer night when someone tapped on his door he scratched his head his acquaintance with the officials and courtiers who lived in the other apartments down this hall was nodding at best hed been at the stables too much to get to know them well who is it he called eroulos oh krispos had not seen petronas steward since the day he came to iakovitzes house for him after hastily throwing his tunic back on he unbarred the door come in no you come out with me eroulos said i am bidden to bring you downstairs to the sevastokrator his imperial highness is entertaining a guest he would like to have him meet you a guest youll see for yourself soon enough come along if you please krispos followed eroulos down the hall and down the stairs petronas guards gave the steward and him a thorough patting down at the doorway to the sevastokrators suite krispos let himself be searched without complaint after all he had never passed through this entrance before but he was surprised eroulos got the same treatment if petronas did not trust his own steward whom did he trust maybe no one krispos thought finally nodding the guards stood aside one of them opened the door eroulos waved krispos in ahead of him krispos had wondered how the sevastokrator lived what he saw reminded him of tanilis villa a mix of great wealth and quiet good taste an icon of phos arrested his eye respect for both the good god and the artist made him sketch the sunsign over his heart hed never seen phos portrayed with such perfectly mingled sternness and kindness eroulos followed his gaze that is the image they say after which the phos in the dome of the high temple is modeled the steward remarked i can well believe it krispos said even after hed walked by he had the uneasy feeling the god in the icon was still looking at him here we are eroulos said at length halting before a door inlaid with lacy vines of gold and ivory he tapped at it for a moment the two voices coming through it did not pause one was petronas the other sounded lighter younger eroulos tapped again all right all right petronas growled the steward swung the door open it moved silently on wellgreased hinges here is krispos your highness good the sevastokrator turned to the man sitting across a small table from him well nephew i suppose the argument can wait a few minutes before we pick it up again you wanted to see the fellow who overthrew the famous beshev and sent gleb back to kubrat less high and mighty than he came here this is krispos petronas nephew krispos bowed low before the younger man then went to his knees and down flat on his belly your majesty he whispered up up how can i shake your hand when youre lying there anthimos iii avtokrator of the videssians waited impatiently while krispos scrambled to his feet then he did as hed said giving krispos hand several enthusiastic pumps nothing could be more boring than listening to the kubratoi going on about how wonderful they are thanks to you we dont have to for a while i am in your debt which means of course that all videssos is in your debt he cocked his head and grinned at krispos krispos found himself grinning back anthimos slightly lopsided smile was infectious thank you your majesty he said for the moment he was an awestruck peasant again no matter what tanilis might have foreseen a big part of him had never really imagined he would feel the emperors flesh pressing his own be close enough to smell wine on the emperors breath nephew you might want to present krispos with some tangible token of your gratitude petronas said smoothly what oh yes so i might here you are krispos he chuckled as he pulled a golden chain from around his neck and put it over krispos head i do apologize having the imperial treasury to play with im apt to forget that other people dont youre very generous your majesty krispos said feeling the weight of the metal on his shoulders a poor man could feed himself and his family for a long time with so much gold could he well i hope youre not a poor man krispos and that my uncle is doing a satisfactory job of feeding you krispos is making a valued place for himself here as chief groom petronas said he might have treated the post as a sinecure and the same gratitude you feel toward him nephew would have compelled me to let him retain it all the same but he has plunged in instead indeed his working with such diligence is the chief reason i have not been able to present him to you beforei seldom find him away from the stables good for him anthimos said a spot of work never hurt anyone krispos wondered what anthimos knew about workby the look of him not much though his features proclaimed him petronas close kin they lacked the hard purpose that informed the sevastokrators face that was not just youth either had anthimos been petronas age rather than krispos he still would have looked indolent krispos could not decide what to make of him hed never known anyone who could afford the luxury of indolence except tanilis and petronas and they did not indulge it petronas said wine krispos yes thank you the sevastokrator poured for him for me once more as well please anthimos said petronas handed him a cup as well he tossed the wine down and held out the cup for a refill petronas poured again and then again a moment later he took occasional sips from his own cup as did krispos they did not come close to emptying theirs the next time the avtokrator held out his cup to his uncle wine slopped over the rim and down onto his fingers when he pulled it back he licked them off sorry he said with a slightly unfocused smile no matter your majesty his uncle answered now if we may pick up the discussion in which we were engaged when krispos came in i still respectfully urge you to set your signature to the order i sent you last week for the construction of two new fortresses in the far southwest i dont know that i want to sign it anthimos stuck out his lower lip skombros says they probably wont ever be needed because the southwest is a very quiet frontier skombros petronas lost some of the air of urbanity krispos had always seen from him before he did not try to hide his contempt as he went on frankly i cant imagine why you even think of listening to your vestiarios on these matters what a eunuch chamberlain knows of the proper placement of fortresses would fit into the ballocks he does not have by the good god nephew youd be better advised asking krispos here what he thinks of the whole business at least hes seen more of the world than the inside of the palaces all right i will anthimos said what do you think of the whole business krispos me krispos almost spilled his own wine drinking with the sevastokrator and avtokrator made him feel proud and important getting into the middle of their argument was something else again something terrifying he was all too conscious of petronas gaze on him as he picked his words with the greatest of care in matters of war i think i would sooner rely on a warriors judgment do you recognize plain truth when you hear it anthimos petronas demanded the avtokrator rubbed his chin the tip of his beard was waxed to a point sounding faintly surprised he said yes that is sensible isnt it very well uncle ill sign your precious order you will excellent petronas sprang to his feet and slapped krispos on the back hard enough to stagger him theres another present youll have from me krispos and another one youve earned too your highness is very kind krispos said i reward good service petronas said dont forget that i also reward the other kind as it deserves dont forget that either now run along why dont you youll just be bored if you hang about longer good to meet you krispos anthimos said as krispos bowed his way out even half sozzled the avtokrator had a charming smile petronas voice came clearly through the door krispos closed behind him there you see anthimos that groom has a better notion of what needs doing than your precious vestiarios the sevastokrator paused his voice turned musing by phos so he does here ill show you out eroulos said krispos jumped he hadnt heard the steward come up behind him the emperor you didnt tell me you were taking me to see the emperor krispos said accusingly as eroulos took him past the guards i was told not to the sevastokrator wanted to see how you would react eroulos started up the stairs with krispos truly though you should not have been surprised petronas once ruled for the avtokrator and still ruleswith him krispos caught the tiny pause through him eroulos had started to say but a man discreet enough to be the sevastokrators steward was too discreet to say such things aloud something else turned krispos thoughts aside why did he want to see how id react i do not presume to speak for his imperial highness eroulos answered discreetly would you not think it wise though to learn what you can of the quality of men who serve you not least those you appoint to responsible posts on brief acquaintance that means me krispos realized by then he and eroulos were at his door he nodded thoughtfully as he went inside tanilis would have done the same sort of thing and if petronas thought like taniliskrispos could find no higher compliment to pay the sevastokrators wits tanilis would never have forgotten a promised reward nor did petronas more he gave it to krispos publicly coming to the stables to present him with a dagger whose hilt was lavishly chased with rubies for your quick thinking the other night he said in a voice that carried krispos bowed low you honor me highness out of the corner of his eye he saw onorios suddenly become very busy with his scissors as he trimmed a horses mane krispos smiled to himself you deserve it petronas said youre doing well here from all ive heard and from what ive seen of the condition of my animals its not all my doing you had fine horses and fine hands long before you ever noticed menot that im not grateful you did highness krispos added quickly im glad you noticed and also that you have the sense to share the credit i know i am not in the habit of employing fools and im increasingly pleased to discover i have not broken my rule with you petronas glanced into a stall smiled a little at what he saw and took a few paces to the next one come krispos walk with me of course highness as stotzas had a few weeks before the sevastokrator waited until he and krispos were out of earshot of most of the stable hands then he said tell me what you know of a body servants tasks highness the question caught krispos by surprise he answered slowly not much though come to think of it i guess youd say i was iakovitzes body servant for a while there in opsikion when he was laid up with a broken leg i sort of had to be so you did petronas agreed that may suffice indeed i think it would as here in the post i have in mind you would be involved in overseeing others as much as with actually serving what post is that krispos asked not your steward surely or are you angry at eroulos for something i dont know about if the sevastokrator was displeased with eroulos the gossip of his household had not heard of it that was possible krispos supposed but unlikely and petronas shook his head no eroulos suits me right well i was thinking of rather a grander place for you how would you like to be anthimos vestiarios one day krispos said the first thing that popped into his head doesnt the vestiarios have to be a eunuch he felt his testicles creep up toward his belly as he spoke the word he had all he could do to keep from shaping his hands into a protective cup over his crotch its usual but by no means mandatory i daresay we can manage to keep you entire petronas laughed then went on im sorry id not seen you look frightened before i want you to think on this though even if i cannot promise you the office soonor at all you cant promise highness krispos said startled at the admission how could you lack the power arent you both sevastokrator and the avtokrators uncle wouldnt he heed you in this perhaps not his chamberlain also has his ear you see and so may not be easily displaced petronas took a slow deep angry breath that cursed skombros is sly as a fox too he plots to weaken me and aggrandize his own worthless relations i would not be surprised to learn he dreams of putting one of them on the throne the more so as the avtokrators lady the empress dara has yet to conceive and so you want anthimos to have a vestiarios loyal to you and without schemes of his own krispos said now i understand yes exactly so petronas said thank you for your trust in me i place no great trust in any man the sevastokrator answered but in this i do trust that having raised you i can cast you down at need do you understand that as well krispos his voice though still quiet had gone hard as stone very well highness good i think the best way to do thisif as i say it can be done at allis to place you in anthimos eye from time to time you seem to think clearly and to be able to put your thoughts into words that although they lack polish carry the ring of conviction living as he does among eunuchs the avtokrator is unused to plain ideas plainly stated save perhaps from me they may prove an exotic novelty and anthimos is ever one to be drawn to the new and exotic should he wish to see more of you and then more againwell that is as the good god wills petronas set a large heavy hand on krispos shoulder shall we try is it a bargain aye highness it is krispos said good petronas repeated we shall see what we shall see he turned and tramped back toward the stable entrance without a backward glance more slowly krispos came after him so the sevastokrator expected him to remain a pliant creature did he even after becoming vestiarios krispos had said he understood that hed said nothing about agreeing with it viii the hunters ambled along on their horses laughing and chatting and passing wineskins back and forth they sighed with relief as they rode under a stand of trees that shielded them from the pounding summer sun wholl give us a song anthimos called out krispos thought of a tune hed known back in his village there was a young pig who got caught in a fence he began a silly young pig without any sense if the pig had no sense neither did the men who tried various unlikely ways of getting it loose when he was through the young nobles who filled the hunting party gave him a cheer the song was new to them theyd never had to worry about pigs themselves krispos knew he was no great minstrel but he could carry a tune past that no one much cared the wineskins had gone back and forth a good many times one of the nobles cast a glance at the sun which was well past noon lets head back to the city majesty weve not caught much today and weve not much time to catch more no we havent anthimos agreed petulantly ill have to speak to my uncle about that this park was supposed to have been restocked with game krispos mention it to him when we return i will majesty but krispos was willing to believe it had been restocked the way the avtokrator and his companions rode thundering through woods and meadow no animals in their right minds would have come within miles of them grumbling still anthimos swung his horses head toward the west the rest of the hunters followed they grumbled too and loudly when they rode back out into the sunshine all at once the grumbles turned to shouts of delighta stag sprang out of the brush almost in front of the hunters faces and darted across the grass after him anthimos yelled he dug spurs into his horses flank someone loosed an arrow that flew nowhere near the fleeing stag none of the huntersnot even krispos who should have paused to wonderbothered to ask himself why the stag had burst from cover so close to them they were young enough and maybe drunk enough to think of it as the perfect ending the day deserved they were altogether off guard then when the pack of wolves that had been chasing the stag ran onto the meadow right under their horses hooves the horses screamed some of the men screamed too as their mounts leaped and reared and bucked and did their best to throw them off the wolves yelped and snarled theyd been intent on their quarry and were at least as taken aback as the hunters by the sudden encounter the stag bounded into the woods and vanished maybe only krispos saw the stag go his mount was a sturdy gelding fast enough and strong enough but with no pretense to fine breeding thus he was in the rear of the hunters pack when they encountered the wolves and on a beast that did not have to be coaxed out of hysteria if a leaf blew past its nose no one of course rode a higherbred horse than anthimos iakovitzes could not have thrown a finer fit than that animal did anthimos was a fine rider but fine riders fall too he landed heavily and lay on the ground stunned some of the other hunters cried out in alarm but most were too busy trying to control their own mounts and fight off the wolves that snapped at their horses legs and bellies and hindquarters to come to the emperors aid a big wolf padded toward him it drew back for a moment when he groaned and stirred then came forward again its tongue lolled from its mouth red as blood ah crippled prey that lupine smile seemed to say easy meat krispos shouted at the wolf in the din the shout was one among many he had a bow but did not trust it he was no horsearcher he drew out an arrow and shot anyway in a romance his need would have made the shaft fly straight and true he missed he came closer to hitting anthimos than the wolf cursing he grabbed the mace that swung from his belt for finishing off large gamein the unlikely event he ever killed any he thought disgusted with himself for his poor shooting he hurled the mace with all his strength it spun through the air the throw was not what hed hoped eitherin his mind hed seen the spiky knob smashing in the wolfs skull instead the wooden handle struck it a stinging blow on the nose that sufficed the wolf yelped in startled pain and sat back on its haunches before it worked up the nerve to advance on the avtokrator again another hunter managed to get his horse between it and anthimos ironshod hooves flashed near its face it snarled and ran off someone who was a better archer than krispos drove an arrow into another wolfs belly the wounded animals howls of pain made more of the pack take to their heels a couple of wolves got all the way round the hunters and picked up the stags scent again they loped after it as far as krispos was concerned they were welcome to it the hunters leaped off their horses and crowded round the fallen emperor they all yelled when after a minute or two he managed to sit rubbing his shoulder he said i take it back this preserve has quite enough game already even the avtokrators feeblest jokes won laughter are you all right your majesty krispos asked along with everyone else let me find out anthimos climbed to his feet his grin was shaky all in one piece i didnt think i would be not unless that cursed wolf was big enough to swallow me whole it looked to have the mouth for the job he tried to bend down grunted and clutched his ribs have to be careful there a second more cautious try succeeded when he straightened again he was holding the mace whose is this krispos had to give his fellow hunters credit hed thought some readyforaught would speak up at once and claim hed saved the avtokrator instead they all looked at one another and waited er its mine krispos said after a moment here let me give it back to you then anthimos said believe me i wont forget where it came from krispos nodded that was an answer petronas might have given if the avtokrator had some of the same stuff in him as the sevastokrator videssos might fare well even if something befell anthimos capable uncle lets head back toward the city anthimos said this time i really mean it one of the young nobles had recaptured the emperors horse he grimaced as he got into the saddle but rode well enough all the same the hunting party remained unusually subdued even when they were back inside the palace quarter they all knew theyd had a brush with disaster krispos tried to imagine what petronas would have done if theyd come back with the news that anthimos had got himself killed in some fribbling hunting accident of course the accident would have made the sevastokrator emperor of videssos but it would also have raised suspicions that it was no accident that petronas had somehow arranged it under such circumstances would the sevastokrator be better off rewarding the witnesses who established his own innocence or punishing them to show they should have protected anthimos better krispos found himself unsure of the answer and glad he did not have to find out as the hunting band broke up a noble leaned over to krispos and said quietly i think id give a couple of inches off my prong to have saved the avtokrator the way you did krispos looked the fellow over he was scarcely out of his teens yet he rode a fine horse that he surely owned unlike krispos borrowed gelding his shirt was silk his riding breeches fine leather and his spurs silver his round plump face said hed never known a days hunger even if he hadnt saved anthimos he was assured a more than comfortable life i mean no disrespect excellent sir but im not sure the price you name is high enough krispos answered after a moments pause i need the luck more than you do you see having started with so much less of it now if youll excuse me i have to get back to my masters stables the noble stared after him as he rode away he suspectedno he was certainhe should have held his tongue he was already far better at that than most men his age now he saw he would have to grow better still so when does the most holy gnatios set the crown on your head mavros asked when he saw krispos coming out of petronas stables a couple of days after the hunt oh shut up krispos told his adopted brother he was not worried about mavros betraying him he just wanted him off his back mavros teasing was the most natural thing in the world though krispos hadnt bragged about what hed done the story was all over the palaces shut up this humble spatharios hears and obeys glad only that your magnificence has deigned to grant him to boon of words mavros swept off his hat and folded himself like a clasp knife in an extravagant bow krispos wanted to hit him he found himself laughing instead humble my left one he snorted mavros had trouble taking anything seriously after a while so did anyone who came near him your left one would look very fine in a dish of umbles mavros said someone ought to run a currycomb over your tongue krispos told him is this another of your innovations in equestrian care mavros stuck out the organ in question and crossed his eyes to look down at it yes it does seem in need of grooming go ahead see if you can put a nice sheen on its coat krispos did hit him then not too hard they scuffled goodnaturedly for a couple of minutes krispos finally got a hammerlock on mavros mavros was whimpering without much conviction when eroulos came up to the two of them if youre quite finished the steward said pointedly what is it krispos let go of mavros who somehow contrived to look innocent and rub his wrist at the same time the theatrics were wasted eroulos took no notice of him he spoke to krispos instead go back to the grand courtroom at once one of his imperial majestys servants is waiting for you there for me krispos squeaked i am not in the habit of repeating myself eroulos said krispos waited no longer he dashed for the grand courtroom mavros might have waved goodbye krispos did not turn his head to see the guards outside petronas wing of the grand courtroom swung down their spears when they saw someone running toward them recognizing krispos they relaxed one of them pointed to a man leaning against the side of the building heres the fellow been waiting for you you are krispos anthimos servitor was tall thin and erect but his hairless cheeks and sexless voice proclaimed him a eunuch i was given to understand that you were the sevastokrators chief groom not that you would stink of horses yourself his own scent was of attar of roses i work krispos said shortly the eunuchs sniff told what he thought of that in any event i am commanded to bid you come to a festivity his imperial majesty will hold tomorrow evening i shall return then to guide you i most respectfully suggest that no matter how virtuous you deem your labors the odor of the stables would be out of place krispos felt his cheeks heat biting back an angry retort he nodded the eunuchs bow was fluid perfection or would have been had he not made it so deep as to suggest scorn rather than courtesy you dont want to get into a meanerthanthou contest with a eunuch one of the guards remarked after the avtokrators servant was too far away to hear youll regret it every time youd be mean too if youd had that done to you another guard said all the troopers chuckled krispos also smiled but he thought the guard was right having lost so much eunuchs could hardly be blamed for getting their own back in whatever petty ways they could devise he knocked off a little early the next afternoon to go from the stables to a bathhouse he would not give that supercilious eunuch another chance to sneer at him he oiled himself scraped his skin with a curved strigil and paid a boy a copper to get the places he could not reach the cold plunge and hot soak that followed left him clean and helped loosen tired tight muscles he was all but purring as he walked back to the grand courtroom this time he waited for the avtokrators eunuch to arrive the eunuch gave a disapproving sniff perhaps krispos thought he was seeking the lingering aroma of horse come along he said sounding no happier for failing to find it krispos had never been tohad never even seenthe small building to which his guide led him he was not surprised the palace quarter held dozens of buildings large and small hed never been to some of the large ones were barracks for the regiments of imperial guards some of the small ones held soldierly supplies others were buildings former emperors had used but that now stood empty awaiting the pleasure of an avtokrator yet to come this one secluded among willows and pear trees looked to be where anthimos himself awaited pleasure krispos heard the music when he was still walking the winding path under the trees whoever was playing he thought had more enthusiasm than skill raucous voices accompanied the musicians he needed a moment to recognize the tavern song they were roaring out only when they came to the refrainthe wine gets drunk but you get drunker was he sure loud applause followed they seem to have started already he remarked the eunuch shrugged its early yet theyll still have their clothes on most of them oh krispos wondered whether he meant most of the revelers or most of their clothes he supposed it was about the same either way by then they were at the door a squad of guardsmen stood just outside big blond haloga mercenaries with axes an amphora of wine almost as tall as they were stood beside them its pointed end rammed into the ground one of them saw krispos looking at it the northerners wide foolish grin said hed already made use of the dipper that stuck out of the jug and his drawling haloga accent was not the only thing that thickened his speech a good duty here yes it is krispos wondered what petronas would do if he caught one of his own guards drunk on duty nothing pleasant he was certain then the eunuch took him inside and all such musings were swept away its krispos anthimos exclaimed he set down the flute hed been playingno wonder the music sounded ragged krispos thoughtand rushed up to embrace the newcomer lets have a cheer for krispos everyone obediently cheered krispos recognized some of the young nobles with whom hed hunted and a few people who had been at some of the wilder feasts hed gone to with iakovitzes most of the folk here though were strange to him and by the look of some of them he would have been as glad to have them stay so torches of spicysmelling sandalwood lit the chamber it was strewn with lilies and violets roses and hyacinths which added their sweet scents to the air many of the emperors guests were also drenched in perfume krispos admitted to himself that his eunuch guide had been rightthe odor of horse did not belong here help yourself to anything anthimos said later you can help yourself to anybody krispos laughed nervously though he did not think the avtokrator was joking he took a cup of wine and a puffy pastry that proved to be stuffed with forcemeat of lobster as petronas had in the hall of the nineteen couches a noble rose to give a toast he had to wait a good deal longer for quiet than the sevastokrator had getting some at last he called heres to krispos who saved his majesty and saved our fun with him this time the cheers were louder no one here krispos thought would be able to revel like this without anthimos largess had the wolf killed anthimos petronas would surely have taken the throne for himself after that most of the people here tonight would have counted themselves lucky not to be whipped out of the city anthimos set down his golden cup what goes in must come out he declared he picked up a chamber pot and turned his back on his guests the chamber pot was also gold decorated with fancy enamelwork krispos wondered how many like it the avtokrator had for golden chamber pots he thought hed been taxed off his land the notion should have made him furious it did anger him but less than he would have thought possible he tried to figure out why at last he decided that anthimos just was not the sort pf young man who inspired fury all he wanted to do was enjoy himself a very pretty girl put her hand on krispos chest do you want to she asked and waved to a mountain of pillows piled against one wall he stared at her she was worth staring at her green silk gown was modestly cut but thinned to transparency in startling places but that was not why he gaped his rustic standards had taken a beating since he came to videssos several times hed gone off with female entertainers after a feast and once with the bored wife of one of the other guests but in front of everyone he blurted she laughed at him youre a new one here arent you she left without even giving him a chance to answer he took another cup of wine and drank it quickly to calm his shaken nerves before long a couple did avail themselves of the pillows krispos found himself watching without having intended to he tore his gaze away a moment later he found his eyes sliding that way again annoyed at himself he turned his back on the whole wall most of the revelers took no special notice of the entwined pair by the way they went on about their business theyd seen such displays often enough not to find them out of the ordinary a few offered suggestions one made the man pause in what he was doing long enough to say try that yourself if youre so keen on it i did once and i hurt my back then he fell to once more matteroffact as if he were laying bricks not far from anthimos sat one who did nothing but watch the sportive couple the robes he wore were as rich as the avtokrators and probably cost a good deal more for they needed to be larger to cover his bulk his smooth beardless face let krispos count his chins another eunuch he thought and then well let him watchits probably as close as he can come to the real thing some of the entertainment was more nearly conventional real musicians took up the instruments anthimos and his cronies had set down acrobats bounced among the guests and sometimes sprang over them the only thing remarkable about the jugglers aside from their skill was that they were all women all lovely and all bare or nearly so krispos admired the aplomb one of them showed when a man came up behind her and fondled her breast the stream of fruit she kept in the air never wavereduntil a very ripe peach landed splat on the fellows head he swore and raised a fist to her but the storm of laughter in the room made him lower it again his dripping face like thunder zotikos draws the first chance of the evening anthimos said loudly more laughter came krispos joined in though he wasnt quite sure what the avtokrator meant anthimos went on here skombros go ahead and give him a real one the eunuch who had stared so avidly at the couple making love now rose from his seat so this was petronas rival krispos thought skombros walked over to a table and picked up a crystal bowl full of little golden balls with great dignity he carried it over to zotikos who was trying to comb peach fragments out of his hair and beard krispos watched curiously zotikos took one of the balls from the bowl he twisted it between his hands it came open he snatched out the little strip of parchment inside when he scanned it his face fell skombros delicately plucked the parchment from his fingers the eunuchs voice was loud clear and musical as a middlerange horns as he read what was written there ten dead dogs more howls of laughter and some out and out howls servants brought zotikos the dead animals and dropped them at his feet he stared at them at skombros and at the barebreasted juggler who had started his humiliation for the evening then cursing he stormed out of the hall a chorus of yips pursued him and sped him on his way by the time he got to the door he was running he didnt seem to want his chance what a pity anthimos said the emperors smile was not altogether pleasant lets let someone else have a go i know how about krispos anger filled krispos as skombros approached was this his reward for rescuing anthimosa chance to be one of the butts for the avtokrators jokes he wanted to kick the crystal bowl out of skombros hands instead grimfaced he drew out a ball and opened it the parchment inside was folded skombros watched cool and contemptuous as krispos fumbled with it do you read groom he asked not bothering to keep his voice down i read eunuch krispos snapped nothing whatever changed in skombros face but krispos knew he had made an enemy he finally got the parchment open ten his voice suddenly broke as if he were a boy ten pounds of silver how fortunate of you skombros said tonelessly anthimos rushed up and planted a winesoaked kiss on krispos cheek good for you he exclaimed i was hoping youd get a good one krispos hadnt known there were any good ones he stood still dazed as a servant brought him a fat jingling sack only when he felt the weight of it in his hands did he believe the money was for him ten pounds of silver was close to half a pound of gold thirty goldpieces he worked out after a little thought to tanilis a pound and a half of gold goldpieceshad been enough to set up krispos as a man with some small wealth of his own to anthimos thirty goldpiecesand belike three hundred or three thousandwas a party favor for the first time krispos understood the difference between the riches tanilis broad estates yielded and those available to a man with the whole empire as his estates no wonder anthimos thought nothing of a chamber pot made of gold a couple of more chances were given out one man found himself the proud possessor of ten pounds of feathersa much larger sack than krispos another got ten free sessions at a fancy brothel you mean i have to pay if i want to go back a second night the braggart asked whereupon the fellow who had won the feathers poured them over his head ten pounds of feathers let loose seemed plenty to fill up the room people flung them about as if they were snow servants did their best to get rid of the blizzard of fluff but even their best took a while to do any good while most of the servitors plied brooms and pillowcases a few brought in the next courses of food anthimos pulled a last bit of down from his beard and let it float away he looked over toward the new trays ah beefribs in fish sauce and garlic he said my chef does them wonderfully well theyre far from a neat dish but oh so tasty the ribs would be anything but neat krispos thought as he walked toward themthey were fairly swimming in the pungent fermented fish saucebut they did smell good one of the men with whom hed hunted got to them first the fellow picked up a rib and took a big bite the rib vanished the young nobles teeth came together with a loud click hed drunk enough wine that he stared foolishly at his dripping but otherwise empty hand then his gaze swung to krispos i did have one didnt i he sounded anything but sure i certainly thought you did krispos said here let me try he took a rib off the tray it felt solid and meaty in his hand he lifted it to his mouth as soon as he tried to bite it it disappeared some of the people watching made phos sunsign others wiser in the ways of anthimos feasts looked to the avtokrator a smallboy grin was on his face i told the cooks to make them rare but not so rare as that he said i suppose youre going to say you told them to get the plaster goose livers you served last time well done someone called out half a dozen of my friends broke teeth on those livers the emperor said this is a safer joke skombros thought of it the eunuch looked smug and also pleased that krispos had been one of the people his trick had deceived krispos stuck his fingers in his mouth to clean them of fish sauce and juice from the ribs what he was able to taste was delicious he thought how unfair it was for some sneaky bit of sorcery to deprive him of the tender meat he picked up another rib some people skombros announced to no one in particular have more stubbornness than sense the vestiarios settled back in his chair perfectly content to let krispos make as thorough a fool of himself as he wanted this time though krispos did not try to take a bite off the rib hed already seen that doing that did not workbringing his jaws together seemed to activate the spell instead he picked up a knife from the serving table and sliced a long strip of meat off each side of the bone he raised one of the strips to his mouth if the meat vanished despite his preparations he knew he was going to look foolish he bit into it then grinned as he started to chew hed hoped cutting it off the bone would sever the spell that made it disappear slowly and deliberately he ate all the meat hed sliced away then he dealt with another rib put the meat hed carved from it on a small plate and carried the plate to anthimos would you like some your majesty you were right they are very tasty thank you krispos dont mind if i do anthimos ate then wiped his fingers so they are krispos asked do you think your esteemed eunuchs had a special set of honorifics that applied to them alone vestiarios would care for some the avtokrator glanced over to skombros who stared back stonily anthimos laughed no hes a good fellow but he has plenty of meat on his bones already krispos shrugged bowed and walked away as if the matter were of no importance he could not think of a better way to twist the knife in skombros huge belly after krispos showed how to eat the ribs they vanished into the revelers rather than into thin air servants took away the trays a new set of minstrels circulated through the crowd another erotic troupe followed them then a group of dancers replaced the horizontal cavorters all the acts did what they did very well krispos smiled to himself anthimos could afford the best skombros strode through the hall every so often with his crystal bowl of chances he came nowhere near krispos a noble who won ten pounds of gold took his stroke of luck with enough equanimity to make krispos sure he was already rich anthimos confirmed that saying more money for slow horses and fast women eh sphrantzes fast horses i hope majesty sphrantzes said amid general laughter why should you change now the avtokrator asked sphrantzes spread his hands as if to admit defeat someone else chose ten peacocks for himself krispos wondered what peacock tasted like but the birds the servants chivvied out were very much alive they honked and squawked and spread their gorgeous tails and generally made nuisances of themselves what do i do with them wailed the winner who had one bird under each arm and was chasing a third i havent the foggiest notion anthimos replied with a blithe wave of his hand thats why i put that chance in thereto find out the man ended up departing with his two birds in the hand and forgetting about the rest after some commotion revelers entertainers and servants joined in shooing the other eight peacocks out the door let the halogai worry about them somebody said which struck krispos as a good enough idea once the peacocks departedshouts from outside said the imperial guards were having their own troubles with the badtempered birdsthe feast grew almost calm for a little while as if everyone needed some time to catch his breath well how is he going to top that krispos said to the man next to him they were standing by a bowl of sweetened gelatin and candied fruit but neither felt like eating the gelatin had peacock tracks i dont know the fellow answered but i expect hell manage krispos shook his head then skombros went round with his bowl again he stopped in front of the young man whose beef rib had vanished would you care for a chance excellent pagras huh by now pagras needed a moment to come out of his winesoaked haze he fumbled while he was getting the ball out of the bowl and fumbled more in getting it open he read the parchment krispos saw his lips move but instead of announcing what chance hed chosen he turned to anthimos and said i dont believe it dont believe what pagras the emperor asked ten thousand fleas pagras said looking at the parchment again not even youd be crazy enough to get together ten thousand fleas at any other time the noble might have lost his tongue for using it so freely anthimos though was drunk too and as usual a friendly drunk so you doubt me eh was all he said he pointed to the doorway from which a servant emerged with a large alabaster jar behold ten thousand fleas dont see any fleas all i see is a damn jar pagras lurched over to the servant and snatched it out of his hands he yanked off the lid and stared down into the jar for several horrified seconds if you plan on counting them pagras youd better do it faster anthimos said pagras did not count fleas he tried to clap the lid back on but the jar slipped through his clumsy fingers and smashed on the marble floor krispos thought of a goodsized pile of ground black pepper but this pile moved and spread without any breeze to stir it a man yelled a woman squealed and clapped a hand to the back of her leg the revel broke up very quickly after that krispos spent the next morning scratching working as he did in the stables he got fleabites fairly often but never so many all at once as after anthimos feast and hed been one of the lucky ones not too close to the broken jar and not too far from the door he wondered what poor pagras looked likeraw meat probably petronas surprised him by dropping by not long before noon a glance from the sevastokrator sent stable hands scurrying out of earshot i understand my nephew had things hopping last night petronas said thats one way to put it yes highness krispos said petronas allowed himself a brief snort of laughter before turning serious once more what did you think of the evenings festivities he asked ive never seen anything like them krispos said truthfully petronas waited without saying anything seeing something more was expected of him krispos went on his imperial majesty knows how to have a good time i enjoyed myself up till the fleas good somethings wrong with a man who cant enjoy himself still i see youre here at work in the morning too petronas smile was twisted aye anthimos knows how to have a good time i sometimes think its all he does know but never mind that for now i hear you also put a spike in skombros wheel it wasnt so much krispos explained how hed got round the spell on the disappearing ribs id like to set a spell on skombros that would make him disappear the sevastokrator said but making the fat maggot look foolish is even better than showing that hes wrong the way you did a few weeks ago the worse he seems to my nephew the sooner he wont be vestiarios any more and when hes notanthimos heeds whichever ear is spoken into last things would go smoother if he heard the same thing with both of them your voice in other words krispos said petronas nodded krispos considered before he went on i dont see any large troubles there highness from everything ive seen youre a man of good sense if i thought you were wrong yes tell me what you would do if you thought i was wrong petronas interrupted tell me what you would do if you a peasant from the back of beyond jumped to head groom here only by my kindness would do if you thought that i a noble who has been general and statesman longer than youve been alive was wrong tell me that most precisely krispos refusing to show he was daunted had taken krispos a long way with iakovitzes and tanilis holding that bold front against petronas was harder the weight of the sevastokrators office and the force of his own person fell on krispos shoulders like heavy stones almost he bent beneath them but at the last moment he found an answer that kept his pride and might not bring petronas wrath down upon him if i thought you were wrong highness i would tell you first in private if i could you once told me anthimos never hears any plain speaking do you truth to tell i wonder petronas gave that snort again very well there is something to what you say any officer who does not point out what he sees as error to his commander is derelict in duty but one who disobeys after his commander makes up his mind i understand krispos said quickly see that you do lad see that you do and one day before too long maybe youll stop smelling of horse manure and take on the scents of perfumes and powders instead what do you say to that its the best reason ive heard yet for wanting to stay in the stables this time petronas laughter came loud and booming you were born a peasant werent you well see if we cant make a vestiarios of you all the same krispos hunted with the avtokrator went to chariot races at the amphitheater in the boxes reserved for anthimos close comrades and attended the feasts to which he was invited as summer moved toward fall the invitations came more often he always found himself among the earliest to leave the nightlong revels but he was one of the few at them who took their day work seriously anthimos certainly did not in all the time krispos saw him he gave scant heed to affairs of state depending on who had been at him last he would say go see my uncle or ask skombros about thatcant you see im busy whenever a finance minister or diplomat did gain access to him and tried to get him to attend to business once when a customs agent waylaid him outside the amphitheater with a technical problem he turned to krispos and asked how would you deal with that let me hear the whole thing over again krispos said the customs man glad for any audience poured out his tale of woe when he was done krispos said if i follow you rightly youre saying that duties and road tolls at some border stations away from the sea or river transport should be lowered to increase trade through them thats exactly right excellentkrispos was it the customs agent said excitedly because moving goods by land is so much more expensive than by water many times they never go far from the sea lowering duties and road tolls would help counteract that krispos thought of the kalavrian merchants at develtos and of the motherofpearl for which they had charged outrageous prices he also thought of how seldom traders with even the most ordinary good had visited his village of how many things hed never seen till he came to videssos the city sounds good to me he said so ordered anthimos declared he took the parchment from which the customs agent had been citing figures and scrawled his signature at the bottom of it the bureaucrat departed with a glad cry anthimos rubbed his hands together pleased with himself there thats taken care of his cronies applauded along with the rest of them krispos accompanied the avtokrator to the next feast hed laid on he was troubled all through it problems like the one hed handled today should have been studied considered not attacked on the spur of the momentif they were attacked at all more often than not anthimos did not care to bother he disapproved of the emperor for his offhandedness about such concerns but had trouble disliking him anthimos would have made a fine innkeeper he thoughtthe young man had a gift for keeping everyone around him happy unfortunately being avtokrator of the videssians required rather more than that which did not stop krispos from enjoying himself immensely whenever he was in anthimos companythe emperor kept coming up with new ways to make his revels interesting he had a whole series of feasts built around colors one day everything was red the next yellow and the next blue at that last feast even the fish were cooked in blue sauce so they looked as if theyd come straight from the sea the avtokrators chances were never the same twice either remembering what had happened to pagras the poor fellow who picked for himself seventeen wasps did not dare open the jar that held them finally anthimos sounding for once most imperial had to order him to break the seal the wasps proved to be exquisite recreations in gold with emeralds for eyes and delicate filigree wings krispos rarely drew a chance skombros kept the crystal bowl and its hollow golden balls away from him that did not bother him he was just glad the vestiarios did not try slipping poison into his soup perhaps skombros feared petronas revenge in any case he made do with black looks from afar sometimes krispos returned them more often he pretended not to see which seemed to irk skombros more such byplay went straight by anthimos after a while though he did notice that krispos had not had his hand in the bowl for weeks go on over to him skombros he said one night lets see how his luck is doing his luck is good in that he enjoys your majestys favor skombros said nevertheless he took krispos the crystal bowl thrusting it almost into his face here groom thank you esteemed sir anyone who had not seen krispos and skombros before would have reckoned his tone perfectly respectful almost hidden by fat a muscle twitched near the eunuchs ear as he set his jaw krispos twisted open a gold ball this was anthimos day for the number fortythree the chances had already allotted fortythree goldpieces to one man fortythree yards of silk to another fortythree parsnips to a third fortythree pounds of lead krispos read laughter erupted around him what a pity skombros said just as if he meant it a puffing servant brought out the worthless prize the vestiarios went on i trust you will know what to do with it as a matter of fact i was thinking of giving it to you krispos said a token of esteem a crude joke but then i would have expected no more from you at last the eunuch let his scorn show no not at all esteemed sir krispos answered smoothly i just thought you would be used to carrying around the extra weight several people who heard krispos took a step or two away from him as if theyd just realized he carried a disease they might catch he frowned remembering his family and the all too real disease theyd taken skombros anger though might be as dangerous as cholera the vestiarios face was red but otherwise impassive as he deliberately turned his broad back on krispos anthimos had been too far away to hear skombros and krispos sniping at each other but the chamberlains gesture of contempt was unmistakable enough the two of you the avtokrator said enough i say i dont care to have two of my favorite people at odds and i will not tolerate it do you understand me yes your majesty krispos said majesty skombros said i promise i shall always give krispos all the credit he deserves excellent anthimos beamed krispos knew the eunuchs words had been no apology skombros would never think he deserved any credit but even skombros hatred did not trouble krispos not for the moment the emperor had called him and the vestiarios two of my favorite people while he loathed skombros for anthimos to mention him in the same breath with the longtime chamberlain was progress indeed slow and ponderous as a merchant ship under not enough sail skombros returned to his seat he sank into it with a sigh of relief his small heavily lidded eyes sought krispos krispos gave back a sunny smile and lifted his wine cup in salute without skombros rudeness he might have needed much longer to be sure how anthimos felt about him the eunuchs suspicious frown deepened krispos smile got wider mavros stamped snow from his boots warmer in here he said gratefully all these horses are almost as good as a fireplace better if you intend to go anyplace you cant ride a fireplace no and i cant fling you into a horse for your foolish jokes either however much i wish i could krispos answered was making that one the only reason you came if it was youve done your damage so goodbye harumph mavros drew himself up a caricature of offended dignity just for that i will go and keep my news to myself he made as if to leave krispos and several stable hands quickly called him back what news krispos said even here in videssos the city at the empire of videssos heart news came slowly in winter and was always welcome everyone whod heard mavros hurried over to find out what hed dug up for one thing he said pleased at the size of his audience that band of haloga mercenaries under harvas blackroberemember krispos we heard about them last winter back in opsikionhas plundered its way straight across thatagush and out onto the pardrayan steppe itll plunder its way right on back then stotzas predicted the steppe nomads dont have much worth stealing who cares what happens in thatagush anyway someone else said its too far away to matter to anybody several other people spoke up in agreement though he did not argue out loud krispos shook his head having known only his own village for so long he found he wanted to learn everything he could about the wider world my other bit of gossip you already know krispos if you were at his majestys feast the night before last mavros said krispos shook his head again this time more emphatically no i missed that one every so often i feel the need to sleep youll never succeed till you learn to rise above such weaknesses mavros said with an airy wave of his hand well this also has to do with a haloga or rather with a halogaina a haloga woman two or three stable hands said it together sudden keen interest in their voices the big blond northerners often came to videssos to trade or to hire on as mercenaries but they left their wives and daughters behind krispos tried to imagine what a halogaina would look like tell me more he said again his was not the only voice eyes the color of a summer sky i heard and the palest pink tips and her hair gilded above and below mavros said it would be wouldnt it krispos thought that hadnt occurred to him the stable hands murmured each painting his own picture in his mind mavros went on you could hardly blame anthimos for trying her on then and there the murmurs got louder i wouldnt blame him for keeping her for a week or a month or a year or onorios was all but panting he must have liked the picture his mind painted but krispos and mavros said no at the same time they glanced at each other krispos dipped his head to mavros who he knew was better with words his majesty mavros explained only sleeps with a pleasure girl once anything more he reckons would constitute infidelity to the empress that got the yowls and whoops krispos had known it would give me fidelity like that any day onorios said give it to me twice a day someone else said three times another groom added the lot of you remind me of the rich old man who married a young wife and promised to kill her with passion krispos said he had her once then fell asleep and snored all night long when he finally woke up she looked over at him and said good morning killer the stable hands hissed at him grinning he added besides if we spent all our time in bed wed never get anything done and phos knows theres plenty to do here the men hissed again but started drifting off toward their tasks not getting anything done doesnt seem to worry his majesty onorios said ah but he has people to do things for him unless you hired a servant while i wasnt looking you dont krispos said afraid not worse luck onorios sadly clicked his tongue and went back to work look at thisthis bloodsucking petronas slammed a fist down on the pile of parchments in front of him they were upside down to krispos but that did not matter because the sevastokrator was in full cry thirtysix hundred goldpiecesfifty pounds of goldthat cursed leech of a skombros has siphoned off for his worthless slug of a nephew askyltos and another twenty pounds for the worthless slugs stinking father evmolpos when i show these accounts to my nephew what do you think will happen krispos asked eagerly will he give skombros the sack but petronas rage collapsed into moroseness no hell just laugh curse it he already knows skombros is a thief he doesnt care what he wont see is that the skotosloving wretch is setting up his own relations as great men dynasties have died that way if his majesty doesnt care whether skombros steals why do you keep shoving accounts in his face krispos asked to make him care by phos before the fox he insists on thinking a lapdog sinks its teeth into him the sevastokrator heaved a sigh making anthimos care about anything save his own amusement is like pushing water uphill with a rake petronas loathing for his rival krispos thought blinded him to any way of dealing with skombros but the one that had already shown it did not work what would happen if skombros didnt amuse him or amused him in the wrong sort of way krispos asked what are you talking about petronas demanded crossly for a moment krispos had no idea himself one of the lessons he should have learned from tanilis was keeping his mouth shut when he had nothing to say he bent his head in humiliation humiliation he remembered how hed felt when he was just a youth when a couple of village wits lampooned his wrestling in a midwinters day skit how would anthimos like the whole city laughing at his vestiarios its only a couple of weeks to midwinters day after all what does that have to do with petronas suddenly caught up with krispos by the good god so it is so you want to make him look ridiculous do you why not he is the sevastokrators eyes lit up as soon as he saw his objective he planned how to reach it with a soldiers directness anthimos has charge of the amphitheater skits they entertain him so he pays attention to them all the same i expect i can slide a new one into the list without his noticing have to give it an innocuous title so that even if he does spot it he wont think anything of it have to find mimes who arent already engaged and costumescurse it can we get costumes made in time we have to figure out what the mimes are going to do too krispos pointed out aye thats true though phos knows theres plenty to say about the eunuch let me get mavros krispos said he has an ear for scandal does he petronas all but purred yes go fetch himat once now this mavros said is what i call an amphitheater he craned his neck to peer around and up only trouble is i feel like im at the bottom of a soup bowl full of people krispos answered fifty thousand seventy ninetyhe was not sure how many people the enormous oval held however many it was they were all here today no one wanted to miss the midwinters day festivity id sooner be at the bottom than the top mavros said who has better seats than we do they were in the very first row right by what was a racecourse most of the time but would serve as an openair stage today theres always the people on the spine krispos pointed to the raised area in the center of the track mavros snorted youre never satisfied are you the spine was reserved for the avtokrator the sevastokrator the patriarch and the chief ministers of the empire krispos saw skombros there not far from anthimos the vestiarios was conspicuous for his bulk and his beardless cheeks the only men on the spine who were not high lords or prelates were the axetoting halogai of the imperial guard mavros nodded toward them see they dont even get to sit down me id rather be comfortable here i suppose i would too krispos said even so hush theyre starting anthimos rose from his throne and strode over to a podium set in the very center of the spine he silently stood there waiting quiet spread through the amphitheater as more and more people saw him when all was still he spoke people of videssos today the sun turns in the sky again a trick of acoustics carried his voice clearly to the uppermost rows of the amphitheater from which he seemed hardly more than a brightcolored speck in his imperial robes he went on once more skotos has failed to drag us down into his eternal darkness let us thank phos the lord of the great and good mind for delivering us for another year and let us celebrate that deliverance the whole day long let joy pour forth unconfined the amphitheater erupted in cheers anthimos staggered as he walked back to his high seat krispos wondered if the acoustical trick worked in reverse if all the noise in the huge building focused where the emperor had stood that would be enough to stagger anyone on the other hand maybe anthimos had just started drinking at dawn here we go mavros breathed the first troupe of mimes a group of men dressed as monks emerged from the gate that normally let horses onto the track from the way one of themmade a point of holding his nose the horses were still much in evidence the monks proceeded to do a number of most unmonastic things the audience howled on midwinters day nothing was sacred krispos peered across the track to the spine to see how gnatios enjoyed watching his clerics lampooned the patriarch was paying the skit no attention at all he was leaning over to one side of his chair so he could talk with his cousin petronas he and the sevastokrator smiled at some private joke when the first mime troupe left another took its place this one tried to exaggerate the excesses at one of anthimos revels the people who filled the stands alternately gasped and whooped unlike his uncle and gnatios the emperor watched attentively and howled laughter krispos chuckled too not least because much of what the mimes thought wild enough to put in their act was milder than things hed really seen at anthimos feasts the next troupe came out in striped caftans and felt hats that looked like upsidedown buckets the makebelieve makuraners capered about the people in the stands jeered and hissed in his high seat on the spine petronas looked pleased with himself make the men from the west look like idiots and weaklings and everyone will be more willing to go to war with them mavros said he guffawed as one of the mimes pretended to relieve himself into his hat i suppose so krispos said but there are a fair number of people from makuran here in the city rugdealers and ivory merchants and such theyre just people half the folk in the amphitheater must have dealt with them at one time or another they know makuraners arent like this i daresay they do when they stop to think about it how many people do you know who always take the time to stop and think though not many krispos admitted a little sadly the pseudomakuraners fled in mock terror as the next troupe whose members were dressed as videssian soldiers came out that won a last laugh and a cheer at the same time the soldiers quickly proved no more heroic than the makuraners they replaced which to krispos way of thinking weakened the message petronas was trying to put across act followed act all competent some very funny indeed the city folk leaned back in their seats to enjoy the spectacle krispos enjoyed it too even while he wished the troupes were a little less polished back in his village a big part of the fun had lain in taking part in the skits and poking fun at the ones that went wrong here no one save professionals took part and nothing went wrong when he grumbled about that mavros said for hundreds of years emperors have been putting on spectacles and entertaining people in the capital to keep them from thinking up ways to get into mischief for themselves save for riots i dont think they know how to make their own entertainment any more he leaned forward see these dancers they come on just before that troupe the sevastokrator hired the dancers came on went off krispos paid scant attention to them he found he was pounding his fist on his thigh as he waited for the next company he made himself stop the mimes came onto the track a few at a time some were dressed as ordinary townsfolk others once more as imperial troops the townsfolk acted out chatting among themselves the troops marched back and forth out came a tall fellow wearing the imperial raiment the soldiers sprang to attention the civilians flopped down in comically overdone prostrations a dozen parasolbearers the proper imperial number followed the mime playing the avtokrator but it soon became obvious they were not attached to him but rather to the figure who emerged after him that man was in a fancy robe too but one padded out so that he looked even wider than he was tall a low murmur of laughter ran through the amphitheater as the audience recognized who he was supposed to be how much did we have to pay that mime to get him to shave his beard krispos asked he looks a lot more like skombros without it he held out for two goldpieces mavros answered i finally ended up paying him youre right its worth it aye it is you might also want to think about paying him for a holiday away from the city till his beard grows back again at least if he wants to live to work next midwinters day krispos said after a moments surprise mavros nodded up on the spine petronas sat at ease watching the mimes but still not seeming to pay any great attention to them krispos admired his coolness no one would have guessed by looking at him that hed had anything to do with this skit anthimos leaned forward to see better curiosity on his facewhatever hed been told about this troupes performance it was something different from this and skombrosskombros fleshy features were so still and hard they might have been carved from granite the mockanthimos on the track walked around receiving the plaudits of his subjects the parasolbearers stayed with the pseudoskombros who was also accompanied by a couple of disgusting hangerson one with gray hair the other with black the actors playing citizens lined up to pay their taxes to the emperor he collected a sack of coins from each one headed over to pay the soldiers at last the mimeskombros bestirred himself he intercepted anthimos patted him on the back put an arm around him and distracted him enough to whisk the sacks away the avtokrators befuddlement on discovering he had no money to give his troops won loud guffaws from the stands meanwhile the mime playing the vestiarios shared the sacks with his two slimy colleagues they fondled the money with lascivious abandonment almost as an afterthought the pseudoskombros went back to the emperor after another round of the hailfellowwellmet routine he had used before he charmed the crown off anthimos head the actor playing the emperor did not seem to notice it was gone skombros took the crown over to his blackhaired henchman tried it on him it was much too big it hid half the fellows face with a shrug as if to say not yet the vestiarios restored it to anthimos the amphitheater grew still during that last bit of business then far up in the stands someone shouted to the ice with skombros that one thin cry unleashed a torrent of abuse against the eunuch krispos and mavros looked at each other and grinned over on the spine petronas kept up his pose of indifference the real skombros sat very still refusing to notice any of the gibes hurled at him he had nerve krispos thought grudgingly then krispos eyes slid to the man for whom the skit had been put on the avtokrator of the videssians anthimos rubbed his chin and stared thoughtfully from the departing troupe of mimes to skombros and back again i hope he got it mavros said he got it krispos said he may be foolish but hes a long way from stupid i just hope he takes notice ofhey an apple flung by someone farther back in the crowd had caugnt krispos in the shoulder a cabbage whizzed by his head another apple thrown by someone with a mighty arm splashed not far from skombros seat dig up the vestiarios bones a woman screechedthe videssian call to riot in a moment the whole amphitheater was screaming it petronas stood and spoke to the commander of the haloga guards pale winter sun glittered on the northerners axeblades as they swung them up over their shoulders the halogai yelled together a deep wordless shout that cut through the cries from the stands like one of their axes cleaving flesh now for the interesting question mavros said will that hold them or will we have ourselves an uprising right now krispos gulped when he put his plan to petronas he hadnt thought of that getting rid of skombros was one thing pulling videssos the city down with the eunuch was something else again given the capitals volatile populace the chance was real the halogai shouted again the threat in their voices plain as the snarl of a wolf another troop of northerners axes at the ready tramped out onto the track from under the amphitheater there are enough people here to swamp them krispos said nervously i know mavros seemed to be enjoying himself but are there enough people here willing to get maimed doing it there werent insults continued to rain down on skombros but the missiles more tangible than insults stopped finally someone yelled get the soldiers off the track we want the mimes soon everyone took up the cry we want the mimes we want the mimes this time anthimos spoke to the haloga commander the warrior bowed at his command the northerners lowered their weapons the newly emerged band of imperial guards marched back through the gate from which they had come a moment later a fresh troupe of mimes replaced them cheers filled the amphitheater fickle buggers mavros said with a contemptuous jerk of his head half an hour from now half of them wont remember what they were screaming about maybe not krispos said but skombros will and so will anthimos that is the point isnt it mavros leaned back in his chair lets see what antics this new bunch has in em shall we the throne in the grand courtroom belonged to anthimos sitting in a raised chair in his own suite dressed in his full sevastokrators regalia petronas looked quite imperial enough krispos thought from his place at his masters left he looked around this room is different somehow he said ive screened off that part of it petronas pointed sure enough a wooden screen like the one that gave privacy to the imperial niche at the high temple was in place the openings in the woodwork were so small that krispos could not see what if anything lay behind it he asked why did you put the screen up lets just say youre not the only one who ever comes up with bright ideas the sevastokrator said krispos shrugged if petronas didnt feel like explaining he could hardly force him to eroulos came in and bowed to petronas his majesty and the vestiarios are here highness show them in by all means the sevastokrator said petronas efficient steward had already supplied anthimos and skombros with goblets the emperor lowered his to grin at krispos as he and petronas rose in greeting skombros face was somber had he been less practiced at schooling his features krispos judged he would have looked nervously from one of his foes to the other as it was his eyes flicked back and forth between them petronas welcomed him affably enough waved him to a seat beside anthimos which was even more splendid than the one in which petronas satthe sevastokrator did not believe in giving unintentional offense after eroulos refilled anthimos wine cup petronas said and what can i do for you today nephew and majesty anthimos sipped glanced from petronas to skombros licked his lips and took a hefty swig of wine thus fortified he said my vestiarios here would like to ah try to repair any illfeeling that may exist between the two of you may he speak you are my avtokrator petronas declared if it be your will that he speak to me of course i shall hear him with all the attention he merits he turned his head toward skombros and waited expectantly i thank you your imperial highness you are gracious to me skombros said his sexless voice soft and persuasive as i seem somehow to have offended your imperial highnessand that was never my intent for my concern as yours is solely for the comfort and especially for the glory of his imperial majesty whom we both servei thought it best at this time to offer my deepest and most sincere apologies for whatever i have done to disturb your imperial highness tranquility and to tender my assurances that any such disturbance was purely inadvertent on my part and shall not be repeated he paused to take a deep breath krispos did not blame him he could not have brought out such a long sentence to save his life he doubted whether he could have written one so complex petronas was more used to the grandiloquence of formal videssian speech nodding to the vestiarios he began esteemed sir from behind that newly installed screen a soft chorus of female voices chanted you have five chins and a lard belly below them krispos happened to be taking a sip of wine he all but choked on it but for the content of what that hidden chorus sang its response was much like that of a temple choir to the prayers of a priest skombros sat perfectly still but could not help the flush that rose from his neck to the roots of his hair anthimos looked about in surprise as if unsure where the chorus was or whether hed truly heard it and petronas seemed to shake himself im sorry he told skombros i must have been woolgathering what was it you wanted the vestiarios tried again your imperial highness i ah wanted to apologize for ah anything i may have done to ah offend you and i certainly want to assure you i ah meant no harm this time krispos noted his delivery was less polished than before petronas nodded esteemed sir you have five chins and a lard belly below them the voices of the chorus rang out once more this time krispos was ready for them and kept his face straight anthimos stared again then giggled hearing that skombros seemed to wilt petronas prompted him you were saying does it matter skombros asked bleakly why esteemed sir the chorus took up where the sevastokrator left off you have five chins and a lard belly below them anthimos giggled again louder ignoring all courtly etiquette skombros heaved his bulk out of his chair and stalked toward the door dear me petronas exclaimed as the eunuch slammed it behind him do you think i said something wrong ix mavros as was his way heard the news first skombros resigned his position last night what the esteemed sir krispos whistled the choral response aye the very same mavros laughedthat story had spread through the palace complex like wildfire not only that hes had himself tonsured and fled into a monastery so they tell me have his nephew askyltos and his brotherinlaw evmolpos if i were wearing their robes id flee to a monastery too krispos said petronas respects the good gods followers so he might leave them there and not take their heads now that their protectors fallen so he might mavros sound regretful then he brightened now that their protectors fallen whos to be the new vestiarios grinning he pointed at krispos well see its the avtokrators choice of course for all his own good times with anthimos for all petronas urging he knew the emperor might just choose another eunuch as his new chamberlain that would be easiest and anthimos liked doing things the easiest way but a couple of hours later while krispos was making sure the new horseshoes on petronas favorite hunter were firmly nailed in place onorios came up to him and said theres a eunuch outside who wants to talk with you thanks ill see him in a minute krispos had one more hoof to check as hed expected the blacksmith had done a good job knowing was better than expecting though when he was through he walked out to see the emperors servant it was the tall thin eunuch who had taken krispos to his first revel with anthimos the summer before now the fellow made no snide remarks about the smell of the stables instead he bowed low krispos his imperial majesty bids you join his household as vestiarios head of his domestic staff he honors me tell me your name please esteemed sir if we are both of his majestys household i should know you the eunuch straighted i am called barsymes he said with the first approval krispos had heard from him now if you will follow me ah he stopped frowning should i call you esteemed sir or eminent sir you are vestiarios a post traditionally held by an esteemed sir and yet you he hesitated again you have a beard the proper protocol is a puzzlement krispos started to laugh then realized he would be worrying about just such concerns himself in his new post either way is all right with me barsymes he said i have it the eunuch looked as pleased as his doleful features would allow now if you will come with me esteemed and eminent sir krispos obediently followed if barsymes had found a formula that satisfied him well and good they scuffed through snow together for a while before krispos said i hope you and your comrades will not be troubled serving with serving with someone who has a beard it is the avtokrators will barsymes said which was no answer at all he walked on not looking at krispos after a while he decided to continue we do remember that you mocked skombros for being a eunuch only when he mocked me first for being a groom krispos said yes there is some truth in that barsymes said judiciously though by now you will have noted esteemed and eminent sir that your condition is rather easier to change than skombros being without any better reply krispos could only nod he felt a little easier when barsymes went on half to himself still you may indeed be entitled to the benefit of the doubt they passed through a grove of cherry trees barebranched and skeletal with winter armed halogai stood outside the entrance to the elegant little building in the center of the grove krispos had seen some of them before guarding anthimos revels most of them had been drunk then now they looked sober and reliable he knew little of soldiers ways but the difference seemed remarkable as if reading his mind barsymes said any guard who fails of alertness while protecting their majestys residence is forthwith banished back to halogaland forfeiting all pay and benefactions earned here a good plan krispos wondered why it didnt hold wherever the emperor was knowing anthimos probably because when he was having a good time he wanted everyone else to have one too the halogai nodded to barsymes and gave krispos curious looks as he walked up the stairs with the eunuch one of the guards said something in his own language the others laughed krispos had no trouble imagining several rough jokes most of them at his expense he sighed however much it meant to him this business of taking over a eunuchs post brought complications his eyes needed a moment to adjust to the dimmer light inside the imperial residence and a moment more to notice that what light there was came neither from torches nor for the most part from windows instead panes of alabaster scraped to translucent thinness were set into the ceiling the pale clear light that filtered through them displayed to best advantage the treasures set along both sides of the central hallway barsymes pointed to some of them as he led krispos past here is the battle helmet of a makuraner king of kings taken centuries ago after a tremendous victory not far from mashiz this is the chalice from which the assembled prelates of phos drank together in ritual renunciation of skotos at the great synod not long after the high temple was built here is a portrait of the emperor stavrakios most often called the conqueror the portrait drew krispos eye stavrakios wore the red boots the imperial crown and a gilded mail shirt but he did not look like an emperor to krispos he looked like a veteran underofficer about to give his troops a hard time for a sloppy piece of drill come along barsymes said when krispos paused to study that tough face he followed the eunuch down the hall thinking that anthimos did not look like his idea of an emperor either he laughed at himself maybe he just didnt know what an emperor was supposed to look like another eunuch heard barsymes and krispos coming and stuck his head out a doorway you have him eh he said very well his majesty will be glad to see him if the eunuch himself was glad to see krispos he concealed it magnificently the fellows head disappeared again krispos heard his voice too low to make out words then anthimos louder whats that tyrovitzes hes here well bring him in barsymes heard also and led krispos forward anthimos sat at a small table eating cakes krispos went down on his belly in a full proskynesis your imperial majesty he murmured get up get up the emperor said impatiently the bowing and scraping can stop when youre in here youre part of my household now you didnt bow and scrape when you were in your parents household did you no your majesty krispos said he wondered what his father would have made of having his household compared to the avtokrators most likely phostis would have laughed himself silly that anthimos could make the comparison only showed how little he realized what a special life he led the emperor said anything special you think youll need krispos having you remember im more used to tending horses than people would help a lot your majesty krispos answered anthimos stared at him then let out a startled laugh krispos went on im sure your other servants will help me learn what i need to know as fast as i can anthimos glanced toward barsymes of course your majesty the eunuch said in his neutral voice good thats settled then the emperor said krispos hoped it was anthimos went on take krispos to his room barsymes he can have the rest of today and tomorrow to move in i expect the rest of you will be able to care for me and dara till morning after next we shall manage your majesty barsymes agreed now if you will excuse us this way krispos as he led krispos down the hall he explained the vestiarios bedchamber is next to that of the avtokrator so that he may most conveniently attend his master at any hour of the day or night the eunuch opened a door you will stay here krispos gasped hed never seen such a profusion of gold and fine silks petronas surely had more but did not flaunt it so and the featherbed in the center of the room looked thick enough to smother in you will understand i hope barsymes said seeing his expression that skombros having no hope of progeny saw no point in stinting his personal comfort the failing is not unique to us eunuchs but is perhaps more common among us i suppose so krispos said still stunned by the rooms opulence near that fabulous featherbed a little silver bell hung from a red cord that ran up into the ceiling and disappeared he pointed to it whats that for the cord runs to the imperial bedchamber next door when that bell rings you must attend all right krispos hesitated then went on thanks barsymes youve helped he held out his hand the eunuch took it his palms were smooth but his grip showed surprising strength not all of us were enamored of skombros he remarked if you do not despise us for what we are we may be able to work together well enough i hope so krispos was not making idle chitchat as at petronas stables he knew he would fail if the people he was supposed to oversee turned against him and eunuchs unlike the straightforward stable hands moved with proverbial guile he was not sure he was ready to counter their machinations with luck he wouldnt have to he was relieved to escape the room that had been skombros and was now his though he wondered how the exvestiarios enjoyed a bare monastery cell so different from this splendor the image of stavrakios caught his eye again as he walked down the hall imagining what that warrioremperor would have said about skombros luxuriesor anthimosgave him something to smile about while he went back to say goodbye to his friends and collect his belongings at the stables after the inevitable round of congratulations and backslapping he managed to get stotzas off to one side for a few minutes do you want my job now that im leaving he asked the senior groom the good god knows youre the best man with horses here and id be pleased to speak with petronas for you youre a gentleman lad and im pleased you asked but no thanks stotzas said youre right its the horses i fancy and id have less time for em if i had to worry about bossing the men around instead krispos nodded hed thought stotzas would say that but he hadnt been sure if the graybeard wanted the job he deserved it since he didnt krispos had someone else in mind to recommend to the sevastokrator when he got back to his apartment in the grand courtroom he discovered he needed more than one duffel bag for what he had inside he smiled to himself as he went back to the stables to borrow petronas brown gelding one last time the horse snorted reproachfully as he loaded it with his worldly goods oh hush he told it better your back than mine the horse did not seem convinced but let him lead it over to the imperial residence the bell beside krispos bed rang at first he tried to fit the sound into his dream the bell kept ringing he woke with a start anthimos was calling him he sprang out of bed naked threw on a robe shoved his feet into sandals and dashed for the imperial bedchamber your majesty he said puffing how may i serve you wearing no more than krispos had anthimos was sitting up in beda bed that looked comfortable enough but not nearly so magnificent as the one krispos had appropriated from skombros the avtokrator grinned at his new vestiarios ill have to get used to your appearing so quickly he said which eased krispos mindhe hadnt taken too long to wake then anthimos went on time to face the day certainly your majesty the eunuchs had spent the previous afternoon talking themselves hoarse about the emperors routine krispos hoped he remembered it beside the bed stood a chamber pot first things first for emperor as for peasant bowing krispos lifted it and handed it to anthimos while the avtokrator stood up and used it krispos got him clean drawers and a fresh robe he helped anthimos dress then ceremoniously escorted him to a mirror of polished silver anthimos made a face at his reflection while krispos combed his hair and beard looks like me the emperor said when he was done eyes arent even too bloodshotbut then i got to sleep early last night he turned back to the bed didnt i dara whats that buried in blankets to the crown of her head anthimos empress sounded more than half asleep herself didnt i get to bed early last night the avtokrator repeated ive even found an advantage to itmy eyes look much clearer than usual this morning dara rolled over and sat up krispos did his best not to starelike anthimos she slept nude then she noticed him squeaked and yanked the blankets up to her chin anthimos laughed no need for such worries my dear this is krispos the new vestiarios keeping his eyes on his own toes krispos said in his most formal voice i did not mean to startle you your majesty itsall right dara said after a moment seeing the beard caught me by surprise thats all his majesty said you were a whole man but it must have slipped my mind go ahead with what you were doing ill summon a maidservant she had a bellpull on her side of the bed too with a green cord she held the blankets in place with one hand reached out with the other krispos fetched the emperors red boots from the closet and helped anthimos into them they were tight and pulling them onto the imperial feet took some work the maidservant came in while he was still fighting to get them on she paid no attention to krispos beard indeed with him bent down in front of the emperor she could hardly have noticed whether he had oneor whether he had horns and fangs for that matter she chose a gown from daras closet and whisked away the bedclothes so she could dress the empress dara again glanced nervously toward krispos but relaxed when she saw him intent on his own duties he did his best to take no special notice of her if she had been easy in the presence of the former vestiarios he did not want to rob her of that ease at the same time even the brief selfconscious glimpses hed had of her showed she was a dazzling young woman she was small and dark with lustrous almost blueblack hair that crackled as her maidservant brushed it she had an aquiline profile with high sculptured cheekbones and a strong rather pointed chin her body was as lovely as her face krispos wondered why anthimos having such an empress also bedded any girl who caught his eye maybe dara lacked passion he thought or maybe anthimos was like some of petronas stable hands unable to pass up any opportunity he found and unlike them he found plentyfew would say no to the avtokrator of the videssians such wherefores were not his concern though getting the emperors boots on was grunting with effort he finally succeeded good job anthimos said laughing and patting him on the head from all ive heard you had a tougher time wrestling with my boots than you did with that giant kubrati different sort of wrestling majesty krispos had to remind himself what came next in the routine and now with what would you and your lady care to break your fast a bloater for me anthimos said a bloater and wine how about you my dear just porridge i think dara said krispos sympathies lay with her smoked and salted mackerel was all very well but not his idea of breakfast food he carried the imperial couples requests back to the kitchens and had a bowl of porridge himself while the cook fixed a tray the good god be thanked his majestys in a simple mood today the fellow said as he poured wine from an amphora into a silver carafe have you ever tried fixing shrimp and octopus stew while hes waiting or worse had to go running out to try to buy oranges out of season because it crossed his mind he wanted some did you find any krispos asked intrigued aye theres a shop or two that sells em preserved by magic for those who have the urge and the money at the same time didnt cost me above twenty times what they usually run and what sort of thanks did i get precious little ill tell you carrying the tray to a dining hall not far from the imperial bedchamber krispos wondered if anthimos had even known the fruit was out of season when would he have occasion to learn all he needed to do was ask for something to have it appear before him the emperor devoured his bloater with lipsmacking gusto now my dear he said to dara why dont you go and tend to your embroidery for a while krispos and i have some serious business to discuss krispos would have resented such a cavalier dismissal whatever dara felt she did not let it show she rose nodded to anthimos and left without a word she took as much notice of krispos as of the chair on which he sat what business is there your majesty krispos asked curious and a little worried none of the emperors eunuchs had warned him anything special was in the wind but anthimos answered why we have to decide what the chances will be for tonights festivities oh krispos said following the emperors pointing finger he saw the ballfilled crystal bowl sitting on a shelf he got it down took apart the balls and set their halves on the table between himself and anthimos where can i find pen and parchment your majesty somewhere around here anthimos said vaguely while krispos poked through drawers in a sideboard anthimos continued i think the number tonight will be eleven after the paired single pips on the dice when someone throws phos little suns what goes well with eleven krispos found writing materials at last eleven dice your majesty since the number is taken from gambling excellent i knew you were clever what else how abouthmmeleven mice so you want to rhyme tonight do you well why not i expect the servants can find eleven mice by evening what else they came up with eleven pounds of ice eleven grains of rice eleven licei know the servants can find those anthimos saideleven drams of spice eleven things nice and eleven kinds of vice both of those will send the winner to the stews the avtokrator declared how about eleven goldpice krispos suggested when their inspiration began to flag its not a perfect rhyme it is if you write it that way anthimos said so krispos did your majesty could i get you to think on something else about these chances for a moment krispos asked at the emperors nod he went on you might want to give them out to the entertainers along with your guests theyre not rich think how overjoyed theyd be to pick one of the good chances anthimos answering smile was not altogether pleasant yes and think how downcast theyd be if they didnt that could be amusing too well give it a try krispos knew he hadnt got his way for the reason he wanted but hed got it some of the jugglers and musicians and courtesans would end up better off and even the ones who came away from the chances disappointed would actually be in no worse state than before he told himself whats next the avtokrator asked i am given to understand a new makuraner embassy has come to the city krispos said carefully if you cared to i suppose you could meet the high ambassador anthimos yawned another time perhaps petronas will tend to them thats his proper function seeing to such tiresome details as you wish your majesty krispos did not press the issue hed done his best to make the meeting sound dull he knew petronas wanted to keep his own hands firmly on the empires relations with its neighbors instead of meeting with the makuraner high ambassador anthimos went to the amphitheater he ate the coarse greasy food the vendors sold there he drank rough wine from a cracked clay cup he awarded five hundred goldpieces to a driver whod brought his chariot from the back of the pack to first in the last couple of laps the crowd cheered his generosity it all worked well enough krispos thought they had a symbol anthimos had fun and petronas had the government and what do i have krispos wondered part of the answer was plain enough good food good lodging even the ear of the avtokrator of the videssiansfor such matters as chances at revels anyhow all that was marvelously better than the nothing with which hed arrived at videssos the city a few years before he was discovering though that the more he had the more he wanted hed read two or three chronicles of the empires past none of them recorded the name of a single vestiarios a few days later anthimos went hunting krispos stayed behind running the imperial residence even with the emperor absent was a fulltime job he was not unduly surprised when eroulos came by a little before noon this time petronas steward bowed to him his imperial highness the sevastokrator would be pleased to take lunch with you esteemed and eminent sir your duties permitting of course krispos gave eroulos a quizzical look so youve heard my new title eroulos sounded surprised that krispos need ask its my business to hear such things petronas had heard it too ah the esteemed and eminent vestiarios he said bowing back when krispos went on one knee before him here have some wine how fares my nephew well enough highness krispos said he showed no great interest in making the acquaintance of the new envoy from makuran just as well petronas said scowling there will be war soonif not this year then the next probably next year ill have to take the field in person and to do that i need you solidly in place with anthimos so he wont listen to too much nonsense while im away from the city in the westlands there lay the weakness in petronas position krispos thought while he ruled he was not videssos ruler if anthimos ever decided to take up the reins of power for himself or if someone else steered him the prestige that went with the imperial title might well make officials follow him rather than his uncle krispos said im glad you place such confidence in me highness weve discussed why i do petronas suavely changed the subject anthimos gain is my loss im finding the stable hands still do their individual work well enough but theres less overall direction to things without you i asked stotzas if he wanted your job but he turned me down flat he did the same with me when i asked him if he wanted me to mention him to you krispos hesitated may i suggest someone else why not whom do you have in mind how about mavros i know hes even younger than i am but everyone likes him and he wouldnt be slack he takes horses seriously hes more a real horseman than i as a matter of fact i got to the point where i knew what i was doing but he comes by it naturally hmm petronas stroked his beard at last he said you may have something there hes likelier than anyone id thought of at any rate ill see what eroulos has to say hes not mavros personal friend as you are if he thinks the youngster will answer i may well give him a try my thanks im pleased to help even if im not part of your household any more krispos doubted eroulos would have anything bad to say about mavros all the same he took note of petronas caution knowing krispos advice was not disinterested the sevastokrator would not move until he heard some that was another bit of business worth remembering krispos thought he wondered if hed ever have a chance to use it the chance came sooner than hed expected a few days later he received a letter from a certain ypatios asking if the two of them could meet to discuss matters of mutual interest krispos had never heard of ypatios some discreet inquiry among the eunuchs let him find out that the fellow headed a large trading house krispos arranged a meeting at the imperial residence on an afternoon when anthimos was watching the chariots barsymes ushered ypatios into the antechamber where krispos sat waiting the man bowed a pleasure to make your acquaintance esteemed sir he began and then stopped seeming to notice krispos beard for the first time i meant no offense by that title i want you to know you are vestiarios after all but i see im usually styled esteemed and eminent this routine krispos realized was one hed need to get used to ypatios quickly recovered his poise esteemed and eminent it is very good the merchant was about fifty well fed and shrewdlooking as i said in my letter esteemed and eminent sir i believe we have interests in common you said so krispos agreed you didnt say what they were though one can never tell who all reads a letter ypatios said let me explain my sons and i specialize in importing fine furs from the kingdom of agder for some time his imperial majesty may his years be many has had under consideration a law to lower the import duties upon such furs his favorable action upon this law would ill not deny work to our advantage would it krispos steepled his fingertips he began to see in which quarter the wind lay ypatios nodded solemnly it would indeed and my sons and i are prepared to be generous in our appreciation as you are in such intimate contact with his imperial majesty surely you might find occasion to suggest a course of action to him our own humble requests expressed in written form perhaps have not had the good fortune to come under his eyes maybe not krispos said it occurred to him that even had anthimos been the most conscientious ruler videssos ever knew he would have had trouble staying up with all the minutiae of the empire since anthimos was anything but he undoubtedly had never seen the law he was supposed to be considering krispos went on why are the duties against the furs so high now ypatios lip curled in a fine round sneer who can say why stupid laws remain in force to make beggars of me and my family i suspect he did not look as if hed be whining for crusts on a street corner any time soon his next words confirmed that still i might see my way clear to investing twenty pieces of gold to repair the injustice presently on the books i will be in touch with you was all krispos said ypatios florid face fell he bowed his way out krispos tugged at his beard and thought for a while the gesture reminded him of petronas he decided to call on the sevastokrator and how may i help the esteemed and eminent sir this day petronas asked krispos explained petronas said he only offered you twenty stick him for at least a pound of gold if you decide to do it he may squeal a bit but he can afford to pay you should i do it though krispos persisted for things like that make up your own mind lad i dont care one way or the othertoo small to worry about if youre not just out for the cash maybe you should find out why the law is the way it is that will give you a clue as to whether it needs changing krispos did some digging or tried to navigating the maze of videssian bureaucracy proved anything but easy the clerk of the courts referred him to the master of the archives the master of the archives sent him to the office of the eparch of the city the eparch of the citys adjutant tried to send him back to the clerk of the courts at which point krispos threw a tantrum the adjutant had second thoughts and suggested he visit the customs commissioner the customs commissioner was not in his office and would not be back for a week his wife had just had a baby as krispos grumpily turned to go someone called excellent sir may i help you excellent sir turning krispos found himself face to face with the customs agent whose scheme hed urged on anthimos outside the amphitheater maybe you can he said not bothering to correct the fellows use of his title heres what i need yes i can find that the customs agent said when he was done a pleasure to be able to repay your kindness in some small way wait here if you would excellent sir he vanished into a room filled with boxes of scrolls at last he reemerged wiping dust from his hands and robe sorry to be so long things are in a frightful muddle back there the law you mention turns out to have been promulgated to protect the livelihood of trappers and hunters who lived by the astris river from competition from agderian furs by the astris krispos said but the kubratoi have ruled the lands around there for hundreds of years you know that and i know that but the law doesnt seem to have heard the news it will krispos promised thanks for your help after what you did for me excellent sir it was my privilege krispos went back to the imperial residence and scribbled a note to ypatios though your case has weight it does not yet have enough weight to go forward he was sure the merchant would be able to figure out that he was talking about the weight of coins sure enough when ypatios met him again the first thing he asked was just how heavy does our case have to be a pound would do nicely krispos said remembering petronas guess he kept his voice bland but waited nervously for ypatios to scream at him the fur seller only sighed a pound it is esteemed and eminent sir youre still cheaper to do business with than skombros was am i when skombros became a priest all his worldly possessions were forfeited to the imperial fisc they would likely keep anthimos in revels a good long time krispos thought wondering just how many bribes the former vestiarios had taken after the gold changed hands krispos put the proposed change to anthimos why not the avtokrator said huzza for cheaper furs krispos produced the necessary document anthimos signed it with ink of imperial scarlet krispos sent petronas a dozen goldpieces the sevastokrator returned them with a note saying you need these more than i do but ill remember the thought since that was true krispos was glad to have them back and since petronas understood why hed sent them he got all the benefits of generosity without actually having to pay for it the singer opened the golden ball read fourteen pieces of gold screamedright on keyand kissed krispos on the mouth he would have enjoyed the kiss more had the singer been a woman other than that the performers reaction left nothing to be desired the fellow ran through the hall musically shrieking at the top of his lungs fourteen goldpieces was nothing worth shrieking about for most of anthimos guests as krispos had expected seeing someone get so excited about what they thought of as so little amused them mightily moreover what the singer now had wasnt so little for him at all laughing at himselfhe hadnt had to worry about kisses from men since he left iakovitzes servicekrispos took a long pull at his wine hed learned to nurse his cups at anthimos affairs tonight though he hadnt done as good a job as usual he could feel his head starting to spin he picked his way through the crowd back to the emperor may i be excused your majesty anthimos pouted so early it was somewhere near midnight you have a midmorning meeting with gnatios if youll remember majesty krispos grinned a wry grin and while you may be able to sleep until just before the time or even to keep the most holy sir waiting i have to be up early to make sure everything is as it should be oh very well anthimos said grouchily then his eyes lit up here give me the bowl ill hand out chances myself for the rest of the evening that was entertainment far less ribald than most of what he favored but it was something new and therefore intriguing krispos gladly surrendered the crystal bowl the cool sweet air of the spring night helped clear his head the racket from the revel faded behind him as he walked to the imperial residence the haloga guards outside the entrance nodded as he went by them they were long since used to him now he had just climbed into bed when the bell on the scarlet cord rang he scowled as he scrambled into his robe in the dark what was anthimos doing back in his bedchamber already the only thing he could think of was that the emperor had sneaked after him to twit him for going to sleep so soon that was the sort of thing anthimos might do but not when hed been so excited about dealing out little gold balls several lamps glowed in the imperial bedroom but anthimos was not there the empress sat up in bed i cant seem to get to sleep tonight krispos dara said could you please fetch me a cup of wine my serving maids are all asleep and i heard you just coming in do you mind of course not majesty krispos said he told the trutha vestiarios had better not mind doing what the empress of videssos asked of him ill be back directly he found a jar of wine in the dining room and poured a cup from it my thanks dara said when he brought it to her she tossed it down almost as quickly as anthimos might have she was as bare as shed been the morning krispos first came into the imperial bedchamber but did not bother to pull up the sheet to her he might as well have been a eunuch holding out the cup she told him fetch me another please of course he repeated she drained the cup a second time as fast as she had the first set it down empty on the night table by the bed tell me she said do you expect his imperial majesty to return any time soon i dont know when his majesty will come back krispos answered when i left the feast he still seemed to be enjoying himself oh dara said tonelessly he usually returns not long after you do ive noticed why not tonight because i have to be up early tomorrow morning to make sure everything is ready for his majestys meeting with the patriarch his majesty was kind enough to let me leave before him oh dara said again without warning tears started streaming from her eyes they ran down her cheeks and splashed on her uncovered breasts that krispos should see her upset bothered her more than him seeing her nude she choked out go away he all but fled one foot was already out in the hall when the empress said no wait come back please reluctantly he turned he would sooner have faced a wolf alone and unarmed than the distraught empress but he did not dare disobey her either whats wrong your majesty he asked in the same soft calm tone he would have used to try to talk the wolf out of ripping his throat open now she raised the sheet to her neck if not as a man she was aware of him as a person rather than a faceless servant whats wrong she echoed bitterly what could possibly be wrong with me trapped here in the imperial residence and my husband at hunts or the horse races by day and his cursed revels by night buthe is the avtokrator krispos said and so he can do just as he pleases i know dara said sometimes i think he is the only free man in all the empire of videssos and i am his empress am i free ha a tradesmans wife has more freedom than i do far more krispos knew she was right except for rare ceremonial appearances in the grand courtroom the empress lived a sheltered indeed a sequestered life always screened away from the wider world by her maidservants and the palace eunuchs as gently as he could he said but surely you knew this would be so when you consented to be his majestys bride there wasnt much consent to it dara said do you know what a bride show is krispos i was one of a long line of pretty girls and anthimos happened to pick me i was so surprised i couldnt even talk my father owns estates in the westlands not far from the border with makuran he was thrilledhed have an avtokrator for a grandson but ihavent even managedto do that as ishould have she started to cry again you still have time krispos said youre younger than i am that distracted her as hed hoped it would she gave him a sharp look gauging his years maybe a little she said at last not fully convinced im certain you are and surely his majesty still he paused to make sure he used the right words cares for you dara understood oh aye when hes here and not drunk asleep or when he hasnt futtered himself out with one of his doxiesor with six of them fire flashed through her tears krispos saw she had a temper when she let it loose then her shoulders sagged and she bent her head but whats the use i havent given him a child and if i dont hell cast me out one of these days again krispos knew she was right even emperors like anthimos who worried about nothing sooner or later worried about an heir but dara already felt far too hurt for him simply to agree with her instead he said for all you know you may be carrying the avtokrators son right now i hope you are i may be but i dont think i am dara said she studied him curiosity on her face you sound as if you mean it skombros said the same thing but i was always sure he was lying skombros was ambitious for his own nephew krispos said with that he thought of his nieceno nieces now hed heardback in his own village he sent gold every year to his sister evdokia and domokos now that he had more he resolved to send more yes he was dara said distantly im glad hes gone after a little while she went on if you fetched me one more cup of wine i think i could sleep now krispos he brought the jar into the bedchamber if you find you need a bit more your majesty here it is thank you krispos she gave him the cup to fill when he handed it back her fingers closed over his for a moment thank you also for listening to me i think youre kind i hope you do sleep majesty and sleep well shall i blow out the lamps if you would leave the one on my night table burning though please ill tend to it when im ready as krispos bowed his way out of the bedchamber dara added i hope you sleep well too krispos bowed again thank you for thinking of me majesty he went back to his own room despite the wine hed drunk at the emperors feast he lay awake for a long time anthimos rose from his chair care to come for a stroll with me gnatios krispos felt like pounding his head against a wall if the avtokrator and the ecumenical patriarch were going out walking then three parts in four of his preparations for this meeting had been wasted effort more to the point he could have slept an extra hour or two a dull headache and scratchy eyes told him he should have gnatios also rose whatever your majesty wishes maybe krispos thought hopefully he could doze for a bit while his master and the patriarch talked then anthimos said you come along too krispos thinking resentful thoughts krispos came a couple of imperial guards attached themselves to the party as the emperor and his companions walked outside anthimos made cheerful small talk as he led his little party through the palace complex gnatios replies were polite enough but also increasingly curious as if he were unsure where the emperor was going either in the stroll or the conversation krispos quietly fumed if anthimos was only going to burble on about the weather why did he need to see the patriarch at all the avtokrator finally stopped in front of a tumbledown building set apart from its nearest neighborsnot that any were very nearby a thick grove of darkgreen cypresses ive decided to study sorcery he declared after you left last night krispos a mage worked such marvelous feats that i decided then and there to learn how they were done i see krispos said he did too it was just like anthimos to seize on a momentary enthusiasm and ride it till he got bored gnatios said forgive me your majesty but may i ask what your sudden interest in sorcery has to do with this elderly temple here you see what it is then or was good anthimos beamed not all sorcery is easy or safeyou know that as well as i what i propose to do gnatios is knock the building down and replace it with a proper magical study the site is ideal you will agree being isolated from the rest of the palaces you want to tear the temple down the patriarch echoed thats right no ones used it for what must be decades you should see the spiderwebs inside some of them could catch birds i expect it wouldnt be sacrilege or anything really it wouldnt the emperor smiled his most engaging smile at gnatios the ecumenical patriarch was more than twice his sovereigns age and a good deal more than twice as serious as anthimos nevertheless the emperor charmed him almost as if he were already using magic gnatios was shaking his head but he answered pyrrhos and his narrowminded followers will rail at me but technically your majesty i suppose you are correct very well i agree you may demolish this unused temple to employ the area for your own purposes perhaps your majesty you could have another temple built somewhere else in the city to make up for tearing down this one krispos put in an excellent notion gnatios said will you pledge to do that your majesty oh certainly anthimos said krispos see to it that the logothetes at the treasury know to set aside funds for a new temple well knock down this old ruin one day next week then gnatios i want you to be here gnatios ran a hand over his shaven head as you wish your majesty but why am i required why to say a prayer while the temple gets demolished of course anthimos flashed his charming smile again this time it did not work gnatios slowly shook his head your majesty i fear i cannot there is in the liturgy a prayer for the construction of a temple but we have not inherited from our forefathers a prayer over the demolition of a temple then invent one anthimos said you are a great scholar gnatios surely you can find words that will please the good god how can he be pleased that one of his temples is destroyed the patriarch said because the temple is old and has long stood vacant he may tolerate it but i dare not ask him to do more than that because this one is being torn down hell soon have a new one that wont be empty krispos said gnatios gave him an unfriendly look i will joyfully pray at the erection of the new i would do so in any event but at the loss of a templeno i cannot pray over that maybe pyrrhos would krispos said no here we would agree or would we gnatios was as much politician as prelate that undid him now more to himself than to krispos or anthimos he went on who knows what pyrrhos might do to gain imperial favor for his fanaticism after another pause he said sourly oh very well your majesty you shall have your prayer from me splendid anthimos said i knew i could rely on you gnatios the patriarch set his jaw and nodded happily clapping him on the shoulder anthimos started back to the imperial residence gnatios and krispos trailed along behind the emperor gnatios said softly i wish you would have kept your mouth shut vestiarios i serve my master krispos said if i can help him get what he wants i will he and i will both look like fools because of this ceremony hes asked for gnatios said is that your idea of good service krispos thought gnatios worried more about gnatios than about anthimos but all he said was his majesty doesnt seem worried gnatios sniffed and stamped on ahead of him blue boots scuffing flagstones a week later a small crowd of priests and officials gathered for the function the emperor had demanded petronas was not there he was closeted with the makuraner envoys he had real work to do krispos thought anthimos walked up and said krispos this chap with me is trokoundos the mage who will be instructing me trokoundos this is my vestiarios krispos if trokoundos needs funds to secure apparatus or mystical goods krispos make sure he has what he asks for very well your majesty krispos eyed trokoundos with suspicion someone else who wants a grip on the emperor he thought indignantly the anger that surged through him brought him up short all at once he understood how petronas felt about his nephew trokoundos looked straight back at krispos his eyes heavylidded and clever i will see you often for i have much to teach his majesty he said his voice was deep and rich it did not suit his framehe was only of medium height and on the thin side he shaved his head like a priest but wore a robe of a most unpriestly orange a pleasure to meet you mage krispos cool voice gave his words the lie and you eu trokoundos stopped short hed started the same rude rejoinder krispos had used against skombros only to notice too late that it did not apply and you vestiarios he amended lamely krispos smiled he was glad to find the mage human enough to miss things my title is esteemed and eminent sir he said rubbing trokoundos nose in the mistake ah here comes gnatios anthimos said happily krispos and trokoundos both turned to watch the patriarch approach gnatios stopped in front of the avtokrator and prostrated himself with grim dignity i have composed the prayer you required of me your majesty he said as he rose by all means say it then so the workmen may begin the emperor said gnatios faced the temple to be torn down he spat on the ground in rejection of skotos then raised his hands to the sky glory to phos the longsuffering at all times he declared now forever and through eons upon eons so may it be so may it be the assembled dignitaries echoed their voices were less hearty than they might have been krispos was not the only one who glanced over to see how the emperor would respond to a prayer that as much as said phos had to be patient to put up with his whims the implied criticism sailed past him he bowed to gnatios thank you most holy sir just what the occasion demanded then he called go to it lads to the band of workmen standing by the temple the workers attacked the dilapidated old building with picks and crowbars the ceremony over court officers and prelates began drifting away krispos started to follow anthimos back to the imperial residence when trokoundos put a hand on his arm he pulled free what do you want he asked roughly i need enough money to purchase several hundred sheets of parchment the mage answered what do you need with several hundred sheets of parchment i have no need of them trokoundos said his majesty does if he would be a mage he first must need copy out in his own hand the spells he will thereafter employ he set hands on hips plainly expecting krispos to say noand ready to go to anthimos with the tale but krispos said of course ill have the money sent to you straightaway you will trokoundos blinked his belligerent air vanished in fact krispos went on if you want to come to the residence with me ill give you the gold right now ill take it from the household chest you will trokoundos said again those heavylidded eyes widened thank you very much thats most gracious of you i serve his majesty krispos said as he had to gnatios how much do you think youll need however much it was he would cheerfully pay it if trokoundos was going to set anthimos to transcribing several hundred pages worth of magical spells he thought the avtokrator would not stay interested in sorcery for long and that suited krispos just fine gnatios is not happy with you petronas said a couple of days later when krispos found a chance to tell him how the ceremony had gone why highness krispos asked i didnt think it was a matter of any importance especially since anthimos is going to build another temple to take the place of the one that got knocked down put that way youre right despite reassuring words petronas still studied krispos through narrowed eyes my cousin the patriarch though is shall we say unused to being faced down in front of the emperor and having to do something he did not care to do in consequence i wasnt trying to embarrass him krispos protested you succeeded nevertheless petronas said well let it go ill soothe gnatios ruffled feathers for him i didnt think you were quite so good at getting folkespecially a strongwilled fellow like my cousinto go along with you oh krispos said you wanted me to be vestiarios because you thought id be able to help get anthimos to do what you wanted why are you angry if i can do the same thing with someone else for his majesty im not angry merely thoughtful the sevastokrator said krispos sighed but consoled himself by remembering that petronas never had trusted him much he didnt think this latest brush would hurt his standing with anthimos uncle petronas went on whats this i hear about some wizard sucking up to the emperor oh that i think i took care of that krispos explained how hed given trokoundos exactly what he wanted the sevastokrator laughed out loud youd kill a cat by drowning it in cream thats better than i would have done id have just sent the beggar packing which would have made anthimos sulk and i dont need him sulking right now the talks with the makuraners arent going well krispos asked theyre not the problem petronas said the makuraners like talk as much as we videssians and thats saying something i just need to keep them talking a while longer till im ready to fight but i dont like the rumbles i hear out of kubrat malomirs stayed quiet ever since old omurtag died if he decided to start raiding us now then the war with makuran might have to wait and i dont want it to wait ive waited too long already he pounded a fist down on the padded arm of his chair krispos nodded thinking of nomad horsemen sweeping down from the north could make him shiver even now and if videssos armies were fully engaged in the far west raids from kubrat could reach all the way down to the walls of videssos the city the capital had stood kubrati siege a couple of times he wondered if the frontier with kubrat wasnt more important than the one with makuran which would stay peaceful for a while if petronas didnt stir it up was he right he wasnt sure himself as the sevastokrator had warned him hed had no practice making that kind of judgment maybe it wouldnt matter either way maybe the kubratoi would let themselves be bought off as they sometimes did he hoped so things would be simpler that way the higher hed risen though and the closer hed come to real power the more complicated things looked anthimos kept at his magical studies with a persistence that startled krispos while his new sanctum rose from the ruins of the temple he transcribed texts at the imperial residence krispos had to go over to the clerks who scribbled by the grand courtroom to find out how they got ink off their fingers when he fetched back some small pumice stones anthimos praised him to the skies thats plenty for today the emperor said one hot muggy summer afternoon coming out of his study wringing his writing hand all work makes a man dull what do we have laid on for tonight the feast features a troupe that performs with large dogs and tiny ponies krispos answered does it well that should give the servants something new to clean up anthimos started down the hall which robe have you chosen for me the blue silk it should be coolest in this weather excuse me your majesty krispos called to the emperors retreating back but i believe youve forgotten something anthimos stopped whats that your fingers are still stained you forgot to pumice them you want people to say the avtokrator of the videssians is his own secretary here let me fetch you a stone anthimos looked down at his right hand i did forget to clean off didnt i now it was his turn to make krispos pause you neednt bring me the pumice stone i can take care of this myself i think intense concentration on his face the emperor spread the inkstained fingers of his writing hand he waved his left hand above it and raised his voice in a rhythmic chant suddenly he cried out and clenched both hands into fists when he opened them they were both clean krispos made the sunsign over his heart you did it he exclaimed then hoped he didnt sound as surprised as he felt i certainly did anthimos said smugly a small application of the law of contagion which states that objects once in contact may continue to influence one another as that pumice had so often scoured my fingers i simply recreated the cleansing action by magical means i didnt realize you could start working magic before you had all your spells copied out krispos said do you want me to take the pumice stones back to the clerks i got them from no not yet for one thing the emperor grinned a smallboy grin trokoundos doesnt know i am working magic i dont think im supposed to be for another cleaning my hands that way was a lot harder than simply scraping off the ink i wanted to show off for you but it wore me out and i dont want to be worn out not when there will be so many interesting women at the revels tonight there will be wont there krispos of course your majesty i always try to please you that way once more krispos wondered why anthimos couldnt give if not all at least most of his attention to dara if nothing else hed have a better chance of begetting a legitimate heir if he spent some time with his own wife it was not as if she were undesirable krispos thoughtquite the opposite in fact whatever anthimos newfound sorcerous talents he could not read minds at the moment perhaps that was just as well the avtokrator went on i can hardly wait to show off my magecraft at a feast for that though ill need something rather more impressive than cleaning my hands without pumice i tried something once and it didnt work you did now krispos didnt care if he sounded appalled a mage who botched a spell was apt to be in even more immediate need of an heir than an avtokrator what did you do anthimos looked sheepish i tried giving wings to one of the little tortoises that crawl through the gardens i thought it would be amusing flying around inside the hall where i usually have my feasts but i must have done something wrong because i ended up with a pigeon with a shell promise me you wont tell trokoundos youre lucky you didnt end up shifting the shell to your own foolish face krispos said sternly anthimos shifted from foot to foot like a schoolboy taking a scolding he knew he deserved as had happened so often before krispos found he could not stay angry at him shaking his head he went on all right i wont tell trokoundos if you promise me youll stop mucking about with things you dont understand i wont anthimos said he had gone off to look at the robe he would wear to the evenings festivities before krispos noticed he hadnt quite made a promise even if he had krispos doubted he would have taken it seriously enough to keep anthimos just did not believe anything bad could ever happen to him krispos knew better if growing up on a farm had done nothing else for him it had done that x the bell beside krispos bed tinkled softly he woke up muttering to himself when anthimos held a feast he was expected to roister along with the emperorand the emperor was better than he at doing without sleep when anthimos spent a night with dara in the imperial residence krispos expected to have the chance to catch up on his rest even as he slipped a robe over his head he knew he was not being fair though hed got into the habit of keeping a lamp burning all night long to help him dress quickly in case the avtokrator needed him anthimos seldom called him after hed gone to bed but tonight he thought grouchily only went to show that seldom didnt mean never he walked out his door and four or five steps down the hall to the imperial bedchamber that door was closed but a light showed under it he opened the door anthimos and dara turned their heads toward him he stopped in his tracks and felt his face go flamehot yyour pardon i pray he stammered i thought the bell summoned me dont go away at least not yet i did call you the emperor said calm as if hed been interrupted playing draughtsor at one of his revels after that first startled glance toward the door dara looked down at anthimos her long dark hair undone now spilled over her shoulders and veiled her so that krispos could not see her face anthimos brushed some of that shining hair away from his nose and went on fetch me a little olive oil if you please krispos thats a good fellow yes your majesty krispos said woodenly he hurried out of the bedchamber behind him he heard anthimos say why did you slow down my dear that was nice what you were doing he found a jar of oil faster than he really wanted to in truth he did not want to go back to the bedchamber at all seeming a eunuch around dara had been simple at first but less easy after that night when she first let him see her as a person rather than an empress now now he would have trouble not imagining his body in place of anthimos under hers as he went back down the hall he wondered what she thought maybe she was used to this as anthimos was in that case she would also be used to taking no notice of what servants imagined probably just as well he thought he paused in the doorway took you long enough anthimos said dont just stand there bring the oil over to me how do you expect me to get it when youre half a mile away krispos reluctantly approached daras head was lowered her hair hid her face from him again he did not want to speak or force her to notice his presence any more than she had to without a word he held out the jar to the avtokrator anthimos dipped his fingers into it you can set it on the night table now krispos in case we want more later on krispos nodded did as he was told and got out but not before he heard the tiny smooth sound of anthimos slickened fingers sliding over daras skin he threw himself back into bed with what he knew was altogether unnecessary violence and lay awake for a long time staring at the ceiling the flickering shadows the lamp cast there all looked lewd eventually it began to rain the soft patter of raindrops on roof tiles lulled him to sleep at last he jerked in dismay when the bell woke him the next morning returning to the emperors chamber was the last thing he felt like doing what he felt like doing however mattered not in the least to anthimos the bell rang again louder and more insistently krispos pulled on a clean robe and went to do his masters bidding but for the jar of olive oil on the table by the bed the previous night might not have happened as far as anthimos was concerned it plainly hadnt good day he said rain i see do you think its just a shower or is the fall wet season coming early this year itll hurt the harvest if it is krispos answered relieved to be able to talk dispassionately do you prefer the purple robe today your majesty or the leek green the green i think anthimos got out of bed and gave an exaggerated shiver brr fall certainly seems to be in the air good thing for the heating ducts this building boasts or i d have to start thinking about sleeping in clothes he glanced over at dara who was still under the covers that would be no fun at all would it my dear whatever you say the empress reached out a slim arm and tugged on the bellpull for a maidservant anthimos sniffed he let krispos dress him and help him on with his boots im for breakfast he announced he looked over at dara again and frowned arent you coming slugabed presently the empress serving girl had come in but she showed no sign of being ready to get up why dont you start without me oh very well krispos ask the cook if he has any squab in the larder if he does ill have a couple roasted with a jar of that sweet golden vaspurakaner wine that goes so well with them ill inquire your majesty the cook had squab he grinned at krispos with all the statues and towers in the city to draw pigeons not likely i wouldnt roasted you said his majesty wants em roasted theyll be krispos fetched anthimos the little birds along with bread honey and the wine hed asked for the avtokrator ate with good appetite then rose and said im off to be sorcerous dara and her maidservant came into the dining room just as he was going out his voice echoed through the central hallway tyrovitzes longinos fetch umbrellas and smartly i dont propose to swim to my little workshop the eunuchs sandals slapped on the marble floor as they hurried to obey krispos asked dara what would you care for this morning your majesty im not very hungry she answered some of this bread and honey should do well enough for me she only picked at it can i get you anything else your majesty the serving maid asked youre not a bird to stay alive on crumbs dara looked at the crust she was holding then set it down maybe a muskmelon would suit me better verinastewed i think not raw ill get one for you majesty verina stood up impudently wrinkled her nose ill spend the time its stewing gossiping with the cook phestos knows everything that goes on here three days before it happens nice to think someone does dara listened to verinas steps fading down the hall then said quietly krispos i want you to know i did not expect anhis majesty to summon you last night if you were embarrassed i can only say im sorry i was too oh krispos thought about that for a while thought about how much he might safely say to even a contrite empress finally he continued it was a little awkward being treated as if i were only aa convenience thats well said daras voice stayed low but her eyes blazed she clenched her hands together thats just how anthimos treats everyone around himas a convenience a toy for his amusement to be put back on the shelf to sit until he feels like playing with it again and by the lord with the great and good mind krispos i am no toy and i am sick to death of being used as one oh krispos said again in a different tone when angry dara was indeed no toy she reminded him of tanilis but a tanilis young and unskilled nor did the memory of her anger sustain her once it was gone as tanilis did tanilis never would have let the emperor keep her in the background like this it was bad enough with skombros those tiny eyes staring and staring from that fat face dara said but after a while i got used to him and even pitied him for what could he do but stare krispos nodded he remembered having the same thought watching the former vestiarios at that first revel hed been to dara went on but better he should have done without the oil krispos or gotten it himself than to have you bring it you who have no need of such spectacles who are whole and in every way as a man should be she broke off abruptly and stared down at her hands i knew before last night that your majesty was beautiful krispos said softly nothing i saw then makes me want to change my mind he heard footfalls in the hall and raised his voice here comes that melon i hope you like it better than the bread and honey the empress shot him a grateful look i think i will thank you verina came in uncovering the bowl in which the stewed muskmelon lay and thank you verina that smells lovely i hope it pleases you the maidservant beamed as she watched her mistress eat the whole melon all a matter of finding out what you want isnt it your majesty so it is verina so it is dara said she did not look at krispos she knew how tiny and fragile a bubble privacy was in the palaces for his part krispos understood for a new reason why vestiarioi were traditionally eunuchs stand aside there you lumbering blond barbarians or ill turn the lot of you into yellow eels krispos watched with amusement as the halogai scrambled out of trokoundos way despite the mages big booming voice the northerners were far more imposing men than he all at least a head taller and twice as thick through the shoulders but they did not care to find out whether he meant his words literally trokoundos stamped up the broad steps water flew from puddles on them at every step you move too he snarled at krispos wipe your boots on this rug here first krispos said glowering trokoundos obeyed he trod so hard that krispos suspected he wished he werent stepping on mere carpet whats the trouble krispos asked shouldnt you be closeted with the emperor hes given me the sack thats what the trouble is the mage said i just spent seventeen goldpieces on new gear too and i expect to get paid back thats why im here of course if you can show me receipts for what you bought krispos said trokoundos rolled his eyes it would take a stronger wizard than i even dreamed of being to get money from anyone in the government without receiptsthink i dont know that here you are he pulled several folded pieces of parchment from the leather wallet he wore at his belt krispos felt his lips move as he added up the sums he checked himself then said seventeen it is come along with me ill pay you right now good trokoundos growled then ill never have to come back here again so i wont run the risk of bumping into his damnfoolness of a majesty and telling him just exactly what i think of him hearing a loud unfamiliar voice coming down the hall barsymes peered out of a dining room to see who it was hearing what the loud unfamiliar voice had to say about his lord and master the eunuch squeaked and pulled his head back in krispos opened a strongbox and counted out coins trokoundos snatched them from his hand now im not out anything but my patience and my digestion he said putting them into his wallet one by one may i ask what went wrong krispos said from what his majestys been saying hes felt hes made good progress oh he has hes a promising beginner maybe even better than promising he can be very quick when he wants to be and he has a good head for remembering what he learns but he wants everything at once that sounded like anthimos krispos thought he asked how so now that he has some of the basics down he wants to leap straight into major conjurationsblasting fires demons who knows what will cross his mind next whatever it is its sure to be something big enough and difficult enough to be dangerous if anything goes wrong i told him as much thats when he sacked me couldnt you have guided him through some of the things he wanted to do repaired any mistakes he might have made no for two reasons for one i wouldnt let any other apprentice ask that of me and his imperial majesty anthimos hi is no avtokrator of magic just another prentice krispos dipped his head to trokoundos respecting him very much for that the mage went on for another im not sure i could repair some of the things he wants to try if he botches them as badly as a prentice can to be frank with you esteemed and eminent sir i dont really care to find out either what happens if he goes on without you krispos asked in some alarm is he likely to kill himself and everyone for half a mile around if he was then this would be one time for petronas to clamp down hard on his nephew but trokoundos shook his head i dont think theres much danger of that you see as soon as he leaves his little laboratory today all his books of spells will go blank hes not the first rich dilettante ive tried to teach there is magic to reconstitute them but it has to be performed by the owner of the books and its not easy to work i dont think his majestys quite up to it and i doubt hed have the patience to retranscribe the texts by hand i didnt think hed do it the first time krispos agreed so youve left him without magic wont he just find himself another mage even if he does hell still have to start over from the beginning but no hes not altogether berefthell still be able to use whatever he has memorized phos willing thatll be enough to keep him happy krispos considered then slowly nodded i suspect it may most of what he wanted with it was to impress people at his feasts i thought as much trokoundos said scornfully he doesnt have a bad head for it or wouldnt but theres no discipline to him you cant succeed at anything unless youre willing to put in the hard work you need to learn your craft he glanced at krispos you know what im talking about i think ive done some wrestling krispos said then you know all right trokoundos gaze sharpened i rememberyoure the one who beat that kubrati arent you you werent vestiarios then i might have connected the name with the story sooner if i hadnt seen you in your fancy robes all the time no i wasnt vestiarios just a groom krispos said he smiled both at trokoundos and at the way his fortunes had changed i didnt think i was just a groom then if you know what i mean i grew up on a farm so anything else looked good by comparison ive heard that said yes the mage studied krispos as he had sometimes with tanilis he got the odd feeling he was transparent to the man id teach you sorcery if you wanted me to youd do what was needed i think and not complain but that isnt the craft youre learning is it what do you mean krispos asked trokoundos was already on his way out the door and did not answer cursed wizards always want the last word krispos muttered to himself anthimos was wild with fury when he discovered all his hardwon spells had disappeared ill have that bastards balls he shouted and his ears and nose too normally not a bloodthirsty soul he went on about pincers and knives and redhot needles until krispos worried that he might really mean it tried to calm him by sayingyoure probably just as well rid of the mage i dont think your uncle would like you studying anything as dangerous as sorcery to the ice with my uncle too anthimos said hes not the avtokrator and i bloody well am but when he sent a squad of halogai to arrest trokoundos sending a priest with them in case he resisted with magic they found his house empty knave must have fled to the hinterland the emperor declared with some satisfaction when they brought him the news by then his usual good humor had returned i daresay thats worse punishment than any i could inflict aye good riddance to bad rubbish said krispos who had quietly sent word to trokoundos to get out of the city for a while to krispos surprise and dismay anthimos did start recopying his tome of spells he never quite quit transcribing either but before long the pace of his work slowed to a crawl he turned one of his revels inside out with a spell that made cabbage intoxicating for a night and left wine mild as milk you see he triumphantly told krispos the next morning i am a mage even if that stinking trokoundos tried to keep me from being one did you hear how they cheered me last night when the wizardry worked just as i said it would yes your majesty krispos said his stomach rumbled like distant thunder hed eaten too much cabbage the night before given a choice he would far soon have got drunk on wine had he got drunk on wine he might have chewed cabbage leaves to ease his morningafter pains he wondered if a cup of wine would cure a cabbage hangover laughing he decided to find out midwinters day came and went one whole section of the amphitheater was full of soldiers as soon as the roads froze after the fall rains petronas had begun calling in levies from the eastern provinces for his war on makuran they made a raucous audience drinking hard then cheering and booing each skit as the fancyor the wineseized them the hangover that bedeviled krispos the morning after midwinters day had nothing to do with cabbageand did not want to yield to it either the wines he drank now were smoother and sweeter than the ones hed quaffed on holidays past but that did not mean they were exempt from giving retribution nor did it mean he wanted to go back to the rougher vintages hed formerly known ypatios was far from the only prominent man willing and eager to pay for influence with the emperor some he could not help some he did not want to help he refused their gold what he took in from the rest made him welltodo even by the standards of videssos the city he bought a horse he took mavros along when he went to the market not far from the forum of the ox nice to know you have confidence in me mavros said lets see what kind of horrible screw i can stick you with i like that krispos said is that your way of showing thanks for getting named chief groom now that you mention it yes the jobs too much like work i liked lying around on my arse as a spatharios a lot better if i werent working with horses i really would resent you what would your mother say if she heard you talking so fondly of shirking what she usually says i expectstop complaining and get to it the first dealer they tried was a plump little man named ibas whose eyes were so round and moist and trustworthy that krispos grew wary at once the horse trader bowed low but not before he had checked the cut and fabric of their robes if you are seeking a riding animal my masters i can show you a magnificent gelding not above seven years old he said yes show us mavros said on seeing the animal krispos was encouraged magnificent was too fine a word for it but hed expected as much sellers of horseflesh sucked in hyperbole with their mothers milk but the horses limbs were sound its dark roan coat well tended and shining mavros only grunted lets see the teeth nodding ibas walked with him up to the animals head you see he said while mavros made his examination the four middle teeth in each jaw are nicely oval and the markor cavity as some call itin the center of each tooth is quite as deep and dark as it should be i see a horse with a mouth full of spit mavros complained he looked thoughtfully at the small gap between the horses upper and lower incisors perhaps well be back another day master ibas thank you for showing him to us politely but firmly he steered krispos toward another dealer what was wrong with him krispos asked i rather fancied his looks seven ibas claimed that horse is twelve if hes a day good old master ibas is what they call a prelatehe takes away his horses sins usually with a file he has a nice touch with the animals mouth so wet i couldnt quite be sure of the rasp marks but if you file down a horses front teeth to give them the proper shape for a young animal they wont quite meet because you havent done anything to the teeth in the back of the horses mouth and if ibas has one like that hell have half a dozen so we dont want to do business with him im glad youre with me krispos said i might have bought the beast for i did like him so would i were he sold for what he was but to try to knock five years off himno dont look so glum my friend theres more horses to suit you than just that one all we have to do is keep looking look they did all that day and part of the next at length with mavros approval this time krispos bought a bay gelding of about the same age as ibas had claimed for the roan by the teeth this one really is seven or eight mavros said not a bad animal at all he wouldnt be the worstlooking horse in petronas stablea long way from the best but not the worst either the bestlooking animal in that stable is petronas show horse and i wouldnt race him against a donkey krispos said something to that too mavros patted the bays neck i hope he serves you well so do i even if the gelding spent most of the time in the stable as it might very well krispos was pleased just to have it owning a horse was another sign of how far hed come no one in his village had owned a horse till they beat the kubratoi afterward the animals had been owned in common in the city hed cared for other peoples horses and borrowed them when he needed to ride now he had one of his own and the hands in the imperial stables could see to its daytoday care that wasnt the proper attitude for a noble but he didnt care nobles tended animals because they wanted to not because they had to having had to he didnt want to not any more what will you call him mavros asked i hadnt thought krispos did after a little while he smiled i have it the perfect name mavros waited expectantly krispos said ill call him progress anthimos essayed a spell to keep snow off the path that led to the hall where he held his feasts he only succeeded in turning the snow on the path bright blue the miscarried magic left him undismayed ive always wanted to revel till everything turned blue he said and heres my chance as you say your majesty krispos sent men with shovels to clear the tinted snow from the path so the emperor and his guests could get to their revel he wondered if anthimos had learned a spell to heat the hall fireplaces only reached so far he doubted ita magic so practical was not one likely to have appealed to the emperor or to have stuck in his memory if hed ever learned it the revel itself krispos enjoyed at least for a time but a steady diet of such carouses had begun to pall for him he looked round for anthimos the emperor was enjoying the attentions of an astonishingly limber girlone of the evenings acrobats krispos saw when she assumed a new position there were times krispos had found out when anthimos did not mind being interrupted in such pursuits but he did not think asking permission to leave was important enough to bother him over he just handed the bowl of chances to another servitor found his coat and departed the moon shone through patchy clouds in its pale light the snow the emperor had colored looked almost black making a strange border to the path when krispos got back to the imperial residence he found that the haloga guards had another word for it isnt that the stupidestlooking thing you ever saw one of them said pointing krispos looked back toward the feasthall at the long blackish ribbon against the proper white snow that had come drifting down from phos sky now that you mention it yes the halogai laughed one of them a veteran whod served the emperor for years thumped him on the back you all right krispos he said in his northern accent we make jokes like that with skombros he tell anthimos maybe we all shipped back to halogaland the rest of the guardsmen nodded thank you vagn krispos said praise from the big blond warriors always pleased him youll go home one day i suppose but better its when you want to vagn thumped him again this time almost hard enough to pitch him down the steps into the snow aye you understand honor the haloga boomed in delight he swung up his axe in salute then held the door wide as he might have for anthimos go in warm yourself krispos was glad to take vagns advice the heating ducts under the floor gave some relief from the chill outside but when he got to his room he lit a brazier all the same he warmed his hands over it stayed close by the welcome heat until his ears and nose began to thaw just as he started to take off his coat the bell by his bed rang this time he knew anthimos had not followed him home but by now he was used to latenight summonses from the empress every so often she liked to talk with him your majesty he said as he came into the imperial bedchamber dara waved him to a chair by the side of the bed she was sitting up but on this cold night shed drawn blankets and furs over her shoulders krispos left the door open sometimes maidservants or eunuchs up raiding the larder peered in at them once anthimos had come in while he and dara were talking about horses that was a nervous moment for krispos but the avtokrator far from being angry had flopped down on the other side of the bed and argued with them till dawn before krispos sat down he asked may i bring you anything majesty no i thank you but not tonight is his majesty on his way too remembering how anthimos had been engaged when he left krispos answered i dont think so something in his voice must have told more than hed intended why what was he doing dara asked sharply when he could not come up with a plausible lie on the spur of the moment she said never mind i suspect i can figure it out for myself she turned her head away from him for a moment i find ive changed my mind i might like some wine after all bring the jar not just a cup yes your majesty krispos hurried away when he came back dara said you may get another cup for yourself if you care to no thank you i had enough at reminding dara of the revel did not seem a good idea ive had enough krispos said and let it go at that have you how lucky you are the empress drank wordlessly held out the cup to krispos he refilled it she drank about half then slammed the cup down so hard that wine splashed onto the night table whats the use sober or drunk i still know krispos found a rag and walked up to the night table to wipe away the spilled wine know what your majesty what do you think krispos dara said bitterly shall i spell it out in words a child can understand all right if you want me to know that my husbandthe avtokrator his majesty whatever you want to call himis out enjoying himself with no lets mince no words at all shall we is out fornicating with some new harlot again for let me see the third night this week or is it the fourth i do lose track sometimes or am i wrong krispos she looked up at him her eyes brimming but her face tensed with the effort to hold back the tears can you tell me im wrong now krispos could not meet her gaze nor answer in words facing the wall he shook his head so that is what i know dara said ive known it for years by the lord with the great and good mind ive known it since a couple of days after they put the flower crowns of marriage on us in the high temple most of the time i manage not to think of it but when i cant help it she stopped for most of a minute when i cant help it its very bad and i dont know why your majesty krispos said why dara repeated why does he do it he doesnt hate me hes even kind to me when hes here and when he remembers to be so why then krispos can you tell me krispos turned back toward her your majesty if youll forgive my speaking up so bold ive wondered over that since the first morning i saw you she might not have heard him can it be that he doesnt want me could i repel him so suddenly she swept the coverings from the bed beneath them as usual she wore nothing would ido irepel you krispos no your majesty his throat was dry hed seen the empress nude countless times now she was naked he watched her nipples stiffen from the chill in the roomor for another reason he spoke her name for the first time oh no dara he breathed lies come easy with words she said softly shut the doors then well see he almost went through the doorway instead of merely to it he knew she wanted him more for revenge on anthimos than for himself and if he was caught in her bed he might stay on as vestiarios but likely after he was made like the others who had held that office but he wanted her hed been uneasily aware of that for months however hard he tried to suppress it even from himself anthimos he thought would be occupied for some time yet a eunuch or maidservant coming by would think the empress here alonehe hoped he closed the doors dara felt the danger too hurry she held out her arms to him slipping out of his robe was the work of a moment he got down on the bed beside her she clutched him as if she were drowning at sea and he a floating spar hurry she said again this time into his ear he did his best to oblige he thought of the sea once more as he separated from her some time laterthe stormy sea his lips were bruised he began to feel the scratches shed clawed in his back and hed wondered if she was without passion his majesty he said sincerely is a fool why dara asked why do you think he stroked her midnight hair she purred and snuggled against him but reluctantly he left the bed id better dress he got into his robe as fast as hed taken it off dara slid back under the covers he opened the doors again then loosed a great sigh of relief out into the empty hallway we got away with it so we did daras eyes shone she gestured him back to the chair that was his correct place in this room im glad we did glad we got away with it krispos shudder was not altogether exaggerated if we hadnt hed already thought once about consequences of not getting away with it once was plenty dara shook her head im glad we did what we did she cocked her head and studied him youre different from anthimos her voice was low no one coming down the hall could have made out her words am i krispos said as neutral a response as he could find silence stretched between them finally because she seemed to want him to he asked how everything he does everything he has me do is for his pleasure first mine only afterward if at all dara said that sounded like anthimos krispos thought what had he said to dara that night when he called krispos while he was making love with her why did you slow down that was nice what you were doing the empress went on you i think were out to please me she hesitated as if she had trouble believing it well of course pity filled krispos the better for you the better for me too anthimos doesnt think that way dara said i didnt know anyone did how could i hes the only man ive ever been in bed with till now till now she repeated half gloating over doing once to the emperor what hed done so often to her half marveling at her own daring i ought to go back to my chamber krispos said dara nodded he got up from the chair went over to the bed and gave her a quick kiss she smiled up at him a lazy happy smile i may summon you again she said when he was almost at the door your majesty i hope you do krispos answered they both laughed the next thing i have to worry about krispos thought as he climbed into his own bed is not giving myself away when i go in there tomorrow morning hed had practice in that kind of discretion with tanilis he expected he could manage it again he hoped dara could too anthimos noticed nothing out of the ordinary so they must have done well enough krispos looked forward to the next time the little silver bell rang late at night krispos bowed low excellent sir i hope youre well well enough esteemed and eminent sir iakovitzes answering bow was as deep as krispos afterward the little noble sank gratefully into a chair well enough though this cursed leg will never be quite the same but thats not what i came here to talk with you about i wouldnt have thought it was krispos agreed he served iakovitzes wine and prawns in a sauce of mustard and ginger what did you come to talk about then before he answered iakovitzes made short work of the prawns he wiped his lips and mustache on a square of linen i hear the war with makuran will begin as soon as the spring rains stop he waved a hand at the drops splashing against the windowpane excellent sir thats hardly a secret krispos said the sevastokrators been mustering soldiers and supplies since last fall im quite aware of it thank you iakovitzes said tart as usual what im also aware of and what petronas seems to be blithely ignoring is that all the signs point to malomir coming down out of kubrat this spring too ive been in the phosforsaken place enough times over the years to hear what goes on there petronas does worry about kubrat krispos said slowly truly he does but hes been set on this war against makuran for years you know and now that hes finally ready to get on with it he doesnt want to listen to anything that might set it back again have you told him what you just told me every word and more its just as you saidhe doesnt want to listen he thinks the screen on the frontier will hold the wild men if they do attack he says iakovitzes raised an eyebrow they will he raised the tribute we pay kubrat last year didnt he krispos said trying to find a hopeful sign that might keep malomir quiet his illustrious highness may think so but malomirs no idiot if you give him money hell take it and when he decides to fight hell bloody well fight kubratoi like to fight you know you of all people should eh iakovitzes said troubled krispos nodded iakovitzes went on what we have in the north isnt enough to stop the wild men if they do come down in force everything i know makes me think theyre going to that could be most unpleasant yes krispos thought of his nieces carried off into captivity as he had beenif they were lucky he thought of what could happen to them if they were unlucky and to his sister and to everyone in his old village and to countless people hed never heard of how can we get petronas to hold up again and reinforce the north i cant the good god knows ive tried but you esteemed and eminent sir you have the ear of his majesty and if the avtokrator gives an order not even the sevastokrator may disobey iakovitzes grinned craftily and since by an accident of fate and former status about which i would not presume to bore you by reminding you of it i enjoy the good fortune of your acquaintance krispos grinned back you thought youd take advantage of it of course i did thats what having friends in high places is for after all ill see what i can do krispos promised good iakovitzes said id kiss you to show how pleased i am but youd probably go and use that notorious influence of yours to get me sent to the mines if i tried so ill just take my leave instead youre incorrigible by the good god krispos i certainly hope so krispos was laughing as he escorted his onetime master from the imperial residence the laughter faded when iakovitzes was no longer there to see apprehension replaced it if he tried to stop the war with makuran petronas would not be pleased with him and no matter how much influence he had with the emperor the sevastokrator was far more powerful than he and he knew it your imperial highness krispos murmured eyes on the ground as he went to one knee before petronas the sevastokrator frowned whats all this in aid of krispos you havent needed to be so formal with me for a long time and you know it thats all a waste of time anyhow and i have no time to waste right now not if im going west once the rains ease up so say what you have to say and have done yes illustrious highness krispos said petronas frown deepened krispos took a deep breath before he went on illustrious highness when you were gracious enough to help mebecome vestiarios i promised id speak to you first over any doubts i had about what you were doing im here today to keep that promise are you indeed had petronas been a lion his tail would have lashed back and forth very well esteemed and eminent sir you have my attention continue by all means now he too was formal dangerously so illustrious highness is it truly wise to use all the empires forces in your war against makuran are you sure youve left behind enough to keep the northern frontier safe he explained iakovitzes concerns about what malomir was going to do ive heard this myself petronas said when he was done it does not concern me i think it should though your imperial highness krispos said when he was done iakovitzes has had dealings with the kubratoi for twenty years or so now if anyone can divine what they plan hes the man and if he says theyre likely to attackwould you risk the north for the sake of the west given the choice yes petronas said the westlands are richer and broader in extent than the country between here and the kubrati border but i say to you what i said to iakovitzesthe choice does not arise malomir is being paid well to leave us at peace and the border is not altogether denuded as you seem to believe krispos thought of the thousands of soldiers who funneled through videssos the city on their way west those were the men whose presence made the kubratoi stay in their own domain surely malomir could not fail to notice they were gone when he said as much petronas answered you let that be my worry i say to you that the kubratoi will not attack and if i am wrong and they do harass us their bands will not be able to penetrate far past the frontier i am reassured to hear you say it illustrious highness but suppose you are mistaken krispos persisted could you stop fighting makuran and send soldiers back to the north that might not be easy no it might not the sevastokrator said but since it is not likely to become necessary either i do not intend to worry overmuch about it and even if everything you describe should come to pass ways remain of bringing the kubratoi to heel i assure you of that krispos raised a skeptical eyebrow would your imperial highness please explain them to me no by the lord with the great and good mind i will not listen to me esteemed and eminent sir though never a servant petronas had learned the art of using titles to cut rather than praise and listen well i need explain myself to no man in videssos save only the avtokrator himself and i do not expect to have to do that in this case do i make myself quite clear krispos aye illustrious highness petronas did not want him to raise the issue with anthimos krispos thought i will have to think on what to do though think carefully krispos now petronas spoke in unmistakable warning think very carefully indeed before you seek to measure your influence with his majesty against mine think also on the fate of skombros and on whether you care to spend the rest of your days in the bare cell of a celibate monk you would find that harder to endure than a eunuch does i assure you and yet it is the best fate to which you might aspire anger me sufficiently and you may know far worse remember it always believe me i will illustrious highness krispos rose to go he did his best not to show how his heart pounded but i will also remember what i think best for the empire he bowed his way out if nothing else he thought this marked the first time hed ever had the last word with petronas leaves glowed green under the spring suns cheerful rays the chatty trills of newly returned wagtails and chiffchaffs came through the open windows of the imperial residence along with the sunbeams and the sweet scent of the cherry blossoms now in riotous pink bloom all around the building krispos fetched a tray of wine and sweet pastries in to anthimos and petronas then contrived to hang about in the hallway outside the chamber where they were talking he had a dust rag and every so often made a swipe at one of the antiquities there but no one would have thought he was doing anything but eavesdropping the avtokrator and sevastokrator exchanged pleasantries before they got down to business krispos dusting hand jerked when petronas asked after dara shes quite well thanks anthimos answered she seems happy these days thats good his uncle said may she give you a son soon as he cleaned the helmet of the longago king of kings of makuran krispos thought with a small smile that the odds of daras conceiving had improved these days she had called him back to her bed after that first time again and again they still had to be cautious they took all the chances they could after more inconsequential talk anthimos said uncle may the good god grant you victory in your wars on makuran but are you certain you have left behind enough forces to hold back the kubratoi if they attack krispos stopped dusting altogether and craned his neck to make sure he heard petronas reply it took a while to come at last the sevastokrator said i do not think the kubratoi will launch any serious assaults this year but theyve already begun it seems to me anthimos rustled parchments see here i have two reports that have just arrived one from near imbros the other some distance farther east of raids by the wild men cattle and sheep stolen i dont like such reports they concern me under most circumstances the young emperor did not hear news of things that went wrong krispos though had made sure these reports came to his attention let me see them another pause presumably while petronas skimmed through the documents the sevastokrator snorted these are pinpricks as you must see anthimos the frontier guards drove off both bands without difficulty but what if they grow worse anthimos persisted the guards youve left behind would not be able to drive them off then krispos nodded to himself hed managed to get his own urgency through to the emperor sure enough i consider that most unlikely your majesty petronas said uncle im afraid i dont anthimos said if these attacks have begun already they will only get larger i really must insist that you strengthen the northern frontier with some of the troops youve shifted toward the westlands this time petronas was silent a long while insist he said as if he did not believe his ears he repeated the word insist nephew now he sounded as if he had caught anthimos in an obvious error and was waiting for the emperor to fix but anthimos though his voice wobbledkrispos knew his own would have wobbled too confronting petronas formidable presencesaid yes i really must even if that means gutting the campaign against makuran petronas asked softly even then anthimos said more firmly now after all i am the avtokrator certainly you are petronas said its only that im surprised to find you taking so sudden an interest in the conduct of matters military id thought i enjoyed your trust in such things his voice was a finely tuned instrument projecting now nothing but patience and reason you do hold my trust you know you do uncle anthimos said krispos feared he was weakening but he went on in this particular case though i think your own eagerness for the fight makes you less cautious than you have been in the past this is your final word your majesty it is anthimos could sound most imperial when he cared to krispos thought he wondered if that would be enough for him to impose his will on the sevastokrator it was and then again it was not after yet another long thoughtful pause petronas said your majesty you know your word is my command krispos knew what a lie that was he wondered if anthimos did he got no chance to find out for the sevastokrator continued perhaps though you will be gracious enough to let me propose a solution that permits me to keep the entire army yet will confound the kubratoi go ahead anthimos said cautiously as if like krispos he was wondering how petronas proposed to accomplish the two goals that seemed incompatible thank you anthimos i will perhaps you remember hearing of a haloga mercenary band led by a northerner called harvas blackrobe well yes now that you mention it theyve been making mischief for a while in khatrish havent they thatagush actually your majesty ive taken the liberty of inquiring of this harvas what he would require to fall upon kubrat instead if his northerners do that malomir will be far too occupied with them to give us any trouble for some time to come all without the use of a single good videssian soldier what say you to that it was the avtokrators turn to hesitate out in the hall krispos kicked at the polished marble floor petronas had indeed had a scheme in reserve and a good scheme to boot krispos learned what being outmaneuvered felt like uncle ill have to give that some thought anthimos said at last go ahead but i hope youll think quickly for now that the weather is fine once more every campaigning day lost counts against me petronas said youll know my decision tomorrow the avtokrator promised good enough petronas said jovially krispos heard him set down his cup then heard the chair shift under him as he got to his feet he started to duck into another roomhe did not want to face the sevastokrator right now but he was either too slow or too noisy for petronas came in after him as protocol required he went to one knee before the man with the second highest rank in the empire of videssos your imperial highness he said eyes on the ground look at me esteemed and eminent sir petronas said unwillingly krispos obeyed the sevastokrators face was hard and cold his voice flat i did not intend throwing a fox out of the vestiarios chamber only to replace him with a lion ive warned you not once but many times that you would pay for disobeying me all that remains is deciding how to punish you for your disobedience i thought you were wrong to bare the border with kubrat krispos said stubbornly i told you as much and i still think so i dont like your new plan much better how much harm can a mercenary company do to a big country like kubrat probably not enough to keep the wild men from going on with their raids against us thatagush is twice the size of kubrat and harvas raiders have kept it in chaos for years petronas nodded to krispos that you dont grovel before me speaks well of you given age and experience you could grow to be truly dangerous i doubt youll have the chance to gain them though krispos started to say that anthimos would protect him against the sevastokrator he stoppedhe knew better the sevastokrators will was far stronger than his nephews one way or another even if anthimos ordered him not to he would strike at krispos anthimos might be sorry krispos was gone at least until he got used to the quiet safe eunuch who would undoubtedly replace him dara would miss him more but neither of them could keep petronas from doing as he liked in the city flight if anyone in the empire could track him down petronas could besides he thought what good was it to run away from the friends and allies he had getting rid of him might be harder here than on some lonely country road better to stay and do what he could now still on that one knee he met petronas eyes may i rise your highness go ahead petronas said youll fall again soon enough krispos did his best to talk anthimos out of letting petronas use harvas blackrobes halogai instead of videssian troops against the kubratoi anthimos listened and shook his head but why your majesty krispos protested even if the mercenaries do turn kubrat topsyturvy kubrati raiders will still wound your northern provinces even being reminded by that you that the empire was his personally did not change anthimos mind maybe they will but not that badly why should a little trouble on the frontier concern me it can be set to rights later what was to anthimos a little trouble on the frontier seemed a disaster in the making to krispos he wondered how the avtokrator would have felt if he had a sister nieces a brotherinlaw only too close to the wild men but nothing that did not directly affect anthimos was real to him with as much control as he could muster krispos said your majesty truly the invasion you admit will happen could be stopped if we put our soldiers back where they belong you know its so maybe it is anthimos said but if i let petronas go ahead hell be out of my hair for months think of the revels i could enjoy while hes not around the avtokrator leered in anticipation krispos tried to hide his disgustwas this the way an emperor chose war or peace then anthimos face changed all at once he was as serious as krispos had ever seen him he went on quietly besides when it comes right down to it i dont dare tell my uncle not to use the soldiers hes spent all this time mustering why not krispos said are you the avtokrator or arent you i am now anthimos answered and id like to keep being the avtokrator a while longer too if you know what i mean suppose i order my uncle not to take his army to makuran dont you think the first thing hed use it for after that would be to throw me down then hed march on makuran anyway and id miss all those lovely revels i saw you sneering about a moment ago abashed krispos hung his head after a little thought he realized anthimos was right he was surprised the emperor could see so clearly when anthimos wanted to be he was able enough trouble was most of the time he didnt bother krispos mumbled thank you for backing me as far as you did then your majesty when i thought taking so many men west would pose a bad risk in the north i was willing to argue with petronas but since hes managed to find a way to enjoy himself and have a good chance of checking the kubratoi at the same time why not let him have his fun he doesnt begrudge me mine krispos bowed he knew hed lost this duel with petronas as your majesty wishes of course he said yielding as graciously as he could thats a good fellow i dont want to see you glooming about anthimos grinned at krispos especially since theres no need for gloom a good carouse tonight to wash the taste of all this boring business weve had to do out of our mouths and well both feel like new men the grin got wider or if you feel like a woman instead i expect that can be arranged krispos did feel like a woman that evening but not one of the complacent girls who enlivened the avtokrators feasts he wished he could talk with tanilis to find out how badly she thought being bested by petronas would hurt him since tanilis was far away dara would do though he still thought her chief loyalty lay with anthimos rather than with himanthimos was avtokrator and he was nothe was sure she preferred him to anthimos uncle but when as he had a good many times before he tried to leave the revel early the emperor would not let him i told you i didnt want you glooming about i expect you to have a good time tonight he pointed to a statuesque brunette she looks like shed be a good time the woman krispos wanted was back at the imperial residence telling the emperor so seemed impractical krispos had taken a couple of girls at the revels just so anthimos would not notice anything out of the ordinary but now he said im not in the mood for it this evening i think ill go over to the wine and drink for a while without a doubt drinking fell within the emperors definition of a good time i know what you need anthimos exclaimed he snatched the clear crystal bowl out of krispos hands here take a chance youve been dealing them out for so long you havent been able to be on the grabbing end obediently krispos reached into the bowl and drew out a golden ball he undid it then unfolded the parchment inside twentyfour pounds of horse manure he read anthimos laughed so hard he almost dropped the bowl grinning servants presented krispos with his prize he looked at the stinking brown mound and shook his head well its been that kind of day the next day was no better he had to greet petronas when the sevastokrator came to hear what anthimos had decided then he had to endure petronas smirk of triumph after the emperors uncle emerged from being closeted with his nephew his majesty is delighted that i set out for the westlands within the week petronas said of course he isthis way you wont kill him and stick his head on the milestone in the plaza of palamas for the crowds to gape at krispos thought aloud he said may you triumph your illustrious highness oh i shall petronas said first into vaspurakan the princes good soldiers all will surely flock to me for they follow phos even if they are heretics and will be glad to escape from the rule of those who worship the fourfalseprophets and thenon toward mashiz krispos remembered what iakovitzes had said about the centuries of inconclusive warfare between videssos and makuran petronas planned trip to mashiz would be quick and easy if his foes cooperated if not it was liable to take longer than the sevastokrator expected may you triumph he said again what a smooth liar youve turned into when youd sooner see me ravens meat thats not likely though im afraid no indeed and in any event as i told you before your punishment awaits you i dont think it will wait long enough for you to see me at all any more let alone in my victorious return a very good afternoon to you esteemed and eminent sir petronas swaggered away krispos stared at his retreating back he sounded very sure of himself what was he going to do hire a band of bravoes to storm the imperial residence bravoes who tangled with the emperors halogai would end up catmeat and whatever krispos ate anthimos ate too unless petronas wanted to be rid of his nephew along with krispos poison was unlikely and he showed no sign of wanting to be rid of his nephew not so long as he got his way what did that leave not much krispos thought if i lay low until petronas heads west the sevastokrator could hire assassins from afar but krispos did not greatly fear a lone assassin he was a good enough man of his hands to hope to survive such an attack maybe petronas was only trying to make him afraid and subservient once moreor maybe his anger would cool away in the westlands no krispos feared that was wishful thinking petronas was not the sort to forget an affront a few days later troops under the sevastokrators command marched and rode down to the docks anthimos came to the docks too and made a fiercely martial speech the soldiers cheered gnatios the patriarch prayed for the armys success the soldiers cheered again then they lined up to be loaded onto ferries for the short journey over the cattlecrossing the narrow strait that separated videssos the city from the empires western provinces krispos watched the tubby ferryboats waddle across the water to the westlands watched them go aground watched as tiny in the distance the warriors began to clamber down onto the beaches across from the city saw the bright spring sunlight sparkling off someones armor that would be a general he thought maybe even petronas himself no matter how the sevastokrator threatened he was far less frightening on the other side of the cattlecrossing anthimos must have been thinking the same thing well he said turning at last to go back to the palaces the city is mine for a while by phos with no one to tell me what i must or must not do theres still me your majesty krispos said ah but you do it in a pleasant tone of voice and so i can ignore you if i care to the emperor said my uncle now i never could ignore no matter how hard i tried krispos nodded but wondered if petronas would agreethe sevastokrator seemed convinced his nephew ignored him all the time but having the wolf away from his door prompted krispos to carouse with the best of them at the revel anthimos put on that night to celebrate the armys victory in advance as the avtokrator said he was drinking wine from a large golden fruit bowl decorated with erotic reliefs when a haloga guardsman came in and tapped him on the shoulder somebody out there wants to see you the northerner said krispos stared at him somebody out where he asked owlishly the haloga stared back out there he said after a long pause krispos realized the guardsman was even drunker than he was ill come krispos said he had almost got to the door when his sodden brain realized he was in no condition to fight off a toddler let alone an assassin he was about to turn around when the haloga grabbed him by the arm and propelled him down the stairsnot apparently with malicious intent but because the northerner needed help standing up himself krispos someone called from the darkness mavros he got free of the haloga and stumbled toward his foster brother what are you doing here i thought you were on the other side of the cattlecrossing with petronas and the ret of his restinuerest of his retinue he corrected himself carefully i was and i will be again sooni cant afford to be missed ive got a little rowboat tied up at a quay not far from here i had to come back across to warn you petronas has hired a mage i came into his tent to ask him which horse hed want tomorrow and he and the wizard were talking about quietly getting rid of someone they named no names while i was there but i think its you xi certainty washed through krispos like the tide youre right you have to be even drunkperhaps more clearly because he was drunkhe could see that this was just how petronas would deal with someone who had become inconvenient to him it was neat and clean with the sevastokrator far away from any embarrassing questions assuming they were ever asked what are you going to do mavros said the question snapped krispos out of his rapt admiration for petronas cleverness he tried to flog his slow wits forward find a wizard of my own i suppose he said at last that sounds well enough mavros agreed whatever you do do it quicklyi dont think petronas will wait long and the mage he was talking with seemed a proper readyforaught now i have to get back before im missed the lord with the great and good mind be with you he stepped up embraced krispos then hurried away krispos watched him disappear into darkness and listened to his footfalls fade till they were gone he thought how fortunate he was to have such a reliable friend in the sevastokrators household then he remembered what he had to do wizard he said aloud as if to remind himself staggering slightly he started out of the palace quarter he was almost to the plaza of palamas before he consciously wondered where he was going he only knew one sorcerer at all well though he was glad he hadnt been the one whod antagonized trokoundos otherwise he thought anthimos former tutor in magecraft would have been more likely to join petronas wizard than to help fend him off trokoundos lived on a fashionable street not far from the palace quarter krispos pounded on his door not caring that it was well past midnight he kept pounding until trokoundos opened it a crack the mage held a lamp in one hand and a most unmystical short sword in the other he lowered it when he recognized krispos by phos esteemed and eminent sir have you gone mad no krispos said trokoundos drew back from the wine fumes he exuded he went on im in peril of my life i need a wizard i thought of you trokoundos laughed are you in such peril that it wont wait till morning yes krispos said trokoundos held the lamp high and peered at him youd better come in he said as krispos walked inside the wizard turned his head and called im sorry phostina but im afraid i have business a womans voice said something querulous yes ill be as quiet as i can trokoundus promised to krispos he explained my wife sit here if you care to and tell me of this peril of yours krispos did by the time he finished trokoundos was nodding and rubbing his chin in calculation youve made a powerful enemy esteemed and eminent sir presumably he will have in his employment a powerful and dangerous mage you know no more than you are to be assailed no krispos said and im lucky to know that so you are so you are but it will make my task more difficult for i will be unable to ward against any specific spells but will have to try to protect you from all magics such a stretching will naturally weaken my own efforts but i will do what i may honor will not let me do less not after your gracious warning of his majestys wrath come along to my study if you please the chamber where trokoundos worked his magics was one part library one part jewelers stall one part herbarium and one part zoo it smelled close and moist and rather fetid krispos stomach flipflopped holding down his gorge with grim determination he sat across from trokoundos while the wizard consulted his books trokoundos slammed a codex shut rolled up a scroll tied it with a ribbon and put it back in its pigeonhole since i do not know what form the attack upon you will take i will use all three kingdomsanimal vegetable and mineralin your defense he went over to a large covered bowl and lifted the lid here is a snail fed on oregano a sovereign against poisonings and other noxiousnesses of all sorts eat it if you would krispos gulped id sooner have it broiled with butter and garlic no doubt but prepared thus its virtue aims only at the tongue do as i say now crack the shell and peel it as if it were a hardcooked egg then swallow the creature down trying not to think about what he was doing krispos obeyed the snail was cold and wet on his tongue he gulped convulsively before he could notice what it tasted like gagging he wondered whether it would still protect him if he threw it up again very good trokoundos said ignoring his distress now then the juice of the narcissus or asphodel will also aid you here is some mixed with honey to make it palatable krispos got it down after the snail it was palatable trokoundos went on i will also wrap a dried asphodel in clean linen and give it to you carry it next to your skin it will repel demons and other evil spirits may the good god grant it be so krispos said when trokoundos gave him the plant he tucked it under his tunic mineral mineral mineral trokoundos muttered he snapped his fingers the very thing he rummaged among the stones on a table by his desk held up a darkbrown one here i have chalcedony which if pierced by an emery stone and hung round the neck is proof against all fantastical illusions and protects the body against ones adversaries and their evil machinations this is known as the counsel of chalcedony now where did that emery go he rummaged some more until he finally found the hard stone he sought he clamped the chalcedony to the table and began to bore through it with the pointed end of the emery stone as he worked he chanted a wordless little song the power we seek lies within the chalcedony itself the mage explained my chant is but to hasten the process that would otherwise be boring in two senses of the word ahh here we are he worked a bit longer to enlarge the hole he had made then held out the chalcedony to krispos have you a chain on which to wear it yes krispos drew the chain on which he kept the goldpiece omurtag had given him up over his head trokoundos stared at the coin as it gleamed in the lamplight my my he said slowly what company my little stone will keep he seemed about to ask krispos about the goldpiece then shook his head no time for my curiosity now may the stone the plant and the snail keep you safe thats all thank you krispos put the stone onto the chain closed the catch and slid the chain back onto his neck now then what do i owe you for your services not a copper seeing as id likely not be here to render those services had you not warned me the city would be unhealthy for a few weeks no i insistthis wont bankrupt me i assure you thank you krispos repeated bowing i had better get back to the imperial residence he turned to go then had another thought not that i fail to trust your charms but can i do anything to make them work even better he hoped the question would not offend trokoundos evidently it didnt for the mage answered promptly pray the lord with the great and good mind opposes all wicked efforts and may well hear your sincere words and grant you his protection having a priest pray for you may also do some good as phos holy men are sworn against evil the good god naturally holds them in high regard ill do both those things krispos promised as soon as he could he thought with winefueled intensity hed see gnatios and ask for his prayers who could be holier than the ecumenical patriarch good i will pray for you as well trokoundos said he yawned enormously whether that was a real yawn or a hint krispos knew it was time to go he thanked the wizard one last time and took his leave dawn had already begun to pink the eastern sky krispos murmured two prayers to phos one for his own safety and the other that anthimos would sleep late you were a busy lad last night anthimos said roguishly as krispos held up a robe for his approval the emperor had slept late but not late enough krispos head ached anthimos went on you werent in your chamber when i got back did you go off with one of the wenches was she good without looking her way krispos sensed dara listening closely for his reply not a wench your majesty he said an old friend came to pay me a bet he owed and afterward he and i went off and did a little more drinking you should have told me before you left the emperor said come to that you could have brought your friend in who knows he might have livened things up yes your majesty sorry your majesty krispos robed anthimos then went to the closet to get his masters red boots as he turned he got a brief glimpse of dara he hoped that he and i had eased her mind it had the advantage of being at least partly true if she checked she was sure to find someone who had seen him with mavros he hoped she would if she thought he was betraying her she had only to speak to anthimos to destroy him he did not like being so vulnerable to her maybe he should have worried more about that before he got into bed with her he thought now was far too late anthimos went off to the amphitheater as soon as he had finished breakfast krispos stayed behind at the imperial residence for a little while then headed for the patriarchs mansion gnatios was domiciled in the northern part of videssos the city in the shadow of the high temple you are a lesser priest haughtily asked at the door looking down his nose at krispos i am the vestiarios to his imperial majesty anthimos iii avtokrator of the videssians i would have speech with the ecumenical patriarch at once he folded his arms and waited he hoped he sounded arrogant rather than anxious only petronas and his mage knew when they would unleash their assault he might need gnatios prayers right away he must have hit the proper tonethe priest deflated yes uh esteemed uh eminent sir esteemed and eminent krispos snapped yes yes of course my apologies the most holy sir is in his study come this way please chattering nervously and bowing every few steps the priest led him through the mansion the artworks on the walls and set into niches were as fine as those in the imperial residence but krispos hardly noticed them he followed close on his guides heels wishing the fellow would move faster gnatios looked up frowning from the codex on his desk curse it badourios i told you i did not wish to be disturbed this morning then he saw who was behind the lesser priest and rose smoothly from his chair of course i am always glad to make an exception for you krispos sit here if you care to will you take wine no thank you most holy sir krispos said having mercy on his hangover may i ask for privacy though you have only to reach behind you and close that stout door there gnatios said krispos did as he suggested the patriarch leaned forward over the desk between them youve roused my curiosity esteemed and eminent sir now privately what do you require your prayers most holy sir for i have discovered that i am in danger of magical attack as he started to explain to gnatios he realized that coming here was a mistake a large mistake his stomach knotted from something other than his hangover not only did the patriarch belong to petronas faction he was the sevastokrators cousin krispos could not even tell him who had brought news of his danger for that might put mavros at risk thus he knew his story limped as it came out gnatios gave no sign of noticing of course i shall pray for you esteemed and eminent sir he said fulsomely if you will give me the name of the man who so bravely brought word of this plot against you i will pray for him as well his courage should not go unrewarded the words were right the tone was sincerea little too sincere suddenly krispos was certain that if he let mavros name slip out the patriarch would get it to petronas as fast as he could and so he answeredmost holy sir i fear i dont know heruh hisname he came to me because he said he could not bear to see his master treat me unjustly i dont even know who herhismaster is with luck those pretended slips would keep gnatios from guessing how much krispos knew and how he knew it you will be in my thoughts and prayers for some time to come the patriarch said yes but how krispos wondered thank you holy sir youre very kind he said he bowed his way out pondering what to do next ducking into a wineshop a few doors down the street from the patriarchal mansion let him ponder sitting down he suspected gnatios prayers would not be for his continued good health who then could intercede with phos for him while he sat and thought about that a priest rushed past the wineshop so close to the high temple blue robes were as common as fleas but the fellow looked familiar after a moment krispos recognized him badourios gnatios doorkeeper where was he going in such a hurry after tossing a couple of coppers on the table for the rather stale cake hed eaten krispos slipped after him to find out badourios was easy to follow he did not seem to imagine he could be pursued his destination soon became obvious the harbor which meant krispos was sure that as soon as he got over the cattlecrossing petronas would know his plans were no longer hidden from their intended victim and that in turn meant krispos surely had very little time it also meant everything hed suspected about gnatios was true and then some but that for now was a side issue through his robe krispos touched the chalcedony amulet trokoundos had given him the mage had as much as said the amulet the asphodel and the raw snail were not enough by themselves to ward him fully he started back toward the high temple intending to ask the first priest he saw to beseech phos to protect him most bluerobes were fine men he was willing to gamble on one chosen at random then he had a better idea the abbot pyrrhos had touched his life twice already and not only was pyrrhos notably holy he was also bound to treat krispos like his own son krispos turned angry at himself for not having thought of pyrrhos sooner the monastery dedicated to the memory of the holy skirios wasthat way krispos headed for it faster than badourios had gone to the harbor the gatekeeper made him wait outside the monastery the brethren just began their noontime prayers they may not be disturbed for any reason krispos drummed his fingers on the wall until the monks began filing out of the temple on the monastery grounds the gatekeeper stood aside to let him pass their shaven heads and identical robes gave the monks no small uniformity but pyrrhos tall lean erect figure stood out among them holy sir abbot pyrrhos krispos called all the while he kept expecting the spell from petronas mage to smash him down in the dust the delay forced while the monks prayed might have given the wizard enough time to smite pyrrhos turned taking in krispos fine robe so different from the plain blue wool he wore scorn sparked in the abbots eyes then he recognized krispos his face changeda little i have not seen you in some while he said i gathered the loose life in the palaces was more to your liking than that which we live here krispos felt himself flush the more so because what pyrrhos said held much truth he said holy sir i need your aid and waited to see what the abbot would do if pyrrhos only wanted to rant at him he would go find another priest and quickly but the abbot checked himself krispos saw he had not forgotten that strange night when krispos first came to the monastery of the holy skirios phos bids us aid all men that they may come to know the good pyrrhos said slowly come to my study tell me of your need thank you holy sir krispos breathed he followed the abbot through the narrow dimly lit corridors of the monastery hed walked this way once before he realized but he had been too bemused then to make special note of his surroundings the study he remembered like pyrrhos it was spare and hard and served its purpose without superfluity the abbot waved krispos to an unpadded stool perched on another and leaned forward like a bearded bird of prey what is this aid you say you require i would have thought you likelier to go to gnatios these days as he reckons most sins but a small matter pyrrhos was not a man to make things easy krispos thought but when he answered gnatios would not help me for the person from whom i need aid is the sevastokrator petronas he knew hed captured the abbots attention how did you fall foul of petronas pyrrhos asked did you presume to suggest to the emperor that his time might be better spent in attending to the duties of the state than in the wantonness and depravity in which with his uncles connivance he currently wallows something like that krispos said he had indeed tried to get anthimos to do more toward running the empire and because of it holy sir the sevastokrator though now out of the city on campaign seeks to slay me with sorcery ive been told the prayers of a priest might help blunt the magics power will you pray for my protection holy sir by the good god i will pyrrhos sprang to his feet and caught krispos by the arm come to the altar with me krispos and offer up your prayers as well the altar of the monastery temple was not of silver and gold and ivory and gems like the one in the high temple it was plain wood as befitted the simplicity of monastic life pyrrhos and krispos spat on the floor in front of it in ritual rejection of the dark god skotos phos eternal rival then they raised their hands to the heavens and spoke the creed together we bless thee phos lord with the great and good mind by thy grace our protector watchful beforehand that the great test of life may be decided in our favor krispos prayed on in silence pyrrhos more used to ordering his thoughts aloud kept speaking after the creed was done phos i beseech you to protect this upright young man from the evil that approaches him may he walk safe and righteous through it as he has walked safe through the iniquity of the palaces i pray for him as i would pray for my own son his eyes met krispos for a moment yes he remembered that first night krispos had come to the monastery will your prayer save me holy sir krispos asked when the abbot lowered his arms that is as phos wills pyrrhos answered and depends on what your future is meant to bealso ill not deny on the power of the sorcery sent against you though phos will vanquish skotos in the end the dark god still ranges free in the world i have prayed within me i pray yet may that suffice that and whatever other wardings you have pyrrhos was narrow but he was also straight he would not promise what he could not deliver at any other time krispos would have had only approbation for that now he thought a reassuring lie might have felt very good he thanked the abbot dropped a goldpiece into the monastery poorbox and started back to the palaces he spent the rest of the day in annoyed suspense if the wizard was going to strike he wished the fellow would strike and have done wondering whether he could withstand the attack seemed harder than waiting for it to come as he was carrying dinner in for anthimos and dara that evening he got his wish and as is often the way of such things he regretted ever making it he was just lowering a wide silver tray from his shoulder to the table at which the emperor and empress sat when the strength suddenly flowed from his body like wine pouring from a jug all at once the tray seemed to weigh tons despite his desperate grip it crashed to the floor anthimos and dara both jumped the empress let out a squeak that wasnt very good krispos anthimos said laying a finger by the side of his nose even if you think the meal is bad you should give us the chance to fling it about krispos tried to answer but only a croak came from his mouth he was not strong enough to force his tongue to shape words as dara began to ask are you all right his legs gave out from under him and he slid bonelessly down into the messy ruins of the dinner he had brought by luck he landed with his head to one side that let him keep breathing had he fallen face down in spilled soup or gravy he surely would have drowned for he could not have shifted to clear the muck from his mouth and nose he heard dara scream he could not see her his eyes pointed in the wrong direction and he could not move them each breath was a separate struggle for air his heart stuttered uncertain in his chest anthimos stooped beside him and rolled him onto his back breathing grew a precious trifle easier whats wrong krispos the emperor demanded staring down at him fetched by the racket of the dropped tray and by daras scream servants rushed into the dining room hes had some sort of fit poor beggar anthimos told them barsymes said lets get him to his bed here tyrovitzes help me move him out of this muck grunting the two eunuchs pulled krispos away from the spilled food barsymes clicked tongue between teeth on second thought wed better clean him up before we put him into bed well just take him out to the hallway first as if he were a sack of lentils they dragged him away from the table and out of the dining room put him down a moment tyrovitzes said barsymes helped ease krispos to the marble flooring tyrovitzes went back into the dining room your majesties i am sorry for the disturbance someone will be along directly i assure you to clean up what was unfortunately spilled and to serve you a fresh meal had he been able to krispos would have snickered so sorry the vestiarios turned to a puddle of mush right before your eyes your majesties a fresh meal will be along directly so dont worry about it but had someone else been stricken in the same way he knew he also would have tried to keep things running smoothly that was how life worked in the palaces krispos can you hear me can you understand me barsymes asked though the answer to both was yes krispos could not give it he could only stare up at barsymes the eunuchs smooth face lengthened in thought if you do understand can you blink your eyes the effort was like lifting a boulder as big as he was but krispos managed to close his eyelids the world went frighteningly dark sweat burst out on his face as he fought to open his eyes again at last he succeeded he felt as worn as if a hundred harvests had all been pressed into one day he has his wits then tyrovitzes said yes barsymes laid a cool hand on krispos forehead no fever id say the good god willing we dont have to fear catchingwhatever this is the chamberlain undid krispos robe and eased his arms out of it as if he were a doll fetch water and towels if you would tyrovitzes well wash him and put him to bed and see if he gets better aye what else can we do tyrovitzes sandals flapped down the hall barsymes squatted on his heels studying krispos watching him in return krispos realized how helpless he was any small remembered slight any resentment the eunuch still felt at being passed over for a whole man and petronas magic would prevail even if it had notquitekilled him outright tyrovitzes came back setting a bucket next to krispos head without a word the two eunuchs set to work the water was chilly krispos found himself shivering movements not under his conscious control seemed to function after a fashion but that blink had been plenty to exhaust him he could not have raised a finger to save his soul from skotos ice the eunuchs hauled him down the corridor to the chamber that had once been skombros one two barsymes said at three he and tyrovitzes lifted krispos and put him on the bed krispos stared up at the ceiling he had no other choice if this was what the sevastokrators magic had done to him while he was warded he wondered what would have become of him without protection about the same thing he supposed that happened to a bull when the fellow at the slaughterhouse hit it between the eyes with his hammer he would have dropped down dead and that would have been that barsymes came back a little later with a wide flat pan as gently as he could he worked it under krispos buttocks you wont want to soil the sheets he observed krispos did his best to put a thankyou look on his blank face that hadnt occurred to him a lot about being completely unable to care for himself hadnt occurred to him over the dreadfully long dreadfully slow course of that summer and fall he found out about all of them the palace eunuchs kept him alive they cared for members of the imperial family at all phases of life sometimes they treated krispos like an infant sometimes like a senile old man longinos held him upright while barsymes massaged his throat to get him to swallow broth a spoonful at a time he watched himself grow thinner day by day physicians poked and prodded him and went away shaking their heads anthimos ordered a healerpriest to come see him the priest fell into a trance but woke from it baffled and defeated i am sorry your majesty but the illness has no cause upon which my talent can light he told the avtokrator that was only a few days after krispos was stricken for those first few days and for a while afterward anthimos was constantly in his chamber constantly making suggestions to the eunuchs about his care some of the suggestions were good ones he urged the eunuchs to roll krispos from side to side periodically to slow the start of bedsores but when krispos showed no signs of leaping to his feet and getting on with his duties as if nothing had happened the emperor began to lose interest not so much in him but in his case and came to see him less and less often although he did not leap to his feet ever so slowly krispos did begin to mend had he stayed as weak and limp as he was when the magic laid him low he likely would have died of slow starvation or from fluid puddling in his flaccid lungs the milestones he reached were small ones at first so small he scarcely noticed them himself for who pays attention to being able to blink or to cough from blinking and coughing though he progressed to swallowing on his own and then later still to chewing soft food he still could not speak that required control more delicate than his muscles could yet achieve being able to smile again and to frown seemed as valuable to him babies used no more to let people know how they felt krispos especially valued the return of expressiveness to his face when dara visited him she did not go into his chamber often certainly not as often as anthimos had after he was laid low but where anthimos lost interest in him because his condition changed so slowly dara kept coming back once in a while she would take a bowl and spoon from one of the eunuchs prop krispos up with pillows and feed him a meal barsymes tyrovitzes longinos and the rest of the chamberlains were gentler and neater than she was krispos did not care he was part of their duty she helped him only because she wanted to being able to smile back at her let her know he understood that though he could not answer she talked at him while she visited he picked up palace gossip and snatches of what went on in the wider world as well petronas he learned was advancing in makuranerheld vaspurakan but slowly the breakthrough the advance on mashiz of which the sevastokrator dreamed was nowhere in sight some of his generals had started to grumble hed even sent one packinga certain mammianos now found himself commanding the western coastal lowlands a rich province but one peaceful for so long as to be a graveyard for a righting soldier if petronas himself never came back from his western campaign krispos would not have shed a tearhad his condition allowed it he might have danced around the room he did hope mavros was all right krispos was less delighted to learn that petronas plan for handling kubrat looked to be working exactly as the sevastokrator had predicted harvas blackrobes haloga mercenaries falling on the kubratoi from the north left them too distracted to launch any large raids against the empire they say malomir may even lose his throne dara told krispos one warm summer evening wanting to hear more he widened his eyes and did his best to look attentive but instead of going on about the affairs of the kubratoi dara looked out toward the hallway quiet tonight she said mixed anger and hurt showed in her eyes a blend krispos had seen there before why shouldnt it be quiet anthimos has been out carousing since a little past noon and the good god alone knows when hell decide to honor us by coming back so a great many folk i have no doubt have gone off to pursue their own pleasures the empress laugh was full of selfmockery and with you in this state krispos i cant even do that can i i find ive missed you more than i thought i would dont you wish we could daras voice sank to a throaty whisper as she described what she wished they could do either her imagination was very fertile or shed been thinking for a long time krispos felt heat rise in him that had nothing to do with the weather something else also rose those parts of him not under full conscious control had always been less subject to petronas magic than the rest dara saw what her words had done after another quick glance to the door she reached out and stroked him through the bedclothes what a shame to waste it she said she stood up hurried out of the room when she came back she blew out the lamps she went outside again looked in and nodded dark enough krispos heard her say she walked over to the bed and drew back the covers the door to my bedchamber is closed she murmured to krispos anyone will think im there and no one can see in here from the hallway so if were quiet she slipped off her drawers she did not get out of her gown but hiked it up so she could lower herself onto krispos she moved slowly to keep the bed from creaking even so he knew he would explode too soon to please her nothing he could do about that though he thought through building ecstasy suddenly dara froze stifling a gasp that had nothing to do with passion krispos heard sandals in the hallway tyrovitzes walked past the door dara started to slide away but the movement made the bedframe start to groan she froze again krispos could not move at all but felt himself shrinking inside her as fear overpowered lust the eunuch did not even glance in but kept walking dara and krispos stayed motionless until he came back crunching on an apple once more he paid no attention to the dark doorway the sound of his footsteps and his chewing faded when everything was quiet again dara did get off the bed she covered krispos once more linen rustled against her skin as she slid her drawers up her legs im sorry she whispered that was a bad idea she slipped away this time she did not return too late krispos was aroused again with nothing whatever he could do about it a bad idea indeed he thought more than a little annoyed it had left everyone unsatisfied summer wore on one morning krispos woke up on his stomach for a moment he thought nothing of it then he realized he had rolled over in his sleep he tried to roll back again and succeeded after an effort that left him panting not long after that his speech returned first as a hoarse whisper then little by little tones that sounded more as he remembered he should as control slowly returned to his arms and legs he sat up in bed and then wobbly as any toddler stood on his own two feet that made anthimos notice him again splendid the avtokrator said good to see you on the mend i look forward to having you serve me again i look forward to it too your majesty krispos said and found himself meaning it after months of forced inactivity he would have looked forward to a long hot stint in the fields no he thought maybe to a short stint he did look forward to returning to the imperial bedchamber both when anthimos was occupying it and even more when he wasnt he found himself weak and clumsy as a pup he began to exercise at first the least labor was plenty to wear him out his strength slowly returned a few weeks before the fall rains came he went back to work he bought handsome presents for the chamberlains who had cared for him so well and so long this was not necessary barsymes said as he unwrapped a heavy gold chain the relief of having you on duty once more and no longer needing to try to keep up with his majesty at those feasts of his the eunuch shook his head but his long face usually sour wore a small grudging smile krispos decided he had spent his money wisely he soon reconnected himself to the tendrils of the grapevine he hardly needed to for the first piece of news that came in was on everyones lips not only had harvas blackrobes halogai smashed the kubratoi again they had seized pliskavos the capital and the only real city kubrat boasted by sorcery i hear they took it longinos said lowering his voice at the word and sketching the sunsign over his heart the bare mention of magic was enough to make krispos shudder all the same he shook his head sorcery doesnt work well in battle he said everyone is too keyed up for it to stick or so ive been told and i longinos agreed but i also know that my sources in the north do not lie the palace eunuchs heard everything and usually knew truth from rumor krispos scratched his head and worried a little he sent a note to iakovitzes if anyone really knew what was happening north of the paristrian mountains the little noble was the man the next day one of iakovitzes retainers brought an answering note everythings gone to the ice up there harvas is a worse murderer than any of the khagans ever dreamed of being maybe he is a wizard too i cant think of any other way for him to have won so quickly and easily krispos worried a little more but only for a couple of days then he found something more important to worry about a messenger sailed into videssos the city from the westlands with word that petronas was on his way home that news dismayed anthimos too hell be impossible the emperor said pacing back and forth the next morning while krispos tried to dress him impossible i tell you hes fought makuran all summer long and he hasnt gained two towns worth having hell be humiliated and hell take it out on me on you krispos thought but he held his tongue since he recovered enough to talk hed told no one the sevastokrator was to blame for his collapse he had no proof save mavros word and mavros was with petronas in the west but he exercised harder than ever and began working with his sword again petronas imminent return made anthimos start an incessant round of revels as if he feared he would never get another chance once his uncle was back krispos lingering weakness gave him the perfect excuse not to accompany his master to his carousings as hed hoped the silver bell in his chamber sometimes rang even when the avtokrator was away from the imperial residence after that dangerous fiasco while hed been recovering dara took fewer chances her summonses most often came well after midnight when the rest of the household could be counted on to be asleep sometimes though she called him openly in the early evening just for the sake of talk he did not mind on the contrary hed learned from tanilis that talk was intercourse too what do you think it will be like having petronas back again dara said on one of those early visits a few days before the sevastokrator was due perhaps im not the one to ask krispos answered cautiously you know he and i didnt agree about his campaign i ill say that the empire doesnt seem to have fallen apart while he was gone that was as far as he was willing to go he did not know how the empress felt about petronas he found out i wish the makurani had slain him she said hes done everything he could to keep anthimos first a boy and then a voluptuary so he can go on holding all the power in the empire in his own fists since that was inarguably true and since petronas had got krispos the post of vestiarios the better to control the emperor he kept quiet sighing dara went on i hoped that with petronas away from the city anthimos might come into his own and act as an avtokrator should but he hasnt has he she sadly shook her head i suppose i shouldnt have expected it by now he is as his uncle made him hes afraid of the sevastokrator too krispos said thats one of the reasons he let petronas go fight in the westlands for fear hed have used his army here in the city if he were thwarted i knew that dara said i didnt know anyone else did i think he was right to be afraid if petronas seized the throne what would become of anthimos or meor you come to that nothing good krispos answered dara was not made for convent lifethe best she could hope forand anthimos even less for the monastery krispos knew he himself would not be lucky enough to have a monastic cell saved for him he continued but anthimos has the power to override anything the sevastokrator does if only he can find the will to use it if only a world of cynical doubt lay behind daras words but he almost did this past spring krispos said not thinking until later how odd it was for him to be defending his lovers husband to her then petronas came up with using harvas brigands against kubrat and that gave anthimos an excuse for backing down so he did but i dont think he would have otherwise what do you think would have happened then ask the lord with the great and good mind not me anthimos is avtokrator aye but petronas had brought all those troops into the city they might have obeyed anthimos and then again they might not the only soldiers im sure are loyal to him are the halogai in the guards regiment and they wouldnt have been enough by themselves maybe its just as well he changed his mind yielding once makes yielding the next time easier dara turned her head to make an automatic scan of the doorway mischief sparked in her eyes her voice dropped as i should know and you as well krispos was glad enough to change the subject smiling with her he said aye your majesty and im glad thats so but he knew that was not what dara had meant at first and knew shed been right he wondered what anthimos would require to stiffen his back so he would not yield to petronas in a pinch the threat of something worse happening if he yielded than if he didnt krispos supposed or else a feeling that he could get away with defying his uncle unfortunately krispos had no idea where anthimos could come up with either of those if petronas was not returning from makuran in triumph he did his best to make sure the people of videssos did not know it he paraded two regiments of toughlooking troops from the silver gate up middle street to the palace quarter with carts carrying booty and a few dejected makuraner prisoners stumbling along in chains between mounted companies of his men he himself headed to procession on his splendid but otherwise useless show horse as the soldiers tramped through the city a herald cried out glory to his illustrious highness the sevastokrator petronas the pale death of the makurani phos sun shines through him the conqueror of artaz and hanzith of fis and bardaa and thelaw glory shouted the soldiers by the way they yelled and the herald proclaimed the names of the places petronas had captured anyone who did not know better would have taken them for great cities rather than vaspurakaner hamlets that all added together might have produced a town not much smaller than say imbros or opsikion and while phos sun may have shone through petronas it could not penetrate the thick gray clouds that overhung videssos the city rain drenched the sevastokrators parade some videssians stood under umbrellas and awnings and colonnades to cheer petronas troopers more stayed indoors krispos wore a widebrimmed hat of woven straw to keep off the worst of the rain as he watched petronas dismiss his soldiers to their barracks once they had traversed the plaza of palamas and gotten out of the public eye then the sevastokrator cold water dripping from his beard booted his horse into a slow trotthe only kind the animal possessedand rode for his lodging in the building that housed the grand courtroom anthimos received petronas the next day at krispos suggestion he did so in the grand courtroom seated on the throne decked in the full gorgeous imperial regalia with chamberlains and courtiers and haloga guardsmen formed up on all sides the avtokrator stared stillfaced as petronas walked up the long aisle toward him as custom required petronas halted about ten feet from the base of the throne he went to his knees and then to his belly in full proskynesis before his nephew as he started to go down he spied krispos who was standing to the emperors right his eyes widened very slightly krispos lips curved open in a show of teeth that was not a smile petronas kept control of his voice majesty he said face to the marble floor arise anthimos answered a beat later than he might have a subtle hint that petronas did not enjoy his full favor but one no courtier would fail to notice petronas could not have failed to notice either but gave no sign as he got to his feet nor did he give any sign that he had failed to accomplish all hed hoped in the west your majesty a promising start has been achieved against the vain followers of the four prophets he declared when weather permits us to resume the campaign next spring even grander triumphs will surely follow standing close by anthimos krispos stiffened he had not thought the sevastokrator would so boldly try to brazen out his failure and go on as if nothing had happened the whispers that ran through the grand courtroom soft as summer breeze through leaves said the same but while anthimos sat on the imperial throne petronas had in truth controlled the empire for well over a decade how would the avtokrator respond now not even krispos knew the ancient formality of the court kept his head still but his eyes slid toward anthimos again the emperor hesitated this time krispos was sure not to make a point but because he was uncertain what to say at last he replied next years campaigning season is still a long way away between now and then we shall decide the proper course to petronas bowed as your majesty wishes of course krispos felt like cheering for all his encouragement and for all that he knew dara had given even getting anthimos to temporize was a victory the rest of the court sensed that too those soft whispers began again petronas withdrew from before the imperial throne bowing every few paces until he had retreated far enough to turn and march away but as he strode from the grand courtroom he did not have the air of a defeated man krispos shook his head please give my regrets to his imperial highness excellent eroulos i was ill almost all summer and i fear i am too feeble to travel to the sevastokrators lodgings that was the politest way he could find to say he did not trust petronas enough to visit him i will pass your words on to my master eroulos said gravely krispos wondered what part petronas steward had played in the sorcerous attempt on his life he liked eroulos and thought eroulos liked him but eroulos was petronas man loyal to the sevastokrator faction made friendship difficult petronas did not deign to come to the imperial residence to visit krispos he was frequently there nonetheless trying to talk his nephew round to letting him continue his war against makuran whenever he saw krispos he stared through him as if he did not exist despite all krispos urging he could tell anthimos was wavering anthimos was far more used to listening to petronas than to krispos and petronas commanded his armies glumly krispos braced himself for another defeat and wondered if he would keep his post then much delayed on account of the vile winter weather word reached videssos the city from what had been the frontier with kubrat bands of harvas blackrobes halogai had crossed the border in several places looted villages on videssian soil massacred their inhabitants and withdrawn krispos made sure anthimos read through the reports which described the slaughter of the villagers in lurid detail this is dreadful the emperor exclaimed sounding more than a little sickened he shoved the parchments aside so it is your majesty krispos said these northerners seem even more vicious than the kubratoi they certainly do with a sort of horrid fascination anthimos picked up the reports and read them again he shuddered and threw them down by the sound of things they might have been doing skotos work krispos nodded thats well put your majesty they do seem to be killing just for the sport of it dont they and remember if you will whose advice caused you to make those butchers the neighbors of the empire also remember who wants you to go right on ignoring them so he can keep up his pointless war with makuran well have to find you a wife one day krispos anthimos said with a dry chuckle that was one of the smoothest i told you sos ive ever heard krispos dutifully smiled thinking it was not in the avtokrator to stay serious about anything for long but anthimos was serious the next day petronas came to talk about the campaign he planned in the west anthimos wordlessly handed him the dispatches from the northern frontier unfortunate aye but what of them petronas said when he was done reading by the nature of things well always have barbarians on that border and barbarians being barbarians will probe at us from time to time exactly so anthimos said and when they probe they should run up against soldiers not find all of them away in the west uncle i forbid you to attack makuran until these new barbarians of yours learn we will respond to their raids and can keep them in check out in the corridor krispos whistled a long low quiet note that was stronger language than hed ever expected anthimos to use to petronas he plied his dust rag with new enthusiasm you forbid me your majesty petronas voice held a tone krispos had heard there before of grown man talking to beardless youth usually anthimos either did not catch it or paid it no mind this time it must have rankled yes by the good god i forbid you uncle he snapped back i am the avtokrator and i have spoken do you propose to disobey my express command krispos waited for petronas to try to jolly him round as he had so often but the sevastokrator only said i will always obey you majesty for as long as you are emperor the feet or his chair scraped on polished marble as he rose now if you will excuse me i have other business to attend to petronas walked past krispos as if he were not there had he stood in the middle of the corridor he suspected the sevastokrator would have walked over him rather than swerve aside a couple of minutes later anthimos came out of the room where hed met with petronas in a most unimperial gesture he wiped his forehead with his sleeve whew he said standing up to my uncle is bloody hard work but by phos i did it he said hed obey he sounded proud of himself krispos did not blame him being who he was anthimos celebrated what he saw as his triumph over petronas with a jar of wine and then with another one thus fortified he headed off for an evening of revels dragging krispos along krispos did not want to revel the more he listened to petronas words in his mind the less they seemed a promise to obey he had no trouble escaping the carouse for one of the rare times since krispos had known him anthimos drank himself insensible krispos ducked out of the feast and hurried back to the imperial residence seeing a light under the closed door of the bedchamber the emperor and empress used he softly tapped at the door dara opened it a moment later she smiled you grow bold she said good she pressed herself against him and tilted her face up for a kiss he gladly gave it but then stepped away from her tell me what you think of this he said and repeated anthimos conversation with petronas as exactly as he could by the time he was done daras expression had gone from lickerish to worried hell obey as long as anthimos is emperor he said what happens if anthimos isnt emperor any more thats just what i thought krispos said i wanted to be sure i wasnt imagining things if petronas wants to overthrow the avtokrator it shouldnt be hard for him most of the soldiers and almost all the high officers look to him not to anthimos till now though he hasnt wanted to why should he have bothered dara said anthimos was always pliant enough to suit himtill now as you say how are we going to stop him her worry was fast becoming fear we have to convince anthimos that his uncle hasnt meekly backed down krispos said we ought to be able to manage that the more so since im sure its true and if we do he paused thinking hard how does this sound frowning dara listened to what he proposed at one point he raised a hand to stop him not gnatios she said no by the good god and im twice an idiot now for thinking of him krispos exclaimed mentally kicking himself dara looked a question at him but he did not explain instead he went on i keep forgetting that even holy men have politics the abbot pyrrhos would serve as well then and hed leap at the chance he finished setting forth his scheme maybe dara said maybe and maybe right now looks better than any other chance we have lets try it how may i serve you your majesty petronas asked offhandedly his indifference krispos thought was enough by itself to damn him and confirm all suspicions if the sevastokrator no longer cared what anthimos did that could only be because he was preparing to dispense with him uncle i think i may have been hasty the other day anthimos said dara had suggested that he sound nervous he was having no trouble following the suggestion you certainly were petronas rumbled no no sign of give there krispos thought the sevastokrator went on thats what you get for heeding the rascal who keeps pretending to dust outside there krispos felt his ears blaze so he hadnt gone unnoticed then even so he did not stop listening er yes anthimos saidnervously well i hope i can make amends its rather late for that petronas said krispos shivered he only hoped he and dara were not too late to save anthimos crown i know i have a lot to make amends for the emperor said not just for ordering you to stand down the other day but for all youve done for me and for the empire as regent when my father died and also since ive come of age i want to reward you as you deserve so if it please you id like to proclaim you coavtokrator before the whole court three days from now having done so much of the work for so long you deserve your full share of the title petronas stayed quiet so long that krispos felt his hands curl into tight fists then his nails biting into his palms the sevastokrator could seize the full imperial power for himselfwould he be content with the offer of part of it legally given he asked if i am to rule alongside you anthimos does that mean youll no longer try to meddle in the army and its business uncle you know more of such things than i do anthimos said youd best believe i do petronas growled high time you remembered it too now the question is do you mean all you say i know how to find out by the lord with the great and good mind ill say yes to you ladif you cast that treacherous scoundrel of a krispos from the palaces the moment i set the crown on your head uncle krispos will be cast not only from the palaces but from the city anthimos promised krispos and dara had planned to have the emperor tell petronas just that the risk remained that anthimos would do exactly as hed promised if he feared petronas more than he trusted his wife his chamberlain and his own abilities he might pay the price for what he reckoned security hate to wait that long petronas said then at last oh very well nephew keep him another three days if it makes you happy we have ourselves a bargain the sevastokrator got to his feet and triumphantly strode out of the chamber in which he had talked with anthimos seeing krispos outside he spoke to him for the first time since hed returned from the west three days wretch start packing his head lowered krispos dusted the gilded frame of an icon of phos he did not reply petronas laughed at his dismay and strutted past him down the corridor fine snow fell outside the grand courtroom as the grandees and high ministers of the empire gathered to see petronas exalted inside heat ducts that ran under the floor from a roaring furnace kept the throne room warm when all the officials and nobles were in their places krispos nodded to the captain of anthimos haloga bodyguards the captain nodded to his men axes held at presentarms before them they slowmarched out in double row to form an aisle down the center of the hall through which the avtokrator and his party would advance their gilded chain mail glittered in the torchlight once that aisle was made anthimos dara pyrrhos and krispos walked along it toward the throneno thrones now krispos saw for a second high seat had been placed beside the first if there were to be coavtokrators each required his own place of honor a crown lay on that second seat silks rustled as courtiers prostrated themselves when anthimos passed them as they rose the nobles whispered among themselves wheres gnatios krispos heard one say to the fellow beside him ought to have the patriarch here to crown a new emperor hes down with the flux poor chap the other grandee answered pyrrhos is a very holy man in his own right the good god wont mind everyone at the patriarchal mansion was down with the flux krispos thought considering the number of goldpieces hed spent to make sure a particular potion got into the mansions kitchen he was not surprised poor gnatios and his clerical colleagues would be dashing to the outhouse for the next several days anthimos climbed the three steps to the thrones and seated himself in the one that had always been his dara stood at his right hand on the highest step pyrrhos in the center of the lowest step krispos was also to the emperors right but off the steps altogether he had helped plan the spectacle that was to come but it was anthimos to play out the avtokrator sat unmoving staring without expression back toward the entrance to the grand courtroom beside and in front of him dara and pyrrhos might also have been statues krispos wanted to fidget with an effort he controlled himself petronas came into the grand courtroom his robe of scarlet silk encrusted with gold and gems was identical to anthimos only his bare head declared that he was not yet avtokrator marching with military precision he approached the thrones a tiny frown crossed his face when he saw krispos but then his eyes went back to the crown waiting for him on the throne that was to be his he looked at krispos again and smiled unpleasantly then for the last time he performed the proskynesis before his nephew he rose and bowed to anthimos as to an equal majesty he said his voice was strong and proud majesty anthimos echoed some of the courtiers started whispering again thinking that the formal recognition of petronas elevation but anthimos went on in a musing tone majesty is the word we use to denote the sovereign of the state the power that is his a signpost of the imperial office if you will rather like the red boots only the avtokrator is privileged to wear petronas gravely nodded krispos watched him go from attention to at ease if anthimos was going to make a speech before he got around to the coronation petronas would endure it in dignified comfort and anthimos was going to make a speech he continued the empire of course is indivisible ought not its sovereignty and the acknowledgment of that sovereignty to be the same many would say no for videssos has known coavtokrators before the creation of another would be no innovation on the ancient customs of our state petronas nodded once more this time krispos thought with a trace of smugness anthimos was still speaking and yet those former avtokrators surely each had reasons they reckoned pressing when they invested their colleagues with a share of the imperial dignity perhaps to give a son or other chosen successor a taste of responsibility before the passing of the senior partner my uncle petronas who stands before me now is as you all know already familiar with the power inherent in the throne anthimos said petronas nodded yet again his nephew went onindeed for many years the administration of the state and of its armies was entrusted to him at first this was because of my youth later not least on account of his own desire to continue what he had begun petronas stood patiently waiting for anthimos to come to the point now anthimos did in his control of the armies my uncle has fought against our ancient foe makuran having failed to win any victories to speak of in his first year he seeks a second year of campaigning and this at a time when other barbarians brought near our northern frontier at his urging now threaten us the smile suddenly faded from petronas face anthimos took no notice continuing when i urged him to consider this he held it to be of scant import and as much as told me he would use his influence over our soldiery to topple me from my throne if i failed to do as he wished anthimos raised his voice called to the halogai in the grand courtroom soldiers of videssos who is your avtokrator anthimos or petronas anthimos the northerners cried so loud that echoes rang from the walls and high ceilings anthimos the emperor rose from his throne then seize this traitor here who sought to terrify me into granting him a share of the imperial power to which he has no right why you petronas sprang toward his nephew dara screamed throwing herself in front of anthimos before petronas could reach the steps that led up to the throne though krispos grappled with him holding him in place until three halogai axes upraised came clattering from their posts nearest the imperial seat yield or die one shouted to petronas who was still struggling against krispos greater strength all the rest of the imperial guards also held their axes above their heads ready to loose massacre in the grand courtroom if any of petronas backers among the empires assembled nobles and commanders sought to rescue the sevastokrator no one did krispos thought petronas fury so great he would die before he gave up but the sevastokrator was a veteran soldier long used to calculating the odds of success in battle although hatred burned in his eyes he checked himself stepped back from krispos and bent his head to the big blond axemen i yield he choked out youd better uncle anthimos said sitting once more by the good god id sooner see krispos here on the throne than you from her place just below him dara nodded vigorously he went on and since you have yielded you must be placed in circumstances where you can no longer threaten us will you now willingly surrender up your hair and join the brotherhood of monks at a monastery of our choosing there to spend the rest of your days in contemplation of the lord with the great and good mind willingly by now petronas had enough aplomb back to raise an ironic eyebrow aye considering the alternative ill abandon my hair willingly enough better to have my hair trimmed than my neck pyrrhos anthimos said with pleasure your majesty the abbot stepped down onto the floor of the grand courtroom in the pouch on his belt he carried scissors and a glitteringly sharp razor he bowed to petronas and held up a copy of phos scriptures formality kept from his voice any gloating he might have felt as he said petronas behold the law under which you shall live if you choose if in your heart you feel you can observe it enter the monastic life if not speak now petronas took no offense at being addressed so simplyif he was to become a monk the titles he had enjoyed were no longer his he did permit himself one meaningful glance at the axemen around him then replied i shall observe it shall you truly i shall truly truly truly after petronas affirmed his pledge for the third time pyrrhos bowed again and saidthen lower your proud head petronas and yield your hair in token of submission to phos the lord with the great and good mind petronas obeyed graying hair fell to the marble floor as the abbot plied his scissors when he had it cropped short he switched to the razor the crown petronas had expected to wear lay on a large cushion of scarlet satin after pyrrhos was done shaving petronas head he climbed the steps to that second throne and lifted the cushion beneath it folded flat was a robe of coarse blue wool the abbot took it and returned to petronas the garment you now wear does not suit the station in life you will have henceforth he said strip it off and those red boots as well that you may don the robe of monastic purity again petronas did as he was told unhooking the fastenings that held the imperial raiment closed with a fine shrug of indifference he let the magnificent robe fall to the floor then yanked off the imperial boots his undertunic and drawers were of smooth glistening silk he stood easily waiting for pyrrhos to proceed defeated or not krispos thought he had style pyrrhos frowned to see petronas rich undergarments those will also be taken from you when we reach the monastery he said they are far too fine for the simple life the brethren live you may take them now for all i care petronas said shrugging again krispos was sure hed hoped to embarrass pyrrhos he succeeded too the abbot went red to the top of his shaven pate recovering he answered as i said that may wait until you join your fellow monks he held out the blue robe to petronas put this on if you please while petronas slipped on the monastic robe pyrrhos intoned as the garment of phos blue covers your body so may his righteousness enfold your heart and preserve it from all evil so may it be petronas said he traced the circular sunsign over his heart so did everyone in the grand courtroom save only the heathen halogai krispos did not feel hypocritical as he silently prayed that the man who till moments before had been sevastokrator would make a good monk like all his countrymen he took his faith seriouslyand better for petronas he thought to end up in a monastic cell than to spill his blood on the polished marble in front of the throne it is accomplished brother petronas pyrrhos said come with me now to the monastery of the holy sirikios that you may make the acquaintance of your comrades in phos service he began to lead the new monk out of the grand courtroom holy sir a moment if you please anthimos said from his throne pyrrhos looked back at the avtokrator with obedience but no great liking he had worked with anthimos to bring down petronas but felt even more scorn for the younger mans way of life than for the elders nonetheless he waited as anthimos went on you might be well advised to have vagn hjalborn and narvikka there accompany you to the monastery lest brother petronas ah suddenly repent of his decision to serve the good god dara had been proudly watching anthimos since the drama in the throne room began as if she had trouble believing he could face down his uncle and was overjoyed to be proven wrong now hearing her husband speak such plain good sense the empress brought her hands together in a small involuntary clap of delight krispos wished she would look at him that way he fought down a stab of jealousy anthimos this time was right that made jealousy unimportant when pyrrhos hesitated krispos put in were things different petronas himself would tell you that was a good idea holy sir youve learned well and may the ice take you petronas said then surprisingly he laughed i probably would at that pyrrhos nodded very well such untimely repentance would be a great sin and sin we must always struggle against let it be as you say your majesty along with his new monk and the three broad burly haloga warriors the abbot withdrew from the imperial presence anthimos thou conquerest one of the courtiers shoutedthe ancient videssian cry of approval for an avtokrator in an instant the grand courtroom was full of uproar with everyone trying to outyell his neighbor to show his loyalty to the newly independent ruler anthimos thou conquerest anthimos thou conquerest anthimos beaming the emperor drank in the praise krispos knew much of it was insincere made by men still loyal to petronas but too wise in the ways of survival at the imperial court to show it he made a mental note to ask anthimos to post halogai around the monastery of the holy sirikios to supplement pyrrhos clubwielding monks but that could wait for the moment like anthimos krispos was content to enjoy the triumph hed helped create at last the avtokrator raised a hand anthimos said as the first decree of this new phase of my reign i command all of you here to go forth and live joyfully for the rest of your lives laughter and cheers rang through the grand courtroom krispos joined them all the same he was thinking anthimos would need a more serious program than that if he intended to rule as well as reign krispos smiled a little that program would have to come from someone why not him xii what is your will your majesty krispos asked shall we continue your uncles war against makuran on the smaller scale well have to use because weve shifted men back to the north or shall we make peace and withdraw from the few towns petronas took dont bother me right now krispos anthimos had his nose in a scroll had the scroll been too far away for krispos to read he would have been impressed with the emperors industry for it was a listing of property that looked much like a tax document but krispos knew it listed the wines in petronas cellars which had fallen to anthimos along with the rest of his uncles vast holdings krispos persisted your majesty spring is hard upon us he gestured to the open window which let in a mild sweetsmelling breeze and showed brilliant sunshine outside if you dont want to meet the envoy the king of kings has sent us what shall i tell him tell him to go to the ice anthimos snapped tell him whatever you bloody well please this catalogue says petronas had five amphorae of golden vaspurakaner wine and my cellarers have only been able to find three i wonder where he hid the other two the avtokrator brightened i know ill cast a spell of finding to sniff them out krispos gave up very well your majesty hed hoped to guide anthimos like petronas he was discovering guiding was not enough most of the time if anything needed doing he had to do it and so while the avtokrator busied himself with his spell of finding krispos bowed to chihorvshnasp the makuraner ambassador chihorvshnasp bowed back less deeply that was not an insult like most of his countrymen chihorvshnasp wore a bucketshaped felt hat that was liable to fall off if he bent too far i hope his imperial majesty recovers from his indisposition soon he said in excellent videssian so do i krispos said continuing the polite fiction he knew chihorvshnasp knew to be a polite fiction meanwhile maybe you and i can see how close we get to settling things for his approval shall we try that esteemed and eminent sir chihorvshnasps knowledge of videssian usages seemed flawless thoughtfully studying krispos he went on such was the custom of the former sevastokrator petronas it was as smooth a way as krispos could imagine of asking him whether he in effect filled petronas place i think the avtokrator will ratify whatever we do he answered so chihorvshnasp drew the first sound of the word out into a hiss it is as i had been led to believe let us discuss these matters then he looked krispos full in the face his large dark eyes were limpid innocent trusting as a child they reminded krispos of the eyes of ibas the horse trader who doctored the teeth of the beasts he sold chihorvshnasp dickered like a horse trader too that made life difficult for krispos who wanted to abandon petronas war on makuran because of what hed known growing up on both sides of the northern frontier and because of the unknown quantity harvas blackrobes mercenaries represented he thought the danger there more pressing than the one in the west but krispos also feared just walking away from petronas war some disgruntled general would surely rise in rebellion if he tried the high officers in the videssian army had all resworn their oaths to anthimos after petronas fell but if one rose krispos wondered whether the rest would resist him or join his revolt he did not want to have to find out and so remembering how iakovitzes had gone round and round with lexo the khatrisher he sparred with chihorvshnasp at last they settled videssos kept the small towns of artaz and hanzith and the valley in which they lay vaspurakaners from the regions round the other towns petronas had taken were to be allowed to move freely into videssian territory but makuran would reoccupy those areas after krispos swore by phos and chihorvshnasp by his peoples four prophets to present to their sovereigns the terms on which theyd agreed the makuraner smiled a slightly triumphant smile and said few from fis and thelaw and bardaa will go over to you you know we saw that in the fighting last yearthey loathe videssos more for being heretic than makuran for being heathen and so did little to aid you i know i read the dispatches too krispos said calmly chihorvshnasp pursed his lips interesting you bargained long and hard for the sake of a concession you admit to be meaningless it isnt meaningless krispos said not when i can present it to his majesty and the court as a victory so chihorvshnasp hissed again i have word then to take to his puissant majesty nakhorgan king of kings pious beneficent to whom the god and his prophets four have granted many years and wide domains that his brother in might anthimos remains ably served by his advisors even if the names change you flatter me krispos tried not to show the pleasure he felt of course i do chihorvshnasp was in his midforties not his late twenties the look he gave krispos was another act of flattery for it seemed to imply that the two of them were equal in experience then he smiled that you notice says i have good reason to krispos bowed in his chair toward the makuraner envoy he lifted his cup of wine shall we drink to our success chihorvshnasp raised his cup too by all means by the good god mavros exclaimed staring wideeyed at a troupe of young comely acrobats who formed a pyramid with some most unconventional joinings ive never seen anything like that before his majestys revels are like no others krispos agreed hed invited his foster brother to the feastmavros was part of anthimos household these days all of petronas men all of petronas vast properties were forfeit to the avtokrator when the sevastokrator fell just as skombros had been before anthimos had his own head groom but mavros new post as that mans aide carried no small weight of responsibility and now without warning his eyes lit with a gleam krispos had seen there before but never so brightly he turned and hurried off where are you going krispos called after him he did not answer but disappeared into the night krispos wondered if watching the acrobats had stirred him so much he had to go find some companionship if that was what mavros wanted krispos thought he was foolish to leave the women right here were more attractive than any he was likely to find elsewhere in the cityand anthimos did not bid any likely to say no to come to his feasts krispos shrugged he knew he didnt think things through all the time however hard he tried no reason mavros should either a man came out with a pandoura struck a ringing chord and began to sing a bawdy wedding song another fellow accompanied him with a set of pipes the loud cheerful music worked the same magic in the palace complex as in any peasant village throughout the empire it pulled people off couches and away from plates piled high with sea urchins and tuna asparagus and cakes it made them want to dance as at any village wedding throughout the empire they formed rings and capered round and round drowning out the singer as they roared along with his song the halogai might have shouted outside if they did no one ever heard them the first krispos knew of mavros return was when a woman facing the entrance screamed others some men among them screamed to pandoura and pipes played on for another few notes then raggedly fell silent hello your majesty mavros said spotting anthimos in one of the suddenly halted rings i thought it was a shame for your friend here to be missing all the fun he clucked to the horse he was ridingone of anthimos favoritesand touched its flanks with his heels hooves clattering on the smooth stone floor the horse advanced through the revelers toward the tables piled high with food dont just stand there krispos mavros called feed this good fellow a strawberry or six krispos felt like throwing something at mavros for involving him in this mad jape reluctantly he stepped toward the tables refusing he thought would only look worse he picked up the bowl of strawberries amid vast silence the snuffling of the horse as it ate was the only sound then anthimos laughed all at once everyone else was laughing too whatever the emperor thought funny could not be an outrage why didnt you bring a mare in season anthimos called then he could share all the pleasures we do maybe next time your majesty mavros said his face perfectly straight yes well all right anthimos said pity theres no entertainment that really could amuse him oh i wouldnt say that your majesty mavros answered blithely after all he has us to watchand if we arent funny what is anthimos laughed again as far as he was concerned mavros headlong style of wit was a great success thinking about it though krispos wondered if his foster brother hadnt been telling the exact and literal truth the emperor said one reward we can give himif hes finished with those strawberries there why dont you fill that bowl up with wine here you can use this jar if you care to nodding mavros took the jar to which anthimos had pointed he brought it back to where the horse stood patiently waiting upended over the bowl that still held a few mashed strawberries the thick wine poured out yellow as a halogas hair your majesty krispos exclaimed is that jar from one of the missing amphorae from petronas cellars as a matter of fact it is anthimos looked smug i was hoping youd notice the spell i employed worked rather well wouldnt you say it took my men right to the missing jars good for you krispos eyed the avtokrator with more respect than he was used to giving him anthimos had stuck with his magic and worked to regain it with greater persistence than he devoted to anything else save the pleasures of the flesh as far as krispos could tell he still botched conjurations every so often but noneyetin a way that had endangered him if only he gave as much attention to the broader concerns of the empire krispos thought whenever he wanted to be he was plenty capable too often he did not care to bother krispos wondered how often hed had that identical thought enough times he was sure that if he had a goldpiece for each one the penpushers in the imperial treasury could lower the taxes on every farm in videssos they wouldnt of course whenever new money came along anthimos always invented a new way to spend it as now the thought had hardly crossed krispos mind before the avtokrator sidled up to him and said you know i think im going to have a pool dug beside this hall so i can stock it with minnows minnows your majesty if anthimos had conceived a passion for fishing hed done it without krispos noticing trout would give you better sport id think not that sort of minnows anthimos looked exasperated at krispos lack of imagination he glanced toward a couple of the courtesans in the crowded room that sort of minnows dont you think they could be very amusing nibbling around the way minnows do in lovely cool water on a hot summer evening i suppose they might krispos said if youand theydont mind being mosquito food while youre sporting mosquitoes and gnats and biting insects of all sorts flourished in the humid heat of the citys summer the emperors face fell but only for a moment i could hold the bugs at bay with magic your majesty if a bugrepelling spell were easy everyone would use it instead of mosquito netting maybe ill devise an easy one then anthimos said maybe he would too krispos thought even if the emperor no longer had a tutor he was turning into a magician of sorts krispos had no interest whatever in becoming a wizard he was however a solidly practical man he said even without sorcery you could put a tent of mosquito netting over and around your pool by the good god so i could anthimos grinned and clapped krispos on the back he talked for the next half hour about the pool and the entertainments he envisioned there krispos listened enthralled anthimos was a voluptuarys voluptuary he tookand communicatedpleasure in talking about pleasure after a while the thought of the pleasure he would enjoy later roused him to pursue some immediately he beckoned to one of the tarts in the hall and took her over to an unoccupied portion of the pile of pillows hed hardly begun when he got a new idea lets make a pyramid of our own he called to the other couples and groups there do you think we could they tried shaking his head krispos watched it wasnt nearly so fine as the acrobats pyramid but everybody in it seemed to be having a good time that was anthimos through and through minnows dara hissed krispos had never heard the name of a small nondescript fish used as a swear word before and needed a moment to understand then he asked how did you hear about that anthimos told me last night of course the empress answered through clenched teeth he likes to tell me about his little schemes and he was so excited over this one that he told me all about it she glared at krispos why didnt you stop him why didnt i what he stared at her anthimos was out carousing but the hour was still early and the door from the imperial bedchamber to the hall wide open whatever got said had to be said in a tone of voice that would attract no notice from anyone walking down the corridor remembering that helped krispos hold his temper how was i supposed to stop him hes the avtokrator he can do what he likes and dont you think hed wonder why i tried to talk him out of it what reason could i give him that that cursed poolmay skotos ice cover it all year aroundis just another way and a particularly vile one for him to be unfaithful to me how am i supposed to tell him that if i sound like a priest hes more likely to shave my head and put me in a blue robe than to listen to me and besides he paused to make sure no one was outside to hear then went on besides things being as they are im hardly the one to tell him anything of the kind but he listens to you dara said he listens to you more than to anyone else these days if you cant get him to pay heed no one can i know its not fair to ask you you dont begin to krispos had thought defending anthimos to dara was curious now she wanted him to get anthimos to be more faithful to her so she would have less time and less desire to give to him because she would be giving more to her husband he had not been trained in fancy logic at the sorcerers collegium but he knew a muddle when he stepped into one he also knew that explaining it to her would be worse than a waste of timeit would make her furious sighing he tried another tack he listens to me when he feels like it even on the business of the empire thats not nearly all the time when it comes to things he really likes he pays attention only to himself you know that dara he still spoke her name but seldom when he did it was a way to emphasize that what he said was important yes i do know she said in a low voice thats so even now that petronas is locked up for good all anthimos cares about is doing just what he wants her eyes lifted and caught krispos she had a way of doing that which made it next to impossible for him to tell her no at least try to get him to set his hand to the empire if he doesnt who will ive tried before but if youll remember i was the one who ended up hashing things out with chihorvshnasp try again dara said those eyes meltingly soft for me all right ill try krispos said with no great optimism again he thought how strange it was for dara to use her lover to improve her husband he wondered just what that meantprobably that anthimos was more important to her than he was whatever his flaws the avtokrator was handsome and affableand without him dara would be only a westlands nobles daughter not the empress of videssos having gained so much status through his connections to others krispos understood how she could fear losing hers if the person from whom it derived was cast down she smiled at him differently from a moment before thank you krispos that will be all for now i think now she spoke as empress to vestiarios he rose bowed and left her chamber angry at her for changing moods so abruptly but unable to show it having nothing better to do he went to bed some time in the middle of the night the small silver bell in his bedchamber rang he wondered whether anthimos was summoning him or dara either way he thought grouchily as he dressed and tried to rub the sleep from his eyes he would have to please and obey it was dara the emperor was still out roistering even the comfort of her body though could not completely make up for the way shed treated him earlier as he had with tanilis he wanted to be more than a bedwarmer for her that she sometimes remembered him as a person only made it worse when she forgot one day he thought hed have to talk with her about thatif only he could figure out how krispos carried the last of the breakfast dishes to the kitchens on a tray then went back to the dining room where anthimos was leaning back in his chair and working lazily on his first morning cup of wine hed learned the avtokrator was more willing to conduct business now than at any other time of day whether more willing really meant willing varied from day to day ill see krispos thought your majesty he said eh what is it anthimos sounded either peevish or a trifle the worse for wear the latter krispos judged the emperor did not bounce back from his debauches quite as readily these days as he had when krispos first became vestiarios that was hardly surprising someone with a less resilient constitution might well have been dead by now if he abused himself as anthimos did all that was beside the pointthe avtokrator in a bad mood was less likely to want to listen to anything that had to do with imperial administration nonetheless krispos had promised dara hed tryand if anthimos was going to keep other people from becoming emperor hed just have to handle the job himself krispos said your majesty the grand logothete of the treasury has asked me to bring certain matters to your attention sure enough anthimos smile lively enough a moment before became fixed on his face im not really much interested right at the moment in what the grand logothete is worrying about he thinks it important your majesty after listening to him so do i krispos said anthimos finished his cup of wine his mobile features assumed a martyred expression go on then if you must thank you your majesty the logothetes complaint is that nobles in some of the provinces more remote from videssos the city are collecting taxes from the peasants on their lands but not turning the money over to the treasury some of the nobles are also buying up peasant holdings next to their lands so that their estates grow and those of the free peasants who make up the backbone of the army suffer that doesnt sound very good the emperor said the trouble was he didnt sound very interested the grand logothete wants you to put out a law that would stop the nobles from getting away with it with punishments harsh enough to make even the hardest thief think twice before he tries cheating the fisc the logothete thinks its urgent yourmajesty and its costing you money you could be using to enjoy yourself hes written a draft of the law and he wants you to review it when i have the time anthimos said which meant somewhere between later and never he peered down into his empty cup held it out to krispos fill this up again for me will you thats a good fellow krispos filled the cup your majesty the grand logothete gave me his draft i have it here i can show it to you when i have the time i said when will that be your majesty this afternoon tomorrow next month three years from now krispos felt his temper slipping he knew it was dangerous but could not help it part of it was pentup frustration over anthimos refusal to hing that didnt gratify him right then and there hed been trying to change that ever since he became vestiarios more irritation sprang from the anger he hadnt been able to let out at dara the night before you want to give me this stupid law your boring bureaucrat dreamed up anthimos was angry too scowling at krispos not even petronas had spoken to him like that breathing hard he went on bring it to me now this instant ill show you what i think of it by phos in his relief krispos heard the emperors words without paying attention to the way he said them thank you your majesty ill fetch it right away he hurried to his chamber and brought anthimos the parchment here you are your majesty the avtokrator unrolled the document and gave it one quick disdainful glance he ripped it in half then in quarters then in eighths then with more methodical care than he ever gave to government he tore each part into a multitude of tiny pieces and flung them about the room until it looked as though a sudden interior blizzard had struck theres what i think of this stupid law he shouted why you of itself krispos fist clenched and drew back had anthimos been any other man in all the empire save who he was that fist would have crashed into his nastily grinning face a cold clear sense of selfpreservation made krispos think twice very carefully as if it belonged to someone else he lowered his hand and made it open even more carefully he said your majesty that was foolish and so what are you going to do about it before krispos could answer anthimos went on ill tell you what quick now get broom and dustpan and sweep up every one of these miserable little pieces and dump em in the privy thats just where they belong krispos stared at him move curse you anthimos said i command it even if he would not act like an emperor he sounded like one krispos had to obey hating himself and anthimos both he swept the floor clean the avtokrator stood over him making sure he found every scrap of parchment when he was finally satisfied he said now go get rid of them normally krispos took no notice of the privies stench stench and privies went together this time though he was on business different from the usual and the sharp reek bit into his nostrils as the tornup pieces of law fluttered downward to their end he thought that anthimos would have done the same thing to the whole empire were it small enough to take in his two hands and tear krispos was stubborn all through his life that had served him well now he brought his stubbornness to bear on anthimos whenever laws were proposed or other matters came up that required a decision from the emperor he kept on presenting them to anthimos in the hope that he could wear him down and gradually accustom him to performing his duties but anthimos proved just as mulish as he was the avtokrator quit paying daytoday affairs even the smallest amount of attention he had once given them he ripped no more edicts to shreds but he did not sign them or affix the imperial seal to them either krispos took to saying thank you your majesty at the end of each days undone business sarcasm rolled off anthimos like water from a gooses feathers my pleasure hed answer day by day the response made krispos want to grind his teethit kept reminding him of all that anthimos really cared about yet anthimos could work hard when he wanted to that irked krispos more than anything he watched the avtokrator patiently studying magic on his own because it interested him hed always known how much ingenuity anthimos put into his revels he could have been a capable emperor that worse luck did not interest him krispos regretted trying to get him to handle routine matters when something came up that was not routine urgent dispatches from the northern frontier told of fresh raids of harvas blackrobes halogai though anthimos had strengthened the border after forcing petronas into the monastery the raiding bands coming south were too large and too fierce for the frontier troops to handle anthimos refused to commit more soldiers but your majesty krispos protested this is the border because of which you toppled your uncle when he would not protect it that was part of the reason aye anthimos gave krispos a measuring stare another part was that he wouldnt leave me alone you seem to have forgotten thatyouve grown almost as tiresome as he was the warning there was unmistakable the troops did not go north krispos sent a message by imperial courier to the village where hed grown up urging his brotherinlaw domokos to bring evdokia and their children down to videssos the city a little more than a week later a wornlooking courier brought his blowing horse up to the imperial residence and delivered domokos reply well stay here he told the rider who spoke with him esteemed and eminent sir the fellow said consulting a scrap of parchment were already too beholden to you he said and we dont care to depend on your charity when we can make a go of things where we are thats what he said just as the other courier wrote it down thank you krispos said abstractedly respecting his brotherinlaws pride and cursing him for being an obstinate fool at the same time meanwhile the courier stood waiting after a moment krispos realized why he gave the man a goldpiece the courier saluted in delight and hurried away krispos decided that if he could not go through anthimos to protect the farmers near the northern border he would have to go around him he spoke with dara she agreed they asked to meet with ouittios one of the generals who had served under petronas to their dismay ouittios refused to come he will not see you except at the avtokrators express command the generals adjutant reported if you will forgive his frankness and me for relaying it he fears being entrapped into what will later be called treason as petronas was krispos scowled when he heard that but had to admit it made sense from ouittios point of view a couple of other attempted contacts proved similarly abortive this desperately needs doing and i cant get it done krispos complained to mavros after yet another highranking soldier refused to have anything to do with him if you like i think i can put you in touch with agapetos mavros said he has lands around opsikion he used to know my father my mother would speak of him from time to time do you want me to try yes by the good god and quick as you can krispos said with mavros as gobetween agapetos agreed to come to the imperial residence and listen to krispos and dara even so the generals hard square face was full of suspicion as he eased himself down into a chair suspicion turned to surprise when he found out why hed been summoned you want me to go up there and fight he said scratching an old scar on his cheek i figured you were out to disband troops not put them to proper use so did everybody after what happened with petronas why this sneaking around behind his majestys back because i put his back up thats why he just wont take care of things in the north since im the one who argued too hard that he ought to krispos answered id sooner wait till he comes round on his own but i dont think we have the time do you no agapetos answered at once i know we dont im only surprised you do too after what befell the sevastokrator like i said before if youll excuse me for speaking out so plainly i wouldve figured you to be out to weaken the army more not give it useful work to do petronas did not fall because he was a soldier dara said he fell because he was a rebellious soldier one who valued his own wishes above those of his overlord surely the same is not true of you excellent sir agapetos chuckle was more grim than amused if it were your majesty do you think i d be dunce enough to admit it all right though i take your point but what happens to me when the avtokrator finds out ive obeyed the two of you rather than him if you win how can he blame you krispos asked even if he tries we and your success will both shield you from him and if you lose you may well end up dead in which case youll worry about phos wrath not anthimos for all those fancy robes you think like a soldier agapetos said all right well try it your way anthimos said he wouldnt mind having you as emperor didnt he i can see why and i wouldnt mind having a go at the halogai truth to tell those axes the imperial guardsmen carry are fearsome enough aye but how would they fare against cavalry that knows something of discipline it will be interesting to find out yes it will krispos could see him planning his new campaign as if he were a carpenter picturing a new chair in his mind before he built it how many men will you take he asked my whole army agapetos answered say seventyfive hundred troopers thats plenty and then some to control raiding bands like the ones i expect well be seeing the only time you need more is if you try to do something really enormous the way petronas did last year against makuran and look what that got himno headway to speak of and a blue robe and a cell at the end of it his ambition earned him that excellent agapetos dara said i already asked you once if you had that kind of ambition and you said no you should be safe enough then not so the general said i expect youre right besides from everything ive heard this is something that needs taking care of the sooner the better if i set out inside the next ten days will that suit you krispos and dara looked at each other krispos had hoped for something more rousing perhaps a cry of ill ride for the frontier before the sun sets but he had seen enough since he came to the capital to understand that large organizations usually moved slower than small ones it will do he said dara nodded well with your leave ill be off then agapetos said rising from his chair ive a deal to make ready before we ride out he dipped his head to krispos bowed deeply to dara and stamped away i hope hell serve krispos said when the general was gone from everything harvas has done hes a soldier who fights hard and moves fast i just hope agapetos understands that the halogai are foot soldiers dara said how can they move faster than our horsemen more likely theyll flee at word of agapetos approach youre probably right krispos said he could not help thinking though that harvas blackrobes halogai had already beaten the kubratoi and the kubratoi raised no mean cavalry even if as agapetos had said they lacked discipline he made himself shake off his worries hed done the best he could to protect the northern frontier hed certainly done more than anthimos had if agapetos army did not suffice then videssos would have a fullsized war on its hands not even anthimos could ignore thathe hoped krispos got more and more used to working around anthimos rather than through him petronas had managed for years but petronas had been sevastokrator of the imperial family and with prestige almost imperialsometimes more imperial than anthimos because he was only vestiarios krispos had to work harder to convince people to see things his way having dara with him when he saw agapetos had helped persuade the general to go along sometimes though krispos needed to beard officials in their own lairs much as he wanted to he could not bring the empress along you have my sincere apologies esteemed and eminent sir but without his imperial majestys seal or signature i cannot implement this new law on codicils to bequests declared a certain iavdas one of the aides to the logothete of the treasury krispos stared but youre the one who asked for it i have your memorandum here he waved the parchment at iavdas its a good law a fair law it should go into effect i quite agree but for it to do so seal or signature must be affixed that too is the law and i dare not disobey it his majesty isnt signing or sealing much these days krispos said slowly the more he urged anthimos to do the less the emperor did a defense of principle that would have been admirable had the principle defended been more noble than anthimos right to absolute laziness i assure you though that i do have the authority to tell you to go ahead with this unfortunately i must disagree like most treasury officials krispos had met iavdas owned a relentlessly literal mind he went on i must follow the letter of the law not the spirit for spirit by its nature is subject to diverse interpretations without formal imperial approval i cannot proceed krispos almost told him to go to the ice he bit back his anger how could he get iavdas to do what even iavdas admitted needed doing suppose we dont call this a new law he said after some thought suppose we just call it an amendment to a law thats already there would my sayso be enough then iavdas eyes got a faraway look i suppose it would be technically accurate to term this a correction of an ambiguity in the existing law it was not framed so but it could be reworked to appear as a revised chapter of the present code on codicils and for a mere revision no seal and signature are not required he beamed at krispos thank you esteemed and eminent sir an ingenious solution to a complex problem and one that evades not only the defects in current legislation but also those posed by the avtokrators obstinacy eryes krispos beat a hasty retreat talking with high functionaries reminded him of the limits of his own education he could read and write add and subtract but he still felt at sea when people larded their talk with big words for no better reason than to hear them roll off their lips why he wondered couldnt they say what they meant and have done he did understand that iavdas liked his plan that would do but as he complained to dara when she called him to her bedchamber some time past midnight we shouldnt have to go through this rigmarole every time we need to get something done i cant always come up with ways of getting around anthimos and because i cant things dont happen if only anthimos would he broke off lying in anthimos bed with anthimos empress he did not want to talk about the avtokrator sometimes though like tonight he got too frustrated with anthimos to stop himself dara put the palm of her hand on his bare chest felt his heartbeat slow toward normal after their coupling smiling she said if he hadnt neglected me we wouldnt have happened still i know what you mean just as you did i hoped hed rule for himself once his uncle was gone now now hes so annoyed with me for trying to get him to rule that he wont even see to the little he did before you were the one who made me keep pushing at him too he thought he kept that to himself dara had been doing her best for her husband and the empire had anthimos responded all would have been well never mind anthimos now dara whispered perhaps feeling some of the same awkwardness he had she held him to her do you think we can try again if we hurry krispos did his best to oblige one did not say no not to the empress then he got out of bed and into his clothes which turns me from lover back to vestiarios he thought with a touch of irritation he slipped from the imperial bedchamber shutting the doors behind him he started to go back to his own room then changed his mind and decided to have a snack first he walked down the hall to the larder he was coming back munching on a roll sticky with honey when he saw a disembodied head floating toward him his mouth dropped opened a bit of roll fell out and landed on the floor with a wet smack he needed a moment to gain enough control of himself to do anything more than stand stare and gurgle in that moment of terror before he could scream and flee he recognized the head it was anthimos the head recognized him too winking it spoke krispos frowned tried to read its silent lips youd eat better than that if you were with me he thought it said i ssuppose i would your majesty he got out if anthimos could work magic this potent while at a revel he was turning into a very impressive sorcerer indeed krispos thought aloud he added you almost scared me to death the emperors head grinned as he looked at it he realized it was not physically there he could see through it that made it a trifle easier to takehe did not have to imagine an acephalous anthimos lying on a couch among his cronies he tried to smile back grinning still the avtokratoror as much of him as was presentmoved past krispos the head came to the door of the imperial bedchamber krispos expected it to drift through the wood had it come a few minutes earlierhe shivered he knew what it would have seen but instead of sailing ghostlike through the closed doors the emperors projected head fetched up against them with a bump that was immaterial but nonetheless seemed to hurt judging by the expression the slightly misty face wore and the words it was mouthing krispos fought to keep his own face straight anthimos might be turning into a powerful mage but he was still a careless one would you like me to open it for you your majesty he asked politely piss off anthimos head snarled an instant later it vanished krispos leaned against the wall and let out a long slow sigh he suddenly realized his right hand was stickyhed squeezed that honeyed bun to pieces without even remembering he had it he threw away what was left and went back to the larder for some water to wash his fingers he did not take another bun hed lost his appetite one of the halogai standing guard outside the imperial residence turned and spotted krispos in the hallway someone out here to see you he called thanks narvikka ill be there in a minute krispos put away the armful of newly washed robes he was carrying then went out onto the steps with the guardsmen he blinked several times trying to get his eyes used to the bright afternoon sunshine outside he did not recognize the wornlooking man who sat waiting for him on a wornlooking horse im krispos he said what can i do for you the wornlooking man touched a finger to the brim of his straw travelers hat my names bassos esteemed and eminent sir im an imperial courier im afraid i have bad news for you go ahead give it to me krispos held his voice steady wondering what had gone wrong now his imagination painted plenty of possibilities earthquake pestilence famine rebellion even invasion from makuran in spite of the peace he thought hed patched together but bassos had meant bad news for him not for the empire esteemed and eminent sir the gold you sent up to your sister and brotherinlaw the courier licked his lips trying to figure out how to go on at last he did baldly well sir we couldnt deliver that gold on account of there wasnt much left of the village there after these new stinking barbarians were mixed up with went through it im sorry esteemed and eminent sir krispos heard himself say thank you as if from very far away bassos pressed a leather pouch into his hands and made him count the goldpieces inside and sign a receipt the emperors vestiarios was too prominent to be cheated the courier remounted and rode away krispos stood on the steps looking after him evdokia domokos two little girls he had never seen he never would see them now narvikka walked over to him setting a large hand on his shoulder their time came as it was fated to come so grieve not for them the haloga said if the gods willed it they took foes with them to serve them forever in the world to come may it be so may it be so krispos agreed he had never had any use for the northerners wild gods and fatalistic view of the world but suddenly he very much wanted his family to have servants in the afterlife servants they had slain with their own hands that would be only just and if justice was hard to come by in this world he could hope for it in the next but was their time fated had domokos been less proud had petronas not made his tooclever bargain with harvas had anthimos listened and sent troops north in good timehad anthimos listened even once curse him thinking of the emperors failing filled krispos with pure and frightening rage his fists clenched only then did he notice he was holding the goldfilled leather pouch he gave it to narvikka saying take it i never want to see these coins again i take it i share them with the rest of the lads here the haloga nodded at the rest of his squad of guardsmen who were watching him and krispos each of us he takes a piece of your ill luck for himself however you like krispos said mechanically much as he wanted not to part of him responded to the halogas gesture he found himself saying my thanks thats kind of you to do such a thing for me narvikkas massive shoulders moved up and down inside his mail shirt we would do it for each other we will do it for a friend as if krispos were a child the big northerner turned him round and gave him a light shove toward the imperial residence is wine inside you drink to remember them or to forget whichever suits my thanks krispos said again given a sense of purpose his feet made for the larder without much conscious thought before he got there barsymes came out of one of the other rooms that opened onto the corridor and saw him the eunuch stared later remembering that look krispos wondered what expression his face had borne barsymes seemed to wrestle with courtesy then spoke your pardon krispos but is something amiss you might say so krispos answered harshly back at the village where i grew up my sister her husband my niecesharvas blackrobes halogai hit the place he stopped unable to go on to his amazement he saw barsymes eyes fill with tears i grieve with you the chamberlain said the loss of young kin is always hard we eunuchs perhaps know that better than most as we have no hope of progeny for ourselves our siblings children become doubly dear to us i understand as he never had before krispos wondered how eunuchs carried on through all the years after they were mutilated a warrior should envy the courage that required he thought but most would only grow angry at being compared to a halfman thinking of barsymes plight helped him grapple with his own the eunuch said if you wish to leave off your duties the rest of the day my colleagues and i will assume them under the circumstances the avtokrator cannot object under the circumstances i dont give a fart whether the emperor objects krispos snapped he watched barsymes gape never mind im sorry you dont know all the circumstances thank you for your offer by your leave ill take advantage of it barsymes bowed of course he said but his face was still shocked and disapproving i am sorry krispos repeated i shouldnt have lashed out at you none of this is your fault very well barsymes said stiffly krispos kept apologizing until he saw the chamberlain truly relent barsymes awkwardly patted him on the shoulder and suggested perhaps you should take a cup of wine to help ease the shock to your spirit when haloga and eunuch gave the same advice krispos thought it had to be good he drank one cup quickly a second more slowly then started to pour a third he stopped he had intended to drink to forget but remembering suddenly seemed the better choice he corked the jar and put it back on the shelf outside shadows were getting longer the wine mounted from krispos stomach to his head he yawned if im not going to attend their majesties i may as well sleep he thought phos willing all this will seem farther away when i wake up he walked to his chamber the wine and the muggy summer heat of videssos the city left him covered with sweat too warm to sleep in clothes he decided he pulled his robe off over his head though it did its best to stick to him he still wore the chain that held the chalcedony amulet trokoundos had given him and his lucky goldpiece he took off the chain held the goldpiece in his hand and looked at it a long time the past couple of years hed thought little of what the coin might mean in spite of beingperhaps because of beingso close to the imperial power he hadnt contemplated taking it for himself yet if anthimos knew no rule save caprice what then had the emperor done his job as he should evdokia domokos and their children would be fine today fury filled krispos againhad anthimos only paid attention to him all would have been well but the avtokrator not only refused to rule he refused to let anyone do it for him that courted disaster and had brought it to krispos family and so the coin krispos wished he knew what message was locked inside it along with the gold he did know he was no assassin if the only way he could take the throne was by murdering anthimos he thought anthimos would stay avtokrator till he died of old age to say nothing of the fact that the halogai would chop to dogmeat anyone who assailed the emperor the pragmatic side of his mind added staring at the goldpiece told him nothing he put the chain back around his neck and flopped heavily onto the soft bed that had once been skombros after a while he slept the silver bell woke him the next morning he did not think much about it it was part of his routine he dressed put on sandals and went into the imperial bedchamber only when he saw anthimos smiling from the bed he shared with dara did memories of the day before come crashing back krispos had to turn away for a moment to make sure his features would be composed when he turned back to the emperor your majesty he said voice expressionless dara spoke before her husband i was saddened last night to hear of your loss krispos he could tell her sympathy was real and warmed a little to it bowing he said thank you your majesty youre gracious to think of me they had played the game of passing messages back and forth under anthimos nose before she nodded very slightly to show she understood the emperor nodded too im sorry also krispos most unfortunate a pity you didnt have yourbrotherinlaw was itcome south to the city before the raiders struck i tried to get him to come your majesty he didnt wish to after two polite quiet sentences krispos found his voice rising toward a shout its an even bigger pity you didnt see fit to guard the frontier properly then he could have lived his life as he wanted to without having to fear raiders out of the north anthimos eyebrows shot up see here sirrah dont take that tone with me by the good god its about time someone did krispos yelled he didnt remember losing his temper but it was lost sure enough lost past finding about time someone took a boot to your backside too for always putting your prick and your belly ahead of your empire you be still this instant anthimos shouted loud as krispos careless of his nakedness the avtokrator sprang out of bed and went nose to nose with his vestiarios he shook a finger in krispos face shut up i tell you youre not man enough to make me krispos said breathing heavily for a copper id break you over my knee go ahead anthimos said touch me just once touch the emperor well see how long the torturers can keep you alive after you do weeks id wager krispos spat between anthimos feet as if in rejection of skotos you shield yourself behind your office whenever you choose to why dont you use it anthimos went white remember petronas he said in a ghastly whisper by the good god you may end up envying him if you dont curb your tongue i remember petronas well enough krispos shot back i daresay the empire would have been better off if hed managed to cast you down from your throne he the avtokrators hands writhed in furious passes suddenly krispos found he could not speak he had no voice nor would his lips form words are you quite through anthimos asked krispos felt that he could nod he refused to anthimos smile was as vicious as any with which petronas had ever favored krispos i suggest you admit you are finishedor do you care to find out how youd relish being without breath as well as speech krispos had no doubt the emperor meant what he said nor that he could do what he threatened he nodded is that yes you are through anthimos asked krispos nodded again the emperor moved his left hand muttering something under his breath he said your speech is restored i suggest howeverno i orderthat you do not use it in my presence now get out krispos turned to leave shaking from a mixture of rage and fright hed never felt before he hadnt thought he could ever grow truly angry at anthimos the emperors good nature had always left him proof against fullblown fury but even less had he imagined anthimos as a figure of fear a figure of fun certainly but never fear not till now the emperor had never shown hed learned enough wizardry to be frightening till now at the door krispos almost bumped into a knot of eunuchs and maidservants who had gathered to listen wideeyed to his shouting match with anthimos they scattered before him as if he had something catching so he did he thought the avtokrators disfavor was a disease that could kill he stamped back to his chamber and slammed the door behind him he hit the wall a good solid whack hard enough to send pain shooting up his arm then he used his restored voice to shout several very rude words he was not sure whether he cursed the emperor or his own foolish rashness either or both he decided he did no good either way that coldblooded realization finally ended his fit of temper he sat down at the edge of his bed and put his head in his hands if he did not mean to strike at the avtokrator he should have kept his mouth shut and he did not see how he could strike not if he hoped to live afterward stupid he said he meant it for a viler curse than any hed used before having been stupid he had nothing left but to make the best of his stupidity he came out of his room a few minutes later and went about his businesshis business that did not directly concern anthimosas normally as he could the rest of the servitors spoke to him in hushed voices but they spoke to him if he heard the whispers that followed him through the imperial residence he could pretend he did not for all his outward show of calm he jumped when early that afternoon longinos said his majesty wants to see you hes in the bedchamber after a moment to gather himself he nodded to the eunuch and walked slowly down the corridor he could feel longinos eyes on his back he wondered who all waited in the imperial bedchamber in his minds eye he saw a masked grinning torturer dressed in crimson learner so as not to show the stains of his trade he had to will his finger first to touch and then to work the latch hed gladly opened so many times late at night eyes on the floor he went in going against the kubratoi spear in hand had been easierhed thought that would be grand and glorious till the fighting started anthimos was alone krispos saw only the one pair of red boots he took his courage in both hands and looked at the avtokrators face indignation ousted fright anthimos was smiling at him as cheerfully as if nothing had happened in the morning your majesty he said much more than the simple question in his voice hello krispos the emperor said i was just wondering have the silk weavers delivered the new robe theyve been promising for so long if its here at last id like to show it off at the revel tonight as a matter of fact your majesty it got here a couple of hours ago krispos said almost giddy with relief he went to the closet got out the robe and held it in front of himself so the emperor could see it oh yes thats very fine anthimos came up to run his fingers over the smooth glistening fabric he sighed all the poets claim women have skin soft as silk if only they truly felt like this after a moment he went on i will wear this tonight krispos make sure its ready for me certainly your majesty krispos hung up the robe nodding anthimos started to leave your majesty krispos called after him the avtokrator stopped what is it is that all krispos blurted anthimos eyes widened either from guilelessness or an all but perfect simulation of it of course thats all dear fellow what else could there possible be nothing nothing at all krispos said quickly hed known the emperors temper was mercurial but hed never expected it to cool so quickly if it had he was not about to risk rekindling it nodding again anthimos bustled out krispos followed shaking his head so much luck seemed too good to be true xiii youre not missing a head or any other vital appendage i see mavros said waving to krispos as he climbed the steps to the imperial residence from all the gossip ive heard the last couple of days thats phos own special miracle and miracles my friend deserve to be celebrated he held up a large jar of wine the haloga guards at the top of the stairs laughed so did krispos you couldnt have timed it better mavros his majesty just took off for a carouse which means we should have the rest of the night to ourselves if you find a few cups krispos we can share some of this with the guardsmen here mavros said if his majestys not here to guard surely their bold captain cant object to their having a taste krispos looked questioningly the other halogai longingly toward the officer a middleaged warrior named thvari he stroked his strawyellow beard as he considered vun cup vill do no harm he said at last his northern accent thick and slow the guards cheered krispos hurried to get cups while mavros drew a dagger sliced through the pitch that glued the wine jars cork in place then stabbed the cork and drew it out once in krispos chamber mavros poured hefty dollops for himself and krispos he lifted his silver goblet in salute to krispos for being intact he declared thats a toast ill gladly drink krispos sipped at the wine its vintage was as fine as any anthimos owned when mavros bought he did not stint his robe was darkgreen wool soft as duckdown his neckcloth transparent silk dyed just the right shade of orange to complement the robe now he raised a quizzical eyebrow and heres the really interesting question why are you still intact after calling anthimos everything from a murderous cannibal to someone who commits unnatural acts with pigs i never called him that krispos said blinking he knew what rumor could do with words but listening to it have its way with his words was doubly unnerving he drank more wine never called him which mavros asked with a wicked grin oh keep still krispos emptied his cup and put it down on the arm of his chair he stared at it for a few seconds then said truth is may the ice take me if i know why anthimos hasnt come down on me i just thank phos he hasnt maybe down deep he really is just a goodnatured soul maybe mavros did not sound as though he believed it more likely he was still so drunk in the morning that hed forgotten by afternoon id like to think so but he wasnt krispos said he wasnt drunk at all i can tell aye youve seen him drunk often enough havent you mavros said who me krispos laughed yes a time or twelve now that you mention it i remember the time he he stopped in surprise the little silver bell by his bed was ringing the scarlet cord on which it hung jerked up and down whoever was pulling it was pulling hard mavros eyed the bell curiously i thought you said his majesty was gone he is krispos frowned had anthimos come back for some reason no he would have heard the emperor go by he did not think dara was summoning him hed let her know he had a friend coming by tonight surely shed not be so indiscreet but that leftno one krispos got up excuse me i think id better find out whats going on mavros smile was sly more of this good wine for me then snorting krispos hurried into the imperial bedchamber it was dara who waited for him there fright filled her face by the good god whats wrong krispos demanded have we been discovered worse dara said he stared at herhe could not imagine anything worse she started to explain when anthimos left tonight he didnt go carousing how is that worse he broke in id think youd be glad will you listen to me she said fiercely he didnt go carousing because he went to that little sanctum of his that used to be a shrine hes going to work magic there magic to kill you thats crazy if he wants me dead all he has to do is tell one of the halogai to swing his axe krispos said but he realized it wasnt crazy not to anthimos where was the fun in a simple execution the emperor would enjoy putting krispos to death by sorcery ever so much more something else struck him why are you telling me this what do you mean why so you can stop him of course dara needed a moment to see that the question went deeper she took a deep breath looked away from krispos let it out and looked back why because she stopped again visibly willed herself to continue because if i am to be empress of videssos i would sooner be your empress than his his eyes met hers those words he knew were irrevocable she nodded her resolve firming as she saw he understood strange he said i always thought you preferred him if youre that big a fool maybe ive picked the wrong man after all dara slipped into his arms for a brief embrace drawing back she said no time for more not now when you return she let the words hang it was his turn to nod when he came back they would need each other she him to keep what she already had he her to add legitimacy to what hed gained when he came back what will you do if anthimos walks into this chamber instead of me go on as best i can she said at once he grimaced nodding again tanilis would have said the same thing for the same reason ambition bound the two of them as much as affection she went on but i will pray to phos that it be you go now and may the lord with the great and good mind go with you ill get my sword krispos said dara bit her lipthat brought home what she was setting in motion but she did not say no too late for that he thought she made a little pushing gesture urging him out of the room he hurried away as he trotted the few steps back to his own chamber he felt his lucky goldpiece bounce on its chain soon enough he thought hed find out whether the coin held true prophecy or only delusion he remembered the last time hed really looked at the goldpiece and remembered thinking he would never try to get rid of anthimos but if the avtokrator was trying to get rid of him waiting quietly to be killed was for sheep not men all that ran through his head before he got to his own doorway mavros raised his cup in salute when he came in then stared when instead of sitting down he started buckling on his sword belt what in the world mavros began treason krispos answered which shut his foster brothers mouth with a snap or itll be treason if i fail anthimos is planning to kill me by sorcery tonight i dont intend to let him are you with me or will you denounce me to the halogai mavros gaped at him im with you of course but by the good god how did you find out you told me he was going carousing tonight not magicking the empress warned me just now krispos said in a flat voice did she mavros looked at krispos as if hed never seen him before then started to laugh you havent told me everything youve been up to have you krispos felt his cheeks grow hot no i never told anyone its not the sort of secret to spread around you know not if not if you want to live to go on keeping it mavros finished for him no youre right come on then krispos said weve no time to lose the halogai guarding the doorway to the imperial residence chuckled when krispos came out wearing his sword you drink a little wine you go into the city looking for someting to fight eh one of them said you should have been born a northern man krispos chuckled too but his heart sank within him as soon as he and mavros were far enough away from the entrance for the guards not to hear he said we have gone looking for something to fight how many halogai will the emperor have with him the night was dark he could not see mavros expression change but he heard his breath catch if its more than one were in trouble armored swinging those axes of theirs i know krispos shook his head but continued im going on anyway maybe i can talk my way past em however many there are im his majestys vestiarios after all and if i cant id sooner die fighting than whichever nasty way anthimos has worked out for me if you dont want to come along the good god knows i cant blame you i am your brother mavros said stiffening with offended dignity krispos clasped his shoulder you are indeed they hurried on making and discarding plans before long the gloomy grove of cypresses surrounding the emperors sanctum loomed before them the path wound through it the dark trees spicy odor filled krispos nostrils as they were about to emerge from the cypresses a redorange flash of light bright as lightning burst from the windows and open doorways of the building ahead krispos staggered sure his moment was here his eyes long used to blackness filled with tears how bitter he thought to have come just too late but nothing further happened not right then he heard anthimos voice begin a new chant whatever magic the avtokrator was devising hed not yet finished it beside krispos mavros also rubbed his eyes in that moment of fire though hed seen something krispos had missed only the one guard he murmured squinting wary against a new levinbolt krispos peered toward anthimos house of magics sure enough lit by the glow of a couple of ordinary torches a single haloga stood in front of the door the northerner was rubbing at his eyes too but came to alertness when he heard footfalls on the path who calls he said swinging up his axe hello geirrod krispos did his best to sound casual in spite of the nervous sweat trickling down the small of his back if anthimos had told the guard why he was incanting here tonight but he had not geirrod lowered his brightbladed weapon a good evening to you krispos and to your friend then the haloga frowned and half raised the axe again why do you come here with brand belted to your body even when he used videssian his speech carried the slow strong rhythms of his cold and distant homeland ive come to deliver a message to his majesty krispos answered as for why im wearing my sword well only a fool goes out at night without one he unbuckled the belt and held it out to geirrod here keep it if you feel the need and give it back when i come out the big blond guard smiled that is well done friend krispos you know what duty means i shall set your sword aside against your return as he turned to lean the blade against the wall mavros sprang forward sheathed dagger reversed in his hand the round lead pommel thudded against the side of geirrods head just in front of his ear the haloga groaned and toppled his mail shirt clinking musically as he fell krispos fingers dug into the side of geirrods thick neck he has a pulse good he said grabbing the sword belt and drawing his blade if he survived the night the halogai would be his guards slaying one of them would mean he could never trust his own protectors not with the northern penchant for blood vengeance come on mavros said he snatched up the halogas axe no wait tie and gag him first krispos said mavros dropped the axe took off his scarf and tore it in half he quickly tied the guardsmans hands behind him knotting the other piece of silk over his mouth and around his head krispos nodded together he and mavros stepped over geirrod into the avtokrators sorcerous secretum the scuffle with the guard had been neither loud nor long with luck anthimos would have been caught up in the intricacies of some elaborate spell and would never have noticed the small disturbance outside with luck as it was he poked his head out into the hallway and called what was that geirrod when he saw krispos his eyes widened and his lips skinned back from his teeth you aye your majesty krispos said me he dashed toward the emperor fast as he was he was not fast enough anthimos ducked back into his chamber and slammed the door the bar crashed into place just as krispos shoulder smote the door the bar was stout he bounced away laughing a wild highpitched laugh anthimos shouted dont you know its rude to come to the feast before youre invited then he began to chant again a chant that even through thick wood raised prickles of dread along krispos arms he kicked the door hard as he could it held mavros shoved him aside i have the tool for the job he said geirrods axe bit into the timbers mavros struck again and again as he hewed at the door the avtokrator chanted on in a mad race to see who would finish firstand live mavros weakened the door enough so he and krispos could kick it open at the same instant anthimos cried out in triumph as his foes burst in on him he extended his hands toward them fire flowed from his fingertips had anthimos controlled a true thunderbolt he would have incinerated krispos and mavros but while his fire flowed it did not dart they scrambled backward out of the chamber before the flames reached them the fire splashed against the far wall and dripped to the floor the wall was stone it did not catch but krispos gagged on acrid smoke not so eager to come in and play any more my dears anthimos said laughing again ill come out and play with you then he stood in the doorway and shot fire at krispos krispos threw himself flat on the floor the flames passed over him close enough that he smelled his hair scorch he waited for anthimos to lower his hands and burn him to a cinder anthimos never got the chance while his attention and his fire were aimed at krispos mavros rushed him with the haloga war axe anthimos whirled casting flames close enough to mavros to spoil his stroke but the emperor had to duck back into his chamber some of his fire caught on the ruined door it began to burn real honest flames licked up toward the beams of the ceiling krispos scrambled to his feet we have him he shouted he cant fight both of us at once out here and trapped in there hell burn already the smoke had grown thicker you think you have me anthimos said all this fribbling fire is but a distraction now to get back to the conjuration i truly had in mind for you krispos the one you so rudely interrupted and when i finish youll wish youd burned to death you and your friend both the avtokrator began to incant again krispos started through the burning doorway at him hoping he could not use his flames while busy with this other more fearful magic but once summoned the fire was at anthimos command a blast of it forced krispos back mavros tried too and was similarly repulsed anthimos chanted on krispos knew nothing of magic but he could sense the magnitude of the forces anthimos employed the very air felt thin and thrummed with power icy fear ran through krispos veins for he knew that power would close on him he could not attack the emperor flight he was sure would do no good he stood and waited coughing more and more as the smoke got worse anthimos was coughing too and fairly gabbling his spell in his haste to get it all out before the fire sealed his escape as krispos had said maybe that haste caused him to make his mistake maybe being at bottom a headstrong young man who took few pains he would have made it anyhow he knew hed erredhis chant abruptly broke off dread and horror in his voice he shouted him not me i didnt mean to say me i meant him too late the power he had summoned did what he had told it to do and to whom he screamed once peering through smoky heathazed air krispos saw him writhe as if trapped in the grip of an invisible fist of monstrous size the scream cut off the sound of snapping bones went on and on an uprush of flame blocked krispos view for a moment when he could see again anthimos or what was left of him lay crumpled and unmoving on the floor mavros pounded krispos shoulder lets get out of here he yelled were just as dead if we toast as ifthat happens to us are we i wonder anthimos was the most definitively dead man krispos had ever seen the last sight of the fallen emperor stayed with him as eyes streaming and lungs burning from the smoke he stumbled with mavros toward the doorway cool clean night air after that inferno was like cool water after an endless trek through the desert krispos sucked in breath after precious breath then he knelt beside geirrod who was just beginning to groan and stir lets drag him away from here he said and listened to the roughness in his own voice we dont want him to burn either something else first slowly and deliberately mavros went to his knees before krispos then flat on his belly majesty he declared let me be the first to salute you thou conquerest krispos avtokrator of the videssians krispos gaped at him in the desperate struggle with anthimos hed forgotten the prize for which hed been struggling he spoke his first words as emperor get up fool geirrods pale eyes were wide and staring flicking back and forth from one man to the other mavros rose but only to a crouch by the haloga do you understand what has happened this night geirrod anthimos sought to slay krispos by sorcery but blundered and destroyed himself instead by the lord with the great and good mind i swear neither krispos nor i wounded him his death was phos own judgment on him my friendmy brotherspeaks truly krispos said he drew the suncircle over his heart by the good god i swear it believe me or not geirrod as you see fit from what you know of me but if you believe me let me ask you in turn will you serve me as bravely and loyally as you served anthimos those eyes of northern blue might have been a hunting beasts rather than a mans such was the intensity of the gaze geirrod aimed up at krispos then the guardsman nodded once free him mavros krispos said mavros cut through the halogas bonds then through the gag geirrod heaved himself upright and started to stagger away from the burning building behind him wait krispos told him then turned to mavros give him his axe what no mavros exclaimed even half out on his feet the way he is with this thing hes more than a match for both of us hes said he will serve me give him the axe part of that tone of command was borrowed from petronas more krispos realized came from anthimos wherever it came from it served its purpose mavros eyes were eloquent but he passed the axe to geirrod the haloga took it looking at it as a father might look at a longlost son who has come home krispos tensed if he was wrong and mavros right he would have the shortest reign of any avtokrator videssos had ever known geirrod raised the axein salute lead me majesty he said where now krispos watched mavros hand leave the hilt of his dagger the little blade would not have kept him or krispos alive an extra moment against an armed and armored geirrod but the protective gesture made krispos proud once more to have him for foster brother where now the guardsman repeated to the imperial residence krispos answered after quick thought you geirrod tell your comrades what happened here i will also speak to them and to the folk inside what do you want to do about this place here mavros asked pointing back at anthimos sanctum as he did part of the roof fell in with a crash let it burn krispos said if anyone sees it or gets close enough to hear noise like that i suppose hell try and put it out not that hell have much luck but the grove is so thick that odds are no one will notice a thing and we certainly dont have time to mess about here or do you feel otherwise mavros shook his head no indeed well be plenty busy between now and dawn aye as he walked back toward the imperial residence krispos tried to think of all the things hed have to do before the sun came up again if he forgot anything of any importance he knew he would not keep the throne hed claimed the halogai standing guard in front of the imperial residence grew alert when they saw three men approaching when krispos and his companions got close enough for torchlight to reveal the state they were in one of the northerners shouted what happened to you krispos looked down at himself his robe was torn and scorched and stained with smoke he glanced over at mavros whose face was streaked from soot and sweat his own he was sure could be no cleaner the avtokrator is dead he said simply the halogai cried out and came dashing down the stairs their huge axes at the ready did you slay him one of them demanded his voice fierce no by phos i did not krispos said as he had for geirrod he sketched the sunsign over his breast you know he and i had a falling out these past few days he waited for the northerners to nod then went on this evening i learned never mind where now he thought i learned hed not forgiven me as he wanted me to believe but was going to use the wizardry hed studied to kill me he touched the sword that swung on his hip i went to defend myself yes but i did not kill him because i was there he hurried his magic and rather than striking me it ate him up instead in the name of the lord with the great and good mind i tell you i speak the truth geirrod suddenly started talking to the northerners in their own language they listened for a moment then began asking questions and talkingsometimes shoutingamong themselves geirrod turned to krispos shifting back to videssian i tell them it be only justice now for you to be emperor since he who was emperor try to slay you but end up killing self instead i also tell them i fight for you if they say no while the halogai argued mavros sidled close to krispos and whispered well i admit you did that better than i would have krispos nodded watching the guardsand their captain sometimes he had read usurpers gained the imperial guards backing with promises of gold he did not think gold would sway thvari save only to make him feel contempt he waited for the guard captain to speak at last thvari did majesty one by one the halogai echoed him now krispos could give rewards half a pound of gold to each of you a pound to thvari and two pounds to geirrod for being first among you to acknowledge me the northerners cheered and gathered round him to clasp his hand between their two what do i get mavros asked mockplaintively you get to go to the stables saddle up progress and a horse for you and get back here fast as you can krispos told him aye thats right give me all the work mavros saidbut over his shoulder for he was already heading for the stables at a fast trot krispos climbed the steps to the imperial residencehis residence now and for as long as he could keep it he realized suddenly he could feel that he was running on nervous energy if he slowed down even for a moment he might not get moving again easily he laughed at himselfwhen would he find the chance to slow down any time soon barsymes and tyrovitzes stood waiting a couple of paces inside the entrance as with the halogai before krispos dishevelment made the eunuchs stare barsymes pointed out toward the guardsmen they called you majesty he said was that accusation in his voice krispos could not tell the chamberlain had long practice in dissimulation yes they called me majestyanthimos is dead krispos answered bluntly hoping to startle some more definite reaction from the eunuchs but for making the suncircle over their hearts they gave him none their silence compelled him to go on to explain once more how the emperor had perished when he was through barsymes nodded he seemed far from startled i did not think anthimos could destroy you so he remarked krispos started to take that as a simple compliment then stopped his eyes going wide you knew he ground out barsymes nodded again krispos drew his sword you knew and you did not warn me how shall i pay you back for that barsymes did not flinch from the naked blade perhaps while you consider you should let the empress dara know you survived i am certain she will be even more relieved to hear of it than we are again krispos started to miss something again he caught himself you knew that too he asked in a small voice this time both eunuchs nodded back he looked at his sword then returned it to its sheath how long have you known now he was whispering barsymes and tyrovitzes looked at each other no secret in the palaces is a secret long barsymes said with the slightest trace of smugness dizzily krispos shook his head and you didnt tell anthimos if we had esteemed andno forgive me i begyour majesty would you be holding this conversation with us now barsymes asked krispos shook his head again how shall i pay you back for that he said then musingly answered himself if im to be emperor ill need a vestiarios the post is yours barsymes the eunuchs long thin face was not made for showing pleasure but his smile was less doleful than most krispos had seen from him you honor me your majesty i am delighted to accept and shall seek to give satisfaction im sure you will krispos said he hurried past the two eunuchs and down the hall he passed the doorway that had been his and paused in front of the one he had entered so many times but that only now belonged to him he raised a hand to knock softly then stopped he did not knock at his own door he opened it he heard daras sharp intake of breathshe had to have been wondering who would come through that door when she saw krispos she said oh phos be praised its you and threw herself into his arms even as he held her though he thought that her words would have done for anthimos return just as wellno chance of making a mistake with them he wondered how long shed worked to come up with such a safe phrase tell me what happened she demanded he explained anthimos downfall for the fourth time that night he knew he would have to do it again before dawn the more he explained it the more the story got between him and the exertion and terror of the moment if he told the tale enough times he thought hopefully perhaps hed forget how frightened hed been this was the first time dara had heard it which made it seem as real for her as if shed been there when he was through she held him again i might have lost you she said her face buried against his shoulder i dont know what i would have done then shed been sure enough earlier in the evening he thought but decided he could not blame her for forgetting that now and her fear for him made him remember his own fear sharply once more you certainly might have he said if he hadnt tripped over his own tongue you made him do it she said he had to nod at the end anthimos had been badly rattled too or likely he never would have made his fatal blunder without you i never would have known i wouldnt have been there this time krispos hugged dara acknowledging the debt he owed the gratitude he felt she must have sensed some of that she looked up at him her eyes searched his face we need each other she said slowly very much he agreed especially now she might not have heard him as if he hadnt spoken she repeated we need each other then went on maybe as much to herself as to himwe please each other too taken together isnt that a fair start toward love krispos heard her hesitate before she risked the word he would also have hesitated to speak it between them having been lovers did not guarantee love that was another of tanilis lessons even so a fair start he said and did not feel he was lying then he added one thing more anyhow whats that dara asked i promise you wont have to worry about minnows with me she blinked then started to laugh but her voice had a grim edge to it as she warned id better not anthimos didnt have to care about what i thought whereas you she stopped he thought about what she hadnt said that he was a peasantborn usurper with no right to the throne whatever save that his fundament was on it he knew that was true if he ruled well he also knew it eventually would not matter but eventually was not now now anything that linked him to the imperial house he had just toppled would help him hold power long enough for it to seem to belong to him he could not afford to antagonize dara i said not a minute ago that you didnt need to worry about such things he reminded her so you did she sounded as if she were reminding herself too he kissed her then said with mock formality so splendid mavros might have envied it and now your majesty if you will forgive me i have a few small trifles to attend to before the night is through yes just a few she said smiling her mood matching his almost as an afterthought she added your majesty he kissed her again then hurried away the halogai outside the imperial residence swung their axes to the ready in salute as he came out a few minutes later mavros rode up leading krispos horse progress on a line heres your mount kris uh your majesty now his voice sank to a conspiratorial whisperwhat do you need the beast for to ride of course krispos said while his foster brother sputtered he turned to thvari and spoke for a couple of minutes when he was done he asked do you have that can you do it i have it if i can do it i will if i cant ill be dead so will you not much later the northerner answered with the usual bloodthirsty directness of the halogai i trust youll do your best then for both our sakes krispos said he swung himself up onto progress back and loosed the lead line now we ride he told mavros i did suspect that truly i did mavros said do you have any place in particular in mind or shall we just gallivant around the city krispos had already urged his bay gelding into a trot iakovitzes house he said over his shoulder as he rode west toward the plaza of palamas i just hope hes there the only person i can think of who likeslikedto carouse more than he does is anthimos why are we going to iakovitzes house because hes still in the habit of keeping lots of grooms krispos answered if im to be avtokrator people will have to know im avtokrator theyll have to see me crowned that will have to happen as fast as it can before anyone else gets the idea theres a throne loose for the taking the grooms can spread word through the city tonight and wake everyone up mavros said the people wont love you for that the people of this town love spectacle more than anything else krispos said they wouldnt forgive me if i didnt wake them up for it look at anthimosyou can be anything in videssos the city so long as youre not dull well maybe so mavros said i hope so by the lord with the great and good mind they reined in in front of iakovitzes house tied their horses to the rail and went up to the front door krispos pounded on it he kept pounding until iakovitzes steward gomaris opened the little grate in the middle of the door and peered through it whatever curses the steward had in mind got left unsaid when he recognized krispos he contented himself with growling by the good god krispos have you gone mad no krispos said i must see iakovitzes right now tell him that gomaris and tell him i wont take no for an answer he waited tenselyif gomaris said his master was out everything was up for grabs again but the steward just slammed the grate shut and went away he returned in a couple of minutes he says he doesnt care if its the emperor himself who wants to see him it is krispos said it is the emperor gomaris the little grate did not show much of gomaris face but he saw the stewards right eye go wide a moment later he heard the bar lift the door swung open whats happened in the palaces gomaris asked eagerly no he was more than eager he was all but panting to hear juicy news before anyone else did that to an inhabitant of the city was treasure more precious than gold youll know when iakovitzes does krispos promised and now hadnt you better run ahead and tell him you let mavros and me in after all aye youre right worse luck the steward said his voice suddenly glum he hurried off toward his masters bedchamber krispos and mavros who still knew their way around the house where they had once served followed more slowly iakovitzes met them before they got to his bedroom the fiery little noble was just knotting the sash of his dressing gown when he came up to his former proteges he stabbed out a finger at krispos whats this nonsense about the emperor wanting to see me i dont see any emperor all i see is you and i wish i didnt excellent sir you do see the emperor krispos answered he touched his own chest iakovitzes snorted what have you been drinking go on home now and if phos is merciful ill fall back to sleep forget all about this and never have to tell anthimos it doesnt matter krispos said anthimos is dead iakovitzes as gomaris had just before iakovitzes eyes went wide hold that torch closer to him gomaris he told his steward gomaris obeyed in the better light iakovitzes examined krispos closely youre not joking he said at last no im not almost by rote krispos told the story he had already told four times that night he finished thats why ive come to you excellent sir to have your grooms and servants spread word through the city that something extraordinary has happened and that people should gather at the high temple to learn what to his surprise and indignation iakovitzes started to laugh the noble said your pardon your majesty but when you first came here i never thought i had a future avtokrator shoveling out my horseshit not many can say that by phos oh no indeed he laughed again louder than before youll help then krispos said iakovitzes slowly sobered aye krispos ill help you better you with the crown than some dunderheaded general which is the other choice wed likely have thanks i suppose krispos saidiakovitzes never gave praise without splashing vinegar on it youre welcome im sure the noble said he sighed and to think that with a little luck i could have had an avtokrator in my bed as well as in my stables iakovitzes turned a look that was half glower half leer on mavros why didnt you overthrow the emperor me no thank you mavros said i wouldnt take the job on a bet i want to go through life without food tastersand without using up a few of them along the way hrmmp iakovitzes gave his attention back to krispos youll have plenty to keep you occupied tonight wont you i suppose youll want me to go and wake up everyone in the household i may as well now that youve ruined my hope for a decent nights sleep why should i let anyone else have one youre as generous and considerate as i remember you krispos said just to see him glare by the good god i promise you wont be sorry for this if both our heads go up on the milestone ill make sure mine reminds yours of that iakovitzes said now get moving will you the faster this is done the better the chance we all have of avoiding the chap with the cleaver since krispos had come to the same conclusion he nodded clasped iakovitzes hand and hurried away he and mavros were just climbing onto their horses when iakovitzes started making a horrible racket inside the house mavros grinned he doesnt do things by halves does he he never did krispos said im only glad hes with us and not against us gnatios wont be so easy youll persuade him mavros said confidently one way or another i have to krispos said as they rode through the dark quiet streets of the city only a few people shared the night with them a couple of courtesans beckoned as they trotted by a couple of footpads slunk out of their way a couple of staggering drunks ignored them altogether once off in the distance krispos saw for a moment the clump of torches that proclaimed respectable citizens traveling by night he rounded a corner and they were gone more torches blazed in front of the patriarchal mansion krispos and mavros tied their horses to a couple of the evergreens that grew there and walked up to the entrance i am heartily tired of rapping on doors krispos said rapping on the door mavros consoled him after this you can have servants rap on them for you the rapping eventually had its resultthe priest badourios opened the door a crack and demanded who dares disturb the ecumenical patriarchs rest then he recognized krispos and grew more civil i hope it is not a matter of urgency esteemed and eminent sir would i be here if it werent krispos retorted i must see the patriarch at once holy sir may i tell him your business badourios asked mavros snapped were it for you be assured we would consult you it is for your master as krispos told you now go and fetch him badourios glared sleepy murder at him then abruptly turned on his heel and hurried away gnatios appeared a few minutes later even freshroused from sleep he looked clever and elegant if none too happy krispos and mavros bowed as gnatios responded with a bow of his own krispos saw him take in their dirty faces and torn robes but his voice was smooth as ever as he asked what has so distressed his majesty that he must have a response in the middle of the night let us speak privately not in this doorway krispos said the patriarch considered then shrugged as you wish he led them to a small chamber lit a couple of lamps then closed and barred the door folding his arms across his chest he said very well let me ask you once more if i may esteemed and eminent sir what theological concern has anthimos so vexed he must needs rout me out of bed for his answer most holy sir you know as well as i that anthimos never worried much about theology krispos said now he doesnt worry about it at all or rather he worries in the only way that truly mattershes walking the narrow bridge between the light above and the ice below he saw gnatios eyebrows shoot up he nodded yes most holy sir anthimos is dead and you most holy sir have been addressing the avtokrator of the videssians by a title far beneath his present dignity mavros added his voice was hard but one corner of his mouth could not help twitching upward with mischief suave and urbane as he normally was the patriarch goggled at that no he whispered yes krispos said and for the halfdozenth time that night told how anthimos had perished listening to himself he discovered he did have the story down pat only a few words were different from the ones hed used with iakovitzes and dara he finished and that is why weve come to you now most holy sir to have you set the crown on my head at the high temple in the morning gnatios had regained his composure while krispos spoke now he shook his head and repeated no this time loudly and firmly no i will not crown a jumpedup stableboy like you no matter what has befallen his majesty if you speak the truth and he has died others are far more deserving of imperial rank by which you mean petronasyour cousin petronas krispos said let me remind you most holy sir that petronas now wears the blue robe vows coerced from a man have been set aside before gnatios said he would make a better avtokrator than you as you must admit i admit nothing of the sort krispos growled and youre mad if you think id give over the throne to a man whose first act upon it would be to take my head youre mad if you think ill crown you gnatios retorted if you dont pyrrhos will krispos said that ploy had worked before with gnatios but it failed now the ecumenical patriarch drew himself up pyrrhos is but an abbot for a coronation to have validity it must be at my hands the patriarchs hands and they shall not grant it to you just then badourios knocked urgently on the door without waiting for a reply the priest tried the latch when he found the door barred he called through it most holy sir theres an unseemly disturbance building in the street outside whats happening in the street outside does not concern me gnatios said angrily now go away krispos and mavros looked at each other maybe whats happening in the street does concern you most holy sir krispos said his voice silky shall we go and see the lines on gnatios forehead and those running down from beside his nose to the outer ends of his mouth deepened in suspicion as you wish he said reluctantly krispos heard the deepvoiced shouting as soon as he was out of the chamber he looked at mavros again they both smiled gnatios scowled at each of them in turn when the three men got to the front entrance the shouting abruptly stopped gnatios stared out in dismay at the whole regiment of imperial guards hundreds of armed and armored halogai drawn up in line of battle before the patriarchal mansion he turned to krispos nervously wetting his lips you would not ah loose the barbarians here on ah holy ground how could you think such a thing most holy sir krispos sounded shocked he made sure he sounded shocked we were just having a nice peaceable talk in there werent we before gnatios could answer one of the halogai detached himself from their ranks and strode toward the mansion as the warrior drew closer krispos saw it was thvari gnatios stood his ground but still seemed to shrink from the northerner who along with his mail shirt and axe also bore a large round bronzefaced shield thvari swung up his axe in salute to krispos majesty he said soberly his gaze swung to gnatios he must not have liked what he saw on the patriarchs face for his already wintry eyes grew colder yet the axe twitched in his hands as if with a life of its own gnatios voice went high call him off me he said to krispos the axe twitched again a bigger movement this time krispos said nothing gnatios watched the axe blade with fearful fascination he jumped when it moved again please call him off me he said shrilly a moment later perhaps realizing what was wrong he added your majesty that will be all thvari thank you krispos said the haloga nodded turned and stalked back to his countrymen there gnatios said to krispos though his eyes stayed on thvari till the northerner was back into the ranks of the guardsmen ive publicly acknowledged you are you satisfied you havent yet honored his majesty with a proskynesis mavros observed gnatios looked daggers at him and opened his mouth to say something defiant then he glanced over to the halogai massed in the street krispos watched the defiance drain out of him slowly he went to his knees then to his belly majesty he said as his forehead touched the floor get up most holy sir krispos said so you agree i am the rightful avtokrator then he waited for gnatios to nod before he went on then can you show that to the whole city by setting the crown on my head at the high temple when morning comes i would seem to have little choice gnatios said bleakly if im to be master of the empire i will be master of all of it krispos told him that includes the temples the ecumenical patriarch did not reply in words but his expression was eloquent though emperors traditionally headed ecclesiastical as well as secular affairs anthimos had ignored both impartially letting gnatios run videssos religious life like an independent prince the prospect of doing another mans bidding could not have appealed to him mavros pointed down the street at the same time haloga heads turned in the direction his finger showed a man carrying a large heavy bundle was coming toward the patriarchal mansion no not a manas the person drew nearer krispos saw beardless cheeks and chin but it was not a woman either barsymes krispos exclaimed what do you have there panting a little the eunuch set down his burden if you are to be crowned your majesty you should appear before the people in the proper regalia i heard your orders to the halogai and so i knew i could find you here ive brought the coronation regalia a crown and a pair of red boots i do hope the rude treatment ive given the silks hasnt wrinkled them too much he finished anxiously never mind krispos said touched that you thought to bring them to me is all that counts he put a hand on barsymes shoulder the eunuch a formal soul if ever there was one shrugged it off and bowed krispos went on it was bravely done and perhaps foolishly done as well how would you have fought back if robbers fell upon you and stole this rich clothing robbers barsymes gave a contemptuous sniff a robber would have to be insane to dare assault one like me who is so obviously a eunuch of the palace for the first time krispos heard a sort of melancholy pride in barsymes description of himself the eunuch continued besides even a madman would think three times before he stole the imperial raiment who could wear it but the emperor when even its possession by another is proof of treason and a capital crime im just glad you got here safely krispos said if thinking himself immune from robbers had helped barsymes come he would not contradict the eunuch privately he suspected barsymes had been more lucky than secure shall i vest you in the regalia now barsymes asked krispos thought for a moment then shook his head no lets do it at the high temple where the ecumenical patriarch will set the crown on my head he glanced over at gnatios who nodded without speaking krispos looked eastward ever so slightly the horizon was beginning to gray he said we should go there now to be ready when the new day comes he called to the halogai they formed up in a hollow rectangle that took the whole width of the street krispos mavros barsymes and gnatios took their places in the middle krispos thought gnatios still wanted to bolt but the patriarch got no chance forward to the high temple krispos said and forward they went the temple as was only fitting lay but a few steps from the patriarchal mansion it bulked huge against the brightening sky the thick piers that supported the weight of its great central dome gave it a squat almost an ungainly appearance from the outside but withinkrispos knew the splendor that lay within the forecourt to the high temple was as large as a couple of the smaller plazas in the city the boots of the halogai slammed down on slate flags their measured tramp echoed from the building they approached gnatios peered out between the marching guardsmen what are all these people doing loitering in the forecourt so long before the dawn he said a coronation must be witnessed krispos reminded him the patriarch gave him a look filled with grudging respect for an adventurer who has just seized the state youve planned well you will prove more difficult to dislodge than i would have guessed when you came pounding on my door i dont intend to be dislodged krispos said neither did anthimos your majesty gnatios replied putting a sardonic edge to the title krispos was still far from used to the forecourt was not yet truly crowded the halogai had no trouble making their way toward the high temple men and women scurried out of their path chattering excitedly look at em something big must be going oni wanted to kill the bloody sod who woke me but now im glad im here wouldnt want to miss anything what do you thinks happened one enterprising fellow had a tray with him sausage and rolls he shouted his eyes like those of most who lived in videssos the city on the main chance buy your sausage and rolls here priests prayed in the high temple by night as well as by day they stared from the top of the stairway at the imperial guards krispos heard them exclaim and call to one another they sounded as curious as any of the onlookers gathering in front of the temple but when the halogai began to climb the low broad stairs the priests cried out in alarm and withdrew inside slamming doors behind them under their officers direction most of the northerners deployed on the stairway facing out toward the forecourt a band that included thvaris warriors accompanied krispos and his videssian comrades up to the high temple itself krispos looked from the closed doors before them to gnatios i hope youll be able to do something about this gnatios nodded he knocked on the door and called sharply open in there open i say your patriarch commands it a grill slid open phos preserve us said the priest peering out it is the patriarch a moment later the doors were flung wide krispos had to step back smartly to keep from being hit ignoring him the clerics hurled questions at gnatios whats toward most holy sirwhat are all the halogai doing here wheres the emperor if all his guards have come whats toward change gnatios answered raising an eyebrow at krispos i would say that response covers the rest of your queries as well barsymes spoke up holy sirs will your kindness permit us to enter the narthex so his majesty may assume the imperial vestments i shall also require a vial of the scented oil used in anointings gnatios added krispos saw the priests faces go momentarily slack with surprise then heard their voices rise as they murmured among themselves they were city men they did not need to hear more to know what was in the wind without waiting for their leave krispos strode into the high temple he felt the clerics eyes on him as they gave way before his confidence but he did not look toward them instead he told barsymes aye this place will do well enough for robing help me if you please of course your majesty the eunuch turned to the priests could i trouble one of you holy sirs for a damp cloth wherewith to wipe clean his majestys face not one but four clerics hurried away ill want to clean off after you do krisyour majesty mavros said the good god knows i must be as sooty as you are the cloth arrived in moments with exquisite delicacy barsymes dabbed and rubbed at krispos cheeks nose and forehead when at last he was satisfied he handed the clothnow grayish rather than whiteto mavros while mavros ran it over his own face barsymes began to clothe krispos in the imperial regalia for the first time the garb for the coronation was of antique style so antique that it was no longer worn at any other time with barsymes help krispos donned blue leggings and a goldbelted blue kilt edged in white his plain sword went into the bejeweled scabbard that hung from the belt his tunic was scarlet with gold threads worked through it barsymes set a white wool cape on his shoulders and fumbled to work the golden fibula that closed it at his throat and now the eunuch said the red boots they were a tight squeeze krispos feet were larger than anthimos they also had higher heels than krispos was used to he stumped around uncertainly inside the narthex barsymes took from his bag a simple golden circlet then a more formal crown a golden dome set with rubies sapphires and glistening pearls he set both of them aside for the moment krispos remained bareheaded mavros went to the doors to look out a lot of people there he said iakovitzes lads did their job well the noise of the crowd which the closed doors had kept down to a sound like that of the distant sea suddenly swelled in krispos ears is it sunrise he asked mavros looked out again near enough its certainly light krispos glanced from him to barsymes to gnatios then lets begin mavros opened the doors once more this time throwing them wide the boom they made as they slammed back against the wall drew the eyes of the crowd to him he stood in the doorway for a moment then cried out as loud as he could people of videssos phos himself has made this day on this day the good god has given our city and our empire a new avtokrator the hum from the crowd dropped as people quieted to hear what mavros said then redoubled when they took in the import of his words he held up his hands and waited quiet slowly came into it mavros said the avtokrator anthimos is dead laid low by his own sorceries people of videssos behold the avtokrator krispos barsymes touched krispos on the arm but he was already moving forward to stand in the open doorway as mavros stepped aside below him on the steps the halogai raised their axes in saluteand in warning to any who would oppose him krispos they shouted all together their voices deep and fierce krispos yelled the crowd save for the inevitable few who heard his name wrong and yelled priskos instead thou conquerest krisposthe ageold videssian shout of acclamation many years to the avtokrator krispos thou conquerest krispos krispos remembered the heady feeling hed had years before when the nobles who filled the hall of the nineteen couches all cried out his name after he vanquished beshev the thickshouldered wrestler from kubrat now he knew that feeling again but magnified a hundredfold for this was not a hallful of people but rather a plazaful buoyed up on that great tide of acclamation he forgot fatigue the people proclaim you emperor krispos mavros cried the acclaim got louder shouts of thou conquerest krispos came thick and fast one burden of worry gone krispos thought had the crowd not accepted him he would never have lasted as avtokrator no matter what other backing he had it would have evaporated in the face of popular contempt the chronicles told of a wouldbe emperor named rhazates whom the mob had laughed off the steps of the high temple for no better reason than that he was grossly fat a rival ousted him within days thvari held up the bronzefaced shield displaying it to the crowd the people quieted they knew what that shield was for with mavros behind him krispos walked down to where the haloga waited too quietly for the people in the forecourt to hear krispos told thvari i want you geirrod narvikka and vagn it shall be as you wish the northerner agreed geirrod stood close by neither of the other guardsmen krispos had named was far away thvari would know which soldiers he favored krispos thought at the officers gesture the two halogai set down their axes and hurried over barsymes approached handing mavros the golden circlet hed brought as thvari had the bronzefaced shield mavros showed the circlet to the crowd those at the back of the courtyard could hardly have been able to see it but they sighed all the same like the shield it had its place in the ritual of coronation the ritual went on mavros offered krispos the circlet he held out his hands palms away from his body in a gesture of refusal mavros offered the circlet again again krispos rejected it mavros paused then tried to present it to krispos once more this time krispos bowed his head in acquiescence mavros set the circle on his brow the gold was cool against his forehead krispos with this circlet i join the people in conferring on you the title of avtokrator mavros said proudly as mavros spoke as the crowd erupted in fresh cheers thvari set the bronzefaced shield flat on the stair beside him krispos stepped up onto it thvari geirrod narvikka and vagn stooped and grasped the rim of the shield at a grunted command from thvari they lifted together up went the shield to the height of their shoulders raising krispos high above them and showing the people that he enjoyed the soldiers support as well as theirs krispos all the halogai shouted once more for a moment he felt more like one of their pirate chieftains about to set forth on a plundering expedition than a staid and civilized avtokrator of the videssians the guardsmen lowered him back to the stone steps as he got off the shield he wondered if it was the one upon which anthimos had stoodand who would be exalted on it after he was gone my son phos willing one day many years from now he thought then shoved that concern far away he looked up to the top of the stone steps gnatios stood in the open doorway holding a satin cushion on which lay the imperial crown and the vial of oil he would use to anoint krispos head the patriarch nodded heart pounding krispos climbed the stairs toward him having been accepted by the people and the army he needed only ecclesiastical recognition to complete his coronation gnatios nodded again as krispos took his place beside him but instead of beginning the ceremony of anointing the patriarch looked out to the expectantly waiting crowd in the forecourt below pitching his voice to carry to the people the patriarch said perhaps our new master will honor us with a few brief words before i set the crown on his head krispos turned around to glare at gnatios who blandly looked back he heard mavros angry hissthis was no normal part of the coronation krispos knew what it was it was gnatios hoping he would play the fool in front of much of the city and blight his reign before it properly began the expanding crowd in the forecourt grew still waiting to hear what krispos would say he paused a moment to gather his thoughts for he saw he could not keep from speaking before he began though he scowled at gnatios again he would never be able to trust the patriarch not after this but when he looked out to the stillwaiting throng all thoughts of gnatios vanished from his mind people of videssos he said then once more louder people of videssos anthimos is dead i do not want to speak ill of the dead but you know as well as i that not everything in the city or in the empire ran as well as it might have while he was emperor he hoped someone would shout out in agreement and bring a laugh from the crowd no one did people stood silent listening judging he took a deep breath and reminded himself to try to keep his rustic accent under control he was glad his years in the city had helped smooth it he plunged ahead i served anthimos i saw how he neglected the empire for the sake of his own pleasure pleasure has its place aye but the avtokrator has to look to videssos first then to himself as far as i can i will do that he paused to think again if i did everything i might possibly do i think id need to pack three days into every one his rueful tone was real as he stood there looking out at the people who were under his rule alone picturing their fellows all the way to the borders of the empire he could not imagine why anyone would want the crushing weight of responsibility that went with being avtokrator no time to worry about that now either he had the responsibility he would have to bear up under it he went on with the good gods help ill be able to do enough to help videssos i pray i can thats all as he turned back to gnatios he listened to the crowd no thunderous outpouring of applause but he hadnt expected one not after the patriarch ambushed him into coming up with a speech on the spot but no one jeered or booed or hissed hed got through it and hadnt hurt himself that was plenty gnatios realized it too he masked himself well but could not quite hide his disappointment carry on most holy sir krispos said coldly yes of course your majesty gnatios nodded bland still he raised his voice to speak to the crowd rather than the emperor bow your head for the anointing krispos obeyed the patriarch drew the stopper from the vial of scented oil and poured its contents over krispos head he spoke the ritual words as phos light shines down on us all so may his blessings pour down on you with this anointing so may it be krispos responded though as he did he wondered whether a prayer had to be sincerely meant to be effective if so phos ears were surely closed to gnatios words the patriarch rubbed the oil through krispos hair with his right hand while he completed the anointing he recited phos creed intoning we bless thee phos lord with the great and good mind by thy grace our protector watchful beforehand that the great test of life may be decided in our favor krispos echoed the prayer which since it did not mention him he supposed the patriarch truly meant the city folk gathered in the forecourt below also recited the creed their voices rose and fell like surf individual words lost but the prayers rhythm unmistakable and then at last gnatios took the imperial crown in both hands and set it on krispos lowered head it was heavy literally as well as for what it meant a sigh ran through the crowd a new avtokrator ruled videssos after a moment the noise began to build again to a crest of acclamation thou conquerest krispos many years krispos hurrah for the emperor krispos krispos krispos he straightened suddenly the crown seemed to weigh nothing at all
